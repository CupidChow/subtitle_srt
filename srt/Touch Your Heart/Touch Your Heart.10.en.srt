1
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,200
(Touch Your Heart)

2
00:00:41,866 --> 00:00:43,733
(Episode 10)

3
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,000
Huh? Kwon!

4
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,686
Just when I thought
you were over it,

5
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:56,853
here you are again,
waiting for me...

6
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:59,153
What, you think
I've been waiting for you?

7
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:01,666
Yes I have, in fact.
For four and a half hours!

8
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,653
Hey, you think I really would?

9
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:05,786
Why would I wait for you?

10
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,600
If you were Yoon-seo, sure.

11
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:11,533
Oh my gosh!

12
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,100
Yoon-seo...

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,633
I mean, Yun-sook.

14
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:38,353
They're an office couple!

15
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:40,186
I caught them a few times,

16
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,866
holding hands on the rooftop.

17
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,200
I see. No wonder...

18
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:50,453
Good times!
Holding hands in secret,

19
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:52,786
meeting up secretly
on the rooftop...

20
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:54,166
It must be so good.

21
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:57,453
If you're that envious of them,
why don't you try it, too?

22
00:01:57,533 --> 00:01:58,533
What...

23
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:01,400
Aren't you married?

24
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,286
It's been a while
since I saw that smile.

25
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:09,366
Yes, well...

26
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:13,720
I ought to have been taken early
with these looks,

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,100
but I'm still single, in fact.

28
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:19,186
In my thirties,
I was too busy with

29
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:21,886
defending justice on the
side of the powerless,

30
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:25,320
and in my forties,
I jumped into management

31
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,000
working around the clock,
so I'm still single...

32
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,586
I see.

33
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:34,820
But you've still got it,
so do find someone.

34
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,853
I say go for
someone in the office.

35
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:41,586
Like you said, it sounds
quite romantic and thrilling.

36
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,153
Office dating?

37
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:44,366
But with who?

38
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,733
Good morning!

39
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,720
- Ah, you're here.
- Good morning!

40
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,086
Have some waffles.
Mr. Choi bought them for us.

41
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:56,120
Ah, that's great.
I haven't had breakfast.

42
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,720
Yum! I love waffles.

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,253
Go on and sit.

44
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,333
Come on, sit.

45
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,166
But why waffles, all of a sudden?

46
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:12,153
I just suddenly remembered that

47
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,286
winter in Canada.

48
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:19,253
The snowy fields of Canada were
as cold as her heart,

49
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,920
and the only thing that
warmed me up then,

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,366
were these waffles topped with
maple syrup.

51
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:28,320
So, how is it?

52
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,800
- Good.
- Right? It's delicious.

53
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:32,266
- Right?
- Yes.

54
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:34,066
The syrup?

55
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,266
It's good.

56
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Yoon-seo.

57
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Why...

58
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:51,266
Why are you doing this?

59
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:55,253
Is there something in your eye?

60
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,220
- Yes.
- Oh, so you do!

61
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,220
There's something in your eye.

62
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,220
- Saline solution!
- There's something there.

63
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,520
- Something big!
- Saline solution!

64
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,453
I have it in my room,
I always keep some on me.

65
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,453
Do you want me to take a look?

66
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:04,733
No, it's alright.

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,153
Oh, come on!

68
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:19,320
Don't just start winking

69
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,286
when everyone is there!

70
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,153
But back in the elevator,

71
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,186
you said office dating was
romantic and full of thrills

72
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:28,153
because of all the
secret exchanges.

73
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:30,453
Oh what? Still...

74
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:33,133
If you do that
without a warning...

75
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:35,266
You just totally got me!

76
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,753
Actually, you know what?

77
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,286
We should make use of
what time we have remaining.

78
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:45,820
So we don't regret it.

79
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,033
I'll do my best to
help you in that field.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,400
Mmm, good!

81
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:58,120
Now that I think about it,

82
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,200
it's my first time
having lunch with you.

83
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,986
Yes, restaurants tend to get

84
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:05,420
crowded during lunchtime,

85
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,286
and I find that
a little uncomfortable, so...

86
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:10,200
Oh, right. I guess you want to
avoid crowded places.

87
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:13,120
I hope I wasn't forcing you to
join me today, then.

88
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,333
No, no. Closed rooms like
this one are fine.

89
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,953
The side dishes are
simple but nice today.

90
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:23,020
Let's enjoy then, everyone.

91
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,900
- They're not that bad.
- No. Enjoy yourself.

92
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,520
I moved the braised beef
toward you.

93
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,866
Since you like meat.

94
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,220
- Would you like water?
- Sure.

95
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,100
Thanks.

96
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,353
I moved the
stir-fried ham closer to you.

97
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:56,420
Because I know you like them.

98
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,153
Yes, I had some right away.

99
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,620
Enjoy your lunch, then.

100
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,733
Kwon.

101
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:02,086
- Yes?
- Who are you texting,

102
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,486
in the middle of your lunch?

103
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:04,486
Yes, uh...

104
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:06,433
My client keeps on texting me.

105
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:11,253
You're so passionate
about your work that

106
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,353
you're working away,
even during your meals!

107
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:15,753
I must say you are my role model.

108
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,266
I really respect you. Right?

109
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:20,933
I really respect you too, sir.

110
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,020
Stop your exaggeration.

111
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,886
There's a limit to everything.
Working even while eating?

112
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:28,020
You know, I really think
Kwon's a workaholic.

113
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,253
Right, I'm sometimes worried
about you, Mr. Kwon,

114
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,986
because all you do is work.

115
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:34,286
Why? As long as he's happy.

116
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:37,566
You truly enjoy
your work, don’t you?

117
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:39,766
Yes.

118
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,800
With all my heart.

119
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:57,753
So you had something to tell me?

120
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,120
Well, uh...

121
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,086
That braised beef just now.

122
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,386
It was so delicious.

123
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:03,500
What?

124
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,820
But...

125
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,733
But why tell me that here?

126
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:08,686
Well, uh...

127
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:10,520
In the dramas,

128
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,986
office couples always meet up
at the emergency stairs,

129
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,600
so I always wanted to try it.

130
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,186
If you're free tonight,

131
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:20,953
would you like to have
dinner with me?

132
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:23,053
Are you asking me out
on a date? Sure!

133
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:25,286
Then I'll make a reservation.

134
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:26,366
Sure.

135
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,486
Can I get a printout of that
tax information submission order?

136
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,653
Yes, Mr. Kwon. Right away, sir.

137
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,486
Get moving, then!
Why are you just standing here?

138
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:51,566
Yes, sir.

139
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:55,020
You must be anxious.

140
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,553
You know gambling is
against the law,

141
00:07:57,633 --> 00:08:00,320
yet you even went overseas for it.

142
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,153
But I'm sorry,
this may put you in despair

143
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,920
but because this isn't
your first time gambling,

144
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,300
it won't end with just
a light punishment.

145
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:12,666
You know, I...

146
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:17,000
I really hate myself for this.

147
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:21,700
I know better than anyone else
that I really shouldn't,

148
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,786
but I keep falling into it,
every time...

149
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:26,633
Right?

150
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,500
Why do I keep on falling...

151
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:32,666
I think it's crazy.

152
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:35,286
What? Crazy?

153
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't you think that's
a little too harsh?

154
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,153
Um, uh...

155
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:42,133
That wasn't meant for you.

156
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,266
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,820
Hae-young,

158
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,700
what's so funny?

159
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:08,720
I'm learning
scuba diving these days,

160
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,553
with the friends I made
through an app.

161
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,453
And I was just looking at
the pictures from then.

162
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:14,320
You meet people through apps?

163
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,500
Yes.

164
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:22,353
You can meet people
who share your interests

165
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:23,986
on this app here.

166
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:26,566
Why? Are you interested?

167
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,620
I keep having stray thoughts,

168
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,786
so I'd like to focus
my mind somewhere.

169
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:34,420
I wonder if anyone's
interested in ukulele.

170
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,886
It'd be nice if I could find
someone to learn it with.

171
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:38,320
Do you even have an ukulele?

172
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,120
Because I happen to have
a spare one.

173
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,566
You want to buy it off me?

174
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:46,286
- What?
- I'll give you

175
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,586
a special price for it.

176
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,433
I'll bring it someday, then.

177
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,120
No...

178
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,433
It's really alright.

179
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,600
I shouldn't get involved...

180
00:10:11,766 --> 00:10:14,153
So, is today a special day?

181
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:15,966
Why bring me to a place like this?

182
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,086
After searching for places
that aren't crowded,

183
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,820
all we did was go to
bad restaurants or

184
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,653
just stay in the car, so...

185
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:27,153
I wanted us to go on
a proper date.

186
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:28,333
I see.

187
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,086
You know, you really had me
back there.

188
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:37,920
I mean, you're kind of...
Dry, should I say?

189
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,920
So I thought you wouldn't like
making all those

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,720
secret exchanges while
everyone was there.

191
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,320
But you were really bold!

192
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,433
I didn't know I was capable of
such a thing myself.

193
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:52,166
But because you like it...

194
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,120
And as you said,

195
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,986
I wanted to make most of
the time we had remaining.

196
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:05,320
Because there's only about
a month left for us to

197
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,833
enjoy this office romance.

198
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,733
Your plate is empty.

199
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,666
When did I finish everything?

200
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:29,400
You know, I think there's
a problem with this steak.

201
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:32,453
The dish is this big,
and the meat's only this size...

202
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:36,300
I mean, shouldn't the steak
take up at least half of the dish?

203
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,766
Can't they pass a law like that?

204
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,733
It will be difficult for
such a law to come into force,

205
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:48,653
so have this for now.

206
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:50,766
That's not what I was aiming for.

207
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:52,000
It's alright.

208
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,433
I'm fine.

209
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,100
I'm alright, too.

210
00:11:57,866 --> 00:11:58,866
Then...

211
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:00,466
No, no. Stop.

212
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:04,366
Go on.

213
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:06,753
These days,

214
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,853
every day has been
a happy one for me.

215
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:12,966
Of course, the biggest reason is
that I have you with me.

216
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,586
To be honest,
when I first started out,

217
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:20,086
I was telling myself,
'Let's try and hold out somehow

218
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,866
for the next three months.'

219
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,786
But now,

220
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:25,686
work is so much fun,

221
00:12:25,766 --> 00:12:27,200
and all the group dinners, too.

222
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:29,486
Oh, and the workshop, too.

223
00:12:29,566 --> 00:12:31,820
Everything's just been
so much fun.

224
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,820
As Mr. Yeon said,

225
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,333
you're really like
Princess Ann from Roman Holiday.

226
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:37,520
The princess who got tired of
her life in the palace,

227
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,666
and found happiness in the
small, day-to-day things.

228
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,320
You watched Roman Holiday?

229
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,753
I think I watched it on TV...

230
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,186
Come on, no!

231
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:51,953
You should watch
Roman Holiday properly.

232
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:54,066
It's my favorite movie!

233
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:58,286
Oh, I have a Blu-ray version at home.

234
00:12:58,366 --> 00:12:59,453
Would you like to
watch it with me?

235
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:01,353
Tomorrow's a Saturday, right?

236
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:02,766
Come over to my place.

237
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,433
- I'll do that, then.
- Yes.

238
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:05,953
Hold on.

239
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:07,320
What did I just say?

240
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,753
Hold on.

241
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:12,153
So that means I'm going over to
Jin-sim's place.

242
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:13,386
Oh no!

243
00:13:13,466 --> 00:13:16,420
I only really invited him
over for the movie.

244
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,253
I only simply said yes
for the movie...

245
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,786
I hope she's not thinking...

246
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,033
...That I have some
other intentions, right?

247
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,520
I need to pretend
everything's okay.

248
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,833
Otherwise it might make things
even more awkward.

249
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:36,486
Let's watch it tomorrow, then.

250
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,700
Sounds like fun!

251
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,433
- Yes, it does.
- Right?

252
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,000
Ah, I can't believe I'll be watching
Roman Holiday.

253
00:13:57,433 --> 00:13:58,433
You're home!

254
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,200
Did you have di...

255
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:02,933
What's with him?

256
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,366
Does he have something urgent
he needs to take care of?

257
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,800
I can't go empty-handed...

258
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:18,800
What should I take?

259
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:29,633
(Visiting girlfriend)

260
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,600
(When visiting girlfriend)

261
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:38,100
(Guy's ultimate fantasy:
Visiting your girlfriend)

262
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,833
Oh what...

263
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,733
I'm only going over for the movie.

264
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:50,920
It's just that

265
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,453
we're going to be watching it
at her place, that's all.

266
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:28,986
With that,

267
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:31,433
he should say
my place is neat, right?

268
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:36,100
This is the first time
I'm having a boyfriend come over.

269
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:37,533
I'm so nervous!

270
00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:05,366
Oh, my goodness. He must be here!

271
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:09,953
Yes, hello?

272
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,586
It's me, Kwon Jung-rok…

273
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,533
Oh, that's right.

274
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:38,066
Um...

275
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:40,133
- Come in.
- Sure.

276
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,953
Oh, and this too.

277
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:09,386
What's this?

278
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:10,500
It's a gift.

279
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:13,286
You have trouble sleeping, right?

280
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,220
I heard that
a glass of wine helps.

281
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,586
Oh, thank you.

282
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,200
I'm really
looking forward to tonight.

283
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:23,553
What was that you just said?

284
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:24,886
"Looking forward to tonight?"

285
00:17:24,966 --> 00:17:27,533
I really meant, I'm looking
forward to a good sleep.

286
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:29,933
I hope he didn't
interpret it otherwise.

287
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:35,000
Sure, hope you have
a good sleep tonight.

288
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:37,900
May I take this off?

289
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,720
Where's your object?

290
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,166
You should've said,
"May I take off my coat?"

291
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:45,633
You're a lawyer,
so where's your object?

292
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:49,033
I hope she doesn't think
I have other intentions.

293
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,120
I meant my coat. My coat!

294
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,453
Yes, sure.

295
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:54,533
Thanks.

296
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,120
Um, may I put this here?

297
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,200
Sure.

298
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,286
You have a nice place.

299
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:12,786
Then...

300
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:14,620
Do you want me to show you around?

301
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,700
This way.

302
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,166
This is my study.

303
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:25,253
It's my favorite place

304
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,866
in the house.

305
00:18:30,633 --> 00:18:32,286
You have a lot of books.

306
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:34,666
Of course. I love reading.

307
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,020
Oh my goodness!

308
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,653
You'd think that, uh...

309
00:18:41,733 --> 00:18:44,153
Dust has piled up because
I never take out books from here,

310
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:45,286
but that's not the case!

311
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:47,600
I read often,
but just don't dust often.

312
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,200
I dust often, but I don't...

313
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:53,533
I mean...

314
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,166
Anyway, let's move on.

315
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:08,133
This is my bedroom.

316
00:19:08,966 --> 00:19:10,433
Isn't this a nice dressing table?

317
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,720
I just love this bed, too.

318
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,520
You don't find
designs like this often.

319
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,620
The headpiece is just the
right height,

320
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,800
and the mattress is so soft, too.

321
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:25,086
Oh what? Why am I describing the
bed with such detail?

322
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,886
The mattress is so soft...
So what?

323
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,966
It's not like I'm inviting him to
lie here with me.

324
00:19:30,566 --> 00:19:33,666
I hope he didn't take it that way!

325
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:40,286
Oh what?
Why did I turn off the lights?

326
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:41,386
This is the bedroom!

327
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:42,966
Why did I make such a mistake?

328
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:45,900
My hand slipped.

329
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,566
Sure, of course.

330
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,500
Then shall we go to
the kitchen next?

331
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:05,200
Yes, I'll send my opinions
through mail.

332
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:07,500
If you've anything to add,
then please write back.

333
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,900
Sure.

334
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:13,920
- Ah, Ms. Dan.
- Mr. Choi.

335
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,653
Why are you here on the weekend?

336
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,820
I had preparing to do
before the trial.

337
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,133
What about you?

338
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:21,833
I had some work to do, too.

339
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:24,753
Ah, great.

340
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,786
I brought the ukulele
that I told you about.

341
00:20:27,866 --> 00:20:30,700
I'll bring it to your room later.

342
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:40,086
Oh what?

343
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,686
Just us two, in the office
on the weekend?

344
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:42,866
Is this what they call...

345
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:45,766
...destiny?

346
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,633
Destiny? Whatever!

347
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:50,520
Get a grip on yourself,
Dan Mun-hee.

348
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,000
You decided to stop doing this!

349
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,620
Ms. Dan,

350
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,366
here's the ukulele
I told you about.

351
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:10,886
Ah, how much do you want for this?

352
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:12,000
It's alright.

353
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:14,220
Just buy me a drink sometime.

354
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,486
A drink?

355
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:16,566
Yes.

356
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:19,700
Then... Here you are.

357
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,353
Thanks for everything until now.

358
00:21:25,433 --> 00:21:26,666
You were once a part of me,

359
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:29,620
and me, a part of you...

360
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,633
All those harmonies
we created together,

361
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,933
as one...

362
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:38,500
I'll never forget them.

363
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:45,600
So instead of goodbye,
let me play this tune...

364
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,000
Alright, I'm done with
my goodbyes.

365
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:34,220
Here you are, then.

366
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,866
Thank you.

367
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:37,800
Take good care of it for me.

368
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,686
Oh, do you even know
how to play an ukulele?

369
00:22:42,766 --> 00:22:46,466
Well, I took some
lessons before...

370
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,566
I know some chords.

371
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:54,900
The... The C-chord...

372
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,333
The F-chord...

373
00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:01,600
You're even holding it wrong.

374
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:04,933
Here.

375
00:23:06,266 --> 00:23:07,266
Here.

376
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,833
Relax your shoulders.

377
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,000
And hold this ukulele gently like
you're holding a child.

378
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,366
Like this.

379
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:28,966
Please!

380
00:23:30,466 --> 00:23:32,166
Give me your permission!

381
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,300
I...

382
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,000
I want to love him!

383
00:23:38,466 --> 00:23:39,933
Mr. Choi!

384
00:23:45,433 --> 00:23:48,486
I see you watch movies often
in your place.

385
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:51,486
Yes, I love watching movies.

386
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:52,600
Sure.

387
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:54,466
Oh.

388
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:57,853
One minute.

389
00:23:57,933 --> 00:23:58,933
Sure.

390
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,366
Yes, hello? Prosecutor?

391
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
Yes.

392
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,133
Next Wednesday for me is a bit...

393
00:24:06,866 --> 00:24:08,200
No, it's not that.

394
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
What...

395
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:16,633
Huh?

396
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,966
Where did it go?
It was right here!

397
00:24:21,766 --> 00:24:23,333
It's not here.

398
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,486
Hey, Hyuk-jun.

399
00:24:31,566 --> 00:24:33,753
My Blu-ray disc player is gone.

400
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:34,933
What happened?

401
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,033
What? You took it to be repaired?

402
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,000
Why didn't you tell me before...

403
00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:40,686
...doing that?

404
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:43,086
What? But I always just
took care of

405
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,920
whatever that needs
fixing at your place.

406
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,653
So what's this, all of a sudden?

407
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:48,633
What do I do now?

408
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:50,900
Oh, alright. Talk to you later.

409
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:55,566
Are we going to watch it now?

410
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,133
Um...

411
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,153
No...

412
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:03,386
No?

413
00:25:03,466 --> 00:25:04,386
Oh.

414
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:06,953
You mean, I might not enjoy it?

415
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:07,953
That's alright.

416
00:25:08,033 --> 00:25:10,486
Though I don't really
watch movies,

417
00:25:10,566 --> 00:25:11,986
since this is your favorite,

418
00:25:12,066 --> 00:25:13,633
I'll try my best.

419
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:16,953
No, what I mean is...

420
00:25:17,033 --> 00:25:21,266
I don't have the player.

421
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,686
I must've forgotten
I took it to be repaired.

422
00:25:28,766 --> 00:25:30,466
Oh, I see.

423
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:40,566
How about the laptop...

424
00:25:46,566 --> 00:25:49,786
How about we watch it
on the laptop instead?

425
00:25:49,866 --> 00:25:51,286
I'll download it right away.

426
00:25:51,366 --> 00:25:52,320
Don't mind me,

427
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,566
take your time.

428
00:25:56,233 --> 00:25:57,266
Go on.

429
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,353
Oh, I'd been curious
about those trophies.

430
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:06,920
May I take a look?

431
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,366
Oh, sure.

432
00:26:14,633 --> 00:26:18,720
KBC Award,
MBU Hot Celebrity Award,

433
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,200
TBM Teenager's Choice,
SBC People's Choice...

434
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,333
Wow, that's a lot of awards.

435
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,053
I did, yes.

436
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:30,233
Though the problem is,
it's all thanks to my popularity.

437
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:32,966
Why is that a problem?

438
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:35,166
Well...

439
00:26:38,233 --> 00:26:39,986
None are for my acting,

440
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,800
so I'm embarrassed they're
all for my popularity.

441
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:44,833
Why should you be embarrassed
about it?

442
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,553
Your popularity means

443
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:48,886
that many people like you.

444
00:26:48,966 --> 00:26:50,820
And I think winning over
someone's heart is

445
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,000
something that's very difficult.

446
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:54,733
So I think you're amazing.

447
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:57,033
You think so?

448
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,553
But you know,

449
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:01,053
I think if I can
go back to acting now...

450
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:03,700
I'll really pull it off this time.

451
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:07,620
Because back then,
I didn't really know

452
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,053
the excitement of being in love.

453
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:12,286
And because I didn't know,
I couldn't really express it.

454
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:13,433
But now...

455
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:16,533
But now,

456
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,966
I think I have an idea.

457
00:27:31,366 --> 00:27:34,253
What drama is that picture from?

458
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:35,433
You look beautiful in this picture.

459
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,886
That wasn't a drama.

460
00:27:38,966 --> 00:27:41,666
I made my debut through that
chocolate commercial.

461
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,220
Thanks to that commercial,
all the chocolates sold out

462
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,786
and they even dubbed me
the "chocolate fairy."

463
00:27:48,866 --> 00:27:50,800
And you're telling me
you never saw it?

464
00:27:51,966 --> 00:27:52,886
I can't have this.

465
00:27:52,966 --> 00:27:55,020
This is no time to watch
Roman Holiday, then.

466
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,386
Come on, over here.

467
00:27:57,466 --> 00:27:58,553
Come sit, now!

468
00:27:58,633 --> 00:27:59,633
Sure.

469
00:28:10,233 --> 00:28:11,220
Look here.

470
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,266
Don't I look so cute
and adorable here?

471
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:18,653
And this, too.
Don't I look pretty?

472
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:19,866
And so innocent, right?

473
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:24,253
So beautiful.

474
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,100
Don't I just look elegant?

475
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,753
Do you want to see
my photos, too?

476
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:33,000
- Oh, this?
- Yes, want to take a look?

477
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,686
I didn't know it back then,

478
00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:45,833
but I was quite pretty.

479
00:28:46,566 --> 00:28:47,633
Right?

480
00:28:50,366 --> 00:28:51,453
Come to think of it,

481
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:53,133
why haven't I heard you
agree with me?

482
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:55,720
What, you don’t think I'm pretty?

483
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,066
No, I think you're pretty.

484
00:28:57,866 --> 00:28:59,833
But I think you're prettier now.

485
00:29:00,666 --> 00:29:02,566
The you, who's in front of me.

486
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,120
Um,

487
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,533
can I have this?

488
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:14,686
- This?
- Yes.

489
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:16,353
Though I want everything,

490
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:17,833
I can't really do that, but...

491
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,600
But I really must have this one.

492
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,033
Alright, then. Take it with you.

493
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:25,686
You know, I'll be generous.

494
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:26,686
You can pick one more.

495
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,953
- Oh, sure.
- They're all worth keeping,

496
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,066
so you need to pick carefully.

497
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,133
So this is the chocolate...

498
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,420
Ah, so fragrant!

499
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,100
I'm glad you like it.

500
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,153
It's really too bad, though.

501
00:29:56,233 --> 00:29:58,086
I invited you over for the movie,

502
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:00,786
but we never got to see it.

503
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:01,920
I'm really sorry.

504
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,486
No, I'm actually glad that

505
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:05,853
we never got to see the movie.

506
00:30:05,933 --> 00:30:06,933
What?

507
00:30:09,466 --> 00:30:12,153
To be honest,

508
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:13,866
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

509
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:16,953
I was nervous.

510
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:19,453
When I thought about how
I'll be visiting your place,

511
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:22,533
I still couldn't believe it
and was a little nervous.

512
00:30:23,466 --> 00:30:24,833
And of course, a little excited.

513
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,533
- Same with me!
- Huh?

514
00:30:29,966 --> 00:30:32,053
When I thought about
how you'll be coming over,

515
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:35,220
I was so nervous that
my heart was beating fast!

516
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,986
And you know how
I have insomnia, right?

517
00:30:38,066 --> 00:30:40,966
Well, yesterday I ended up
not getting any sleep at all!

518
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:45,686
Gosh, I thought it was just me.

519
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:47,586
No, I was like that too.

520
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:49,953
Anyway, though I was
nervous at first,

521
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:53,186
that's all gone away thanks to

522
00:30:53,266 --> 00:30:54,586
all that time we spent
chatting over your pretty photos.

523
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:57,020
Same for me, too!

524
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,800
I only got over it after
we looked at the photos together.

525
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,853
Before then, all kinds of
things ran in my head

526
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:06,520
when you were here and

527
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,400
I realized it's just us two,
here alone...

528
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:16,753
But that doesn't mean

529
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,866
I was having naughty thoughts.

530
00:31:22,433 --> 00:31:24,666
By naughty thoughts,
do you mean...

531
00:31:25,766 --> 00:31:27,400
Well, uh...

532
00:31:34,466 --> 00:31:36,100
Do you mean something like this?

533
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,333
Or...

534
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,166
Something like this?

535
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:12,666
Hey, Hyuk-jun.

536
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:15,286
What, you're going to be late?

537
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:16,400
How late?

538
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,986
Oh, alright.
Call me when you're here.

539
00:32:20,066 --> 00:32:21,100
Alright.

540
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:31,633
It was so much fun yesterday
with Mr. Kwon here.

541
00:32:34,733 --> 00:32:37,066
Is this why people get married,
I wonder?

542
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,253
Because you're so happy
when you're together,

543
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:43,066
and everything is just
so much fun?

544
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,720
Lee Kang-joon, Director of
Empire Entertainment,

545
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,920
who caused much controversy
over a drug scandal two years ago

546
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,986
is back on the company's
management team,

547
00:32:51,066 --> 00:32:53,086
as the Vice President of
Empire Holdings,

548
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:55,020
one of Empire Group's
affiliates in manufacturing.

549
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,853
The Group is currently undergoing
restructuring so that

550
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,420
Mr. Lee will be put in charge of
Empire Group's entertainment

551
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,820
and other associated businesses.

552
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:05,586
Some see his return to management
as a little hasty...

553
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:07,053
Lee Kang-joon, as in the
Vice President of Empire Group.

554
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:10,253
Why, there was that drug scandal
with him and some actress.

555
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,686
Oh Yoon-seo, was she?

556
00:33:11,766 --> 00:33:13,053
- Oh Yoon-seo?
- Apparently,

557
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:14,520
Lee Kang-joon had
called Oh Yoon-seo out to

558
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,253
a drug party, to make her guilty
as revenge for rejecting him.

559
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:19,786
He'd been stalking her, too.

560
00:33:19,866 --> 00:33:21,786
At the time, Empire Group had
released a statement that

561
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:24,186
it feels highly responsible for
the social controversy

562
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:25,666
caused by Vice President
Lee Kang-joon...

563
00:33:26,366 --> 00:33:27,833
Ah, off to work?

564
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,220
Of course. Where else
would I go at this time?

565
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,300
I'm off.

566
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,200
Um...

567
00:33:36,033 --> 00:33:38,200
Everything's okay with
Yoon-seo, right?

568
00:33:40,866 --> 00:33:42,820
I was just curious,

569
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,220
on whether our cosmic goddess is
doing well.

570
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,320
Yes, she's doing well.

571
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,466
- See you, then.
- Alright.

572
00:33:57,866 --> 00:33:59,120
Yes, Mr. Yeon.

573
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,786
I saw the news, too.

574
00:34:00,866 --> 00:34:02,566
Lee Kang-joon is back.

575
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:05,853
No, I haven't noticed
anything suspicious yet.

576
00:34:05,933 --> 00:34:07,086
I doubt Yoon-seo knows, though.

577
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:09,133
It's not like
she watches the news.

578
00:34:10,066 --> 00:34:11,820
Mr. Yeon, Yoon-seo's here.

579
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,000
I'll call you right back. Alright.

580
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,133
Ah.

581
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,086
Oh what?

582
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:25,200
Who was that just now?
You hung up in a rush.

583
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,733
No, I didn't hang up in a rush.

584
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:30,733
Alright.

585
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:33,733
- Yoon-seo?
- Yes?

586
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:37,366
What?

587
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,520
Everything's okay
with you these days, right?

588
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,086
No one's been stalking you,

589
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:43,966
or following you home?

590
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,753
Oh what? Why are you asking me
such a thing?

591
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:51,320
Why else?

592
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,553
You're Oh Yoon-seo!

593
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:56,500
You're so beautiful that
I always worry about you.

594
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:00,153
Do I look beautiful today?

595
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:01,566
You're beautiful every day.

596
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:04,766
- Let's go, then.
- Alright.

597
00:35:08,766 --> 00:35:09,686
Bye, Hyuk-jun.

598
00:35:09,766 --> 00:35:11,633
- Alright. Take care.
- Sure!

599
00:35:17,633 --> 00:35:18,633
Hmmm?

600
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,900
Yes, Mr. Kwon. Good morning.

601
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,066
The written ruling? One second.

602
00:35:30,633 --> 00:35:31,666
Hold on.

603
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,700
Yes, where should I send it to?

604
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,620
I'm at the underground
parking lot right now,

605
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,920
so I'll send it right away
as soon as I'm there. Don’t worry.

606
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,066
I'll see you later.

607
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:04,353
Everything's okay
with you these days, right?

608
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:06,720
No one's been stalking you,

609
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,633
or following you home?

610
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:14,233
Excuse me.

611
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,253
Who are you?

612
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:20,100
Why do you keep on following me?

613
00:36:20,966 --> 00:36:23,120
Um, your...

614
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
What, you're my fan?

615
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,586
You got the wrong person.
I'm not a celebrity.

616
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:31,533
I'm just an average citizen
with good looks!

617
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:40,266
Um, excuse me!

618
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,153
Why do you keep on following me?

619
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:45,453
I told you already,
I'm not a celebrity!

620
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:47,433
Excuse me, it's not like that...

621
00:36:53,366 --> 00:36:54,466
Oh what?

622
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,453
Ah, honey.

623
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:02,353
Yes, I'm at Jung-rok's office.

624
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:03,466
Jung-rok?

625
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,200
He's not picking up.

626
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:10,386
Well, I'm here, so I'll just
tell him in person.

627
00:37:10,466 --> 00:37:11,633
Alright.

628
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,520
How may I help you?

629
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,286
I'm here to see
Mr. Kwon Jung-rok.

630
00:37:20,366 --> 00:37:22,386
Tell him Kwon Je-bok is
here to see him, and he'll know.

631
00:37:22,466 --> 00:37:25,620
Oh, you must be Mr. Kwon's father.

632
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,986
How did you know?

633
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:29,886
Just a hunch.

634
00:37:29,966 --> 00:37:32,153
If you continue on that way,

635
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:33,753
you should find his office.

636
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:34,620
Or should I show you the...

637
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,853
No, it's alright.

638
00:37:36,933 --> 00:37:39,033
I'll find my way alright.

639
00:37:39,766 --> 00:37:43,600
Written ruling... Submitted.

640
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:52,020
Oh my gosh, you can't just
follow me in here!

641
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,666
I'm not Oh Yun...

642
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,686
Fine, I'm Oh Yoon-seo.

643
00:38:01,766 --> 00:38:04,386
Are you happy now?

644
00:38:04,466 --> 00:38:06,353
- What?
- You say you're my fan,

645
00:38:06,433 --> 00:38:10,253
but must you put me
in this difficult situation?

646
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:13,066
How did you even know that
I work here?

647
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,366
How much do you know
about me, anyway?

648
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,320
Excuse me, miss.

649
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,453
I think there's been
some misunderstanding,

650
00:38:30,533 --> 00:38:32,486
but I'm not your fan.

651
00:38:32,566 --> 00:38:35,686
I only meant to return this
pen to you, which I picked up!

652
00:38:35,766 --> 00:38:37,420
- What?
- And I'm here

653
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,820
not because I followed you here,

654
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,953
but because I have
something to say to my son!

655
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:45,320
Something to say to your son?
But...

656
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,166
Isn't this
Mr. Kwon Jung-rok's office?

657
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:51,953
- Yes it is.
- Exactly.

658
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:54,920
I'm here to see
Mr. Kwon Jung-rok.

659
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,933
- My son.
- So Mr. Kwon Jung-rok is...

660
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,233
You're Mr. Kwon's father?

661
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,366
Hello, sir.

662
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,333
Father.

663
00:39:29,866 --> 00:39:32,653
I can't believe this.

664
00:39:32,733 --> 00:39:35,566
Why did I say such a thing to
his father?

665
00:39:49,933 --> 00:39:50,966
What brings you here?

666
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,653
Hey, you should dress more warmly.

667
00:39:56,733 --> 00:39:58,486
Your neck is all bare!

668
00:39:58,566 --> 00:40:00,300
You're going to catch
a cold at this rate.

669
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,286
I'm taking all the precautions

670
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:06,853
so I don't catch a cold.

671
00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:09,420
And call your mother often.

672
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,186
I've been doing as much as I can.

673
00:40:11,266 --> 00:40:12,486
Tsk, you...

674
00:40:12,566 --> 00:40:14,886
Can't you just say yes
and be done with it?

675
00:40:14,966 --> 00:40:16,466
Instead of talking back to me,
each time!

676
00:40:22,566 --> 00:40:25,353
Anyway, the more I think about it,
it makes me mad!

677
00:40:25,433 --> 00:40:28,400
How could she think that
I followed her in here?

678
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,720
I'm extremely concerned that
such a reckless person

679
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,466
like her, is your secretary.

680
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,566
Everyone makes mistakes.

681
00:40:44,266 --> 00:40:45,266
And this, too.

682
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,733
Is this your secretary's doing?

683
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,186
This isn't a coloring book.

684
00:40:52,266 --> 00:40:54,653
If she has time for this,

685
00:40:54,733 --> 00:40:57,620
she should get
more work done in that time.

686
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,586
She's been diligent in her duties.

687
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:02,333
Well, her attitude is all wrong.

688
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,520
I mean, look at her outfit.

689
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,286
Do you really think
she's dressed for work?

690
00:41:06,366 --> 00:41:09,853
It's prejudice to judge
a person by the way they dress.

691
00:41:09,933 --> 00:41:11,653
Still, all it needs is
one look to know...

692
00:41:11,733 --> 00:41:12,766
Father.

693
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,053
Tell me why you're here.

694
00:41:16,133 --> 00:41:17,686
What, do I have to have
an excuse for

695
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,820
coming to see my own son?

696
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,153
This is my workplace.

697
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:24,853
You're here to see me
during work hours,

698
00:41:24,933 --> 00:41:27,020
so I thought you had
some urgent business.

699
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,786
Fine, then.

700
00:41:28,866 --> 00:41:32,420
I'm sorry for disturbing you
during your work hours.

701
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,466
I'll go tend to my own work, then.

702
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,553
Um, Mr. Kwon, sir... Coffee?

703
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:42,966
Goodbye, then.

704
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:55,053
Why did he just leave like that?

705
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:56,600
He didn't even stay for coffee.

706
00:41:58,533 --> 00:42:01,266
Did you have a fight?

707
00:42:01,933 --> 00:42:04,953
Don’t tell me, it's because of me?

708
00:42:05,033 --> 00:42:06,353
It's not like that.

709
00:42:06,433 --> 00:42:08,720
You don't need to mind us.

710
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,133
But that must be why, right?

711
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,553
He was upset because of me, right?

712
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:17,753
My father and I...

713
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:21,553
We don't get along, and
we always end up arguing...

714
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:23,620
...though it's nothing
to be proud of.

715
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,766
Anyway, so you really
don't need to mind us.

716
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:37,520
Well, we have all the evidence.

717
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,620
Let's indict him.

718
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,520
It's decided then!

719
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,720
Shall we go to lunch now?

720
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,686
Yes, let's get
something delicious.

721
00:42:44,766 --> 00:42:46,320
Since you all worked hard,

722
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,586
let's go for something special

723
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,120
- Galbi?
- Korean beef?

724
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,500
- Sure, let's do that.
- Prosecutor Kim's office.

725
00:42:54,933 --> 00:42:55,966
Yes, sir.

726
00:42:58,533 --> 00:42:59,533
What?

727
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:11,920
Why the hesitation?

728
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,100
What do you have to
tell me anyway?

729
00:43:16,466 --> 00:43:21,320
Fine, I'll just get to the point.

730
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,420
About that Jung Ji-ho case...

731
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,600
Close it, as soon as you can.

732
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,353
Why, I'd like that
more than anyone else.

733
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:34,653
That's why I'm speeding things up.

734
00:43:34,733 --> 00:43:36,986
I had a look into it myself,

735
00:43:37,066 --> 00:43:39,453
and all Jung Ji-ho did was
overseas gambling.

736
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,820
There's lack of evidence to
support suspicions that

737
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,653
he was involved in
setting up the slush fund.

738
00:43:43,733 --> 00:43:46,253
So I think it's right that
we approach this as

739
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:47,366
the Vice President's own private affair.

740
00:43:49,966 --> 00:43:51,986
Is that really the right approach,

741
00:43:52,066 --> 00:43:54,200
or must we make it that way?

742
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,100
Is this...

743
00:43:59,066 --> 00:44:01,020
...the order from the DA?

744
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,453
- What?
- Choi Yeon-su, the lawyer who's

745
00:44:04,533 --> 00:44:05,820
defending Jung...
He's DA's brother-in-law.

746
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,953
So what?

747
00:44:08,033 --> 00:44:11,186
Let's just deem it as the Vice
President's personal affair, and...

748
00:44:11,266 --> 00:44:12,266
Sir!

749
00:44:14,533 --> 00:44:18,386
Don’t you remember what you said
to me when you called me back in?

750
00:44:18,466 --> 00:44:19,986
That unless it was left to

751
00:44:20,066 --> 00:44:21,486
a crazy bastard like me,

752
00:44:21,566 --> 00:44:23,553
it won't be easy investigating
the Jung Ji-ho case!

753
00:44:23,633 --> 00:44:25,686
I know what you mean.

754
00:44:25,766 --> 00:44:27,220
And I don't know
how to face you anymore.

755
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:32,020
But the wall we've reached is
just too high.

756
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,953
You only just managed to
come back,

757
00:44:34,033 --> 00:44:36,920
and I didn't want you
taking any risks.

758
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,033
Alright?

759
00:45:03,766 --> 00:45:05,753
Um, Mr. Kwon?

760
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:08,220
Have you called your father?

761
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,320
To check that he's alright?

762
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,653
I'm worried he left without
saying what he needed to,

763
00:45:13,733 --> 00:45:14,966
because of me.

764
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,353
It's not like that.

765
00:45:17,433 --> 00:45:18,553
He didn't have any
particular business with me.

766
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,020
Huh? I don't think so.

767
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,520
Before, he clearly said

768
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,653
he came because he had
something to say to his son.

769
00:45:25,733 --> 00:45:26,733
What?

770
00:45:28,766 --> 00:45:29,966
(Mother)

771
00:45:31,066 --> 00:45:32,020
Let me take this call.

772
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,600
Then please excuse me.

773
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:39,286
Yes, Mother.

774
00:45:39,366 --> 00:45:40,600
Yes. In fact, just now...

775
00:45:44,433 --> 00:45:47,020
What? Father?

776
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:52,786
He's been suspended for
three months as retaliation for

777
00:45:52,866 --> 00:45:56,886
exposing the Vice Mayor's
$2.7 million embezzlement.

778
00:45:56,966 --> 00:45:59,533
Didn't he say anything to you?

779
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,266
He had come to consult with you.

780
00:46:02,266 --> 00:46:04,400
(I demand Vice Mayor Kim to
withdraw his retaliatory order!)

781
00:46:14,433 --> 00:46:16,100
(Uiyang City Hall)

782
00:46:17,933 --> 00:46:19,933
(I demand Vice Mayor Kim to
withdraw his retaliatory order!)

783
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,200
I'm here, Father.

784
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:26,553
How did you know,

785
00:46:26,633 --> 00:46:28,053
where to find me?

786
00:46:28,133 --> 00:46:29,486
I heard from Mother.

787
00:46:29,566 --> 00:46:31,966
She's done something
unnecessary again.

788
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,320
Just go, you must be busy.

789
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,533
Let's go for some coffee.

790
00:46:37,633 --> 00:46:39,733
Do you think
I have time for coffee?

791
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:44,666
If you're going to protest here,
warm yourself up at least.

792
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:48,833
(I demand Vice Mayor Kim to
withdraw his retaliatory order!)

793
00:46:53,566 --> 00:46:55,266
Why that...

794
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:58,166
(I demand Vice Mayor Kim to
withdraw his retaliatory order!)

795
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,453
No need to sigh.

796
00:47:03,533 --> 00:47:07,386
I'm actually relieved that
I've been suspended.

797
00:47:07,466 --> 00:47:08,386
Just what do you...

798
00:47:08,466 --> 00:47:11,653
Despite my whistle-blowing,
nothing's changed.

799
00:47:11,733 --> 00:47:14,233
Everyone around me was
trying to cover this up.

800
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:18,020
But now that they've
suspended me for 3 months,

801
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,000
they've given me an excuse
for this protest.

802
00:47:21,966 --> 00:47:23,000
This may be a chance

803
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:26,800
for the world to know
more about this.

804
00:47:30,533 --> 00:47:32,766
Have you filed for appeal?
(Appeals: Administrative trial to review disciplinary action)

805
00:47:33,566 --> 00:47:35,053
When is the review?
(of public officials or unfavorable disposition)

806
00:47:35,133 --> 00:47:36,166
Tomorrow.

807
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,000
And what if your suspension is fixed?

808
00:47:40,533 --> 00:47:43,153
Then I'll have to take it to Court.

809
00:47:43,233 --> 00:47:45,400
Is that why you were
in my office earlier?

810
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,020
To ask me to defend you,

811
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,333
if you end up
taking this to the Court?

812
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,533
Then you should've said so
from the beginning.

813
00:47:59,133 --> 00:48:00,653
Did you even give me a chance to

814
00:48:00,733 --> 00:48:02,566
ask you that?

815
00:48:03,466 --> 00:48:05,553
Still, you just walked out.

816
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,733
You always make me the bad son.

817
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:21,100
I see, so that's what happened.

818
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:25,686
With all these things going on,

819
00:48:25,766 --> 00:48:28,433
I had to suspect him for
something like that...

820
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,053
Don't worry too much,
I'm sure it's nothing.

821
00:48:34,133 --> 00:48:35,820
Even if they decide on
his suspension,

822
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,686
we'll have that
overturned in Court.

823
00:48:37,766 --> 00:48:40,286
I'm going to do all I can to
set everything right,

824
00:48:40,366 --> 00:48:42,166
so there's no more
need for you to worry.

825
00:48:45,666 --> 00:48:46,900
It's really okay.

826
00:48:47,533 --> 00:48:48,986
No...

827
00:48:49,066 --> 00:48:51,320
There's that too, but...

828
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:56,253
I'm worried about
what he thinks of me now.

829
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:59,453
If he finds out that you're seeing
an actress with such a past...

830
00:48:59,533 --> 00:49:01,100
He'll be worried.

831
00:49:02,733 --> 00:49:05,233
And I just had to leave
a bad first impression.

832
00:49:10,733 --> 00:49:12,500
No need to be so sad about it.

833
00:49:14,133 --> 00:49:16,320
Because once anyone learns
what you're truly like,

834
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,420
they can't help but like you.

835
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,266
There must be a reason why you
won all those popularity awards.

836
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,353
Then will it be just your father
at the disciplinary review?

837
00:49:33,433 --> 00:49:35,120
Yes, well...

838
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,853
He just needs to
state his opinions and

839
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:39,420
hear their decision,

840
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,833
so there's no need for me to
accompany him.

841
00:49:43,433 --> 00:49:44,666
I see.

842
00:49:45,166 --> 00:49:46,166
But...

843
00:49:47,033 --> 00:49:49,800
Won't he be nervous about
going alone?

844
00:49:54,133 --> 00:49:56,553
What? You think
I should accompany him?

845
00:49:56,633 --> 00:49:57,820
No matter how I think about it,

846
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,186
I think your father will feel
too nervous on his own.

847
00:50:00,266 --> 00:50:02,286
So I think it's best that
you accompany him,

848
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:05,320
as his son and his lawyer.

849
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,953
I re-arranged all your
appointments for this morning,

850
00:50:08,033 --> 00:50:09,233
so off you go.

851
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,320
Thanks for your consideration,

852
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,253
but you don't know my father.

853
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:17,086
My father's not someone to
get nervous over such a thing.

854
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:19,453
He's got a strong mentality.

855
00:50:19,533 --> 00:50:21,886
That's what you think.

856
00:50:21,966 --> 00:50:25,986
Even if he is a strong person,
this must be all new to him.

857
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:28,253
He might get nervous,

858
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:31,466
and may need someone to
rely on, who knows?

859
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:40,233
So go, just this one. Come on!

860
00:50:41,066 --> 00:50:42,720
I'm just really worried that

861
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,400
you two ended up having
an argument because of me.

862
00:50:46,966 --> 00:50:50,820
So please, for my sake.

863
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,366
Yes, well...

864
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,000
Alright, then let's go!

865
00:50:59,633 --> 00:51:00,553
Here.

866
00:51:00,633 --> 00:51:03,133
Take this. This is to help
calm the nerves.

867
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:05,220
Though it's a little old and

868
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,986
I don't look like the person to
carry these around...

869
00:51:07,066 --> 00:51:09,820
Nothing beats that when
you're in a nervous situation.

870
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,786
Then have a good trip.

871
00:51:12,866 --> 00:51:13,900
Off you go!

872
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:15,900
Let's go.

873
00:51:47,233 --> 00:51:48,466
I'm here.

874
00:51:50,433 --> 00:51:51,566
Why did you come here?

875
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,766
My morning appointment was
cancelled, so...

876
00:51:58,233 --> 00:52:00,500
You must have more free time
than I thought.

877
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,720
Everything is ready,
including written opinions,

878
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,266
so it should all be fine.

879
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:20,053
Even if you do end up
taking this to Court,

880
00:52:20,133 --> 00:52:22,553
I will win this case no matter what.

881
00:52:22,633 --> 00:52:24,066
So don't worry too much.

882
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,686
I'm not worried.

883
00:52:28,766 --> 00:52:30,233
Of course that's how it should be.

884
00:52:38,433 --> 00:52:41,466
I've something for your nerves.
Would you like it?

885
00:52:52,033 --> 00:52:53,200
If you have something,
give it to me.

886
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,800
They should be done by now...

887
00:53:50,066 --> 00:53:52,353
Mr. Kwon, how did it go?

888
00:53:52,433 --> 00:53:55,100
His suspension has been confirmed.

889
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:00,853
We'll have to start working
on it right away.

890
00:54:00,933 --> 00:54:02,286
And,

891
00:54:02,366 --> 00:54:04,053
it's as you said.

892
00:54:04,133 --> 00:54:06,686
I'm glad I was there for
my father today.

893
00:54:06,766 --> 00:54:10,086
That tonic you gave to me
was a big help, too.

894
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:12,053
Thank you for your
kind consideration.

895
00:54:12,133 --> 00:54:14,753
It's nothing.

896
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:16,820
Cheer your father up, then.

897
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,520
Don't talk back like that

898
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,420
and take him
somewhere nice for lunch.

899
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,500
Oh, and...

900
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,186
If you have the chance,

901
00:54:27,266 --> 00:54:32,286
maybe mention that it was me
who got him that tonic?

902
00:54:32,366 --> 00:54:34,633
Yes, alright.

903
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:48,166
(Evidence)

904
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,766
(Affidavit)

905
00:54:57,366 --> 00:54:59,486
I've just spoken with the Chief.

906
00:54:59,566 --> 00:55:01,733
Why? Did he want you to
try and stop me?

907
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:05,520
Let me make this clear
so I don't waste your time,

908
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,033
but don't try to convince me.

909
00:55:08,433 --> 00:55:10,453
What if you really get into
the DA's bad books?

910
00:55:10,533 --> 00:55:12,420
You only just managed to
come back, too.

911
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,453
At this rate, you really might...

912
00:55:14,533 --> 00:55:16,700
I said, don't try to convince me.

913
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,266
Don't you think that
this makes us even.

914
00:55:57,066 --> 00:55:58,220
Pay me back properly.

915
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:01,266
Don't worry, I have a conscience.

916
00:56:08,233 --> 00:56:09,266
So, what's this about?

917
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,733
Did something happen?

918
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:18,733
Yu Yeo-reum.

919
00:56:20,633 --> 00:56:22,066
Can you hug me, just this once?

920
00:56:23,733 --> 00:56:24,900
What's this about?

921
00:56:29,133 --> 00:56:30,166
Just...

922
00:56:31,433 --> 00:56:32,533
I just...

923
00:56:33,966 --> 00:56:35,066
I just wish that

924
00:56:38,033 --> 00:56:40,000
you'll comfort me.

925
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,253
(The Disciplinary
Committee's Decision)

926
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:20,366
(Vice Mayor
Kim Jun-cheol's 1.2 million...)

927
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:27,020
Here, your favorite.
Instant coffee mix.

928
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,786
Thank you.

929
00:57:28,866 --> 00:57:31,453
Is everything going alright
with the trial?

930
00:57:31,533 --> 00:57:32,533
Yes.

931
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:36,586
At first, I thought he was
making a big deal out of nothing

932
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:38,620
but as I dug deeper into this,

933
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,186
I came to understand
why he did what he did.

934
00:57:41,266 --> 00:57:44,520
Because though everyone might
think he's making a fuss,

935
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,153
the right thing here is to
right what's wrong.

936
00:57:47,233 --> 00:57:48,220
Yes, right.

937
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,020
I also respect
your father for that.

938
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,586
Because it wouldn't have been
easy to be the whistleblower

939
00:57:52,666 --> 00:57:55,033
if you learned that sort of thing.

940
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:59,353
I really admire him for that.

941
00:57:59,433 --> 00:58:03,733
So be good to your father,
who's truly amazing.

942
00:58:05,466 --> 00:58:10,053
Oh, and if you ever
have the chance,

943
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:12,533
please mention that it was me
who advised you to be good to him.

944
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:15,853
Does it concern you that much?

945
00:58:15,933 --> 00:58:17,953
That you might have left
a bad impression on him?

946
00:58:18,033 --> 00:58:21,433
Of course I'm concerned.

947
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,266
Alright. I'll make sure to
pass it on.

948
00:58:37,033 --> 00:58:38,986
Here we have a public servant,

949
00:58:39,066 --> 00:58:41,200
who happens to be my client
and my father.

950
00:58:42,066 --> 00:58:43,820
And in the past 30 years,

951
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:47,020
he has never been suspended.

952
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,686
Yet, right before his retirement,

953
00:58:49,766 --> 00:58:51,420
he has been suspended for
three months, for

954
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:55,286
raising suspicions that
his boss may have

955
00:58:55,366 --> 00:58:58,020
embezzled $2.7 million.

956
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,320
Your Honor,

957
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:02,253
the Civil Servant's Charter
stipulates that

958
00:59:02,333 --> 00:59:03,853
a civil servant must
prioritize common good,

959
00:59:03,933 --> 00:59:05,020
and assume
his full responsibilities

960
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:08,253
in a fair and
transparent manner.

961
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:11,120
Article 15 of the
Whistleblowing Protection Law

962
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,553
also states that no person shall
implement any disadvantageous

963
00:59:14,633 --> 00:59:17,720
measures against the whistleblower
in retaliation.

964
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,020
As for what truly

965
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:22,153
befits the description of justice
as discussed by countless books

966
00:59:22,233 --> 00:59:24,053
on law, I hope you, Your Honor,

967
00:59:24,133 --> 00:59:26,366
will make a wise decision on that.

968
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,166
I rest my case.

969
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,100
Thanks for that.

970
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:53,766
It's nothing.

971
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,466
Please excuse me.

972
00:59:59,566 --> 01:00:00,920
Mr. Kwon.

973
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,253
You were amazing today.

974
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:07,153
I'm sure you made
your father proud.

975
01:00:07,233 --> 01:00:08,486
I'll get going first,

976
01:00:08,566 --> 01:00:11,033
so enjoy your lunch
with your father.

977
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,986
Let's go for lunch, then.

978
01:00:15,066 --> 01:00:16,686
Sure.

979
01:00:16,766 --> 01:00:19,333
With my secretary,
Ms. Oh Jin-sim as well.

980
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,066
Will that be okay?

981
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,053
What?

982
01:00:32,133 --> 01:00:35,320
Why does he suddenly want me to
join him for lunch with his father?

983
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,586
Well, this is my last chance to

984
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:38,753
make up for that
grave mistake that I made.

985
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:39,866
Right?

986
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,900
I'm already calmly
dressed in black,

987
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,333
but are my lips too pink?

988
01:00:54,966 --> 01:00:57,553
Today, I have to be
serious and careful.

989
01:00:57,633 --> 01:00:59,086
Let's watch yourself today.

990
01:00:59,166 --> 01:01:00,966
Be serious,
and watch your actions.

991
01:01:03,866 --> 01:01:05,366
No, not like that.

992
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,720
What I learnt from this case is,

993
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,520
you can't prevent corruption by

994
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,153
punishing the officers
down the hierarchy.

995
01:01:28,233 --> 01:01:29,833
You need to uproot its very cause!

996
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,820
The disciplinary system
in place right now,

997
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,466
is all just for show.

998
01:01:37,166 --> 01:01:38,266
I completely agree.

999
01:01:40,866 --> 01:01:43,353
Just like these useless
decorations right here,

1000
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:46,353
I believe they're the result of
window-dressing policies.

1001
01:01:46,433 --> 01:01:50,120
And that's led to this
vicious cycle,

1002
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,566
where I've now been victimized.

1003
01:01:55,233 --> 01:02:00,653
Ah, I'm sorry we've been
lost in boring talk.

1004
01:02:00,733 --> 01:02:02,786
No, not at all.
It's interesting to hear.

1005
01:02:02,866 --> 01:02:05,420
Tell him honestly,
that it's boring.

1006
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:08,200
No, no. It's interesting. Really.

1007
01:02:11,233 --> 01:02:13,720
By the way, Ms. Oh Jin-sim

1008
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,966
asked me to mention
some things to you.

1009
01:02:20,566 --> 01:02:23,453
It was she who cancelled
all my morning appointments

1010
01:02:23,533 --> 01:02:26,766
and told me to be there
with you for the review.

1011
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:31,753
She also bought that tonic,

1012
01:02:31,833 --> 01:02:34,120
and said I should be
a better son to you,

1013
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,986
since you're such
a respectful father.

1014
01:02:38,066 --> 01:02:40,120
That's Ms. Oh Jin-sim, right here.

1015
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,586
Uh, Mr. Kwon?

1016
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:45,820
That's how considerate she is.

1017
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,320
Which is why,

1018
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,020
I like her very much.

1019
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,400
Let me introduce her to you.

1020
01:02:52,733 --> 01:02:53,900
This is my girlfriend.

1021
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,133
Is that something to be
so shocked about?

1022
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,333
Of course!

1023
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,320
I've never seen you act like this,

1024
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,620
confessing your love for a girl
in front of me!

1025
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:16,320
Of course I would be shocked.

1026
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,120
Right? I'm in such a panic, too.

1027
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,820
Right? I'm not the only one
who's panicking here, is it?

1028
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:25,220
No! You know your son
better than anyone else.

1029
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,786
He's never the person to do
such a thing.

1030
01:03:26,866 --> 01:03:28,666
Exactly!

1031
01:03:31,166 --> 01:03:33,433
So your name is Oh Jin-sim?

1032
01:03:35,233 --> 01:03:36,266
Yes.

1033
01:03:38,133 --> 01:03:40,886
For my son to do
something like that,

1034
01:03:40,966 --> 01:03:44,566
he must sure like you a lot.

1035
01:03:46,466 --> 01:03:48,620
Please take good care of my son,

1036
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,400
though he needs a lot of work.

1037
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,753
No, not at all!

1038
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:56,353
He's not like that all,
he's just perfect.

1039
01:03:56,433 --> 01:04:00,620
I'll make your dear son happy,

1040
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,100
so don't worry, Mr. Kwon, sir.

1041
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:16,100
- Let's eat, then.
- Alright.

1042
01:04:19,533 --> 01:04:22,253
You had me panicking
so much back there!

1043
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:25,820
Who knew you'd be
so straight like that?

1044
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,086
Did I embarrass you?

1045
01:04:27,166 --> 01:04:28,920
Embarrass me?

1046
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,053
No, I was more touched!

1047
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:32,986
That should be my line.

1048
01:04:33,066 --> 01:04:35,533
You've done so much for me
and my father.

1049
01:04:36,966 --> 01:04:39,986
We both have high pride,
so whenever we argued,

1050
01:04:40,066 --> 01:04:43,786
we'd go months without
calling each other.

1051
01:04:43,866 --> 01:04:46,586
My mother always had a hard time
between us.

1052
01:04:46,666 --> 01:04:51,186
But thanks to you this time,
we were able to make up quickly.

1053
01:04:51,266 --> 01:04:53,120
I'm sure my father is
grateful to you on that.

1054
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,366
Really?

1055
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:00,153
Mr. Kwon, I really like
how we're an office couple.

1056
01:05:00,233 --> 01:05:02,786
Especially after this incident!

1057
01:05:02,866 --> 01:05:04,220
Because we work at the same place,

1058
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,353
I was able to meet your father,

1059
01:05:06,433 --> 01:05:09,653
and help you to
make up with him.

1060
01:05:09,733 --> 01:05:13,453
And earn his approval, too!

1061
01:05:13,533 --> 01:05:15,766
Anyway, I like everything about it.

1062
01:05:22,233 --> 01:05:23,300
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

1063
01:05:33,066 --> 01:05:34,900
What's this?

1064
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:38,866
Gosh, it's so pretty.

1065
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:44,553
- But why...
- It's a gift for you.

1066
01:05:44,633 --> 01:05:45,933
A gift?

1067
01:05:46,966 --> 01:05:50,386
Is this to thank me for helping
you to make up with your father?

1068
01:05:50,466 --> 01:05:52,120
No, it's not like that.

1069
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,133
I just wanted to give it to you.

1070
01:06:14,066 --> 01:06:16,020
Beautiful.

1071
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,653
You mean, the necklace?

1072
01:06:17,733 --> 01:06:19,620
No, both.

1073
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:21,566
Both the necklace,
and you, Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

1074
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,400
I guess you like it?

1075
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:56,653
Yes, the more I look at it,
the more I like it.

1076
01:06:56,733 --> 01:06:58,353
Thank you so much, Mr. Kwon.

1077
01:06:58,433 --> 01:07:01,220
I'm glad it makes you that happy,

1078
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,366
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

1079
01:07:03,833 --> 01:07:06,933
Oh, I wanted to ask you something.

1080
01:07:08,166 --> 01:07:11,386
Why do you keep on
calling me Oh Jin-sim?

1081
01:07:11,466 --> 01:07:13,786
I corrected you many times
that it's Oh Yoon-seo.

1082
01:07:13,866 --> 01:07:16,820
At first, I thought that because that
name is a pseudonym for

1083
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:19,153
when you're acting,
you should use your

1084
01:07:19,233 --> 01:07:23,720
real name in the office,
since you're here to work.

1085
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,053
But when I look back,

1086
01:07:25,133 --> 01:07:27,786
I'm actually glad I started
calling you by that name.

1087
01:07:27,866 --> 01:07:30,520
- What?
- Because it's just me

1088
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:31,900
who calls you by that name, right?

1089
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,953
Alright, if it's for that reason,
I'm happy with that.

1090
01:07:38,033 --> 01:07:39,586
Because it's just you, Mr. Kwon,

1091
01:07:39,666 --> 01:07:41,453
who calls me by that name.

1092
01:07:41,533 --> 01:07:44,920
Which means whenever I hear
someone call out Oh Jin-sim,

1093
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,400
I know it's you right away.

1094
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:06,700
By the way, I think that
black car has been following us.

1095
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,000
Or is it just my delusion?

1096
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,633
Oh what?

1097
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,833
Are they really following us?

1098
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,766
Are you alright, Ms. Oh Jin-sim?

1099
01:09:36,866 --> 01:09:38,433
Don't get out, Mr. Kwon.

1100
01:09:54,766 --> 01:09:55,800
What is it?

1101
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,033
(Thank you to Park Ji-il for
his special cameo appearance)
