1
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,200
(Touch Your Heart)

2
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:50,953
Thanks to your emotional lecture,

3
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:52,800
I was able to convince Yun-ha.

4
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,153
I didn't do anything...

5
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:58,600
Well done, Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

6
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:09,933
Please say that again.

7
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:14,800
What?

8
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:19,520
Please compliment me again.

9
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,386
What you said before.

10
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:23,300
It was really nice,
hearing those words.

11
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,500
Please, just one more time.

12
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:46,333
Well done.

13
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,133
Well done, Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

14
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,133
Let's get going, then.

15
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,600
(Episode 4)

16
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,920
We're back.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,166
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back.

18
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,633
Yoon-seo.

19
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:27,953
How did the trial go today?

20
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:30,420
I heard she pleaded for
not guilty.

21
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,853
Is this true?

22
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:33,200
Yes, well...

23
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,186
Wow. I always thought lawyers
who turn the table

24
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:39,020
at the very last are so sexy.

25
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,453
When you think about it,

26
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:43,120
Not only is Mr. Kwon competent,

27
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,666
but he's handsome, too...

28
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,020
Isn't he just amazing?

29
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,133
Even just a bit?

30
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:54,020
Well, I don't know.

31
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,133
Then please excuse me.

32
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,633
Amazing? How?

33
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,466
The management entity...

34
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,733
What are you so absorbed in?

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,686
I told you. I bought books to
take up law again.

36
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:39,020
Oh. But it's time to go home.

37
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,020
Oh, is it already?

38
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,453
Then have a good weekend,

39
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:45,933
I'll see you on Monday.

40
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:48,353
Weekend...

41
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:49,533
Wait!

42
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:57,620
Back then, you complimented me,
didn't you?

43
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,700
Yes.

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,953
Is that all?

45
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,033
Pardon?

46
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:05,786
Do you think
words will just suffice?

47
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:06,933
I want my reward.

48
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,966
Reward?

49
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,120
Help me with my studies.

50
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,986
Though I was enthusiastic enough
about it to buy books,

51
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:19,133
It's hard, studying by myself.
I'm not really understanding it.

52
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:22,686
So tomorrow,

53
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:24,933
look over my studies.
As my reward.

54
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,086
- Alright, then.
- Huh?

55
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,486
You do have a point, rewards
should follow achievements.

56
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

57
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:45,466
What have I just done?

58
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:48,266
(HEIGHTS MANSION)

59
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,620
I noticed last time that

60
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,353
your wardrobe's lights
were flickering.

61
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:59,020
I'll just leave as soon as
I change the lights.

62
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,086
Why did I do that?

63
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,520
What? Who?

64
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,786
Huh?

65
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:05,020
Oh, it's nothing.

66
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,433
- Alright.
- Haha.

67
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,986
I'll be visiting my old professor
tomorrow morning,

68
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:17,786
so how about we study in
one of the empty classrooms?

69
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:19,153
I think you might prefer that

70
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:21,000
over a crowded library.

71
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,586
Quite considerate, aren't you?

72
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,386
Hey, come on!

73
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:29,620
I'm only changing the lights.
This is nothing!

74
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,920
Aw, Yoon-seo,

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,686
are you touched because
I'm being considerate,

76
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:33,986
changing the lights for you?

77
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:35,620
Yes, of course!

78
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,153
I'm so touched.

79
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:38,153
Well, what are you going to do

80
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:39,986
when you hear this next one?

81
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:42,520
Because I've done
something else for you.

82
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,033
I booked you in with
Dr. Kwon tomorrow!

83
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,386
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

84
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:49,586
You haven't been
sleeping well lately, right?

85
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,920
So let's go in for a consultation
and some sleeping pills.

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,386
Oh no... I can't, not tomorrow.

87
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:59,133
I'm supposed to be studying.

88
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,066
What was that, you said?

89
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:04,820
Studying.

90
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,386
Well, since I'm working
at a law firm,

91
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:11,086
I thought I needed to know
at least some basic jargons.

92
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:14,033
So I'll be studying with that
lawyer tomorrow.

93
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:18,320
- With that lawyer?
- Yeah.

94
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,166
What, on your precious weekend?

95
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:22,466
Yoon-seo, don't tell me...

96
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:26,520
- What?
- You...

97
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,820
- Yeah?
- That lawyer...

98
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,853
You completely fell out
with that lawyer, did you?

99
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:31,353
That's why you're
summoning him on the weekend to

100
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,553
drive him crazy, right?

101
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:36,020
Talk about revenge!

102
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,020
Good one, Yoon-seo.

103
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,386
Because it's really tiring to
be with you all day.

104
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,086
I mean, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday...

105
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,286
And now the weekend, too!

106
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:46,220
That poor guy.

107
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,700
I really do feel sorry for him!

108
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,066
I should just go and
change the lights.

109
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,233
Sure, I'd like that.

110
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:20,653
Ta-da!

111
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:21,986
Wait a second.

112
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,433
I look too pretty and overdressed.

113
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:28,386
He might be mistaken that
I'm trying to impress him.

114
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:30,020
This is...

115
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,120
I look too pretty and elegant.

116
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,166
And this is... Simple but pretty!

117
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:38,200
And this is...
I look like an angel!

118
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,366
Gosh, I just look too good
in everything!

119
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:46,300
Oh God, I'm going to be late.

120
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,533
I'll just have to go
with the first one.

121
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,800
Aw, angel...

122
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,100
You're here early.

123
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,520
There wasn't much traffic.

124
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,986
Well, thank you for sparing
your time for me.

125
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:31,120
It's nothing.

126
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,820
The classrooms are that way.

127
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,900
Let's go.

128
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:39,986
Oh what?

129
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:42,486
This is kind of new,
seeing him dressed like that.

130
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:47,086
Wait a second. This feels like
a date on the campus!

131
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,700
Don't tell me that's what
Mr. Kwon is thinking!

132
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,653
That's why the special law was

133
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,466
prioritized for
this particular case.

134
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:17,166
Men... There's no stopping them!

135
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,620
If you promised to lend money
for gambling,

136
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,553
you do not have to
lend that money.

137
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:25,420
The basis for this reason is
Article 103 of the Civil Act,

138
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,253
which states that acts contrary to
good morals and other social order

139
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,920
shall be null and void.

140
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,053
So even if you do not lend that
money as promised,

141
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:35,020
you will not be held
legally responsible.

142
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,453
Then let's say
you did lend that money.

143
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:37,920
I'm sure you'll be left to wonder

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,620
if you'll be able to
receive this money back.

145
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,986
The answer is in the
Article 746 of the Civil Act,

146
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:46,553
Performance for Illegal Cause.
It's in that book.

147
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:49,586
The law stipulates that if
a person granted property

148
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,520
for an illegal cause, he may not
demand its return.

149
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,020
In other words,
you can't receive it back.

150
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,133
Did you understand?

151
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,686
- Well, kind of?
- Ah, sure.

152
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,920
But... Mr. Kwon?

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,186
You could just teach me
while sitting down.

154
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:05,853
It's alright, we should make
use of the whiteboard.

155
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:07,786
Alright, then. Let's move onto
the next chapter.

156
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:09,786
Article 747 of the Civil Act.

157
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:11,133
Wait!

158
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:17,853
Can we go elsewhere and study?

159
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:19,566
There won't be
a whiteboard elsewhere.

160
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,466
You said you wanted to study
elsewhere, so why are we...

161
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:39,020
Well, studying isn't always about
writing on the whiteboard,

162
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,153
and memorizing all the
contents in the books.

163
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:43,986
There's a movie about law
that came out recently,

164
00:10:44,066 --> 00:10:46,600
so why don't we study law
while watching this movie?

165
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:53,853
Have you ever been to
a drive-in theater before?

166
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:56,120
I'm not so comfortable with
normal cinemas,

167
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,733
so I come here often instead.

168
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,453
It's my first time at
a drive-in theater.

169
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:03,733
In fact, I haven't been to the
movies in a while.

170
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:06,753
How long has it been, then?

171
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,220
The last movie I saw in the
theater was Avatar, in 2009.

172
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,320
What, Avatar?

173
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,120
Yes, that movie with

174
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,700
blue-skinned natives
living on Planet Pandora.

175
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:20,920
That means it's been
at least 10 years?

176
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,353
I was busy studying,

177
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:24,186
and besides, I'm not interested
in these kinds of things.

178
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,886
Even with Avatar,
I only reluctantly watched it

179
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:27,186
because Yeo-reum begged me to.

180
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:30,120
Huh? Yeo-reum?

181
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,433
- She's a friend from college.
- Oh.

182
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,466
That'll be $25.

183
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:45,533
(What's Wrong With My Lawyer?)

184
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:47,586
Sir! As you said, we found that
$20,000 was transferred to

185
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:51,353
the account belonging to
Professor Jang's wife last year.

186
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:52,753
The source of this money...

187
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,486
That's so awesome.

188
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:56,386
I doubt whether it'll be
accepted as evidence, though.

189
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,820
It is quite admiring,
to see the lawyer

190
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,386
trying to deliver justice.

191
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:02,053
No, not that.

192
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:04,353
I mean the outfit!

193
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:07,920
Look at the legal secretary
dressed so nicely.

194
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,033
I've a lot of
pretty clothes, too...

195
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:12,953
Mr. Kwon,

196
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:16,786
can't you let me wear
more colors, too?

197
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:18,720
When did I not allow you to
wear colors?

198
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,820
Remember what you said last time?

199
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,886
You were like, "Can you really
call that dressed for work?"

200
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:27,386
That's because you were
dressed rather uncomfortably.

201
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:29,153
Color's never an issue.

202
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:30,586
Really?

203
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,086
Then can I wear pink?

204
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,086
You may.

205
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,266
Yes!

206
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,686
You said you wanted to
study law over this movie,

207
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:42,386
but you could've just
watched it alone, then.

208
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:44,433
Why did you have to
bring me here?

209
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,900
Well, uh...

210
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,553
If I had any questions while
watching this movie,

211
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:56,766
I could just ask you on the spot,
that's why.

212
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,500
For example...

213
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:02,353
Just like now.

214
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:06,953
If your boss makes an issue of
what you wear,

215
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:09,020
can you make an issue of that?

216
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,653
Based on the Labor Standards Act,

217
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:13,220
if there is a business need to
do so,

218
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,086
your employer may
enact a dress code.

219
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,020
However, not without
a valid reason.

220
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,120
Because that would be
violating your rights to

221
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,020
pursue happiness, and
freedom of common action.

222
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,533
Oh, I see.

223
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,720
See?

224
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,920
I wouldn't have had anyone to ask
if I watched it alone.

225
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,220
You're right.

226
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,466
Then ask away,
if you've any more questions.

227
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,700
More questions?

228
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,120
I wasn't trying to hold your hand!

229
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,553
Don't get the wrong idea,

230
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:56,653
I'm not that girl who uses the
excuse of darkness to

231
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:58,853
try and hold your hand.

232
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:02,633
Sure, don't worry.
I won't get the wrong idea.

233
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:08,320
That's right, I've always been
curious about this, too.

234
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,386
Let's say I want to
rest my arm here.

235
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:15,420
But you were already
resting your arm here first.

236
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,520
So for a case like this
in the movies,

237
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,233
who is the rightful owner?

238
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,886
The law cannot
regulate everything.

239
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:26,920
That's why there's the
principle of good faith.

240
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,353
In other words,
we should make concessions

241
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:30,686
and use our good reasoning.

242
00:14:30,766 --> 00:14:32,633
Oh, I see.

243
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:41,366
You really know everything
about law, don't you?

244
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,466
Well, I'm a lawyer.

245
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,733
That's right.

246
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:47,466
You are a lawyer.

247
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:19,800
- Um, excuse me...
- Yes?

248
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:24,533
Oh what?

249
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,720
Just now, I saw some woman

250
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,600
talking to you.

251
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,686
What were you talking about?

252
00:15:39,766 --> 00:15:41,520
Did she ask you for directions?

253
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,166
She asked me not for
directions, but for my number.

254
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:48,520
So did you give her your number?

255
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,000
No, I didn't.

256
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:52,386
But uh...

257
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:55,286
You took a long time to
reject her, didn't you?

258
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:57,720
When I said no, she asked
whether I had a girlfriend,

259
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,886
and when I said I didn't,

260
00:15:58,966 --> 00:16:00,986
she asked me again why I won't
give her my number.

261
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:02,553
So I had to offer
a long explanation to

262
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:03,886
try make her understand that
an absence of a girlfriend

263
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:06,386
does not necessarily mean
I'm willing to

264
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,200
give her my number.

265
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,633
Why are you laughing?

266
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:17,000
I just thought, you have
an iron defense against women.

267
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,786
Why are you looking at me
like that?

268
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,500
I've never seen you
with such a big smile.

269
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:40,720
Why the straight face again?

270
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,086
Smile like just before.

271
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,386
It's nicer when you smile.

272
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:46,200
Come on, please?

273
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:49,233
I'll smile when I want to,
thank you.

274
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:12,320
Thank you for taking me home.

275
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,553
It's nothing.

276
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,000
I'll see you on Monday.

277
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,500
(Raon Drive-in Theater)

278
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,453
Ah, so you saw a movie today!

279
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:36,600
With who?

280
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,853
You don't have to know.

281
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,500
Why? But I want to know.

282
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:47,620
Man, I never thought I'll ever
see you go on a date!

283
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,953
It wasn't a date.

284
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:50,320
Whatever!

285
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,653
You never watch movies,

286
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:53,453
so you going to a theater is
saying something.

287
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:55,720
I said, it's not like that.

288
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,986
We were only studying.

289
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:59,520
What? Study?

290
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,586
My secretary said she wanted to
study law,

291
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,353
so we watched a film
about law together.

292
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:05,566
To study.

293
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:08,433
Do you think that makes sense?

294
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:11,820
Well, do you think
this makes sense,

295
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,820
leeching off me at my place?

296
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,466
Isn't it about time that
you move out?

297
00:18:15,466 --> 00:18:17,553
Fine. We'll just
leave it at this today.

298
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:18,766
Get some rest, then.

299
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,866
Mr. Kwon Jung-rok,

300
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,933
who went to the theater to
study law.

301
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:41,720
Mr. Kwon,

302
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,086
thank you for
all your teaching today.

303
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,766
Good night, then.

304
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,500
(Mr. Kwon Jung-rok)

305
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:00,966
Sweet dreams to you too,
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

306
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,733
You're not getting out?
Hey, I'm going to smash this!

307
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,420
You can talk with me.

308
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,653
I'm her lawyer.

309
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:14,920
What...

310
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,120
Why did he help me back then?

311
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,086
Why? Why?

312
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,666
Because he was worried about me?

313
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:25,420
Well done.

314
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,100
Well done, Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

315
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,920
He could've just
returned the scarf,

316
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,466
so why did he have to
wrap it around my neck? Why?

317
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,720
And what was with that big smile?

318
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,920
Is it because of me?

319
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,233
Oh, my goodness!

320
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:51,500
I mean, come on!
Why did he smile like that?

321
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,366
Good morning, Mr. Kwon.

322
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,153
Mr. Kwon, your suit today is
really stu...

323
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:23,586
Hello, Yoon-seo.

324
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,920
Hi, good morning!

325
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,133
- Good morning.
- Hello.

326
00:20:29,266 --> 00:20:30,453
Oh, Yoon-seo.

327
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,486
The elevator can get crowded
in the morning.

328
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,220
- Will you be okay?
- Sorry?

329
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,486
I'm just worried that
people will recognize you.

330
00:20:37,566 --> 00:20:39,753
What, can you tell?

331
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,366
Of course I can tell. Of co...

332
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:45,020
Or is it just me?

333
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,420
But then again, I would
recognize you in a niqab.

334
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,420
Why?

335
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,100
Because I'm your...

336
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:54,033
...CEO.

337
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,066
Of course.

338
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,520
Do you wait for me every
morning for me or something?

339
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,286
Because it feels like
I always bump into you here.

340
00:21:02,366 --> 00:21:03,920
Right?

341
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,353
We always bump into each other
in the elevator, huh?

342
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,853
I was always
curious about that, too.

343
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,420
I guess that's destiny.

344
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,353
You, Mr. Kwon,

345
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:14,166
and Yoon-seo, too.

346
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,266
Destiny!

347
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:18,520
Right, Yoon-seo?

348
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,200
- Right.
- Right?

349
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:22,400
Excuse me.

350
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,300
Ah, Director Lee Chung-jae.

351
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,033
He's a TV show director!

352
00:21:30,433 --> 00:21:32,020
What, you need one more?

353
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,486
What's this emergency
meeting about?

354
00:21:34,566 --> 00:21:35,753
Well, it's nothing really.

355
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,066
There was an invite from
a TV show.

356
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,633
To me.

357
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:41,920
It was a personal request.

358
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,253
Which TV show?

359
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,620
Well, it's about the
Fourth Industrial Revolution,

360
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,053
and I guess they want
input from a lawyer.

361
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:53,453
But now that I think about it,
it's actually a big burden.

362
00:21:53,533 --> 00:21:54,820
As you all know,

363
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,753
I've no interest in
standing in the spotlight

364
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,453
or becoming famous.
I'm the type who just

365
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:02,320
quietly gives his best
in his given duties.

366
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,153
Right?

367
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:06,486
But then, this director has been
begging me,

368
00:22:06,566 --> 00:22:09,253
and this is a chance to
promote Always.

369
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,786
So I decided to
just make the sacrifice

370
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:14,020
and go on the show.

371
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,700
Hey, you already wrote about it
on your social media.

372
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:21,386
Hello, this is Yeon Jun-gyu
from Always.

373
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:24,353
I'll be participating in
a debate TV show.

374
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:26,586
It's to air on February 15th,
at 9 a.m.,

375
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,033
and I'll see you all there!

376
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:39,386
Anyway, it's a live show
at 9 a.m. tomorrow,

377
00:22:39,466 --> 00:22:41,020
and I just had a call from
the same director.

378
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,653
He says he'd like one more.

379
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:45,220
So, we need one more.

380
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,486
Who do you think should join me?

381
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:47,953
I think

382
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,086
it should be someone
who's not scared to

383
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,086
express his opinions eloquently
on a live show,

384
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,366
and with the looks, too.

385
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,366
So how about Mr. Kwon?

386
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,486
Right? He's our
best choice, right?

387
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:02,386
Then it's decided,

388
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:04,453
you'll join me for the show
tomorrow morning.

389
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:05,986
No, I refuse.

390
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:07,520
I've a lot of work tomorrow.

391
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,020
If this is all there is,
then may I take my leave?

392
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,733
We need to go to Court now,
so get ready.

393
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,233
Sure.

394
00:23:13,966 --> 00:23:15,386
Oh man.

395
00:23:15,466 --> 00:23:17,986
Does he have to be so cold?

396
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:20,953
Why can't he at least
refuse with a smile?

397
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:24,020
It's not one or two days that
he's been like that.

398
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,620
Well...

399
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,286
I'm sure he still shows his smile
to people he want to show it to.

400
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:31,253
And I'm sure he'll smile
when he's really happy.

401
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:32,966
For example, like...

402
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,820
Ah, forget what I said.

403
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,300
Then please excuse me, too.

404
00:23:45,433 --> 00:23:47,220
Anyway, if Mr. Kwon isn't so keen,

405
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,820
then who should go instead?

406
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,520
Any volunteers between you two?

407
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,633
Me!

408
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,253
You both want to go?

409
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,566
Put that hand down.

410
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:01,466
Can you move your car?
You've parked illegally.

411
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:07,420
So the next trial is
in two weeks, is it?

412
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,120
Yes, please re-confirm
the date and place.

413
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,253
Yes, sir!

414
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,333
Kwon Jung-rok!

415
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:14,633
Yeo-reum.

416
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,700
Yeo-reum? Ah, that's right.

417
00:24:19,566 --> 00:24:20,520
You had a trial?

418
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,420
Yes. You're done with yours, too?

419
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,986
Yes. Great timing!

420
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:26,400
How about you join me for
coffee if you're free?

421
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,766
Should I? I can spare
about 30 minutes.

422
00:24:31,633 --> 00:24:33,933
Hello. You must be Ms. Oh.

423
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,620
How do you know me?

424
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,986
I just happened to hear about you.

425
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:40,486
How about you join us for tea?

426
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:41,566
Will that be okay?

427
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:44,820
She's not so comfortable
with crowded...

428
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,453
No, it's alright.

429
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:47,666
I'd like to come, too.

430
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:54,086
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

431
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:55,766
Then I'll leave you to it.

432
00:24:57,266 --> 00:24:59,153
Black for Ms. Oh and I,

433
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:01,333
and for you...
With milk and sugar, right?

434
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,553
That sweet tooth of yours...

435
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:06,186
You won't even drink coffee
unless it's sweet.

436
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:09,786
I don't understand people
who like it bitter.

437
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:11,386
Sweet tooth?

438
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:12,420
You didn't know?

439
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,366
He doesn't drink coffee
without sugar and milk.

440
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:20,353
It's not just coffee.
There's also...

441
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:21,666
That's enough, stop.

442
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,933
Should I, then?

443
00:25:25,766 --> 00:25:28,120
Oh, sorry to bring you here
without asking you first.

444
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,286
This is the only place I know of

445
00:25:30,366 --> 00:25:31,986
where you can chat quietly

446
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:33,400
away from the crowd.

447
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,753
No, it's fine.

448
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:38,566
I'm actually fine with anywhere.

449
00:25:39,066 --> 00:25:40,686
Actually, I know everything.

450
00:25:40,766 --> 00:25:42,120
Including your identity.

451
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,433
You're Oh Yoon-seo, right?

452
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,753
Don't tell me...

453
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:49,020
It wasn't me.

454
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,653
I heard from Mr. Choi Yun-hyuk.

455
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:53,220
I bumped into him
at Court the other day.

456
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,786
I see.

457
00:25:54,866 --> 00:25:56,786
So, how is it
working as a secretary?

458
00:25:56,866 --> 00:25:59,620
I bet it's hard because
Jung-rok's hard to deal with.

459
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,953
- Um...
- How?

460
00:26:01,033 --> 00:26:02,386
How?

461
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:05,286
You’ve no idea
how cold you can be.

462
00:26:05,366 --> 00:26:07,700
Sometimes, I get really fed up.

463
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:10,953
What, I'm like that?

464
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:12,033
Yes!

465
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:18,453
You two must be close.

466
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,700
We were always together
at college.

467
00:26:22,033 --> 00:26:23,300
What, just you two?

468
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:25,233
Three, actually.

469
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:27,720
Three, including Kim Se-won.

470
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,233
Kim Se-won?

471
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:32,020
Let's all meet up sometime.

472
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,700
You can't avoid him forever.

473
00:26:34,566 --> 00:26:35,900
We're both busy.

474
00:26:36,566 --> 00:26:38,453
Hey, we should have
dinner sometime.

475
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:40,553
It's been a long time
since we last did that.

476
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:42,720
Sure, anytime's fine for me.

477
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,300
I'm going to be touched again.

478
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:48,720
Sorry to leave you
out of the conversation.

479
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,233
Actually, you should join us
when we have dinner.

480
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:55,300
Well... I'll see.

481
00:26:58,866 --> 00:27:01,653
Why aren't you wearing
your scarf? Aren't you cold?

482
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:03,433
No, it's not so cold today.

483
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:06,353
I see you don't get
so cold easily.

484
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:08,666
No, that's why I like winter.

485
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:12,166
What, not summer?
(Yeo-reum: "Summer" in Korean)

486
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,986
Pardon?

487
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,100
It's nothing.

488
00:27:16,566 --> 00:27:18,486
As for that spell check
I asked you to do,

489
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:20,086
I'd like it by 5 p.m.

490
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:22,786
No, I'm going to
give it to you at 5:10 p.m.

491
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:24,233
I'm a little tired, you see.

492
00:27:28,266 --> 00:27:29,533
By the way, Mr. Kwon.

493
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,833
Why are you so loose
with your smiles?

494
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,353
That's the first time
anyone's told me such a thing.

495
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:40,353
But didn't you say it's nicer
when I smile?

496
00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:43,186
Well, too much of something
isn't always a good thing.

497
00:27:43,266 --> 00:27:44,253
And besides,

498
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:46,533
I don't think a smile suits you.

499
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,000
I said, stop smiling!

500
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:57,800
What... What's wrong with her?

501
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,620
I really liked that restaurant
you took me to.

502
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,153
I should take my other
colleagues there next time.

503
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:08,553
It won't be a secret find
if you tell just everyone.

504
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:10,133
Maybe you're right.

505
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:13,653
By the way, how is
Prosecutor Kim Se-won?

506
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:14,920
What about him?

507
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,420
He's our branch's idol, isn't he?

508
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,753
There weren't just
one or two women

509
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:22,120
who cried at the news of
his transfer 2 years ago.

510
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,600
By the way, do you think
he has a girlfriend?

511
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,266
No, he broke up with her
two years ago.

512
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,453
How do you know?

513
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:36,253
He and Prosecutor Yu were
pretty famous, didn't you know?

514
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,186
You mean, Yu Yeo-reum?

515
00:28:38,266 --> 00:28:40,520
Yes. They were dating for
about 7 years,

516
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,233
then two years ago,
it ended completely!

517
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:45,666
Why?

518
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:48,300
Who knows.

519
00:28:49,633 --> 00:28:52,966
They say Prosecutor Yu isn't
all that nice, maybe that's why.

520
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:00,233
Prosecutor Yu.

521
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,100
Why do you look so scared?

522
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:07,753
In case I bite,
since I'm not all that nice?

523
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:10,620
I'm sorry.

524
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,720
It's alright, it's true.

525
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,120
By the way, Jung-mi.

526
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,053
- Yes?
- About that restaurant.

527
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:17,153
Take me there next time.

528
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:18,766
We should share the good stuff.

529
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,000
God, I had the
biggest scare in my life.

530
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:47,353
You don’t seem to be
in a good mood.

531
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:48,353
No.

532
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:50,153
So I heard,

533
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:53,986
you went to the same college
as Prosecutor Yu Yeo-reum.

534
00:29:54,066 --> 00:29:55,120
Yep.

535
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,920
And that you were close.

536
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,300
"Were," as in past tense.

537
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:01,933
That's right.

538
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,620
But I intend on fixing that,

539
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,786
to present tense.

540
00:30:05,866 --> 00:30:06,920
But why?

541
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,153
Even if you glue back
a broken dish together,

542
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:11,320
you know it's in vain.

543
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,953
It's just the way I am.

544
00:30:13,033 --> 00:30:15,886
I can't stand seeing

545
00:30:15,966 --> 00:30:17,333
something that's broken
or chipped.

546
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,886
Then...

547
00:30:19,966 --> 00:30:22,166
I guess I'll have to be
like that myself.

548
00:30:22,866 --> 00:30:24,053
What?

549
00:30:24,133 --> 00:30:25,400
It's nothing.

550
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,100
Thank you.

551
00:30:49,366 --> 00:30:52,886
Anyway, what are we going to
do about that TV show?

552
00:30:52,966 --> 00:30:55,620
Since you both want to be on it,
I'm in a real dilemma.

553
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,253
So, what do you think?

554
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,320
Who do you think I should take?

555
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,053
I think Ms. Dan would be good.

556
00:31:01,133 --> 00:31:02,320
Since they have you,
a male lawyer,

557
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,553
maybe they'll like
a female lawyer as well.

558
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:07,586
Well, this isn't the
Family Entertainment,

559
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:10,353
so does gender matter?

560
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:12,886
I think Mr. Choi would be better.

561
00:31:12,966 --> 00:31:15,153
He's good with words,

562
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:18,953
and I think he'll be
less nervous to go on TV.

563
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:20,700
Um, I...

564
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:25,053
I completely agree with Ms. Yang.

565
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,253
I must say,

566
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:28,086
you two have a discerning eye.

567
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:29,320
Wait a second.

568
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,820
So you two think
Choi will be better,

569
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,353
whereas I think Dan is better
since she's more composed.

570
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:37,486
Right? So that's us two
who think Dan is better.

571
00:31:37,566 --> 00:31:39,320
That's two to two.

572
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,820
Eh...

573
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,920
But I still think that Dan is...

574
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,966
Hold on, let me take this call.

575
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,653
Why hello, Prosecutor Park.

576
00:31:48,733 --> 00:31:50,633
I was just about to call you.

577
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,053
Let me do it.

578
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:57,320
I'm sorry,

579
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,086
but I really want to do this, too.

580
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:01,686
I didn't know you would be
interested in going on TV.

581
00:32:01,766 --> 00:32:04,600
I thought you wouldn't be,
since you're an introvert.

582
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,520
Um... It's because my performance
hasn't been good lately,

583
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,500
so I thought this TV show
might be my chance.

584
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,120
- Chance?
- Whatever goes on TV

585
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,020
becomes a real hit, right?

586
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,053
I want to be a hit too, and
be the ace attorney of Always.

587
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:20,953
I'm suffocating whenever
Mr. Yeon nags me

588
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:22,966
about my performance.

589
00:32:24,966 --> 00:32:26,233
Mr. Yeon...

590
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:31,453
I think it's best that you let
Choi have it this time.

591
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,733
What if you suffocate to death,
being with me?

592
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,686
I'm disappointed, Dan.

593
00:32:35,766 --> 00:32:38,600
I didn't know you'd
backstab me like that.

594
00:32:38,966 --> 00:32:40,653
Um, Mr. Yeon?

595
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:42,320
That's not what I meant.

596
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,486
Remember how I voted for you?

597
00:32:44,566 --> 00:32:46,553
Well, I take it back.
I can do that, right?

598
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:48,786
Alright, then what's the
score again?

599
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,786
Three for Choi,
and one vote for Dan.

600
00:32:51,866 --> 00:32:53,520
Let's do this then, Choi.

601
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,133
I respect your
reasonable judgment, sir.

602
00:33:01,433 --> 00:33:02,553
Mom! Mom! Mom!

603
00:33:02,633 --> 00:33:04,233
Hold onto your heart.

604
00:33:05,966 --> 00:33:07,386
I'm going on TV!

605
00:33:07,466 --> 00:33:08,820
It's for a talk show!

606
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,566
Yun-hyuk's so happy.

607
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,653
Mom, why won't you say anything?

608
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:14,820
Are you crying?

609
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,353
Don't cry, Mom.

610
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:18,100
You're making me cry, too.

611
00:33:25,633 --> 00:33:27,286
Yes, Mother.

612
00:33:27,366 --> 00:33:29,000
We'll discuss this further
at home.

613
00:33:30,966 --> 00:33:32,753
You look... Happy.

614
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:34,886
Happy?

615
00:33:34,966 --> 00:33:37,866
Your sorrow is my sorrow.

616
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:58,133
How do you convert this
into a pdf format?

617
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:05,166
He said I should find
everything in here, right?

618
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:13,100
(List of Mr. Kwon Jung-rok's
Acquaintances: Yu Yeo-reum)

619
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,033
Five stars?

620
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,753
What, is this
a mattress rating or something?

621
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:19,366
Well, I guess she's
very important to him.

622
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,620
Aren't you going home?

623
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,166
It's past your working hours.

624
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:32,086
I guess when I go home is
important to you, huh?

625
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:33,986
You've so many things that
are important, huh?

626
00:34:34,066 --> 00:34:35,820
Like important articles,

627
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,653
important person...

628
00:34:38,733 --> 00:34:40,153
- Just what is...
- Then please excuse me,

629
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:41,566
I'm going home as well.

630
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:58,686
I only said it's time to go home
because it is time to go home.

631
00:34:58,766 --> 00:35:00,353
Unbelievable, right?

632
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:02,686
What kind of manners is that,
inviting me,

633
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:04,286
only to talk about something
they know about?

634
00:35:04,366 --> 00:35:05,953
Same with Mr. Kwon.

635
00:35:06,033 --> 00:35:08,320
He's always so cold in the office,

636
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,920
but in front of that
Yu Yeo-reum or whatever,

637
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,900
he's totally defenseless!

638
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,720
He was just so loose,
smiling like that...

639
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,853
Um... Yoon-seo?

640
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:18,553
Right? He's so mean, right?

641
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:20,086
You think so too, right?

642
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,886
No, it's not that.

643
00:35:21,966 --> 00:35:24,500
Let me ask you,
though I doubt it's true, but...

644
00:35:25,933 --> 00:35:27,466
Did you fall for that lawyer?

645
00:35:28,233 --> 00:35:29,386
No way.

646
00:35:29,466 --> 00:35:30,886
What the... Why would I?

647
00:35:30,966 --> 00:35:32,286
I mean, let's be honest.

648
00:35:32,366 --> 00:35:35,586
It didn't occur to me at first
when you first told me

649
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,120
you're seeing him on the weekend
to study with him.

650
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,086
But when I thought about it later,
something wasn't right.

651
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:42,753
Still, I told myself
no way, but...

652
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:45,286
You know, you acting like this
is a bit...

653
00:35:45,366 --> 00:35:47,853
Is a bit, what?

654
00:35:47,933 --> 00:35:49,786
It's like you're jealous.

655
00:35:49,866 --> 00:35:50,866
What?

656
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:52,766
Jealous?

657
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,953
Did I fall for him?

658
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:00,366
Am I jealous?

659
00:36:01,266 --> 00:36:03,633
Why on earth would he
ever think that?

660
00:36:04,966 --> 00:36:06,220
This is not good.
I should watch myself,

661
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,786
in case people get the
wrong idea.

662
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:09,300
Ha! Just unbelievable.

663
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,200
(Morning Korea)

664
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,200
It's starting now, is it?

665
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:21,886
Who cares, even if it is?

666
00:36:21,966 --> 00:36:23,520
Good morning!

667
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,966
- Ah, you're here.
- Hello.

668
00:36:27,433 --> 00:36:29,920
What are you all doing here?

669
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,553
Mr. Yeon and Mr. Choi will be

670
00:36:31,633 --> 00:36:33,286
on that live talk show today.

671
00:36:33,366 --> 00:36:36,266
We're waiting for it to start
so we can watch it.

672
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:40,186
Is Mr. Kwon yet to
come into the office?

673
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:42,753
He always arrives early.

674
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,053
Do you think something happened?

675
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:45,853
Well, who knows?

676
00:36:45,933 --> 00:36:48,553
I'm not so sure
why he isn't in yet.

677
00:36:48,633 --> 00:36:50,553
I mean, it's not like

678
00:36:50,633 --> 00:36:52,953
I observe Mr. Kwon
with a keen interest.

679
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:55,620
But you should.
You're his secretary.

680
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,700
Huh?

681
00:36:57,933 --> 00:37:01,386
Oh, that's right.

682
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:04,666
He said he'll be with a client
so he's coming late today.

683
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,700
It's starting!

684
00:37:09,633 --> 00:37:11,820
Good morning to our viewers.

685
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,120
I'm Han Seok-gyu, your host of
Morning Korea.

686
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,086
Huh? I don't see Mr. Choi.

687
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:20,120
You're right. Where did he go?

688
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,353
Here I am!

689
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:22,920
...on the show today.

690
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,920
Hello.

691
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,300
What happened?

692
00:37:26,033 --> 00:37:27,320
Aren't you supposed to be
on that show?

693
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,220
Mr. Yeon received
a call this morning,

694
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,686
and they said two lawyers out of
a panel of four is too much.

695
00:37:32,766 --> 00:37:35,866
So they wanted just him,
like they said initially.

696
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,320
Enjoy the show, then.

697
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,533
Though I'm sure it's no fun
without me.

698
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:54,786
He was so excited to
go on that show, too.

699
00:37:54,866 --> 00:37:55,786
Too bad.

700
00:37:55,866 --> 00:37:58,353
I'm sure Mr. Yeon would
still do his share.

701
00:37:58,433 --> 00:37:59,853
Then let's hear from Mr. Yeon,

702
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:02,420
representative lawyer of Always.

703
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,253
So Mr. Yeon,

704
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:07,753
I believe lawyers have
something to be concerned about

705
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:09,253
because in the U.S. right now,

706
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,953
AI lawyers are already a thing.

707
00:38:12,033 --> 00:38:14,020
And from my knowledge,

708
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,286
Korea also saw its first
AI lawyer last year.

709
00:38:17,366 --> 00:38:18,686
What are your thoughts on this?

710
00:38:18,766 --> 00:38:22,100
Because I believe this means
many changes for lawyers, too.

711
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:24,733
That's right.

712
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:28,100
- Oh, I see.
- Yes.

713
00:38:29,666 --> 00:38:31,686
- That's right.
- Klaus Schwab,

714
00:38:31,766 --> 00:38:33,420
an advocate of the
4th Industrial Revolution,

715
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,853
has defined it as
a technological revolution

716
00:38:35,933 --> 00:38:37,853
where the physical, digital, and
biological spheres

717
00:38:37,933 --> 00:38:40,186
from the 3rd Industrial Revolution

718
00:38:40,266 --> 00:38:42,586
will fuse together, bringing
rapid transformations in

719
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:45,920
our economic systems
and social structures.

720
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,186
Do you agree, Mr. Yeon?

721
00:38:47,266 --> 00:38:48,566
We'd like to hear your opinions.

722
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,500
Yes, of course.

723
00:38:53,366 --> 00:38:56,586
- Uh...
- That's right.

724
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:57,953
Then shall we hear from
another panelist first?

725
00:38:58,033 --> 00:39:00,120
Yes, sure.

726
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,920
Then let's hear from
Mr. Kim Young-taek...

727
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,453
"Sure," "That's right,"
"Of course."

728
00:39:04,533 --> 00:39:06,186
That's all he said?

729
00:39:06,266 --> 00:39:08,833
He's embarrassing Always.

730
00:39:13,366 --> 00:39:14,986
This is all because of you, Mom.

731
00:39:15,066 --> 00:39:17,286
I told you I'm not having
that seaweed soup.

732
00:39:17,366 --> 00:39:20,820
That's what dropped me out
from that TV show!

733
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,533
You've no idea
how I feel right now.

734
00:39:24,766 --> 00:39:27,033
Yes, Mother. I'll call you back.

735
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:29,820
What is it?

736
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,586
I just wanted to
return this to you.

737
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:32,900
Thank you.

738
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,620
You must be thrilled,

739
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,986
now that I'm not on the show.

740
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:41,553
No!

741
00:39:41,633 --> 00:39:45,153
Your sorrow is my sorrow.

742
00:39:45,233 --> 00:39:47,700
Cheer up, then.

743
00:40:02,766 --> 00:40:03,966
Hello.

744
00:40:05,066 --> 00:40:08,320
Is Mr. Kwon Jung-rok in?

745
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,286
Did you book an appointment?

746
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,420
What's your name?

747
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,966
No, I just wanted to
consult with him.

748
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,733
He seems like
someone who can help me.

749
00:40:19,466 --> 00:40:20,466
Um...

750
00:40:22,866 --> 00:40:24,866
I saw this article, you see.

751
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:27,000
(Infringement of the Right to
Enjoy Peace and Privacy)

752
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,520
He did write this, yes.

753
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,833
- But you first need to...
- I'm Kwon Jung-rok.

754
00:40:37,866 --> 00:40:39,066
How may I help?

755
00:40:46,733 --> 00:40:47,733
Um...

756
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:52,966
The reason
why I'm here today is...

757
00:41:04,266 --> 00:41:05,300
Thank you.

758
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,466
Um, I'm really sorry,

759
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,866
but could I ask your
secretary to stay?

760
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:17,120
Me?

761
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,920
Yes, I still feel a bit unsettled,

762
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,200
so it'll be comforting to have
another woman in here.

763
00:41:26,766 --> 00:41:28,486
Please sit, then.

764
00:41:28,566 --> 00:41:29,600
Then...

765
00:41:31,066 --> 00:41:33,400
Though I'm not sure
if I'll be of help, but...

766
00:41:36,066 --> 00:41:37,333
Thank you.

767
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,733
Once you're ready.

768
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:48,220
I...

769
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,433
I think I'm being
stalked by my ex-boyfriend.

770
00:41:56,066 --> 00:41:59,720
It's so distressing,
but I don't know what to do.

771
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,386
Then I read your article,

772
00:42:02,466 --> 00:42:06,866
and I thought
you might have a solution.

773
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:19,233
Could you please tell me more?

774
00:42:24,066 --> 00:42:26,286
I...

775
00:42:26,366 --> 00:42:28,186
I dated him for about a year.

776
00:42:28,266 --> 00:42:30,200
I wonder which one.

777
00:42:30,566 --> 00:42:31,733
This one's cute.

778
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,520
Wow, what's with the
unexpected present?

779
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,953
It was all good for
the first few months.

780
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:38,953
A humidifier?

781
00:42:39,033 --> 00:42:41,920
I needed this, wow!

782
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,086
- Really?
- He was sweet,

783
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:46,353
- I'm glad to hear it.
- sensitive,

784
00:42:46,433 --> 00:42:47,286
and caring.

785
00:42:47,366 --> 00:42:48,753
I feel like some pasta.

786
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:51,553
I can't believe you got
a reservation here!

787
00:42:51,633 --> 00:42:54,320
I've been craving pasta
since yesterday.

788
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,753
Really?

789
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:58,086
That just shows we click, right?

790
00:42:58,166 --> 00:42:59,820
Yep!

791
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,253
Enjoy, then.

792
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:02,253
Looks delicious!

793
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:04,953
At first, I thought
I'd found my soulmate

794
00:43:05,033 --> 00:43:07,520
and that we just click.

795
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,433
But it turns out...

796
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,933
How about a glass of wine tonight?

797
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,700
What if you pass out
after another glass again?

798
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:22,720
You're so perfect, except for the
fact you can't hold your liquor.

799
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,433
Are you sure it's not that
you're a heavy drinker?

800
00:43:25,866 --> 00:43:26,966
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da!

801
00:43:41,366 --> 00:43:43,286
He'd used the chance to
go through my phone

802
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:46,820
while I was drunk.

803
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,020
He'd snoop though
my search history,

804
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,420
the web sites I visit often,

805
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,966
and even the conversations
with my friends.

806
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,033
That's why I said
let's break up, but...

807
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,786
Ah, you're home.

808
00:44:07,866 --> 00:44:10,120
I was just cooking dinner for you.

809
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,466
But... We broke up.

810
00:44:18,233 --> 00:44:19,366
That again?

811
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:26,833
Hurry up, I'll cook it up
delicious for you.

812
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,120
You should've just
changed your passcode.

813
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,786
I did.

814
00:44:38,866 --> 00:44:40,086
But...

815
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:43,486
He somehow found out, every time.

816
00:44:43,566 --> 00:44:45,820
So, uh...

817
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,453
Can I apply for
a restraining order?

818
00:44:49,533 --> 00:44:51,053
Of course you can.

819
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:52,366
Right, Mr. Kwon?

820
00:44:53,866 --> 00:44:55,486
Well...

821
00:44:55,566 --> 00:44:57,053
The Court may not see that

822
00:44:57,133 --> 00:45:00,353
as sufficient for
a restraining order.

823
00:45:00,433 --> 00:45:02,686
Because the opposing party will

824
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:05,086
probably argue it as
lingering attachment,

825
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:08,020
based on the fact that
there was no verbal

826
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,020
or physical violence.

827
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,586
No way...

828
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:13,753
But violence isn't just
about hitting people.

829
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:15,786
He's watching her every move

830
00:45:15,866 --> 00:45:17,586
and trespassing on her property!

831
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:20,233
So how is it possible that there's
no legal mean to stop that?

832
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,600
But it's true that we need more
circumstantial evidence.

833
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,920
Wait a second. You said
you don't get drunk fast,

834
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,366
but how is it that
you got drunk before him?

835
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,753
He...

836
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:43,400
He drugged me.

837
00:45:45,433 --> 00:45:46,433
What?

838
00:45:48,566 --> 00:45:49,720
Drugs?

839
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,620
I thought it was strange that
I would pass out

840
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,366
every time I had a drink with him,

841
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,486
so I went to see a doctor next day

842
00:45:58,566 --> 00:46:02,200
and they found traces of
sleeping pills in my system.

843
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,700
He drugged me, every time.

844
00:46:36,733 --> 00:46:37,866
Ms. Oh Jin-sim?

845
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:43,366
Ms. Oh Jin-sim!

846
00:46:47,166 --> 00:46:48,166
Yes?

847
00:47:36,966 --> 00:47:39,320
What's the matter, Ms. Yang?

848
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,920
No, what's the matter with you?

849
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,920
Why were you trying to
strangle me?

850
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,666
No, I was only trying to say
wait up.

851
00:47:47,566 --> 00:47:49,000
You scared me.

852
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:52,433
I'm sorry.

853
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,953
Ms. Yang,

854
00:48:04,033 --> 00:48:05,986
take the main street if you can

855
00:48:06,066 --> 00:48:07,553
and not the underpass.

856
00:48:07,633 --> 00:48:10,100
But that's the shortcut, so...

857
00:48:12,366 --> 00:48:13,686
Hey,

858
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,720
it's grass.

859
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,453
Right.

860
00:48:17,533 --> 00:48:19,053
It must be cold since it's winter,

861
00:48:19,133 --> 00:48:21,920
but it's holding out, isn't it?

862
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,953
Just as we're waiting for the bus,

863
00:48:24,033 --> 00:48:26,486
maybe it's waiting for its bus
called spring.

864
00:48:26,566 --> 00:48:28,086
- Bus arriving.
- Ah,

865
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:29,353
it's here.

866
00:48:29,433 --> 00:48:31,753
You're getting on it too, right?

867
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:32,866
Of course.

868
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:30,100
The next stop is...

869
00:49:31,033 --> 00:49:32,100
Ms. Yang.

870
00:49:33,266 --> 00:49:34,400
Ms. Yang.

871
00:49:35,233 --> 00:49:36,833
- It's your stop.
- Oh my.

872
00:49:37,866 --> 00:49:39,386
Thank you, every time.

873
00:49:39,466 --> 00:49:42,033
I would've gone to the final stop
again, if it weren't for you.

874
00:49:44,733 --> 00:49:46,120
Take care, then.

875
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,766
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

876
00:50:11,533 --> 00:50:13,620
Mr. Jung Ji-ho, who has been
charged for

877
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,620
his illegal gambling tours

878
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,986
has been summoned by the
Prosecution tomorrow.

879
00:50:19,066 --> 00:50:21,020
His franchise company,
which is due to

880
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,686
go public soon, has been...

881
00:50:22,766 --> 00:50:24,186
You're home early.

882
00:50:24,266 --> 00:50:26,386
- Ah, welcome back.
- Meanwhile, their individual...

883
00:50:26,466 --> 00:50:27,386
Oh what?

884
00:50:27,466 --> 00:50:29,120
...have stated this case is
irrelevent to their own...

885
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,300
Jung Ji-ho?

886
00:50:31,133 --> 00:50:32,800
However, the listing...

887
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,586
Do you know how much
Choi Yun-su is getting paid to

888
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:37,900
defend Jung Ji-ho?

889
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:41,320
Including incentives,

890
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,986
5 million.

891
00:50:43,066 --> 00:50:46,753
He must be smart,
for a commission like that.

892
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:50,353
Well, he's got a reputation for
helping the rich with their mess.

893
00:50:50,433 --> 00:50:53,253
I heard he was paid big for
the Lee Kang Joon case, too.

894
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:54,333
Lee Kang Joon?

895
00:50:55,133 --> 00:50:56,420
Oh, maybe you don't know.

896
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,753
Lee Kang Joon, as in the
Vice President of Empire Group.

897
00:50:58,833 --> 00:51:02,366
Why, there was that drug scandal
with him and some actress.

898
00:51:03,633 --> 00:51:05,000
Oh Yoon-seo, was she?

899
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,753
- Oh Yoon-seo?
- Yeah.

900
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:10,786
But about that scandal,

901
00:51:10,866 --> 00:51:12,620
I heard it from someone I know,

902
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,953
but apparently Lee Kang Joon had
called Oh Yoon-seo out to

903
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:17,053
a drug party, to make her guilty

904
00:51:17,133 --> 00:51:18,353
as revenge for rejecting him.

905
00:51:18,433 --> 00:51:20,920
He'd been stalking her, too.

906
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,486
But because he's rich
and so high-up,

907
00:51:23,566 --> 00:51:25,366
everyone just kept
their mouths shut.

908
00:51:27,533 --> 00:51:29,020
Oh, that's right.

909
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,566
You were never interested in
gossip like this, huh?

910
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,433
Hey, Kwon Jung-rok!

911
00:51:37,866 --> 00:51:39,353
Yeah?

912
00:51:39,433 --> 00:51:41,000
What are you thinking about?

913
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:43,933
It's nothing.

914
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,586
(Oh Yoon-seo claims she's being
stalked by a chaebol)

915
00:51:58,666 --> 00:52:00,853
(What is the truth?)

916
00:52:00,933 --> 00:52:02,266
(Actress Oh Yoon-seo, Summoned by
Prosecution on Drug Suspicions)

917
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:08,753
You mean the drug scandal?

918
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:10,786
But she tested negative and
was found to be not guilty.

919
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:13,686
About her
relationship with that chaebol.

920
00:52:13,766 --> 00:52:17,300
I mean, it's true that
she was there.

921
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:21,966
He drugged me, every time.

922
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:35,200
What?

923
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,020
What do you mean, you want me
off Seung-hee's case?

924
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,053
Rather than that,

925
00:52:41,133 --> 00:52:44,086
the other traffic accident
case is more urgent,

926
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:47,786
so I'd like you to please
research some similar cases.

927
00:52:47,866 --> 00:52:50,366
But you said that was
due by next week...

928
00:52:53,066 --> 00:52:56,986
Is it because you don't
trust my skills?

929
00:52:57,066 --> 00:52:58,333
You think I won't be
any help, do you?

930
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,286
- It's not that...
- You know,

931
00:53:02,366 --> 00:53:04,320
she trusted me and told her story,

932
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,220
so I want to help her
in whatever way I can.

933
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,220
Besides,

934
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:11,286
the building manager called and
agreed to give us the CCTV clips.

935
00:53:11,366 --> 00:53:13,966
So I'm going to go and
receive them later.

936
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,086
So please,

937
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:20,386
just trust me on this.

938
00:53:20,466 --> 00:53:21,500
Please?

939
00:53:24,633 --> 00:53:27,520
Then I'll take that as a yes.

940
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,666
Alright?

941
00:53:39,433 --> 00:53:42,053
I should've come to the law firm.

942
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:44,366
No, please.

943
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,153
It must be hard for you,

944
00:53:48,233 --> 00:53:49,420
but cheer up.

945
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,933
Mr. Kwon will solve this, somehow.

946
00:53:55,366 --> 00:53:57,633
I hope so, too.

947
00:53:59,466 --> 00:54:01,100
This is the place.

948
00:54:01,666 --> 00:54:02,733
Oh.

949
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:05,853
Then I'll wait here.

950
00:54:05,933 --> 00:54:07,086
You should come in.

951
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:08,566
It's cold out here.

952
00:54:10,066 --> 00:54:11,266
Should I, then?

953
00:54:17,966 --> 00:54:20,400
Hold on, I'll get the USB.

954
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:29,166
The water's...

955
00:54:40,566 --> 00:54:42,033
What is it, Miss Secretary?

956
00:54:44,466 --> 00:54:45,386
Seung-hee.

957
00:54:45,466 --> 00:54:47,553
Can we talk, please?
Please come here.

958
00:54:47,633 --> 00:54:49,586
You know, I thought about this
over and over,

959
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:51,786
but you know... I don't think
I can let you go, ever.

960
00:54:51,866 --> 00:54:53,586
Just be still!
I just want to talk.

961
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:55,553
Seung-hee says she doesn't
want to. So please, stop!

962
00:54:55,633 --> 00:54:56,953
Get out of the way!

963
00:54:57,033 --> 00:54:59,353
You know that I love you, right?

964
00:54:59,433 --> 00:55:00,353
I just love you too much.

965
00:55:00,433 --> 00:55:01,386
I don't think I can ever
break up with you.

966
00:55:01,466 --> 00:55:03,186
It won't take long.
So let's talk, please!

967
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:04,686
Please just stop. Please!

968
00:55:04,766 --> 00:55:05,766
Oh, please!

969
00:55:06,733 --> 00:55:08,086
I told you to
stay still, didn't I?

970
00:55:08,166 --> 00:55:09,200
Why you...!

971
00:55:12,566 --> 00:55:13,600
Who are you?

972
00:55:26,066 --> 00:55:28,066
(Always for the people
Your trusted police)

973
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:43,286
What happened?

974
00:55:43,366 --> 00:55:46,053
Are you sure they don't need me?

975
00:55:46,133 --> 00:55:48,120
No. I was questioned instead

976
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,620
as a witness,
and her attorney, too.

977
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,053
By the way, it turns out
the CCTV in front of her place

978
00:55:53,133 --> 00:55:55,253
had actually been installed by
that man as well.

979
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:57,586
That's how he found out
what her new passcode is

980
00:55:57,666 --> 00:55:59,233
every time she changed it.

981
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,353
He's been called in by
the police for

982
00:56:03,433 --> 00:56:06,486
illegal filming and trespassing,

983
00:56:06,566 --> 00:56:07,920
which means that's more than
enough reason for

984
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,120
a restraining order.

985
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,433
Thank goodness.

986
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:19,253
But how did you come here?

987
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:20,333
Oh.

988
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,420
I just wanted to
check out the site,

989
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,600
and wanted to hear
more about the CCTV.

990
00:56:26,266 --> 00:56:28,986
But all of a sudden,
I heard you scream.

991
00:56:29,066 --> 00:56:30,066
Oh.

992
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,720
Are you alright?

993
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,720
- Sorry?
- About earlier on.

994
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,400
You seem like
you were quite shocked.

995
00:56:38,766 --> 00:56:40,500
I'm alright now.

996
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:44,566
Then it's all been settled,
has it?

997
00:56:45,633 --> 00:56:47,886
As soon as the restraining order
is in place,

998
00:56:47,966 --> 00:56:50,653
he won't ever appear
in front of her, right?

999
00:56:50,733 --> 00:56:53,033
Right. So no need to worry.

1000
00:56:59,966 --> 00:57:01,720
Infringing on
someone else's privacy,

1001
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,053
and enforcing your
feelings on them is

1002
00:57:04,133 --> 00:57:05,666
clearly a fault.

1003
00:57:07,766 --> 00:57:09,920
And I believe the offender
should be the one to suffer,

1004
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,733
not the victim.

1005
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:16,453
So you need to
forget the bad memories

1006
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:18,286
and move on to enjoy your life,

1007
00:57:18,366 --> 00:57:20,153
more so than anybody else.

1008
00:57:20,233 --> 00:57:21,820
For you, and not for anybody else.

1009
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,133
Do you understand me?

1010
00:57:24,666 --> 00:57:27,133
Why this, all of a sudden?

1011
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,753
Uh...

1012
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:33,200
It's nothing.

1013
00:57:38,266 --> 00:57:41,186
Mr. Kwon, you have
a scratch on your neck!

1014
00:57:41,266 --> 00:57:42,466
Oh no.

1015
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,066
I'm really fine.

1016
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:01,420
Well, I'm not.

1017
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,153
In a way, you got
hurt because of me.

1018
00:58:04,233 --> 00:58:06,553
So if you were to leave like that,

1019
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:08,586
I would feel guilty.

1020
00:58:08,666 --> 00:58:10,986
Then I'll do it myself.

1021
00:58:11,066 --> 00:58:12,053
You may not remember,

1022
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:15,120
but I was once the heroine
of a medical drama.

1023
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,086
Have you seen it, by any chance?

1024
00:58:17,166 --> 00:58:18,686
"Emotional Doctors."

1025
00:58:18,766 --> 00:58:20,320
No.

1026
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,653
Of course.

1027
00:58:21,733 --> 00:58:22,820
Anyway,

1028
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,366
I was Korea's best surgeon
in that drama.

1029
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:30,620
Does that have anything to do
with sterilizing and

1030
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,620
dressing wounds?

1031
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,120
Of course.

1032
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,166
Just watch and see how
professional I'm at this.

1033
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,653
Or if it makes you feel
too uncomfortable,

1034
00:59:03,733 --> 00:59:06,466
do you want to apply the
ointment yourself?

1035
00:59:08,166 --> 00:59:09,200
No.

1036
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,100
Please, do it for me.

1037
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:18,900
You said you played a doctor.

1038
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:22,400
Sure.

1039
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,900
(HEIGHTS MANSION)

1040
01:01:23,433 --> 01:01:26,900
Thank you for everything
today, Mr. Kwon.

1041
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:33,720
No, I should say that.
That must've been scary...

1042
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,686
And thank you,

1043
01:01:35,766 --> 01:01:37,033
for saving me.

1044
01:01:47,966 --> 01:01:49,420
Thank you to you, too.

1045
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,886
For dressing my wounds.

1046
01:01:51,966 --> 01:01:53,653
Make sure to apply ointment
on it tomorrow morning,

1047
01:01:53,733 --> 01:01:56,186
so it doesn't fester.

1048
01:01:56,266 --> 01:01:57,753
Do the same at lunch,

1049
01:01:57,833 --> 01:01:59,620
and in the evening, too.

1050
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,386
I'm not saying that because
I'm worried about you,

1051
01:02:01,466 --> 01:02:02,886
but because I feel responsible

1052
01:02:02,966 --> 01:02:04,586
since you got hurt
because of me.

1053
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:05,820
Sure, sure.

1054
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:08,720
I'm a very responsible
person, you see.

1055
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,386
I'll make sure to
dress it regularly,

1056
01:02:11,466 --> 01:02:13,900
so you can stop being upset,
Ms. Responsible Oh Jin-sim.

1057
01:02:19,233 --> 01:02:21,766
Then good night.

1058
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,053
And sweet dreams.

1059
01:02:43,133 --> 01:02:45,433
Sweet dreams to you, too.

1060
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:54,220
(Thank you to Hwang Seung-eon and
Kim Wook for their)

1061
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,166
(special cameo appearance)

1062
01:03:30,133 --> 01:03:31,766
(Touch Your Heart)

1063
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:32,820
Ah, you're here.

1064
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,053
Isn't it pretty?

1065
01:03:34,133 --> 01:03:36,653
But pink is a bit...
We're a law firm...

1066
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:37,920
- Come on, let's go!
- Kwon Jung-rok!

1067
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,053
Come on, hurry up!

1068
01:03:39,133 --> 01:03:41,500
You're so mean, Mr. Kwon.

1069
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,266
I'm here to see you,
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

1070
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,186
For some reason, you were
half-hearted in your duties...

1071
01:03:47,266 --> 01:03:50,420
The reason why I'm mad at you is...

1072
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,486
And it turns out that
you've never been in

1073
01:03:52,566 --> 01:03:53,853
a single relationship.

1074
01:03:53,933 --> 01:03:55,286
Enough, please!

1075
01:03:55,366 --> 01:03:58,220
It feels so nice,
going for a drive.

1076
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,286
We're off to a detention center.
To work.

1077
01:04:00,366 --> 01:04:04,200
Always is about to take on
a huge case!

1078
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,933
You promised, so keep it.
