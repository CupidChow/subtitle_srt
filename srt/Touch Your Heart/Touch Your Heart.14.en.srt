(Touch Your Heart)

2
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:43,500
(Episode 14)

3
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:47,200
Um, please wait!

4
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:11,153
Mr. Kwon Jung-rok?

5
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:12,866
He's not in the office right now.

6
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,386
No, we have nothing to
say about that.

7
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:16,566
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,720
Gosh, it's started again
this morning!

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,320
I hope today doesn't just end at
just answering complaint calls.

10
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,353
Our server is down, too.

11
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:31,553
What if this ends up on the
National Petition webboard?

12
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,386
Gosh, what do we do?

13
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:35,586
Our number of clients has
dropped so much as well.

14
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:39,000
After that happened,
we haven't had any requests.

15
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,886
Here's the schedule for this week.

16
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:01,433
Ah, thank you.

17
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:05,186
Um… Mr. Yeon?

18
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:06,420
- Hmmm?
- Maybe it's time to

19
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,566
reconcile with Mr. Kwon.

20
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:12,120
- What?
- Well, he's accepted it already,

21
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,686
so he can't go back on it now.

22
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,253
And with no one to
turn to for support,

23
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,453
just imagine how hard it must be

24
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:19,400
if you're going to
keep up that attitude.

25
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:21,500
What, you don't think
I'm having a hard time?

26
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:26,053
How do you think I feel,
having to watch this and that?

27
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:29,453
God, I should've known better
about his stubborn nature.

28
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:31,200
Even back then, five years ago…

29
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:33,266
Actually, no.

30
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:35,120
Anyway, it's him who's done wrong,

31
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,353
so he should make the first move,
not me.

32
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:40,300
Why should I give him
the special treatment?

33
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:41,833
Go back to your work.

34
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:04,920
(Is This the Park Su-myung Case,
Or the Lim Yun-hee Case?)

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,066
(Even the Judges Are Confused)

36
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:16,320
What is it?

37
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,066
I had something to say.

38
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:25,786
But your actions seemed to suggest
you'll never talk to me again.

39
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:28,033
So, what is it that
you have to tell me?

40
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,720
What is this?

41
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,933
A letter of apology?

42
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,866
It's a letter of resignation.

43
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,586
What did you just say, Kwon?

44
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:44,766
Resignation letter?

45
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,400
After accepting the
Park Su-myung case,

46
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:51,700
I seem to have become
a great burden to the firm.

47
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,653
My resignation would minimize
damages to the…

48
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:59,420
Oh, so you'll quit?

49
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,700
After you create this mess,
you'll just run, and the end?

50
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,020
Is that what you are
really thinking, Kwon?

51
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,233
Do you think resigning is
the best option?

52
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:12,353
I will finish up on all my
current cases before I leave.

53
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:13,466
Hey!

54
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,633
You can't do this to me.

55
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:20,566
You really can't do this to me,
you know that.

56
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:23,153
I…

57
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:26,853
I never considered you
as just an employee.

58
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,420
You are a friend I treasure and
a colleague whom I trust.

59
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,120
You are more than family to me!

60
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,020
Yet, first you accept a case under
your arbitrary decision,

61
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,800
and next, you hand in
your resignation letter?

62
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,020
But because of me, law firm
has come under fire and

63
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,753
all those phone calls have been
holding everyone up in their work.

64
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,486
Not only that, we've had
no new clients, have we?

65
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:47,986
But despite all this…
I had to accept this case.

66
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:50,420
I may have ruined someone's life,

67
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,233
so it's right I must
set things right again.

68
00:04:57,733 --> 00:05:00,420
That's why I had no other option.

69
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,553
Fine, do what you want.

70
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:02,686
Do what you want!

71
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:04,120
Because I also don't need
someone who is

72
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,620
as irresponsible as you are.

73
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,620
So do what you want!

74
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,620
If you want to defend, defend!

75
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,733
And if you want to resign,
all up to you.

76
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,220
Our defendant is an entrepreneur
and a self-made millionaire,

77
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,353
with a total of $5 million in assets.

78
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:28,953
However, he is refusing
a divorce on paper,

79
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:33,233
because he does not wish to
pay his wife alimony…

80
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,266
…alimony, and…

81
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,833
…and so is refusing divorce…

82
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,886
My wish is to
never see you waiver.

83
00:05:56,966 --> 00:06:01,966
And just like you always have,
I'm sure you'll pull through this.

84
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:19,053
Ah, Mr. Park.

85
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:21,353
I see you're calling back
after I asked for your

86
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:22,220
recommendations for lawyers.

87
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,600
So, how did it go?

88
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:28,220
No, I'm not fussed about winrates.

89
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,820
As long as she or he has
a sense of responsibility,

90
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,386
and doesn't stab you in the back
by producing

91
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:33,300
a resignation letter out of blue.

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,066
Alright.

93
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,353
Mr. Yeon.

94
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:44,186
That's my phone…

95
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:46,266
Yes, yes. I know!

96
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:54,700
What to do about this atmosphere?

97
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:05,620
(D-2 Until Park Su-myung's Appeal)

98
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,333
(Does His Lawyer Have a Plan?)

99
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:25,666
I wonder if he's alright.

100
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:30,966
But I've no one to ask…

101
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,066
Wait, I'm sure I got
his number last time.

102
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:46,400
(Prosecutor Kim Se-won)

103
00:08:00,966 --> 00:08:02,366
(Kim Se-won)

104
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,353
Hello?

105
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:06,353
Hey, where are you?

106
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:07,566
Join me for a drink.

107
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:10,253
No thanks, I'm beat.

108
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,553
To tell you the truth…
Someone wants to see you.

109
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:14,733
And this person says
they can't let you go like this.

110
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:19,200
Just what…

111
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:30,466
Hey, over here.

112
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,233
Come on, don't just stand there.

113
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,366
Just sit already.

114
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,353
I was wondering what was up
when Jun-gyu called me.

115
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:58,420
You're not in
middle school anymore.

116
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,486
Grown-up adults don't fight!

117
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:01,786
Oh, and Jung-rok.

118
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:03,533
I heard you even turned in
your resignation letter.

119
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,053
Fine, I understand that
you decided to leave

120
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:10,553
because you didn't want to be
a burden to the firm.

121
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,853
Still, you should've talked it out
with Jun-gyu first.

122
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:16,186
How could you just shove that
letter of resignation at his face?

123
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:17,753
And from what he told me,

124
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,453
he hasn't said anything wrong!

125
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:21,420
What's so wrong with
his advice of,

126
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,386
"Don't take a chance on
things you're unsure of?"

127
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:25,186
What, can't he say that,
as your boss?

128
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:27,653
Tsk, you narrow-minded bastard.

129
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,620
But then again,
I did say something harsh.

130
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,686
That he'll be branded a lawyer
who takes the Court for a show.

131
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:37,986
Show? That was going too far.

132
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:39,700
You're really brutal, aren't you?

133
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:43,486
Just stop. It's my fault
anyway in the first place,

134
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:45,420
for accepting the case
without asking for his permission.

135
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,853
What, you'd accepted the case

136
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:48,533
without even
seeking his permission?

137
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:52,686
You've no respect for
your boss, do you?

138
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:54,653
Well, I must admit
I was being stubborn.

139
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:57,386
It's not like Kwon has no manners…
It's alright.

140
00:09:57,466 --> 00:10:00,020
What, you knew that about him
and yet you were so stubborn?

141
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,000
Jeez, you're really
uptight, aren't you?

142
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,386
Are you here to help us
patch things up,

143
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:07,420
or to fuel our anger?

144
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,753
Make your stance clear.

145
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,086
Did I…

146
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,400
Did I confuse you?

147
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,053
Anyway, from what I hear,

148
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:18,786
both of you are equally at fault.

149
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:22,486
That's what you call even, right?

150
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:23,633
So drink. Here.

151
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:26,533
Even?

152
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,466
So, anyway…

153
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:32,053
Just make up already.

154
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,166
Go on.

155
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,900
Tsk, please…

156
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:37,466
Oh what?

157
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:39,620
Actually, this won't do.

158
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,886
I'll go ahead first so you two
can talk things out.

159
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:43,986
Hey, come on!
This isn't a blind date.

160
00:10:44,066 --> 00:10:45,453
Right, so stay a little longer.

161
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:46,753
Hey, let go of me.

162
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:47,886
I don't care how this
turns out anymore,

163
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:50,086
you two talk and sort it out.

164
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,266
Anyway, I'm off.

165
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,420
Stay a little longer.

166
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,653
Hey, I said
stay just a little longer!

167
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:57,566
- Oops.
- And he called me out here.

168
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:04,433
I don't know
what's up with that guy.

169
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,600
Ugh, please.

170
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,586
Prosecutor Kim,

171
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:22,486
thank you for taking care of
the rest from last time.

172
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:26,020
I remembered I was
yet to thank you for that.

173
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,366
Anyway, is Mr. Kwon doing okay?

174
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,420
No.

175
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,953
This is too obvious.

176
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,186
Anyone can see that

177
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:45,333
I'm desperate to know
how Mr. Kwon is doing.

178
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:54,020
But I can't ask the people
at the law firm anymore,

179
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,433
because I used that card
too much already…

180
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,233
Kwon.

181
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,433
I mean, Jung-rok.

182
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,133
Don't you know me already?

183
00:12:23,933 --> 00:12:27,786
Did you really think
I would turn against you

184
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:30,286
and kick you out of the firm?

185
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:32,786
Did all that time
we spent together

186
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:35,833
mean nothing to you?

187
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,220
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,586
But it's as you said.

189
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:49,433
You asked me, if I never
considered Always as family.

190
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,320
And you were right in
pointing that out.

191
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,220
Because I…

192
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,600
I've been selfish and tyrannical
from the start to the end.

193
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:05,286
I started this

194
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:08,133
in order to feel better and
be proud of myself,

195
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
so I thought it was right that
I take on all the criticisms alone.

196
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,500
Therefore, the best option
I had before me,

197
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,966
in order not to put any more
burden on you or Always,

198
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,366
was to resign.

199
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,966
I know.

200
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:29,566
I know very well.

201
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,966
I know how you felt
when you made that decision.

202
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:38,386
But you know,

203
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:41,320
I can't see you get hurt anymore.

204
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,286
It's obvious you'll end up hurt
just like five years ago,

205
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:48,386
and yet you want me to
just stand there,

206
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:50,833
watching you walk that path?

207
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:54,733
Jung-rok.

208
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,633
Do you know what the
biggest regret I have in my life is?

209
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,400
It looks like we'll have to
stand on the side of the victims.

210
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:14,830
(Five Years Ago)

211
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,886
All of their claims
turned out to be true.

212
00:14:16,966 --> 00:14:20,686
That disinfectant does
clearly have toxicity.

213
00:14:20,766 --> 00:14:22,786
The research reports that claim
they're not toxic

214
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:27,220
had reached that conclusion
after manipulating the

215
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,520
testing conditions
in favor of Sejong Chemicals.

216
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,666
But what…

217
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:35,586
Still, your client is
Sejong Chemicals.

218
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,133
Is your boss even aware of this?

219
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:42,520
I think

220
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,853
he may also be involved
in the manipulation.

221
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:46,000
Hey.

222
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,133
Don't tell me…

223
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,266
You're not thinking of
disclosing this, are you?

224
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,266
No way. There's just no way.

225
00:14:56,466 --> 00:14:58,720
The number of victims
amount to 250.

226
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,620
Even if I am representing
a corporate this time,

227
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,986
am I not allowed the
tiniest bit of conscience?

228
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:07,420
Hey, Jung-rok. Are you crazy?

229
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,286
Don't even think of
doing the unthinkable.

230
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,786
You know better than anyone else
about what Daehan Law is like.

231
00:15:11,866 --> 00:15:13,120
You…

232
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,866
You want to disclose this?

233
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:19,233
If you do that,
you're finished as a lawyer.

234
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,466
I'm scared, too.

235
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:26,986
But…

236
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:29,553
But if I continue to
pretend I didn't see it,

237
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:33,386
or hear it… Once, then twice…

238
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:34,820
I'm afraid that I'll become

239
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,733
a desensitized monster that
they've become.

240
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,300
And that's what scares me more.

241
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,953
I'm thinking of bringing this up at
the Korean Bar Association to

242
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:53,120
have your license revoked.

243
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,920
"Breaching of
confidentiality obligation."

244
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,786
I think that's enough
reason right there.

245
00:15:56,866 --> 00:16:00,586
Article 2-3 of the
Lawyer Code of Ethics states that

246
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,286
a lawyer must not engage in
activities that

247
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:04,386
undermine their dignity or
harm the public good,

248
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:07,020
both during and outside his duties.

249
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,986
As a lawyer,

250
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:11,700
I'd like to hold onto
my conscience.

251
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,686
Tsk, that Kwon Jung-rok…

252
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:21,620
God, that…

253
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,433
That crazy bastard!

254
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,066
(Law Firm Yeram)

255
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,920
Good morning, sir.

256
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,833
I'm Yeon Jun-gyu, from the
32nd batch of graduates.

257
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,720
He's a very competent lawyer,
and a good man.

258
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,120
So I couldn't just see him become
victimized by Daehan…

259
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,986
Since it's coming from you,
of course I should help.

260
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:51,133
Thank you.

261
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,886
I won't ever forget
what you did for me, sir.

262
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:57,033
Thank you so much.

263
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:01,853
The biggest regret
I hold in my life is

264
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:05,266
not stopping you, five years ago.

265
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,886
Because I saw with
my own two eyes,

266
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:12,366
how you crumbled.

267
00:17:15,566 --> 00:17:17,286
Then…

268
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:19,566
What do you think is the
best thing I did in my life is?

269
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:24,100
Saving you, five years ago.

270
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:31,520
Because that's how you came to
join me at my law firm,

271
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,953
and from then on, we tackled
a lot of difficulties together.

272
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:36,020
And while not much was
said between us,

273
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,000
we came to rely each other a lot.

274
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:41,900
That's who you are to me,

275
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:45,733
so if you resign and leave,

276
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:52,500
what will I have left in my life?

277
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,400
So let's walk down
this path together.

278
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:01,233
I…

279
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,320
I can't see you break down
like this.

280
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,353
So even if it gets tough, let's…

281
00:18:09,433 --> 00:18:13,633
Let's brave it together. Alright?

282
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:10,766
I…

283
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,833
I won't be waivered, anymore.

284
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,586
Do you think things will be
scary once again in the office?

285
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,966
I know right.
It's been so scary lately.

286
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,500
Good morning!

287
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:37,220
- Ah, you're here.
- Ah, Dan. Mr. Lee.

288
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,553
We'll have an urgent meeting
in 5 min, so get ready.

289
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:41,853
- Oh, Pil-ki, go tell Choi.
- Yes, sir.

290
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:44,153
So… Why this urgent meeting?

291
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:45,986
Well, it's to save a life.

292
00:19:46,066 --> 00:19:47,986
Save a life? Whose?

293
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:51,286
Who else? Kwon's, who's become
the nation's most hated lawyer.

294
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:52,353
Nation's most hated lawyer?

295
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:53,653
But it's true, isn't it?

296
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,653
With all the complaint calls
and malicious comments,

297
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:57,420
you are the nation's most hated.

298
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,686
Get ready, then.

299
00:19:58,766 --> 00:19:59,920
Sure.

300
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,166
Then please.

301
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,620
Oh what?

302
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,820
Only just yesterday, it was as if

303
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,253
they never wanted to
see each other again.

304
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,853
Right?

305
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:11,653
What do you think happened that

306
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:14,386
their frozen hearts
melted once again?

307
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:16,186
They probably had a drink
and talked it out.

308
00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:17,853
Let's get ready, then.

309
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:19,033
Cut!

310
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,820
Cut! Alright!

311
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,286
- Thanks everyone.
- Thank you everyone.

312
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:28,286
Thank you, everyone.

313
00:20:28,366 --> 00:20:29,466
Thank you, everyone.

314
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:31,966
- Thank you everyone.
- Good job, Yoon-seo.

315
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:34,153
Thank you, everyone.

316
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,266
Let's go.

317
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,100
Thank you, everyone.

318
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:53,300
Well done.

319
00:20:58,233 --> 00:21:00,766
Well done, Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

320
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:06,720
What is it, Yoon-seo?

321
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,833
Just…

322
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,566
I was just thinking about
Mr. Kwon.

323
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:14,633
This is where we went on
a walk together.

324
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,100
Huh?

325
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,533
Wait here, Hyuk-jun.

326
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,233
Um, excuse me! Prosecutor Kim!

327
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,266
Yoon-seo.

328
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,586
What brings you here?

329
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,686
We're shooting here today.

330
00:21:41,766 --> 00:21:44,000
Who knew I would
bump into you here like this?

331
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:48,920
Because I've been wanting to
contact you.

332
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,286
Me?

333
00:21:50,366 --> 00:21:51,486
About what?

334
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:52,933
Well, uh…

335
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:55,653
Last time, uh…

336
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:57,853
You dealt with that
stalking incident for me,

337
00:21:57,933 --> 00:21:59,953
and I wanted to say thank you.

338
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:02,366
Oh, that!

339
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,966
And, uh…

340
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:07,520
Just be honest.

341
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,020
You want to ask about
Jung-rok, don't you?

342
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,266
You're as sharp as always.

343
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:21,120
So… How is Mr. Kwon doing?

344
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,820
The media didn't seem to
be on his side.

345
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,286
Is he alright?

346
00:22:25,366 --> 00:22:26,600
Of course not.

347
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:31,320
Jung-rok hasn't been eating well
ever since he accepted the case,

348
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,800
and I'm worried he may
collapse at this rate.

349
00:22:36,366 --> 00:22:38,600
Yoon-seo, we should get going.

350
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:42,300
Otherwise you'll be late for
your next schedule.

351
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:47,486
Um… I should get going.

352
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:48,633
Sure.

353
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,486
Please take good care of…

354
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:54,133
…Mr. Kwon.

355
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,753
Maybe I shouldn't have said it.

356
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,666
It seems to have
bothered her greatly.

357
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:12,033
But then again, that was
exactly the reason why I said it.

358
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,920
This is Ms. Lim Yun-hee,

359
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,320
who was charged for
murdering her husband

360
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,786
on January 21, 2019,

361
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:21,700
by stabbing him twice with a knife
when he started to beat her.

362
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:27,953
The Prosecution found it
suspicious that

363
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:30,220
Ms. Lim's father was
missing long-term,

364
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,033
and that her ex-husband had
also perished in fire.

365
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,753
Because straight after
their death was legally recognized,

366
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,320
Ms. Lim received
a huge life insurance payout

367
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,966
under their names.

368
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:44,053
The Court ruled 20 years of
imprisonment for Mr. Park,

369
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:46,353
and released Ms. Lim on bail.

370
00:23:46,433 --> 00:23:47,686
And as of current, Ms. Lim's
whereabouts are unknown

371
00:23:47,766 --> 00:23:51,920
after claiming only a portion of
the $4.93 million payout,

372
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,453
or $2.73 million, to be exact.

373
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:55,086
Her whereabouts are unknown?

374
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:57,686
Was she in a hurry? Why not wait
for the rest to come in?

375
00:23:57,766 --> 00:23:59,586
Something is fishy, yes.

376
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:00,986
And right at this timing,
Park Su-myung has

377
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,386
made a new claim.

378
00:24:02,466 --> 00:24:04,153
That he'd only stabbed him once.

379
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:07,653
If what he said were true
and he had only stabbed him once,

380
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:09,453
then that means the
true murderer may be out there,

381
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:10,953
or he had an accomplice.

382
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,933
Do you have any evidence to
support that?

383
00:24:13,966 --> 00:24:15,920
While tracking Ms. Lim,

384
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,053
we secured evidence that
she had been unaccompanied by

385
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:21,033
an unidentified man to
receive the insurance payout.

386
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,020
But her records show that
she has no other family.

387
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,533
What, already?

388
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:29,853
But it hasn't been that long
since her husband died.

389
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:31,453
Or…!

390
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:34,286
Their relationship could have
started long before the murder.

391
00:24:34,366 --> 00:24:37,286
Because as you all know,
I'm quite an expert when

392
00:24:37,366 --> 00:24:40,186
it comes down to ugly love affairs
and divorce cases.

393
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:41,953
And my instincts are telling me,

394
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:43,120
it's her lover.

395
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,300
Hold on.

396
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,686
You said Lim's ex-husband also
perished in fire 5 years ago.

397
00:24:48,766 --> 00:24:51,620
Then we have reason to suspect
that this too, was the work of

398
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,786
Lim and her lover.

399
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:57,953
They're still suspicions.

400
00:24:58,033 --> 00:25:00,653
I think the first thing
on our list is to

401
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:01,653
identify the man in that
security camera footage.

402
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,853
Alright. Then Mr. Lee,

403
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:06,553
please track down where Lim
headed after she was released.

404
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:10,753
Please also search all the security
cameras in the vicinity,

405
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:14,620
because there has to be a footage
of them, together somewhere.

406
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,886
Yes, sir.

407
00:25:15,966 --> 00:25:17,886
By the way, Mr. Yeon.

408
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:20,866
I haven't seen this charismatic
side of yours for a long time!

409
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:22,586
I must agree.

410
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:24,220
I'd temporarily forgotten,

411
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,553
that you're a lawyer, too.

412
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:27,633
Lawyer Yeon.

413
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,086
Cut it with that.

414
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:32,253
Yeon…

415
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:33,520
Hey.

416
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,066
Do you know why I took out a loan
and started my own office?

417
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,420
"Prosecutor Yeon,"
"Judge Yeon." Sounds so natural.

418
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,686
But what happens when
that's replaced with, "lawyer?"

419
00:25:41,766 --> 00:25:42,953
Lawyer Yeon…

420
00:25:43,033 --> 00:25:44,286
What the hell?

421
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:46,053
It sounds like a swear word,
and I hate vulgar words.

422
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:49,633
That's why, I became the
Representing Lawyer instead.

423
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,566
- Lawyer Yeon…
- Hey!

424
00:25:54,866 --> 00:25:56,653
Alright, if you happen to
think of something,

425
00:25:56,733 --> 00:25:58,520
let's have a meeting again
and talk about it.

426
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,753
Sure.

427
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:00,753
Good job, team.

428
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:02,253
Um, Mr. Kwon?

429
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:03,386
If there's anything I can
help you with,

430
00:26:03,466 --> 00:26:04,686
don't hesitate to tell me.

431
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:06,600
Alright, thank you.

432
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:09,553
At times like these, it would be
good for him to

433
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:10,686
have his own personal assistant.

434
00:26:10,766 --> 00:26:12,320
Should I find
a secretary for him, then?

435
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,986
But Ms. Hwang will be back from
her maternity leave in 3 months,

436
00:26:15,066 --> 00:26:17,520
so the timing isn't so right.

437
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,066
You're right. Then…

438
00:26:19,633 --> 00:26:22,420
Why don't we take
one of the interns, and…

439
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,620
I… I am here! Pil-ki is here!

440
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,486
I can do better than Jong-hwa.

441
00:26:26,566 --> 00:26:28,153
So please give me a chance!

442
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:30,386
This is a golden chance that
won't come again,

443
00:26:30,466 --> 00:26:32,520
and I don't want to miss it.

444
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,920
Sure, then you do it.

445
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,486
That means we had one applicant
for that one vacancy,

446
00:26:36,566 --> 00:26:38,020
and you beat some
hard competition.

447
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,153
Congratulations to you.

448
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:40,453
Anyway, let's make
preparations, then.

449
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:41,666
Yes, sir.

450
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,620
I was searching up some
relevant case examples.

451
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,153
In case they might help.

452
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:11,220
Who knows?

453
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,666
I might catch something that
you may miss.

454
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,400
Hmm… I'd like to help, somehow.

455
00:27:23,366 --> 00:27:24,433
Yes?

456
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,953
From today onward,

457
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:31,520
Pil-ki here will
support you in your work.

458
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,720
He'll be your personal assistant.

459
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,220
I, Kim Pil-ki,

460
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,820
vow to become an ace intern

461
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,786
so as not to shame you sir,
who is an ace attorney.

462
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,433
I'll be in your care, then.

463
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:43,520
I know he tends to overexaggerate,
but he's a diligent guy.

464
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,220
- I'll leave you to it, then.
- Yes, sir.

465
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,300
Sure.

466
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:49,953
Mr. Kwon, what would you
like me to do from now on?

467
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:51,286
If you want me to
research case examples,

468
00:27:51,366 --> 00:27:54,833
I will do so until
I pull a ligament.

469
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,686
Oh, sure. Then please look up
some case examples for me.

470
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:04,166
Yes, sir.

471
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,753
Mr. Kwon, would you like help?

472
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:10,186
No…

473
00:28:10,266 --> 00:28:11,566
Alright, then.

474
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:29,220
Where are you off to, Mr. Kwon?

475
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,986
I'm off to the Archives.

476
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:32,353
There's a reference I need.

477
00:28:32,433 --> 00:28:34,320
Alright, then. Let me escort you.

478
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,186
No, that's alright.

479
00:28:36,266 --> 00:28:39,253
Just take notes down
if there are any calls.

480
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:41,720
And there should be a diary
inside that desk.

481
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,420
You'll find your duties
listed in there.

482
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,420
Yes, sir.

483
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,186
Oh, and Mr. Kwon.

484
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,886
It'll be lunch soon, so…

485
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:50,720
Would you like me to
grab something for you?

486
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,586
It's alright,
I'll take care of myself.

487
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:54,220
- Then.
- Alright.

488
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,366
Goodbye, sir.

489
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:05,520
Even though he's been
driven to a corner,

490
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,233
a lion's still a lion.

491
00:29:08,366 --> 00:29:11,820
I'm going to observe with
my own two eyes,

492
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,553
just how he overcomes
this great trial.

493
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:15,286
I'm going to suck up
everything like a sponge,

494
00:29:15,366 --> 00:29:17,533
and learn all that I can,
from him!

495
00:29:19,266 --> 00:29:20,466
Oh, that's right. Diary…

496
00:29:24,366 --> 00:29:25,366
Huh?

497
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,300
Isn't this Ms. Oh's?

498
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:41,153
Jung-rok hasn't been eating well
ever since he accepted the case,

499
00:29:41,233 --> 00:29:43,466
and I'm worried he may
collapse at this rate.

500
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,500
Why are you sighing?

501
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,220
Having trouble learning the lines?

502
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,520
Yes.

503
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,886
I'm just a bit tired.

504
00:29:55,966 --> 00:29:57,620
It is hard, isn't it?

505
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,586
But you'll be done for the day
with this next scene,

506
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,500
so let's hurry up and go home.

507
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,366
Alright.

508
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,753
Huh?

509
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,333
This is the office number.

510
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,933
Hello? This is Oh Yoon-seo.

511
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:19,166
Ah, Pil-ki.

512
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:21,986
Did you need to
talk to me about something?

513
00:30:22,066 --> 00:30:24,386
Well, the thing is…
I'll be supporting Mr. Kwon

514
00:30:24,466 --> 00:30:28,386
from today onward.

515
00:30:28,466 --> 00:30:31,086
So I'm at your old desk right now,

516
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:36,020
and happened to discover
the pen you left behind.

517
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,720
Um, if it's alright with you,

518
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,700
may I keep this pen as a keepsake?

519
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,800
Sure, do that.

520
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,500
Um, hold on.

521
00:30:57,366 --> 00:30:58,786
Yes, Mr. Lee.

522
00:30:58,866 --> 00:31:00,153
Um…

523
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:03,120
We did some legwork using the
security camera footage,

524
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,766
but to no avail.

525
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,166
Alright, I see.

526
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:20,353
Welcome back, Mr. Kwon.

527
00:31:20,433 --> 00:31:21,500
Yes, well…

528
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,720
Any important calls
while I was out?

529
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,553
No, no important calls.

530
00:31:26,633 --> 00:31:29,933
But you do have a VIP guest.

531
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,386
Um…

532
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:35,386
I found Ms. Oh's pen
in the drawers.

533
00:31:35,466 --> 00:31:37,720
So I contacted her,

534
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,900
and she came to pick it up.

535
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,853
I said I could send it
to her by post,

536
00:31:44,933 --> 00:31:47,453
but she said it was
really important to her,

537
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:49,086
and that she'll have to
come in person to pick it up.

538
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:52,333
And so here she is now.

539
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,486
Well, Mr. Yeon called for me,

540
00:31:57,566 --> 00:31:59,966
so I better go and see him.

541
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:27,420
Well, uh…

542
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,866
I came to pick up my pen,

543
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:33,666
but thought I should say hello
before I left.

544
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:46,620
Those are the files
I left for you.

545
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,986
Yes.

546
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,286
I know.

547
00:32:49,366 --> 00:32:52,086
What, you knew,

548
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:54,400
and you never called to
say thank you?

549
00:32:55,733 --> 00:32:58,933
You should've said thanks
if you've received it.

550
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,886
I want my compensation.

551
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:06,953
I gave you such useful data,

552
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:09,920
so you should reciprocate
my efforts.

553
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,986
Article 734 of the
Civil Act states,

554
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:15,553
"A person who manages affairs
on behalf of another without

555
00:33:15,633 --> 00:33:16,953
being bound to do so has
the right to seek compensation for

556
00:33:17,033 --> 00:33:18,266
the costs incurred."

557
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:22,520
Don't tell me you don't know.

558
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,353
So anyway,

559
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:26,820
as my compensation…

560
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,033
Treat me to lunch or dinner.

561
00:33:31,033 --> 00:33:32,133
Or…

562
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,733
Should I treat you instead?

563
00:33:37,033 --> 00:33:39,486
But then again, that was
something you didn't really

564
00:33:39,566 --> 00:33:42,620
ask me to do, and
I guess it could be a burden.

565
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,566
As my apology, let me treat you.

566
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:50,020
What should we have, then?

567
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,066
Pick something that's healthy.

568
00:33:53,266 --> 00:33:54,433
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

569
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:57,733
Have you forgotten that…

570
00:33:59,366 --> 00:34:01,500
…we broke up?

571
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,533
How can I forget?

572
00:34:12,766 --> 00:34:15,766
Of course I know. But…

573
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,520
But I'm worried about you.

574
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,686
It's been so hard for you
these days, hasn't it?

575
00:34:26,766 --> 00:34:30,366
I saw the news, and
it really hurt my heart.

576
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:37,900
You'd be there for me,
when I was having a hard time,

577
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:45,000
but I can't, can I?

578
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,133
Because we're not in that
kind of relationship anymore.

579
00:34:57,066 --> 00:34:58,853
Still, I came.

580
00:34:58,933 --> 00:35:01,120
'What if he hates it?'
'What if I end up troubling him?'

581
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,886
I asked myself,
but still, I'm here.

582
00:35:05,966 --> 00:35:08,000
Because I wanted to
have lunch or dinner with you.

583
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:15,653
Because I was worried
you'd collapse from overwork.

584
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:19,033
You don't need to worry about
such a thing.

585
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:24,453
- Pardon?
- Because as you said,

586
00:35:24,533 --> 00:35:26,833
we're not in that kind of
relationship anymore.

587
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:34,953
- Mr. Kwon…
- So instead of worrying about me,

588
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:38,400
I hope you'll put all your efforts
into your given duties.

589
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,766
Try to forget about
all that happened here.

590
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,420
Oh what? You were at home,
so why didn't you get the door?

591
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,286
Yoon-seo, I bought some
health supplements that are

592
00:37:11,366 --> 00:37:12,886
supposed to be
good for your health,

593
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:15,233
and also abalone porridge,
which are even better!

594
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,453
What is it?

595
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:19,966
Did something happen?

596
00:37:21,066 --> 00:37:23,720
All the notes were gone.

597
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,053
- Huh?
- I was told that

598
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:28,533
Mr. Kwon is having
a hard time these days.

599
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,953
So I went to see him
because I was so worried,

600
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:39,833
but he didn't look at me
with that warm gaze anymore.

601
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,466
And all those notes that
we had exchanged…

602
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:48,266
He'd taken them all off.

603
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,853
I guess…

604
00:37:54,933 --> 00:37:57,400
…he's really over me now.

605
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,533
But what about me?

606
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:19,820
So… Why did Yoon-seo say
she came here?

607
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,386
Oh, she left a pen behind
and came to pick it up.

608
00:38:23,466 --> 00:38:25,986
She's so busy, yet she came
all this way for a pen?

609
00:38:26,066 --> 00:38:28,733
I guess that pen must be
really important to her.

610
00:38:29,866 --> 00:38:31,966
I think I understand her.

611
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:35,186
Everyone has things that are
special to them,

612
00:38:35,266 --> 00:38:37,486
even if they may be
worthless to other people.

613
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:39,953
For example,

614
00:38:40,033 --> 00:38:43,633
I have this leaf bookmark

615
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:46,366
which I picked up on my way to
my grandmother's house.

616
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,020
If I were to lose it,

617
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,133
I think I would be overcome by
extreme sadness.

618
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,766
Mr. Kwon.

619
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:29,653
We did manage to obtain
additional footage,

620
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:31,286
but still, there was
nothing that's noteworthy.

621
00:39:31,366 --> 00:39:33,420
But I did ask some people that
I know from my days

622
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,233
as a detective to
look into it a bit more.

623
00:39:38,966 --> 00:39:40,953
What is it?

624
00:39:41,033 --> 00:39:43,853
Something's not quite right
about these articles.

625
00:39:43,933 --> 00:39:45,000
What is it?

626
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,886
The blood splattered everywhere,

627
00:39:47,966 --> 00:39:49,633
for the wall to be
stained like this,

628
00:39:51,366 --> 00:39:55,166
but why is Mr. Park's
jacket so clean?

629
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,933
(Court)

630
00:40:03,266 --> 00:40:04,653
The jacket you see on the screen

631
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:07,853
was the jacket worn by
my client during his crime.

632
00:40:07,933 --> 00:40:10,253
Forensic testing has found
traces of the victim's blood

633
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:12,120
on the sleeve,

634
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,586
and this may be evidence that

635
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:17,366
my client stabbed Kim Hyung-tae,

636
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,200
and at the same time,
only stabbed him just once.

637
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:29,386
The wound that proved fatal is

638
00:40:29,466 --> 00:40:31,853
the second on the victim's chest.

639
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:35,220
The second stab tore the
artery to the heart,

640
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,800
and the victim died from
excessive hemorrhage.

641
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,586
As you can see from the
photo of the crime scene,

642
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:44,066
the walls and the floor are
covered with blood.

643
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,720
This is because as soon as
the killer pulled out the knife,

644
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,720
blood splattered everywhere,
like a leaking pipe.

645
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,720
And it is hard to understand that
in such a situation,

646
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,520
only a trace amount of blood
was detected on my client's

647
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,433
jacket, when he is supposedly
responsible for the fatal stab.

648
00:40:57,633 --> 00:41:00,120
Moreover, Ms. Lim Yun-hee,
who was released on bail

649
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,353
has recently gone dark
after collecting only $2.73 million

650
00:41:03,433 --> 00:41:06,966
of the $4.93 million that
she is entitled to.

651
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,953
What could be the reason
she went into hiding,

652
00:41:11,033 --> 00:41:13,700
even giving up on
what amounts to over $2 million?

653
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:18,020
Can we still argue that

654
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,086
the Prosecution has
put forward enough evidence to

655
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:21,853
support their claims that
they have no reason to

656
00:41:21,933 --> 00:41:23,766
doubt that Mr. Park Su-myung is
the true murderer?

657
00:41:25,766 --> 00:41:28,600
(Judge)

658
00:41:27,933 --> 00:41:30,100
Counsel, you may defend.

659
00:41:35,233 --> 00:41:37,900
Your Honor, I would like to
call a witness to the stand.

660
00:41:38,233 --> 00:41:40,233
She is the only witness of
the crime,

661
00:41:50,733 --> 00:41:52,900
- Ms. Lim Yun-hee.
- Yun-hee!

662
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:00,366
Yun-hee!

663
00:42:05,966 --> 00:42:07,166
(Witness)

664
00:42:10,766 --> 00:42:11,800
Ms. Lim.

665
00:42:13,266 --> 00:42:16,466
May I ask why you had
cut off all contact all this time?

666
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:21,653
After I was released on bail,

667
00:42:21,733 --> 00:42:23,766
I went on a trip to clear my head.

668
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:27,286
I see.

669
00:42:27,366 --> 00:42:30,353
Then let me ask you, Ms. Lim,
who was once the suspect,

670
00:42:30,433 --> 00:42:33,553
and now the sole witness of
this murder case.

671
00:42:33,633 --> 00:42:35,153
Who is the culprit that
killed the victim,

672
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:38,366
by stabbing him twice?

673
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:45,766
Yun-hee! Yun-hee!

674
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,700
Su-myung…

675
00:42:51,066 --> 00:42:52,733
I'm sorry, Su-myung.

676
00:42:53,966 --> 00:42:56,820
Yun-hee, don't cry. Don't cry!

677
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,500
Yun-hee, don't cry.

678
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:02,220
Ms. Lim.

679
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,886
Let me ask you again.

680
00:43:03,966 --> 00:43:06,820
Was it Mr. Park Su-myung,
who is sitting over there,

681
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,033
that murdered your husband by
stabbing him once

682
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:14,566
in the abdomen, and
then in the chest?

683
00:43:17,633 --> 00:43:20,500
Yes, it was.

684
00:43:24,933 --> 00:43:26,100
I rest my case.

685
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,733
Yun-hee.

686
00:43:51,933 --> 00:43:53,853
- Ms. Lim!
- Mr. Kwon.

687
00:43:53,933 --> 00:43:55,653
You claimed Ms. Lim Yun-hee
had gone into hiding.

688
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:57,020
So what do you have to say
about how she was

689
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:57,986
present in court today to
stand as witness?

690
00:43:58,066 --> 00:44:00,353
Do you truly believe the true
murderer is out there?

691
00:44:00,433 --> 00:44:03,533
Many have criticized you for
choosing to defend Mr. Park…

692
00:44:05,466 --> 00:44:06,633
How did it go?

693
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,486
How do you think it went?

694
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:11,233
I knocked him out.

695
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,653
Thank God we got in touch with
Lim Yun-hee just before the trial.

696
00:44:15,733 --> 00:44:17,533
Otherwise it may have been
a close one.

697
00:44:18,266 --> 00:44:19,333
By the way,

698
00:44:21,066 --> 00:44:23,720
how were you suddenly able to
get in touch with her?

699
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,153
Well… She called us first.

700
00:44:26,233 --> 00:44:27,766
Saying she wanted to
stand as witness.

701
00:44:32,666 --> 00:44:34,186
(Lim Yun-hee Stands As Witness
for the Park Murder Case)

702
00:44:33,633 --> 00:44:35,220
What happened here?

703
00:44:34,266 --> 00:44:35,566
(Amid Controversy)

704
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,153
Kwon said he secured hard evidence
so this isn't what I expected.

705
00:44:38,233 --> 00:44:40,920
Right. I never expected
Lim Yun-hee to

706
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,320
turn up at the trial.

707
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,120
What do you think happened?

708
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,186
Is Lim Yun-hee
innocent, after all?

709
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,620
She probably appeared in Court
because she has nothing to hide.

710
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,620
Oh, who knows.

711
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,186
But the conclusion is,

712
00:44:51,266 --> 00:44:54,000
more people are criticizing
Mr. Kwon as a result.

713
00:45:05,233 --> 00:45:08,020
Gosh, Yoon-seo. Stop reading it.

714
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,233
It'll only make you feel worse.

715
00:45:28,933 --> 00:45:31,553
You know, I can't do this anymore.

716
00:45:31,633 --> 00:45:33,586
Yoon-seo? Actually…

717
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:37,420
Before that,
slap me hard right here.

718
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,253
Oh what? What's this about?

719
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:41,153
I mean it.
I deserve to be slapped.

720
00:45:41,233 --> 00:45:42,753
Because I…

721
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:45,353
I did something that
you'll hate me for.

722
00:45:45,433 --> 00:45:47,133
To tell you the truth,
Mr. Kwon, he…

723
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,666
He didn't break up with you
because he doesn't love you.

724
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,653
Yes, Mr. Lee.

725
00:46:12,733 --> 00:46:14,533
I got hold of the security camera.

726
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,153
It's near the bank where
she withdrew the money.

727
00:46:22,233 --> 00:46:25,420
February 27th, 3 p.m…
It's that day alright.

728
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,153
This is the one with the
best resolution,

729
00:46:28,233 --> 00:46:31,500
but it'll still be difficult to
make out his face.

730
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,933
What is it?

731
00:46:45,233 --> 00:46:47,153
We don't have anything with
a clear shot of his face.

732
00:46:47,233 --> 00:46:48,466
But take a look at this.

733
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:52,520
Do you think we can obtain
fingerprint samples?

734
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,120
From what I see here,
I think it might be possible.

735
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,433
That should do.

736
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:04,553
He…

737
00:47:04,633 --> 00:47:06,433
He didn't leave you
because he doesn’t love you,

738
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:11,066
but because
he loves you too much.

739
00:47:14,233 --> 00:47:15,233
Let's…

740
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,653
…break up.

741
00:47:21,733 --> 00:47:23,686
Did you feel betrayed,
now that you thought about it?

742
00:47:23,766 --> 00:47:29,120
Or you felt burdened by
all this unwanted attention?

743
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,053
It's because of all the
reasons you mentioned,

744
00:47:32,133 --> 00:47:35,586
that I decided it was too much for
me to continue our relationship.

745
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:40,666
So I think it's best that
we leave it here.

746
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,133
Those weren't the reasons.

747
00:48:20,033 --> 00:48:21,986
On your way to work, Mr. Kwon?

748
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:23,720
- Why are you…
- I, uh…

749
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,820
…packed lunch for you.

750
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:26,900
Here.

751
00:48:28,466 --> 00:48:29,766
Enjoy your lunch,

752
00:48:31,966 --> 00:48:33,633
and don't skip your meals.

753
00:48:36,466 --> 00:48:37,886
Ms. Oh Jin-sim…

754
00:48:37,966 --> 00:48:40,286
Oh, it's time for my shoot.
I should get going.

755
00:48:40,366 --> 00:48:43,933
Eat that, cheer up,
and strike back!

756
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:48,033
You need to eat
everything, alright?

757
00:49:06,233 --> 00:49:09,253
Mr. Kwon, would you like to
have dinner with me?

758
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:12,053
I looked up this restaurant
that's usually empty,

759
00:49:12,133 --> 00:49:13,166
so let's go.

760
00:49:21,533 --> 00:49:23,020
Why are you doing this?

761
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,866
If you continue to pop up
everywhere like this,

762
00:49:27,166 --> 00:49:29,120
someone may get our photo and
it may result in another scandal.

763
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,653
As I told you,

764
00:49:30,733 --> 00:49:31,986
forget about
all that happened, and…

765
00:49:32,066 --> 00:49:33,400
I don't want to.

766
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:38,920
It's me who chooses
whether to forget or not.

767
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,653
I'm going to do what I want
and not forget about you.

768
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:44,266
I'm going to keep missing you,

769
00:49:45,866 --> 00:49:47,453
and I'm going to come see you

770
00:49:47,533 --> 00:49:50,666
when I do miss you or
are worried about you.

771
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,400
Su-myung…

772
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,433
It's hard, isn't it?

773
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:17,420
I'm sorry, Su-myung.

774
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:21,153
Yun-hee, don't cry.
Yun-hee, don't cry! Don't cry!

775
00:50:21,233 --> 00:50:25,300
You ended up here
while trying to save me…

776
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:32,766
Su-myung,

777
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,753
do you remember that night
when you came to my place?

778
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:40,220
I stabbed him, yes!

779
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,133
That's how I saved you.
Because I stabbed him!

780
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,933
That's right.

781
00:50:45,966 --> 00:50:48,120
You saved me back then.

782
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,486
But Su-myung…

783
00:50:49,566 --> 00:50:52,153
Are you sure you don't remember

784
00:50:52,233 --> 00:50:54,853
stabbing him twice?

785
00:50:54,933 --> 00:50:56,520
No, Yun-hee.

786
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,853
Yun-hee, I only stabbed him once.

787
00:50:58,933 --> 00:51:01,400
Yun-hee, I only stabbed him once!

788
00:51:06,566 --> 00:51:07,600
No,

789
00:51:08,966 --> 00:51:10,733
you stabbed him twice.

790
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,933
You're the one
who killed that bastard.

(Yeo-reum)

792
00:51:30,466 --> 00:51:31,486
Hey, Yeo-reum.

793
00:51:31,566 --> 00:51:33,800
We got his identity
from his fingerprint.

794
00:51:34,866 --> 00:51:36,253
But something's not right.

795
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:38,853
He's supposed to be dead.

796
00:51:38,933 --> 00:51:39,966
What?

797
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,666
Fingerprint of a dead person?

(Fingerprint Scanning Report)

Choi Sang-ho.

800
00:51:45,866 --> 00:51:48,333
He has three offences for violence
and one for fraud.

801
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,533
Choi Sang-ho…?

00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,700
- But he's…
- That's right.

803
00:51:55,433 --> 00:51:57,266
He's Lim Yun-hee's ex-husband.

804
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,033
(Fingerprint Scanning Report)

805
00:52:03,966 --> 00:52:05,886
You mean, Lim Yun-hee's
ex-husband is still alive?

806
00:52:05,966 --> 00:52:08,020
Yes, the bodies had been changed.

807
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,653
It wasn't Choi Sang-ho,

808
00:52:09,733 --> 00:52:11,500
who died in that fire.

809
00:52:12,366 --> 00:52:15,966
Lim Yun-hee and Choi Sang-ho have
been posted to the APB.

810
00:52:20,066 --> 00:52:22,053
Let's look at the video.

811
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:23,420
The man in the video

812
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,866
accompanied Ms. Lim to
collect the insurance payout.

813
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,153
We were able to collect his
fingerprint from this glass wall,

814
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:35,653
and identify him.

815
00:52:35,733 --> 00:52:37,100
And this man is…

816
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:41,886
…Choi Sang-ho, who is
Ms. Lim's dead husband.

817
00:52:41,966 --> 00:52:43,786
Just how is this possible?

818
00:52:43,866 --> 00:52:45,653
How,

819
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:48,686
is a man who is supposed to be
dead, walking around alive?

820
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:50,253
Choi Sang-ho,
Ms. Lim's ex-husband,

821
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,953
who was believed to have
perished in fire,

822
00:52:52,033 --> 00:52:53,753
had actually been alive
the whole time.

823
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:56,600
And he had been assisting Ms. Lim
with her crimes the whole time.

824
00:52:57,066 --> 00:52:59,086
Furthermore, in order to
then identify the body of the

825
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:01,900
true victim who had
perished in that fire,

826
00:53:04,266 --> 00:53:06,220
we compared the dental records,

827
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,286
starting with those
around Ms. Lim Yun-hee.

828
00:53:09,366 --> 00:53:12,366
And we were able to put
a name on the body.

829
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,886
That name is Lim Oh-joong,
who is Ms. Lim's father,

830
00:53:19,966 --> 00:53:21,466
and who had been believed to
have gone missing.

831
00:53:48,233 --> 00:53:49,433
Mr. Choi Sang-ho.

832
00:53:51,933 --> 00:53:53,300
Are you Mr. Choi Sang-ho?

833
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,220
You do realize you're
our strongest suspect for

834
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,833
murdering Kim Hyung-tae,
don't you?

835
00:54:02,366 --> 00:54:04,386
Though you have the
right to remain silent,

836
00:54:04,466 --> 00:54:06,520
if you choose to do that,

837
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:10,300
all the punishment will
befall on you.

838
00:54:11,433 --> 00:54:13,153
Because Ms. Lim Yun-hee is
claiming that

839
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:17,220
you are solely responsible for
everything that happened.

840
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,266
No! That witch…

841
00:54:20,566 --> 00:54:21,920
That witch ordered everything.

842
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,586
I'm a victim, too.

843
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:25,020
Then…

844
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,766
Shall we begin with
Kim Hyung-tae's murder?

845
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,233
What really happened?

846
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,933
Yun-hee!

847
00:54:35,166 --> 00:54:37,386
From a week before the murder,

848
00:54:37,466 --> 00:54:40,086
Yun-hee called Park Su-myung,
using deliveries as excuses.

849
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:41,286
Thanks again today.

850
00:54:41,366 --> 00:54:43,753
- She'd let him see the DV,
- Yun-hee!

851
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:45,686
and kept saying the same thing
to him, as if to brainwash him.

852
00:54:45,766 --> 00:54:46,900
I wish…

853
00:54:48,633 --> 00:54:52,020
Someone will kill him for me.

854
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:53,920
Bad bastard! Bad bastard!

855
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,600
That she wished someone would
kill him for her instead.

856
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,466
Su-myung.

857
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,633
Su-myung, come to your senses.

858
00:55:11,633 --> 00:55:14,153
- Yun-hee…
- Now listen to me.

859
00:55:14,233 --> 00:55:17,053
You weren't here today.

860
00:55:17,133 --> 00:55:21,020
You saw nothing,
and did nothing. Alright?

861
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,353
And don't tell anyone this.

862
00:55:23,433 --> 00:55:24,753
Can you promise me?

863
00:55:24,833 --> 00:55:28,020
Yes. Yes, Yun-hee.

864
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,133
Go.

865
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:30,733
Go, then.

866
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,466
It's over. You can come out.

867
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,686
Why did you let him go?

868
00:55:59,766 --> 00:56:02,220
If you got him to help you,
then call the police!

869
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,086
Are you crazy?

870
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:06,320
Then the police will
start suspecting me, too.

871
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,186
Don't you realize you get put on
the suspect list

872
00:56:07,266 --> 00:56:08,953
if you're present at the scene?

873
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:11,086
First I'll confess,

874
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:13,220
so that I'll have the public pity me
when it is finally revealed that

875
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,853
it was actually him
who was the real killer.

876
00:56:14,933 --> 00:56:16,933
That would erase the suspicions
that this is for the insurance.

877
00:56:19,466 --> 00:56:21,186
Anyway, get lost.

878
00:56:21,266 --> 00:56:24,420
I called you just in case,
but you're not needed anymore.

879
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,600
Alright.

880
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,200
Give me that.

881
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,153
I'll take care of this,

882
00:56:50,233 --> 00:56:52,220
so don't you ever come
near this place.

883
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,766
Don't call me, either.

884
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,586
Ms. Lim Yun-hee, who was once
put on trial for

885
00:57:02,666 --> 00:57:04,253
murdering her husband,

886
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:07,053
has been charged this time,
under the suspicions of

887
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:08,786
abetting murder and
murdering her kin.

888
00:57:08,866 --> 00:57:10,620
Ms. Lim talked her ex-husband
into killing her new husband,

889
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,753
Mr. Kim Hyung-tae.

890
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:16,786
In the past, she also murdered
her own father and

891
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:19,053
disguised the body as
her ex-husband's,

892
00:57:19,133 --> 00:57:21,820
then going on to claim
insurance payouts for

893
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:22,853
both her father and
her ex-husband.

894
00:57:22,933 --> 00:57:25,186
So in other words,
her father hadn't gone missing,

895
00:57:25,266 --> 00:57:26,453
but she had actually killed him.

896
00:57:26,533 --> 00:57:28,086
And her ex-husband hadn't
perished in fire,

897
00:57:28,166 --> 00:57:29,086
but she burned her father's body

898
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:32,186
in order to disguise it
as her ex-husbands!

899
00:57:32,266 --> 00:57:34,953
And by doing that, she claimed
payouts for both the two.

900
00:57:35,033 --> 00:57:38,420
But that money was gambled away
with her husband,

901
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,586
and so she approached a new man

902
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:42,486
and killed him, too.

903
00:57:42,566 --> 00:57:45,653
How atrocious! It's just heinous.

904
00:57:45,733 --> 00:57:48,386
Anyway, I'm so glad
it was revealed that

905
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:50,153
Lim Yun-hee was the one
who was evil.

906
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:53,286
And Mr. Kwon became a star lawyer
for doing that job!

907
00:57:53,366 --> 00:57:54,253
Exactly.

908
00:57:54,333 --> 00:57:56,666
Mr. Kwon has really done it.

909
00:57:58,066 --> 00:58:00,186
By the way, where's Mr. Yeon?

910
00:58:00,266 --> 00:58:01,853
Oh.

911
00:58:01,933 --> 00:58:04,686
He's busy doing phone interviews.

912
00:58:04,766 --> 00:58:05,866
Interviews?

913
00:58:07,866 --> 00:58:10,086
Yes, hello. I'm Yeon Jun-gyu,

914
00:58:10,166 --> 00:58:15,100
Kwon Jung-rok's mentor
and role model.

915
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:17,333
Ah!

916
00:58:19,433 --> 00:58:20,686
Ah, yes.

917
00:58:20,766 --> 00:58:22,520
Mr. Kwon is…

918
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:26,520
He's an outstanding lawyer,

919
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,153
who is following my footsteps

920
00:58:28,233 --> 00:58:31,120
toward truth and justice.

921
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,486
I am personally quite proud of him
for this recent case,

922
00:58:33,566 --> 00:58:36,653
because it showed that

923
00:58:36,733 --> 00:58:40,386
he has a deep understanding
of our company's motto.

924
00:58:40,466 --> 00:58:43,486
See, Always' motto is

925
00:58:43,566 --> 00:58:47,220
"Seek the truth,
and deliver justice."

926
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:51,886
By the way, that was also
written by me, Yeon Jun-gyu.

927
00:58:51,966 --> 00:58:53,086
Ah, yes.

928
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:54,986
Oh, this is enough?

929
00:58:55,066 --> 00:58:57,486
But I want to add on
just a little more.

930
00:58:57,566 --> 00:59:00,186
Aren't you curious about
my personal history and

931
00:59:00,266 --> 00:59:03,086
how I was able to become
established as the head of Always?

932
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:04,420
Or even my ideal type of women,

933
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,386
or my future plans to
appear on TV shows? Hello?

934
00:59:07,466 --> 00:59:08,533
Hello?

935
00:59:09,933 --> 00:59:11,920
Why did he hang up?

936
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,700
I just don't understand.

937
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:15,333
I'll just call back.

938
00:59:19,066 --> 00:59:21,100
(Evidence)

939
00:59:24,766 --> 00:59:27,320
Kwon! We should go out for
a drink on a night like this.

940
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,753
What do you want?
Just name it, and you'll have it.

941
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:30,753
A-grade beef?

942
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,220
Lobster? Sashimi?

943
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,453
Or a whole bouquet of fish cakes?

944
00:59:33,533 --> 00:59:34,453
Just say it, and
I'll buy it for you.

945
00:59:34,533 --> 00:59:36,933
Later. I'm a bit tired today.

946
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,420
Right. I guess you need rest,

947
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,053
because you haven't had
much sleep these couple of days.

948
00:59:42,133 --> 00:59:43,753
Then let's save it for next time,

949
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:46,620
and really have a drink
next time.

950
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:47,733
Bye!

951
01:00:05,433 --> 01:00:07,653
But uh...

952
01:00:07,733 --> 01:00:09,766
Can I ask you something?

953
01:00:10,766 --> 01:00:15,686
You said you were too tired for
a team dinner,

954
01:00:15,766 --> 01:00:19,200
so why ask me to
have a drink with you?

955
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,766
Today, I just...

956
01:00:24,733 --> 01:00:27,833
I just wanted to
have a drink, just us two.

957
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:40,186
Mr. Kwon, we should
drink to celebrate!

958
01:00:40,266 --> 01:00:44,466
How about that same place we went
to after our win?

959
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:52,986
- Welcome.
- One medium-sized pork stew.

960
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,066
Oh, sure.

961
01:01:05,866 --> 01:01:07,100
Welcome.

962
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:17,166
Mr. Kwon.

963
01:01:20,033 --> 01:01:22,366
Can I have a minute?

964
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:45,320
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

965
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,833
Why are you doing this?

966
01:01:48,566 --> 01:01:49,686
Why, what did I do?

967
01:01:49,766 --> 01:01:53,986
You know we shouldn't be
doing this anymore.

968
01:01:54,066 --> 01:01:55,886
No, I don't know.

969
01:01:55,966 --> 01:01:57,633
I don't know why we shouldn't.

970
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:02,586
I heard everything.

971
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:05,586
About why…

972
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:07,633
…you left me.

973
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,753
I'd been through

974
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:16,620
a much difficult time,

975
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,933
but I was able to overcome it,
because you were there for me.

976
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,600
And through that process,
I became strong.

977
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:31,886
I'm more scared about seeing you
disappear from by my side,

978
01:02:31,966 --> 01:02:37,353
rather than missing this opportunity
because of a scandal.

979
01:02:37,433 --> 01:02:38,633
So…

980
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,633
If you truly care about me,

981
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:50,766
then be with me.

982
01:02:56,433 --> 01:02:58,366
Let's start again.

983
01:03:11,733 --> 01:03:14,333
You're really going to
let me go like this?

984
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:19,733
Even if you might…

985
01:03:21,733 --> 01:03:24,966
…never see me again?

986
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:55,700
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

987
01:04:05,566 --> 01:04:06,766
I love you.

988
01:05:17,133 --> 01:05:18,866
(Touch Your Heart)

989
01:05:19,133 --> 01:05:20,820
I don't want to go home.

990
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,786
I just want to keep on
looking at you, like this.

991
01:05:22,866 --> 01:05:23,920
Advisory Lawyer?

992
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:24,920
So no one's interested?

993
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,420
- I'll do it.
- Why did you have to say that?

994
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,586
We'll have to keep
our relationship

995
01:05:29,666 --> 01:05:31,153
even more secretive than this,

996
01:05:31,233 --> 01:05:32,666
in order to protect you,
Ms. Oh Jin-sim.

997
01:05:32,733 --> 01:05:33,533
(Kwon Jung-rok)

998
01:05:33,266 --> 01:05:36,300
Even more… secretive?

999
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,886
Even if you're my manager,
respect my privacy!

1000
01:05:38,966 --> 01:05:41,400
Yoon-seo, can I use your bathroom?

1001
01:05:42,033 --> 01:05:43,033
Hyuk-jun!

1002
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,266
How are things between Yoon-seo
and the male lead?

1003
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:46,633
(Kiss expert)

1004
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,953
Kiss expert…

1005
01:05:48,033 --> 01:05:50,186
Right, there was a kiss scene
in episode 4.

1006
01:05:50,266 --> 01:05:54,086
There's a chance they might
end up dating after this.

1007
01:05:54,166 --> 01:05:56,853
Since you need practice,
let's really get it right.

1008
01:05:56,933 --> 01:05:58,533
Is this how it's done?
