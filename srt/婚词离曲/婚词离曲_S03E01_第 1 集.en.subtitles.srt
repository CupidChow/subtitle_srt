1
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,715
She's having contractions!

2
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,800
-Contractions?
-But it's not due for a week.

3
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,469
It has a temper.

4
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,763
The brat has no patience.

5
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:58,016
I mean the little one.

6
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,522
That's mine.

7
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,191
You're strangling me!

8
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,905
Who cares if this is a woman's?
No one would notice.

9
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,073
Of course they would.

10
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,203
-Bring the car around.
-Got it!

11
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,789
-Is her doctor waiting?
-I haven't heard back.

12
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,209
I shouldn't have sent our driver home.

13
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,920
Did you have any dreams?

14
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,296
No.

15
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,298
This isn't the time to talk about dreams.

16
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,843
But there couldn't be a better,
more joyous time than this.

17
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:38,556
Why is it coming into the world
a week before it's due though?

18
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,849
For what reason?

19
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,102
What's the date on the lunar calendar?

20
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,480
-Put some socks on.
-I'm good.

21
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,774
You'll graze your feet. That's not okay.

22
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,567
I said I'm okay with it.

23
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,736
It's not like it'll take ten minutes.

24
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,280
That reminds me!

25
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,576
I ordered a wheelchair,
just for this occasion.

26
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,578
Where is it?

27
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,288
Where could it be?

28
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,166
You said it was delivered.

29
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,543
I did?

30
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,628
Yes, yesterday.

31
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,171
Wasn't it Driver Choi?

32
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:15,176
Could it be in the trunk of the car?

33
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,387
Don't ask me.
I didn't tell him to do that.

34
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,061
Hang in there a little longer.

35
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,437
How about a piggyback ride?

36
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,481
And who would carry her?

37
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,400
-Can you walk?
-Yes.

38
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,695
-My phone!
-Let's go.

39
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,156
-Where's my phone?
-As if that's important.

40
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,951
We shouldn't forget the hospital bag.

41
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,328
Right. That's what we need the most.

42
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,998
It's in the closet.

43
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,835
At a time like this,
get a hold of yourself.

44
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,100
The wheelchair must be
in the trunk of my car.

45
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,435
We should hurry up.

46
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,438
Watch your back!

47
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,527
What is it? Talk to me.

48
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,071
-Cramps.
-Cramps?

49
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,699
You chose this moment to have cramps?

50
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,375
Your father has the cramps
for Christ's sake.

51
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,294
Can't you walk?

52
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,380
My stomach's suddenly killing me.

53
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:40,011
Ji-a, aren't you craving
my homemade burgers?

54
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,930
And some fried chicken
and fermented kimchi gimbap?

55
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,181
Of course I am.

56
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,683
But you don't stop by or call either.

57
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,268
It's because Mom has been busy.

58
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,021
I'll gladly pick you up myself.

59
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,315
Your mom would say no to keep you slim.

60
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,027
Ji-a, dinner's ready.

61
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:01,324
-Are you going somewhere?
-I'm sorry, but can you take me to Dad's?

62
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,868
Emptiness.

63
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,747
You come to me straight

64
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,919
In the form of freshly cleansed sunlight.

65
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,425
Is it diarrhea?

66
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,720
Not fully.

67
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,307
We should just stay home.

68
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,559
God's telling us not to go.

69
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,229
We'll only make Song Yuan uncomfortable.

70
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,523
Is that so?

71
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,733
Even I would find it stifling.

72
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,319
We should quietly wait at home.

73
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,113
Still…

74
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,491
Shouldn't we be present at the scene?

75
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,285
It's not some crime scene, you know.

76
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,370
You're being snappier than usual.

77
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,496
Snappy?

78
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,749
-You're snapping at everything I say.
-I'm carrying on the conversation.

79
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,376
We've been together for almost 40 years.

80
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,128
I know what that looks like.

81
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,755
I also know when you're being sarcastic.

82
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,800
You're one to talk.
Must you ruin a good day?

83
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:01,968
Right?

84
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,638
It sure is a good day.

85
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,765
One filled with joy.

86
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,019
I can't contain my excitement.

87
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,854
What will the child be like?

88
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:18,067
-Are you having regular contractions?
-No, not yet.

89
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,528
I don't know.

90
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,662
-Yes, Dad.
-Are you on your way?

91
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,664
-Are you still on the road?
-Yes.

92
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,749
How's Song Yuan?

93
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,375
-Is she in pain?
-Yes.

94
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,378
-We'll stay at home and pray.
-Sure thing.

95
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:41,591
Your mother doesn't want
to make things uncomfortable for her.

96
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,259
Did you dream of anything?

97
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,427
Not really.

98
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,723
-Is that a no or a yes?
-A no.

99
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:49,891
Again with the dreams?

100
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:53,728
Hang up already so he can drive.
Safety first, remember?

101
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,104
-I'll hang up then.
-Sure.

102
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,481
-And drive safely.
-Got it.

103
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,734
My advice is to focus your mind elsewhere.

104
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,278
Stop thinking about how much it hurts

105
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,947
and focus on something funny
like a comedy program.

106
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:09,368
Thinking about Bada's conception
will take your mind off things--

107
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:13,414
That hurts! Why the hell did you pinch me?

108
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,043
Text us once you get there.

109
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,920
Let us know when you go
into the delivery room.

110
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,046
Got it.

111
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,717
You silly old man. Think before you talk.

112
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,135
But I didn't cross any lines.

113
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,192
You should know about the real me
before you go.

114
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,360
I already do.

115
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,736
No, you don't.

116
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,281
You may be aware of youth,
but not what comes with old age.

117
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,676
I now know what love truly is

118
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,554
and what it really feels like.

119
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,349
Please, protect my dignity.

120
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,267
Forever.

121
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,228
Learn the real me today

122
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,606
and end your feelings for me.

123
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,672
Is Ji-a washing up?
She isn't answering my calls.

124
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,091
I just dropped her off
at her father's place.

125
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,261
Why?

126
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,307
I'm still driving, ma'am.

127
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,643
-Go back and get Ji-a.
-Sorry?

128
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,436
-Get her out of that house.
-Why?

129
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,980
-Don't ask questions and just do it.
-Sure.

130
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,409
Who's she?

131
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,911
Didn't your mom tell you?

132
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,040
She's your dad's girlfriend.

133
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,042
Grandma, don't play jokes on me.

134
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,001
This isn't a joke.

135
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,420
Why don't you tell her yourself?

136
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,050
Get lost!

137
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,349
My puppy must be hungry.

138
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,809
More so now that I'm here.

139
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,979
All I have to do is grill the patty.

140
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,442
Please don't forget the avocado.

141
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,902
As if I would.

142
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,405
Avocado, lettuce, and a tomato slice.

143
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,241
Where's Dad?

144
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,617
He has a dinner meeting.

145
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,748
Does he drink all the time
now that we're not here?

146
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,668
Of course not.

147
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,628
Ms. Sa asked me to take Ji-a home.

148
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,425
-Ji-a.
-Why?

149
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,468
Can't I have my burger?

150
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,887
She said to come right away.
It must be urgent.

151
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,557
I'll be back some other time, Grandma.

152
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,481
Have a pleasant night, ma'am.

153
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,108
Take care, my puppy.

154
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,067
You too.

155
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,036
You were in there forever.

156
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,293
How long it takes me
to do whatever with my hair

157
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,544
is none of your business.

158
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,547
As if I actually care.

159
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,007
Was someone here?

160
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,054
Are you losing your hearing?

161
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,807
I was hoping for some entertainment.
Ji-a came by.

162
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,569
How will you explain to her
that you stole her dad away?

163
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,113
I'm bracing myself.

164
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,948
She's quite feisty for her age.

165
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,117
She gets that from her mother.

166
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,037
And she was always Yu-sin's top priority.

167
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,247
When it comes to her,
he's foolishly helpless.

168
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,417
So would Ji-a accept this?

169
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,128
She would throw a fit at the least.

170
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:15,883
Once that happens,
you'd be kicked out of here, Fish Head.

171
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,136
-Is that so?
-Yes.

172
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,769
Nothing in this world is guaranteed.

173
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,812
Exactly.

174
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,731
One's life can take unexpected turns.

175
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,777
And stop calling me Fish Head.

176
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,821
-I can call you what I want.
-Fine, Dongchimi.

177
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,492
Dongchimi.

178
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,912
Isn't it about time we made dongchimi?

179
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,832
Make sure that it's delicious
so we can enjoy noodles with it.

180
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,800
-Do you have a headache or feel dizzy?
-I'm okay.

181
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:04,306
Things won't begin until after midnight.
She hasn't even begun to dilate.

182
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,433
Dilate?

183
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,478
Could Ji-a be injured?

184
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,521
I doubt it.

185
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,899
If she were, Ms. Sa would have told us.

186
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,693
You should text her later.

187
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,156
I'm sorry about this. It's my manager.

188
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,119
Yes?

189
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,746
Hye-ryung, I need you here.
Someone bumped into your car.

190
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,915
In the parking lot?

191
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,626
Yes.

192
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,837
While you were parked?

193
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,465
Some drunk old man ran into me.

194
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,216
I'll be right there.

195
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,220
-Is she hurt?
-I'll have to see.

196
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,181
Let me come with you.

197
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,975
-Excuse us.
-Sure thing.

198
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,686
Take your purse with you.

199
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,646
I might go to the restroom.

200
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,989
I said I'd take you home tomorrow.

201
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:51,872
Can you check
if Professor Park is doing all right?

202
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,207
No news is good news.

203
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,877
I'll look into it though.

204
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,880
-Stop worrying about him and--
-How can I not?

205
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,133
I bet you never worried about me.

206
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,684
-Just go.
-That's what you always say.

207
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,397
You look pretty.

208
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,650
Don't wear too much makeup
for the wedding. It doesn't suit you.

209
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,151
Don't try to micromanage me.

210
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:25,406
-I never agreed to a marriage.
-I'm being attentive, not controlling.

211
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,491
The woman's side usually sets a date.

212
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,703
The faster, the better.
Let's not drag this out.

213
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,123
Ga-bin, I won't let you get hurt
from now on.

214
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,745
-Did she leave?
-Yes.

215
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,844
The bill's already been paid.

216
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,554
-By Ms. Lee?
-Yes.

217
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,745
Press one to record your message…

218
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,835
Are you dead or alive?

219
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,839
Did you go on a trip to clear your head?

220
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,262
Don't do anything stupid
for the sake of your children.

221
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,431
Someone of your caliber…

222
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,937
will find another relationship in no time.

223
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,148
You have a melodic voice,

224
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,694
a good figure, and a handsome face.

225
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,862
You also have a respectable job.

226
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,659
"Respect…"

227
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,750
The children and I

228
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,962
had the utmost respect for you.

229
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,427
I just don't know
how things ended up like this.

230
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,264
That darn affair, right?

231
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,309
Anyway, keep living your life.

232
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,562
That's your best option.

233
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,065
"This too shall pass."

234
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:10,070
That's what I told myself
while coping with this whole ordeal.

235
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,617
Don't do anything
to worry our children anymore.

236
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,121
Our family is the other way around.

237
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:23,292
In other families, it's the kids
who cause grievances for the parents.

238
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,253
You know,

239
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,006
even I would…

240
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,261
Actually, forget it.

241
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,060
Don't drown yourself in alcohol

242
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,313
no matter how heartbroken you are.

243
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,565
I guess

244
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,568
you now know

245
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,820
how I feel.

246
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,520
You should look forward to
a special gift on your birthday.

247
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,564
One that money can't buy.

248
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,232
But I'm a materialistic person.

249
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,109
On top of a tangible one.

250
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,193
I'm only joking.

251
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,237
Will I be getting your love then?

252
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,822
A gift that comes from the heart.

253
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:17,865
Now I'm curious.

254
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,452
-Please tell me.
-Tell me

255
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,371
Tell me the truth

256
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,542
Tell me how you feel about me

257
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,710
That song's ancient!

258
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,920
Whether you love me or not

259
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,673
And how big that love is

260
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,133
Show me how much you love me.

261
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,010
-You first.
-I'm getting a tattoo.

262
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,470
A tattoo?
When you're a doctor of all things?

263
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,431
You specialize in mental health.

264
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,641
I'll get your name tattooed
on my stomach or thigh.

265
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,896
-The inside of your thigh or the outside?
-The inside.

266
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,524
Then it's to hide it from people.
You're embarrassed.

267
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,651
Forehead it is then.

268
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,947
I'll get one that says
"Shin Yu-sin is mine."

269
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:03,452
No, wait. "Sa Pi-young is Yu-sin's."

270
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,495
Don't. It'll only hurt.

271
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,914
And that I don't want.

272
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,249
I don't want my love to be in pain either.

273
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,626
I'll be fine.

274
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:14,046
I can manage anything
as long as I have you. You know that.

275
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,549
I sure do. Anyway, I'm touched.

276
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,302
Well, I mean it.
You can decide on the font.

277
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,513
Forget it. What if you go in
for surgery as an old man?

278
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,850
What will the doctor and nurses think?

279
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,354
They'll think that you've been around.

280
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,274
They will see me as a romantic
since it's my wife's name.

281
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,069
People will stare at the pool too.

282
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,987
Either way, it won't age nicely.

283
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:39,905
Is that so?

284
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:43,951
You wanting one is enough.
I can feel your love for me.

285
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,581
How about a deeper kiss?

286
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,432
Babe, let's dance.

287
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,604
A MI

288
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,734
-Are you here?
-Yes. Where's the car?

289
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,778
It's with the valet.

290
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,162
-Where's A Mi?
-She left after Yu-sin called.

291
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,747
What can I get you? Water or sikhye?

292
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,582
Neither.

293
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,463
You must have had dinner plans.

294
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,219
Why did you let Ji-a come here?

295
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,679
She came by unannounced.

296
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,264
You told her to come by anytime.

297
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,473
Watch that tone of yours.

298
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,558
You're not clueless,

299
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:54,479
so tell me what your intentions are.

300
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,440
-My intentions?
-Did you want to hurt her

301
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,442
by letting her see A Mi?

302
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,777
Being drunk doesn't excuse ill-manners.

303
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:01,862
You're the adult here!

304
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,448
I'm too shocked to put this in words.

305
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,575
You know how sensitive teenagers are--

306
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,785
Yet, you still went through
with the divorce.

307
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,747
As if she wouldn't know.
Especially given how smart she is.

308
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,540
She's still an innocent child.

309
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,542
And that doesn't justify your actions.

310
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,128
How can she know
when Yu-sin comes by often?

311
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:21,214
Anyway, she'll find out sooner or later.

312
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,509
-Who are you to butt in?
-How dare you raise your voice at me.

313
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,386
-I'd do worse if--
-You'll hit me?

314
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,056
Me of all people?

315
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,061
Don't you know I'm a simple woman?

316
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,272
No, you're anything but simple.

317
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,648
You'll know once you're my age.

318
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:41,485
I'll be 60 soon
and I'm not how I used to be.

319
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,488
You should act your age.
Where's your sense of wisdom?

320
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,947
Think from Ji-a's perspective.

321
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,742
Don't say you don't know
because you never had kids.

322
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,328
For nearly 50 years,
you were someone's mother.

323
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,080
You said so yourself.

324
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,248
I only called because I missed her.

325
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,543
From what I hear, the housekeeper is nice,
but she's not a good cook.

326
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,046
I wanted to make her a delicious meal

327
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,923
since I feel bad for her.

328
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,300
But I told you we'd keep the truth
from her for now, didn't I?

329
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,928
You dare try to intimidate
your mother-in-law?

330
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,304
Well, I'm enraged right now.

331
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,764
I'm always the punching bag.

332
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,225
Everyone thinks
they can vent their anger on me.

333
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,851
Is it because I'm a stepmother?

334
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,104
I treated you with respect
throughout my marriage.

335
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,647
As if!

336
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,691
Am I fair game now that you're divorced?

337
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,027
-Don't change the subject.
-I'm not!

338
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,030
Think of it from my perspective too.

339
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,574
Ji-a means more to me than Yu-sin now.

340
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,743
What he did makes me just as sick.

341
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,830
Ever since you moved out,
Ji-a has never come by.

342
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,332
I missed her
and that's all I could think about.

343
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,292
What if she bumped into A Mi?

344
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,169
There are more than
enough lies to tell her.

345
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,088
-Mother!
-I'm not deaf, you know.

346
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,674
-Please stop.
-Stop what?

347
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,134
Your scheming.

348
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,637
We'll talk again once you're sober.

349
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,514
I don't want to deal
with your drunken frenzy.

350
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:56,017
If Ji-a had found out everything today,
I would have ended it with you.

351
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,727
I'm not the one who had an affair!

352
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,855
Besides, it seems like
you're already done with me.

353
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,064
Be nicer.

354
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,235
Please consider
other people's feelings too.

355
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,736
Don't judge others by your standards.

356
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,239
Your marriage
might have ended in a divorce,

357
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,825
but you married into this family
thanks to me.

358
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,786
After all that we've been through
as a family,

359
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,497
you come here to nitpick
about a silly phone call.

360
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,292
Yelling and glaring at me like that!

361
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,544
I'm the one who should be lost for words.

362
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,755
How do you really feel about him?

363
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,343
-What do you mean?
-About Yu-sin.

364
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,553
What is it that you want to hear?

365
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,435
You'll keep up with this nonsense?

366
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,853
Must I deal with a drunk?

367
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,898
Nonsense is better than lies, is it not?

368
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:43,940
You're…

369
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,277
crossing many lines today.

370
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,280
Yu-sin told A Mi that
you were his first love.

371
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,699
How does that make you feel?

372
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:53,992
She probably made it up.

373
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:57,412
Fish Head is more than capable,
so don't let her deceive you.

374
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:00,749
Then you shouldn't treat him like that.
You should treat him like your son.

375
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,168
-Is it that important?
-Of course.

376
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,670
Are you saying
I'm allowed to treat you with no respect?

377
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,132
Now that I'm a widow,
you think you can walk all over me.

378
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,508
You brought this on yourself--

379
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,636
Even a fly has its anger.
Don't push your luck.

380
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,929
Thankfully…

381
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,431
I left on my own accord.

382
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:21,019
If Ji-a manages to drive A Mi away,
Yu-sin will be all yours.

383
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,021
You're crossing lines as you please now.

384
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,731
Ask around.

385
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,983
No one treats their son
as intimately as you.

386
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,944
Have you seen anyone who acts like you?

387
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,197
Being uneducated has me clueless
when it comes to etiquette.

388
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,990
As if that's the issue.

389
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,869
Did women in the past
who never went to school

390
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,830
treat their sons like you do
in front of their daughters-in-law?

391
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,167
It's because you have feelings for him.

392
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,921
How did you keep it all in
and not nitpick for all these years?

393
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,929
It's about time you aged with grace.

394
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,891
You!

395
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,273
Are you proud to be divorced?

396
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:10,360
You're in no position to come here
and accuse me of such nonsense.

397
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:16,950
VOICE RECORDING

398
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,453
Keep going, why don't you?

399
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,414
Is this what I get for being nice?

400
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,375
Only those with decent parents
luck out with their spouses.

401
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,002
That sums up Yu-sin's life.

402
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,921
His birth mother never loved him
and his wife stabbed him in the back

403
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,799
-over one mistake.
-It's my back that was stabbed.

404
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,135
One moment of patience
wards off great disaster.

405
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,429
But you couldn't even
let one mistake slide.

406
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,847
What will Ji-a learn?

407
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,268
Nicely said, Mother.

408
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:48,064
Were you the one who taught him
to step out on his own wife?

409
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,316
He learned from the best.

410
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,861
You married his father
only two years after his mother died.

411
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:56,364
Did your love really bloom
after he had lost his wife?

412
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:02,287
This one time,
Director Hong got drunk and asked Father

413
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:07,042
how it felt to be slapped
by his own wife of all people.

414
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:12,255
He couldn't imagine it since
he has never been hit by anyone before.

415
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,424
More so because it was Gyeong-suk.

416
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,926
That was Yu-sin's mother, right?

417
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,637
He was amazed that you weren't fired.

418
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,807
I overheard him while serving them coffee.

419
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,684
Father was utterly embarrassed.

420
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:31,900
If it were me,
I could have been able to relate to A Mi.

421
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,028
You two are the same, aren't you?

422
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:41,284
They say that nothing
is worse than a person's greed.

423
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:45,872
So have some shame and know your place.

424
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,752
I hope that was all recorded.

425
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,048
You love foreign soap operas, right?

426
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,717
Ones where daughters-in-law
slap their mothers-in-law.

427
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,594
Why don't we reenact the scene?

428
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,808
Go ahead!

429
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,103
You ungrateful wench.

430
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,606
Is this what I get for talking
Yu-sin's father into letting

431
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,024
Yu-sin marry a nobody like you?

432
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,871
Are you seriously going to hit me?
Is that it?

433
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,211
She called Ji-a over
to get her to meet A Mi.

434
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,671
Where is she?

435
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,923
-All I did was call her.
-And Ji-a came by!

436
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,969
You wanted to shock Ji-a
so that she could drive A Mi away.

437
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,181
What happened here was all recorded.

438
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,601
I'll break your wrist if you touch it!

439
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,270
As if I'd let you touch me.

440
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,112
How dare you of all people do this to me.

441
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,238
How dare I?

442
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,074
Did you hear that?

443
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,034
Please sit down…

444
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,538
-or leave.
-If you got here sooner,

445
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,415
you would have seen me get slapped.

446
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,672
Can you blame me?
After everything you said?

447
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:21,468
This is exactly why
you never had a second child.

448
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,095
You knew a daughter-in-law
would only mean trouble.

449
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,889
-That's enough.
-You should have

450
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,932
studied acting, not nursing.

451
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,435
-Watch your words.
-This woman was going to use Ji-a

452
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:31,978
to get what she wants.

453
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,480
By deliberately hurting Ji-a!

454
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,607
"This woman"? Seriously?

455
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,358
Curse at me, why don't you?

456
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,485
Unbelievable.

457
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,864
Ji-a stopped by
while I was washing my hair.

458
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,115
Shut up!

459
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,326
"Shut up"?

460
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,662
SHUT UP YOURSELF!

461
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,373
She barged in here all drunk

462
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:56,586
just to yell at me
when I was once her mother-in-law.

463
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,256
You don't know half of it.

464
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,302
You're drunk again?

465
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,805
-Is that why you divorced me?
-Then what about you?

466
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,557
You're a mother. What will Ji-a learn?

467
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,643
-Exactly.
-People drink at team dinners.

468
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,353
This job is my livelihood now.

469
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,647
That was your choice, not mine.

470
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,778
Pi-young, you seem exhausted.
Please have a seat.

471
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:22,904
Would you like a soda?

472
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,155
"Pi-young"?

473
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,699
Call her your sister-wife, why don't you?

474
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,369
Look at you two getting along.

475
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,079
You will never see Ji-a again.

476
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,456
Why not?
I've been a good grandmother to her.

477
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,916
You think we get along?

478
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,836
In my eyes, it's you and Yu-sin
who get along even better.

479
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,796
Even if you aren't family by blood.

480
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,180
Why divorce me
when you care so much about Ji-a?

481
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,061
Must I repeat myself?

482
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,063
You're divorced and living apart.

483
00:30:57,146 --> 00:31:00,066
You can't hide it forever.
Ji-a will find out sooner or later.

484
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,943
That's my concern, not yours!

485
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,863
-You always stay out and drink.
-You have no right to say that!

486
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,490
I may be a bastard to you,

487
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,492
but I've always been a good father.

488
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,660
Not in the true sense.

489
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,246
If you're that confident,

490
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,665
why didn't you seek Ji-a's permission
before you had that affair?

491
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,334
"Your dad will be seeing
another woman on the side."

492
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,670
It's killing you, isn't it?

493
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,881
You want to make me
into a bad parent so badly.

494
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,593
I'm tired of your threats.

495
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,844
Tell the housekeeper to bring her over.

496
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,763
She'll find out anyway,
so let's get it over with.

497
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,682
Shin Yu-sin.

498
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,727
-Don't you dare call her.
-Or what?

499
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,230
You'll never see her again either.

500
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,614
What then?

501
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,532
You're killing me.

502
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,660
Have you ever thought about
what I'm going through?

503
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,335
It's the price of your inconsideration.

504
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,671
You deceived your wife
and stepped out on her,

505
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,383
so how can you expect respect?

506
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,511
Is it hard for you?

507
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,472
Does it hurt?

508
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,350
To what extent?

509
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,684
What can I do then?

510
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,227
Water that has trickled down

511
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,229
can't be pulled back up.

512
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,398
How can one's feelings be less than water?

513
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,983
One's feelings aren't tangible.

514
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,860
Water is just water.

515
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,489
Feelings can't be seen,
but they can be felt.

516
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:30,990
If Ji-a finds out,

517
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,745
her pain might be even greater than mine.

518
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:39,040
Unlike me, she's tied to you by blood.

519
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,126
On top of that, she adores you.

520
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,753
I know.

521
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,421
This is all because of you.

522
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,591
-You shameless brat.
-That's enough.

523
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,552
Never call me or Ji-a again.

524
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,845
I hope I don't have to.

525
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,892
Pi-young!

526
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,438
I'll leave if you tell me to end this.

527
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,149
It hurts me too…

528
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,735
and I'm ashamed.

529
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,445
What a liar.

530
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,069
-Please get in.
-I'd rather walk.

531
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,532
It's cold and taxis rarely come by
at this hour.

532
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,702
-You had a few drinks too.
-I'm sober now.

533
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,623
I meant what I said.
I'll do what you tell me to do.

534
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,380
It may be too late,

535
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,383
but I'll do as you say.

536
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,683
It's your loss.

537
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,935
Go ahead and age as a single woman.

538
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,482
Unlike you, I'll have a man by my side
who loves me.

539
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,818
Why hasn't he called?

540
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,279
You should call him.

541
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,532
He will call us once the baby's born.

542
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,242
I'm worried that she'll suffer.

543
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,287
There could be complications,
considering her age.

544
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,207
We'll have to leave it up to God.

545
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,294
Should we pray to the skies?

546
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,423
-We should.
-And serve water to the spirits?

547
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,509
If only we had the right bowl.

548
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,594
It's not like we can head home to Daejeon.

549
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,304
We should do things properly.

550
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:01,182
How about a church?
I doubt there's a temple nearby.

551
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,187
Will I be able to have a safe delivery?

552
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,188
Of course.

553
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,108
Please let me know if the pain's too much.

554
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,318
I'll help you manage.

555
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,528
It's not so bad.

556
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,155
Don't be stubborn. It won't help you.

557
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,824
The pain is manageable.

558
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:22,161
I'm looking forward to a pretty baby
since both parents are good-looking.

559
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,682
God…

560
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:44,725
and Buddha.

561
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:48,646
Why would you be asking
for Buddha at a church?

562
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:49,564
God.

563
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,399
God…

564
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:55,403
Is it God with a capital G?

565
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,779
Probably.

566
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,323
I think someone said otherwise.

567
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,450
Then just pray with your inner voice.

568
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,121
Please grant her a safe delivery.

569
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,124
I'm worried sick, you see.

570
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,876
Also let us greet

571
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,045
a healthy baby into this family.

572
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,882
It's what I wish for.

573
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:16,966
By the way,

574
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,677
I'm sure you're aware of my true desire.

575
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,221
I already have two granddaughters,

576
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:27,059
so I would love nothing more
than to now have a grandson.

577
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,103
This old man is just being greedy.

578
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:34,066
All I wish for
is a quick delivery of a healthy baby

579
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,277
whether it's a boy or a girl.

580
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,029
Mark my words, God.

581
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:42,658
Regardless of what she's saying,

582
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:47,038
she's secretly hoping that something
will be dangling between that baby's legs.

583
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,332
Your prayer should be sincere.

584
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,460
But it is.
It can't get more serious than this.

585
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,879
And stop calling me old.
I'm not even close to 70.

586
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,589
The way you think is old.

587
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,842
Why are you getting up?

588
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,844
I'm going to pray properly on my own.

589
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,664
MR. SEO

590
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,085
Hello?

591
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,294
It's Seo Ban.

592
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,839
-Right.
-Why did you pay the bill and leave?

593
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,844
-It should have been my treat.
-Maybe next time.

594
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,763
I bet it was steep.

595
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,849
Think of it as my way
of thanking you for all the other meals.

596
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,813
Are you upset about something?

597
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,148
What about Hye-ryung's car?

598
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,609
Her bumper was smashed,
so it needs to be fixed.

599
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,488
She took her manager to the hospital
to get her neck checked out.

600
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,157
Talk about a ruined night.

601
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,828
It started off great.
I especially loved your poem.

602
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,788
It's not like I wrote it.

603
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,581
Writing one takes skill,

604
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:16,335
but reciting one by heart
is just as beautiful.

605
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,338
It was the best I ever heard.

606
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,799
Do you want me to send it via text?

607
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:25,594
Actually, I can't be bothered.
Maybe tomorrow.

608
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,431
-Sure thing.
-Good night, then.

609
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,314
-Where are you right now?
-At home.

610
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,649
I came back to our table
as fast as I could

611
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:42,236
after assessing the situation
and sending them off to the hospital.

612
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,404
I see.

613
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,284
Shouldn't you have gone with them?

614
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,287
Hye-ryung's the reason
why we gathered today.

615
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,583
That way, there would be
no lingering worries.

616
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,293
Who'd be worried in this case?

617
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,128
You, of course.

618
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,631
Is your husband home?

619
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,301
If he is, I'd like to say hello.

620
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:07,928
Why?

621
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,972
Because we're co-workers.

622
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,724
I once greeted Ms. Boo's husband.

623
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,352
I mean, ex-husband.

624
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,485
He's not around.

625
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,111
We're divorced, you see.

626
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,616
When? Is this true?

627
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,951
-It's been a while.
-Why didn't you tell me?

628
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,495
It's nothing to brag about.

629
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,374
I would have told you
had you asked like today.

630
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,377
If you had known,

631
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,631
would you have taken me out too
for a pity dinner?

632
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,715
I…

633
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,473
I know what you're thinking.

634
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,600
And what would that be?

635
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,685
All three of us are divorced.

636
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,731
The producer, the writer,
and also the show host.

637
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:05,069
Even I think it's unbelievably funny.

638
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,988
I don't. Anyway, we should meet up.

639
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,033
But you said you were home.

640
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,369
It'll only take me ten minutes by car.

641
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,205
Twenty tops.

642
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,333
You live in Bangbae-dong, right?

643
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,836
-Yes.
-I'll be right over.

644
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,462
To my apartment complex?

645
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:26,173
I'll call from a nearby shop.

646
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,176
I'm hanging up.

647
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,761
Sure.

648
00:40:53,784 --> 00:41:00,249
VACANT

649
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:10,801
My baby, you have no idea
how long I've waited for this day.

650
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,014
I'm sure you're just as tired and scared.

651
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,726
But you don't need to be.

652
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,147
Trust your mom
and bravely enter this world.

653
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,524
I'll hold you in my arms.

654
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:27,943
My baby,

655
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,071
I can't wait to see you.

656
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,886
Will you opt for surgery?

657
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,473
This hardly warrants for one.

658
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,267
These are tears of joy.

659
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,019
I'd rather be the one in pain.

660
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:04,522
-Really?
-Of course.

661
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,359
Bada.

662
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,779
Aren't you curious about your mom and dad?

663
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,490
We sure are of you.

664
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,874
Should I get the doctor? Are you in labor?

665
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,242
What are you thinking about?

666
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,329
-Nothing much.
-Are you just looking at me then?

667
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,333
What's my least attractive feature?

668
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,377
Eyes, nose, or mouth?

669
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:13,090
Your eyes, nose, and mouth.

670
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,341
They're all handsome.

671
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,260
Especially your eyes though.

672
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,555
Your gaze to be exact.

673
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:20,889
What about my gaze?

674
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,266
Well…

675
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:28,772
a smile flashes
through your eyes at times.

676
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,691
-Really?
-Yes.

677
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,359
That's a new one for me.

678
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,278
It is a compliment, right?

679
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,615
These emotions I'm feeling…

680
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,743
It's all a first for me.

681
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,078
I'm overwhelmed.

682
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:47,833
How was I?

683
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,677
Please look at me.

684
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:00,471
Please.

685
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:04,683
You're mine now.

686
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:09,396
Now I understand that
what I'm feeling is love.

687
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:21,909
You should go.

688
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,702
Fine.

689
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:31,126
I'd like a compliment
in any shape or form though.

690
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,712
Could you spare one?

691
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,632
You're great.

692
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,843
You're a great man.

693
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,303
And I'll stay that way.

694
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,681
You know what I mean, right?

695
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,204
I'm not going to scream.

696
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,706
I won't let my baby hear it.

697
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,629
Mama's all right. Just stay strong for me.

698
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:21,051
Your dad, grandma, and grandpa

699
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,262
are all waiting.

700
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,643
Let's take a look.

701
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,856
CHURCH

702
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,277
Goodness.

703
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,407
It's me. Has she given birth?

704
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,491
Not yet.

705
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,327
Is she close or not?

706
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,538
I'm afraid it's going to be
a few more hours.

707
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,833
Goodness. Well, it's her first birth.

708
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,461
She must be exhausted.

709
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,713
She's staying strong,
so don't worry too much.

710
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:58,964
She's not even screaming.

711
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,758
Where are you right now?
Aren't calls forbidden?

712
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,093
I'm in the lobby.

713
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,803
Don't leave her side.

714
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:08,056
We'll stay up all night,
so call us once she gives birth.

715
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,814
I'm going out for a while.
A friend is in the neighborhood.

716
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,192
-Got it.
-Isn't it too late for a snack?

717
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,068
I can't sleep because I'm hungry.

718
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,945
I only had a small dinner.

719
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,197
As if.

720
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,002
This was the only place open at this hour.

721
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,189
I'm pretty sure
you drank more than usual today.

722
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,567
You sounded hungover on the phone.

723
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,903
-Is this why you came by?
-I bought it on the way here.

724
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:09,660
HANGOVER SUPPLEMENTS

725
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,790
I'm fine though.

726
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:17,000
A hot bath made me feel all better.

727
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,253
I'll save it for later.

728
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,763
Eomuktang and a bottle of soju, please.

729
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:30,931
Sure thing.

730
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:34,726
Hot soup will ease your stomach.

731
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:42,568
I'll help myself to this.

732
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,487
Not drinking enough
only keeps me up at night.

733
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,322
I didn't get my fill today.

734
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,449
Likewise.

735
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,165
It's fine.

736
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,381
Didn't Hye-ryung call?

737
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,632
Let's only talk about us.

738
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:10,053
ABOUT US…

739
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,316
You mean about me, right?
The story behind my divorce.

740
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,693
You're probably curious.

741
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,696
It's the same as Hye-ryung's.

742
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,618
That's absurd.

743
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,912
As if anyone could ever
find fault with you.

744
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,791
-You're too good for him.
-My ex?

745
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:40,709
Yes.

746
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,337
That depends on how you see it.

747
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:47,883
You're not like the other men.

748
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:52,387
-Maybe it's because you never married.
-How is U-ram holding up?

749
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,847
You saw him.

750
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,142
The children have accepted it somewhat,

751
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,771
but I doubt their hearts have mended yet.

752
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,273
They're just too considerate
to show their pain.

753
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,067
I honestly don't get him.

754
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,362
As a man myself, I mean.

755
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,113
They say friends stick together,

756
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:16,036
so I'm grateful for how you're taking
my side on this matter.

757
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,667
Do you still have feelings for him?

758
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,086
As in love?

759
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,381
As if that's even possible.

760
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:30,592
We met as seniors in high school
and have been together for 30 years.

761
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,177
It's about time we got sick of each other.

762
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,012
Must married couples be in love?

763
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:39,101
Can't attachment keep a marriage together
after the love ends?

764
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:42,020
That's what we women believe.

765
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:46,525
Our brains say one thing,
but our hearts believe another.

766
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:47,859
Who's the other woman?

767
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,986
Someone famous enough
for even you to recognize.

768
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,910
It ended though.

769
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,871
They talked about marriage,

770
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:04,084
but the woman ended it
saying that it wasn't love.

771
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,419
It wasn't mutual.

772
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,130
What was it if it wasn't love?

773
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,840
I guess it was comfort.

774
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:14,052
It's not easy to find someone
that you can rely on.

775
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,512
So?

776
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,848
Are you taking him back?

777
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,892
No, that's not what I want.

778
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,784
Doesn't this make you uneasy?

779
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,786
-Is that the case for you?
-No.

780
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,457
Things can't possibly
be uncomfortable for us.

781
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,383
Is it over between you two?

782
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:58,054
Emotionally and in every other aspect?

783
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,224
-Yes.
-What if he wants back in?

784
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,642
He couldn't possibly ask.

785
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:09,024
You don't seem like your usual self today.

786
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,789
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

787
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:43,683
Dig in.

788
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,156
This isn't the mood for such talks.

789
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,034
So I'll carry on tomorrow.

790
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:05,914
When we're both sober.

791
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:12,128
DONG-MA

792
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,550
Yes?

793
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,719
You don't have hot water.

794
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,055
-You're at my place?
-Yes. I got kicked out.

795
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,559
-Why?
-Isn't it obvious?

796
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:27,769
I want to shower.

797
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,604
Then contact maintenance.

798
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,576
There goes a cab.

799
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,963
I can make it home myself.
It's just around the corner.

800
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,465
You shouldn't keep your brother waiting.

801
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,844
When exactly does U-ram go to bed?

802
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:05,348
Later now that he's in his teens.

803
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,518
His sister must adore him.

804
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,353
She does.

805
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:14,107
It's true that the eldest daughter
is an asset.

806
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,109
She's reliable in many aspects.

807
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:19,571
Does she take after you?

808
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:22,908
She's more like my mother actually.

809
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,412
To me, you always seem cold.

810
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:28,622
Me?

811
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,416
I do get cold easily.

812
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,511
Lee Si-eun.

813
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,598
We once met.

814
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:51,061
Did we go to the same school?

815
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,187
No.

816
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,564
I'll tell you tomorrow.

817
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,542
Are you sure though?

818
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,253
You can talk to me casually.

819
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,560
This is my daughter.

820
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,900
Right. He's the engineer of the show.

821
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:42,112
Oh, right.
My brother told me a lot about you.

822
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:43,071
Hi.

823
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,240
Why are you out in the cold?

824
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:47,367
I got worried.
And I needed some fresh air.

825
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,704
-You should go then.
-Sure.

826
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,790
-I'll see you around.
-Sure. Good night.

827
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:00,672
Mom, he's incredible!

828
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,258
-Come on.
-No way.

829
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,095
You've still got it, Mom.

830
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,723
Don't get ahead of yourself.

831
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,100
Hardly. I know what I saw.

832
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,937
The team went out for dinner,
but Pi-young left early because of Ji-a

833
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,981
and Hye-ryung had to leave as well.

834
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,524
It ended rather abruptly.

835
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:22,944
That's why he came over
to finish talking about work.

836
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,320
Sure thing.

837
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,448
He's a gentleman though.

838
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:29,034
Or maybe he's just kind.
He lent you his jacket.

839
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,286
Only after I sneezed while sobering up.

840
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,121
Whatever you say.

841
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:35,582
Nothing's going on.

842
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:36,875
Sure.

843
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:50,847
Oh, gosh. Stop being so distracting.

844
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,016
No, we should go over there.

845
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,517
-To the hospital?
-Yes.

846
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,227
-We'll only disturb her.
-Why?

847
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,938
We'll wait outside
without telling her we're there.

848
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,529
He says Ga-bin will never do.

849
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,323
As expected.

850
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,866
So what now?

851
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,578
The student surpasses the master
even by their stubbornness.

852
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:14,788
Dad will cave in.

853
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:16,915
You're worse than him if I recall.

854
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:18,500
Why not just ride it out at home?

855
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,711
I feel bad saying this to your face,
but Dad needs me in his sight.

856
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,546
Maybe a week?

857
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,883
-He'll want me back in ten days.
-What about Ga-bin?

858
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,718
Will she let you take the lead?

859
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,386
Has she forgiven you?

860
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,681
HANGOVER SUPPLEMENTS

861
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,911
It sure is quiet.

862
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:56,788
It's been hours.

863
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,748
I'm worried about her health.

864
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:02,502
This will completely
drain her of her energy.

865
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:05,046
What if she has none left to spare?

866
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:09,175
She should have eaten better.
Like ox-bone soup

867
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,177
or ox-knee soup.

868
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,514
She needs energy to give birth.

869
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,724
Surgery requires an empty stomach.

870
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,601
What if she needs a C-section?

871
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,312
I'm worried, that's all.

872
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,689
Back in the day,

873
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:26,025
women glanced back at their shoes

874
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,069
when entering the delivery room.

875
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:31,281
They didn't know
if they'd be able to put them on again.

876
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,866
Watch what you're saying!

877
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:33,992
But it's the truth.

878
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:36,870
Keeping your mouth shut
is how you can help.

879
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,503
The cervix is at 8cm now.

880
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,005
It won't be much longer.

881
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:50,175
-Can you give her a shot for the pain?
-Well, she's managing.

882
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,815
It's Seo Ban.

883
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:12,030
PARK HAE-RYUN

884
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,536
Yes?

885
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,414
You know a clinic that specializes
in acupuncture, right?

886
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:25,919
-What was that?
-A clinic that specializes in acupuncture.

887
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:28,463
Can you speak clearly?

888
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,215
Acupuncture…

889
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,927
Are you crying?

890
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:37,096
I… My mouth is stuck.

891
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,807
-You're stuck?
-Yes.

892
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,935
You're stuck to Nam Ga-bin, is that it?

893
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,062
So are these tears of joy?

894
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:45,063
My mouth.

895
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,815
Is your face paralyzed?

896
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,025
Yes.

897
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:54,364
Which clinic specializes in acupuncture?
Text me the number.

898
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,785
-Okay?
-When did this happen?

899
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:02,330
I woke up just now
and grabbed myself some water to drink.

900
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:06,584
It poured down the side of my face
and my face felt weird.

901
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,796
That's when I looked in the mirror.

902
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,005
Give me more details.

903
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:14,842
How bad is it?

904
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,094
It's bad.

905
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:43,496
Were you up all night?

906
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:51,546
My dad passed away.

907
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:54,591
Which one? The one in the States?

908
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:02,307
He became paralyzed
after falling off his horse.

909
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:05,560
And then last Monday…

910
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,021
You didn't know?

911
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,898
-You didn't get the news?
-No.

912
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:18,156
Did your mother call?

913
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,577
An old friend of hers…

914
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:25,330
texted her.

915
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:57,403
Women soothe their own sorrows

916
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:05,495
Mom.

917
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:12,168
-What's wrong?
-You hear someone singing too, right?

918
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,004
Someone singing?

919
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:16,089
Can't you hear it?

920
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,551
It's coming from the living room.

921
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:25,431
But still

922
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:28,851
You're my man, man, man

923
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,646
A woman who awaits happiness
A woman who awaits…

924
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,606
-You must have been dreaming.
-Can't you hear it?

925
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,485
-Sleep with me tonight.
-That kind of woman, woman, woman

926
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:42,365
That kind of woman, woman, woman

927
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,410
I can't sleep.

928
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,995
Keep your eyes closed though.

929
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,915
The sun doesn't rise
for another three hours.

930
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,794
Maybe you need herbal medicine.

931
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,630
Lack of energy
could lead to hearing things.

932
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,508
Maybe old age has affected your hearing.

933
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:02,009
Are you calling me old?

934
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:05,263
I definitely heard something
although it's gone now.

935
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:12,395
Wasn't it your dad you missed,
not your grandma's burger?

936
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,397
I see Dad every morning.

937
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,566
Then I'll make you a burger.

938
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:17,525
For breakfast?

939
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:20,445
Yes, for breakfast.

940
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:22,613
What time is it?

941
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,493
It's 5:05 a.m. You've stayed strong.

942
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:30,496
Our baby did as well.

943
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,914
You must hate me.

944
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:35,460
Why?

945
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:39,255
Yun-su's wife shouted profanities at him
when giving birth

946
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:40,673
for getting her pregnant.

947
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:47,013
Do so if you want since it's fine by me.

948
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,097
I don't mind.

949
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,891
And that'll be the first thing
our baby learns.

950
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:50,975
Wouldn't our baby understand?

951
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,937
Babies only gain full hearing
a month after they are born.

952
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:59,609
They hear and feel enough
even from the womb.

953
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,487
Why else would we listen to calming music?

954
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,654
Of course.

955
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,452
Bada, your mom's exhausted enough.

956
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,579
Aren't you tired as well?

957
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:14,832
Aren't you curious to see
this beautiful world?

958
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,919
"I'll see it soon."

959
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,129
"I'm ready."

960
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,883
Be good to your mother.

961
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,678
This isn't a stroll in the park.

962
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:33,434
Bada, you heard her, right?

963
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,610
Text me your address.

964
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,622
Good job. You'll soon meet your baby.

965
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:58,000
You should stay outside.

966
01:03:58,751 --> 01:03:59,627
Why?

967
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:01,754
It's a superstition,

968
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,298
but they say
some fertility goddesses are shy.

969
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,634
Will you be all right?

970
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,846
I can turn around, you know.

971
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,561
I love you. Stay strong.

972
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:54,116
Take in a deep breath!

973
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:56,827
All right. Once more.

974
01:05:58,496 --> 01:05:59,872
You're doing great.

975
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:03,209
Think of it as defecating
rather than giving birth.

976
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,336
Imagine sitting on a toilet
when constipated.

977
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,007
All right. You're almost done.

978
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:13,052
Here's your epidural shot.
It will sting a little.

979
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,555
The baby is coming.

980
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,891
After cutting the umbilical cord,

981
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,268
check its breathing
and also its heart rate.

982
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:22,520
Yes, doctor.

983
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:26,148
Here we go. Take a deep breath.

984
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:28,484
Once more.

985
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:32,071
You're doing great.

986
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,739
Once more.

987
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,908
That's it.

988
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,160
Yes!

989
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:46,877
It's a prince.

990
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:27,543
-Hello?
-I forgot to tell you something important.

991
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:28,711
She just had the baby.

992
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:29,879
Really?

993
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:32,381
-A girl or a boy?
-I don't know yet.

994
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,134
How so? Weren't you there with her?

995
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:36,677
-Did she have it?
-Yes.

996
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:37,803
Is she all right?

997
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,138
It wasn't an easy delivery.

998
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:43,184
Anyway, I called about the time.

999
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:45,102
The time of birth is just as crucial.

1000
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,020
What time is it?

1001
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:22,181
He's a handsome young boy
just like his parents.

1002
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:30,773
My baby.

1003
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:33,025
My sweet baby.

1004
01:08:35,402 --> 01:08:36,821
I'm your mom!

1005
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,868
Mr. Seo. I heard you live in Golden Park.

1006
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:26,245
-I do.
-Could you give me a house tour today?

1007
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:28,622
I love myself so much.

1008
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,250
Get lost this instant!

1009
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:32,209
Shut it.

1010
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,044
I'm getting goosebumps.

1011
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:35,379
She attacked her?

1012
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:38,632
What a clingy, old geezer.
He even haunts me from his grave.

1013
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,843
-He's looking at me.
-Goodness. You're right.

1014
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:42,094
They're all there.

1015
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,053
What did you say?

1016
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:46,223
I said time is of the essence.
I need to see an acupuncturist.

1017
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:48,475
-Let me see.
-Focus on me.

1018
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:50,019
What will be your wedding gift?
The best gift is…

1019
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:51,896
It's a punishment from God.

1020
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:52,897
What would you do?

1021
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:56,400
A disabled husband at home
will only slow you down at work.

1022
01:09:56,483 --> 01:09:57,776
Hey, Seung-a. It's been a while.

1023
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,653
It seems like Sa-hyeon
lost someone in his family.

1024
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:01,822
There's no way his parents passed away.

1025
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:03,949
I hope you rest in peace.

1026
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:06,660
Don't you dare touch her.
Don't be absurd. You can't take her.

1027
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:11,707
