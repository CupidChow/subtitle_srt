EPISODE 13

2
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,331
It's not cold! It's not!

3
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,959
It's hot! It's really hot!

4
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,173
One, two.

5
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,557
You're up.

6
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,727
I left the restaurant just fine.
Did I black out?

7
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,397
Yes. I guess you're not much of a drinker.

8
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,440
I usually only drink a glass of wine.

9
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,818
-Are you okay?
-I am.

10
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,903
I'm a little…

11
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,656
I think you loosened up
after we left there.

12
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,867
The alcohol suddenly hit you.

13
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,910
That happens, you know.

14
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,205
You were blacking out,
so I escorted you into my car right away.

15
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:45,999
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,669
No, I should be the one who's sorry.
Had I known you couldn't drink,

17
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,672
we would've had just a little…
No, we wouldn't have drunk at all.

18
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,842
My tolerance must've gotten lower.
It wasn't this low.

19
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,388
I'm sorry. Were you jumping around outside
because of me?

20
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,599
It's okay. I just worked out.

21
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,018
I was out here for about 40 minutes.

22
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,061
My goodness. What time is it?

23
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,940
It's not even 10 p.m.

24
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,360
Your face is frozen.

25
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,529
What if you got frostbitten?

26
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,367
Come up for a bit.

27
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,579
You should have some hot tea.
You could get really sick.

28
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,459
-Hurry up.
-What?

29
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,169
But…

30
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,081
Poor you.

31
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,624
It's okay.

32
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,794
You should've woken me up
even if you had to slap me.

33
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,963
Thanks to you, I'm totally sober now.

34
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,466
Come on in.

35
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,344
Gosh, I forgot to use honorifics.

36
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,137
I'm much younger than you.

37
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,306
It won't take long.

38
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:26,808
Okay.

39
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,062
I have beef porridge. Would you like some?

40
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,855
Jumping around made me hungry.

41
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,816
You need to warm your body.

42
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,568
We didn't eat a lot for dinner.

43
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,321
-Let me take this off.
-Sure.

44
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,118
Regardless of who it belongs to,
a home is always wonderful.

45
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,161
I feel bad for those who don't have one.

46
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,372
I need to wash my hands.

47
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,624
Right. The bathroom is over there.

48
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,183
-Have a seat.
-Thanks.

49
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,691
It's already seasoned,
but do you still need kimchi?

50
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,568
I prefer to have it on its own.

51
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,195
Me too. I don't like it
when the two flavors are mixed.

52
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,615
-Stir it first.
-Right.

53
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,828
I hope you don't get sick.

54
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,372
You could catch a cold
staying outside like that.

55
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,833
All I did was work out at night
after a good meal.

56
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,254
Thank you for the food.

57
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,302
It's good.

58
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,637
I've never had beef porridge before.

59
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,640
Really? Do you not like porridge?

60
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,935
I do, but I usually had
abalone porridge and soybean porridge.

61
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,562
My dad likes soybean porridge.

62
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,356
I've never had soybean porridge before.

63
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,534
This is warming up my body.

64
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,412
My sister-in-law gave me
some tangerines from Jeju Island.

65
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,623
You should have them yourself.

66
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,840
-I have plenty.
-Thank you.

67
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,179
-You don't have to do it now.
-It's okay.

68
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,231
The more I eat it,
the more savory it gets.

69
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,066
There's no sugar, but it's sweet.

70
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,611
Anything your body wants tastes sweet.
Oh, my.

71
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,239
You're not okay, are you?

72
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,367
I'm not feeling nauseous,
but I'm a bit woozy.

73
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,326
How do you feel?

74
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,246
I feel bad.

75
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,499
When you blacked out, I was really scared.

76
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,126
I wanted to go to the hospital,

77
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,920
but you looked so peaceful.

78
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,673
It seemed like you were having
a sweet dream.

79
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,675
So I just took you home.

80
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,594
Had you not told me where you lived,
we'd be at the hospital.

81
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,013
I owe you big time.

82
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,433
Not at all.
Thank you for this good porridge.

83
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,728
You don't have a bad stomach, do you?

84
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:21,816
I make and eat porridge
when I miss my mom.

85
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:27,572
She'd make some for me
when I didn't have an appetite.

86
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,824
I see.

87
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,160
I learned the recipe over the shoulder.

88
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,037
But it doesn't taste the same.

89
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,373
But it's so soothing and delicious.

90
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,880
I feel good and warm in the stomach.
It relaxes me.

91
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,049
I'm truly sorry for the inconvenience.

92
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,678
Come on. It was nearby.
It didn't even take that long.

93
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,388
Remember what I said?

94
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,225
My wife hates it when I reek of alcohol.
She makes me sleep on the couch.

95
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,060
Do you only have one bedroom?

96
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,481
No. There are three,
but one is for storage,

97
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,609
and the study is cluttered up
with the desk and the bookshelves.

98
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,195
By the way, how did we come here?

99
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,032
-You called a chauffeur, right?
-Of course.

100
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,493
But I don't need one on my way home.
I'm sober now.

101
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,620
You still shouldn't drive.

102
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,954
Okay.

103
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,958
Did you know that protein
breaks down the alcohol,

104
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,585
so it's good for hangovers?

105
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,836
I heard.

106
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,215
So on days I drink heavily,
I have two fried eggs before going to bed.

107
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,509
I like fried eggs too.

108
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,513
Oh, I have some eggs.

109
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,182
Oh, I'll have some if you want some.

110
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,187
Should I fry them? I'm good at it.

111
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,313
You're my guest.

112
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,441
You're not completely sober yet.

113
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,401
I like the state I'm in right now.

114
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,283
-Eat up before it gets cold.
-Okay.

115
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,045
How much did you have?

116
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,547
A ton.

117
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,299
I'm okay with you drinking,
but don't let it show.

118
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,592
Drunk men are an eyesore.

119
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,928
Hey, Hye-ryung.

120
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,684
-"Hey"?
-Yes. Hey.

121
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:26,232
What's wrong
with a husband calling his wife "hey"?

122
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,153
Can you fry me some eggs?

123
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,324
-Fried eggs?
-Yes.

124
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,659
Why should I?

125
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,459
Half-cooked or fully-cooked?

126
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,878
Do you prefer half-cooked, Song Yuan?

127
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,090
Half-cooked yolks are a bit smelly,

128
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,509
and fully-cooked ones are too hard,

129
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,885
so I like mine in-between.

130
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,596
What? Me too.

131
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,398
Thank you so much
for the delicious porridge.

132
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,027
-Have some tangerines.
-Okay.

133
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,323
Do you know
when your mom looks the prettiest?

134
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,950
When she's cooking.

135
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,703
That's just an excuse
to make me cook for you.

136
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,864
You're good at everything.

137
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,201
Even kids can cook fried eggs.

138
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:04,163
It's perfectly cooked.
Usually, the yolk breaks when you flip it.

139
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,876
Why didn't you just stay in the car?

140
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,419
You could've felt uncomfortable.

141
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,297
You could've sat in the back.
I was sleeping anyway.

142
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:18,886
Besides, we're not strangers.
We go to the same gym.

143
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,223
Do you have a dishwasher?

144
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,724
No. Why?

145
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,477
I should at least do the dishes.

146
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,062
That's what I do at home.

147
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,232
-Goodness.
-Only on the helper's days off.

148
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,486
There's not much to do anyway.

149
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:40,866
Are all men these days
as kind and sweet as you, Xiexian?

150
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,285
-That's a compliment, right?
-Of course.

151
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,288
My wife makes me do house chores.

152
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,666
But I lived alone for a long time,
so it's nothing.

153
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,876
You're amazing.

154
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:56,507
At times, I keep putting things off,
so I have to deal with them all at once.

155
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,051
When that happens,
I don't want to do any chores.

156
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,177
To be honest,

157
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:04,432
I want to be a couch potato
when I get home after work.

158
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,600
Me too.

159
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,227
May I ask… Never mind.

160
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,980
What is it? Ask away.

161
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,608
Was your marriage life happy?
Other than not being able to have kids.

162
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,111
Yes.

163
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,822
Do you think of him from time to time?

164
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,700
I thought I had forgotten about him.

165
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,078
But I saw him
at a department store recently.

166
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,831
I was looking at some sportswear

167
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,459
when I heard a familiar voice.

168
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,961
So I turned around.

169
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:38,090
My ex-husband and his wife were walking

170
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,927
with a girl about five or six years old.

171
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,598
They looked happy.

172
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:51,770
I want to make her happy.

173
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,689
Tell me the truth.

174
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,276
I remember putting the muffler around you.

175
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:01,489
Did I black out right after that?
Did I not embarrass myself?

176
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,325
You didn't.

177
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,078
What? Do you feel like you swore at me?

178
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,666
Right. There's one thing.

179
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,171
You could've just wrapped the muffler
around my neck once.

180
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,424
But you wrapped it several times
then pulled.

181
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:24,720
Goodness. Really? What's wrong with me?

182
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,891
In a way, I'm glad you blacked out.

183
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,812
That's unbelievable. How could I…

184
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,442
-You're joking, right?
-I'm not.

185
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,867
Can I make her laugh like this
all the time?

186
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,536
How did I go to the car?

187
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,996
I had no choice. I dragged you.

188
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,748
I'm so mortified!

189
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,209
I'm kidding. I didn't drag you.

190
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,586
Some woman helped me carry you on my back.

191
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,674
Please forget it.

192
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,553
-Forget what happened tonight.
-I don't want to.

193
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,805
I even served you beef porridge.

194
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,015
Have you warmed up?

195
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,768
Your face looks much better now.

196
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,645
You should pay me back.

197
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,398
Lawyers hate giving free consultation
the most.

198
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,527
-You too, Lawyer Pan?
-Call me by my other name.

199
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,903
You too, Xiexian?

200
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,824
Be my life coach from time to time.

201
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,995
My brother lives in Daejeon.
There's no one I can really talk to.

202
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,372
Don't you have friends?

203
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,165
They're all busy with their lives.

204
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,751
Those who have kids
are busy child-rearing.

205
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:41,088
Those who are still single
are busy dating or going on blind dates.

206
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:47,177
Be my mentor. My life mentor.

207
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,559
It's been ages since we last clubbed!

208
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,604
How long has it been?

209
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,564
It's been over a year.

210
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,232
Next time, let's exclude her.

211
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,943
We can't hang out with guys
because of her.

212
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,237
I won't get in the way now,
so enjoy yourselves.

213
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,239
-There are many nice guys.
-Right?

214
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,366
Are you sure your husband hasn't called?

215
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,993
Is this out of respect or neglect?

216
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,494
I trained him this way.

217
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,247
If he checked on me every hour,
it'd be so tiring.

218
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,290
I'm not a housewife.

219
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,835
Does he know any fellow lawyers
who are bachelors?

220
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,756
The younger girls have already
snatched the good ones away.

221
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,382
And we're no match for them.

222
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,675
We're not bad.

223
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,137
Women in their 20s and 30s are
completely different. We should know.

224
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:35,184
Back when I was in my twenties,
I could hit a tennis ball with my butt.

225
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,521
Gosh. I need to snatch
a younger guy like Hye-ryung did.

226
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,233
She's different from us.
She's a celebrity. That's a privilege.

227
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,111
None of that matters anymore
now that I'm married.

228
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,030
I've lost so much after getting married.

229
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,324
In every gain, there is a loss.

230
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,952
You're too greedy, Hye-ryung.

231
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:57,665
That's true. Those who have everything
tend to be greedier.

232
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,917
Don't see me out. It's cold.

233
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,003
Thank you so much for today.

234
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,506
You made me laugh a lot.

235
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,049
I'm fun, aren't I?

236
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,052
Thank you for the food.
That was the best beef porridge ever.

237
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,387
I'll never forget it.

238
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,890
Tell me when you crave it again.
I'll bring some in a thermos.

239
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,936
Don't drink with anyone else but me.

240
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:23,190
I won't. Thanks to you,
I know exactly how much I can drink.

241
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,693
-Good night.
-Good night.

242
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,677
Wait.

243
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,818
I have no regrets

244
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:12,740
other than what I did
to you and your daughter.

245
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,784
I will meet with you
and ask for forgiveness.

246
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,829
Did those two know each other
from the get-go?

247
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,917
Are they in-laws now?

248
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,961
Do you expect me to explain everything?

249
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,964
About their ill-fated relationship
and their children?

250
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,925
Why are you yelling at me?

251
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,053
-I can't even ask?
-Don't talk to me.

252
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,056
You're so coldhearted.

253
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,058
It's because of you.

254
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,770
Then you should've just gone
to the wedding.

255
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,647
You ruined my day.

256
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,067
Do you think I'd be able to smile
and bless them?

257
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,863
I'm really okay. You should use it.

258
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,240
Try it. It's moisturizing.

259
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,242
I don't like my face getting sticky.

260
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,412
Dry skin creates wrinkles.
Women these days use one every day.

261
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,748
You should try it. She wants you to.

262
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,500
Fine. Put it down.

263
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,668
No. I'll put this on your face for you.

264
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,670
-Do you want one?
-Sure.

265
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,052
It's so cold.

266
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,888
It's refreshing, not cold.

267
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,232
You're right. It is refreshing.

268
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,027
-How long do I leave this on?
-About 15 minutes.

269
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,196
Stay still.

270
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,533
-A photo?
-Yes.

271
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,786
-No, don't.
-Why not? Your face is covered.

272
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,329
Honey, do this.

273
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,373
What? The Scream?

274
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,049
-Don't show your friends.
-Of course not.

275
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,594
Let me see.

276
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,514
It's not that funny.
Look at it whenever you feel down.

277
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,106
I'm glad we have a daughter
who does this for us.

278
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,400
We have a wonderful daughter

279
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,319
and a wonderful son.

280
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,280
We have everything except for money.

281
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,824
What's the point of having
a lot of money in the bank?

282
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,450
We have a roof over our heads.

283
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,287
I'm truly grateful that you feel that way.

284
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,290
It's all thanks to you.
Imagine I'm the sole breadwinner.

285
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,668
Back in high school, there was
this pretty girl from a wealthy family.

286
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,338
She married into one of the top 30
conglomerate families.

287
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,633
-You mean Duna E&C?
-Yes. Her name's Joo Ma-ri.

288
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:40,304
She ended up divorcing her husband
because of his affairs.

289
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,723
-What about their kids?
-Just one son.

290
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,308
And he's all grown up now.

291
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,477
The husband had two children
with other women.

292
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,688
-Illegitimate children?
-Yes.

293
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:53,317
I'm sure she was always dressed
in luxury items,

294
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,902
but I doubt she was happy.

295
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,529
Goodness.
She should've divorced him sooner.

296
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,656
She thought he could change.

297
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,618
People don't change.
It's almost impossible.

298
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,121
So I have no complaints
about our marriage life.

299
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,373
In fact, I'm very thankful.

300
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,000
I feel the same way.

301
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,324
Put these on.

302
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,038
It felt

303
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:34,668
so comfortable and dreamy.

304
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,921
I should tell her.

305
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,981
-Yes?
-I had a dream.

306
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,484
-And it's kept bothering me.
-What was it?

307
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,070
-Is Yu-sin…
-What about him?

308
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,740
I saw your bedroom in my dreams.

309
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,200
And some woman was lying in your bed.

310
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,368
So?

311
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,662
You never know.

312
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:14,124
Besides, Yu-sin is the epitome
of a handsome gentleman.

313
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,459
-I'm sure there--
-I'm busy.

314
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,294
Don't call me about these things.

315
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:22,883
Some men flirt with women nonstop
even if they don't flirt back

316
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,885
while some make sure to draw a line.

317
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,261
And Yu-sin is the latter.

318
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,264
Right. I was just worried.

319
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,142
-I'm sorry.
-I'm hanging up.

320
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,769
Okay.

321
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,565
Gosh, she ruined my morning.

322
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,805
-Hello.
-Hi, Jae-in.

323
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,557
-Are you going out?
-No, we're staying home.

324
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,773
-Order in something delicious.
-Okay.

325
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,902
Dad, you're more handsome
than usual today.

326
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,823
-Will you be coming home late?
-Yes. I'm having dinner outside.

327
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:28,907
Have a nice day, then.

328
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,367
You too.

329
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:34,371
I envy you.

330
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,874
My dad has always had a huge belly.

331
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,920
I've never seen him looking slim.

332
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,881
That's a beer belly.

333
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,138
Goodness.

334
00:23:56,434 --> 00:24:00,147
Why are you here so early?
I was going to wait for you.

335
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,108
I shouldn't make a lady wait.

336
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,819
But this was my invitation.
It's not right.

337
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,279
To me, it is right.

338
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,824
You look different today.

339
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,534
Did I look lousy in my office?

340
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,454
No. You looked like
a stereotypical head of department.

341
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,581
A professional.

342
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,292
I looked this place up
and saw that there was a dress code.

343
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,253
That's why I dressed up a little.

344
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,547
Next time,
I won't tell you the restaurant name.

345
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,464
Why not?

346
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,550
So you can't look up the menu beforehand.

347
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,179
-That's not right.
-To me, it is right.

348
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,644
-May I order for you?
-Sure.

349
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,523
-Love Course, please.
-Sure.

350
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,445
You said you were the freest in February.

351
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,864
Did you spend some quality time
with your family?

352
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,699
My wife also works.

353
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,785
I just read some books
I had wanted to read and rested.

354
00:24:56,453 --> 00:25:00,248
Ga-bin… I mean, Professor Nam,
I also watched your performance online.

355
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,167
I'm not a professor yet.

356
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,960
You can just call me by my name.

357
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,879
I was really amazed.

358
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:10,175
You're quite petite, yet you sing so well
with such strong charisma.

359
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,219
You're incredible.

360
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,930
Thank you for your kind words.

361
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,391
Do you ever encounter an awful audience?

362
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,560
-Of course.
-Like what?

363
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,855
Various types of people
watch my performances.

364
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,400
I remember these two people vividly.
One of them is a woman.

365
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,862
She watched the same musical
over and over again.

366
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,240
-Why?
-She just loved it.

367
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:37,327
She came more than ten times a month
but never showed much reaction.

368
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,996
She always sat
in the center of the front row

369
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,415
and watched with a straight face.

370
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,834
When I have an audience like her,

371
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,671
I feel embarrassed
and not as enthusiastic.

372
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,047
I bet.

373
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,677
Didn't the song suit
today's weather perfectly?

374
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,389
Ms. Sa must be able to foresee the future.
She always picks the right songs.

375
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,309
I'd like to hold a contest
to pick my nickname as a DJ.

376
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,687
Is there a prize? Of course, there is.

377
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,147
Instead of DJ so-and-so,

378
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,317
I'd like to have a unique nickname.

379
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,986
I'll look forward to it.

380
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,281
Please send us lots of suggestions.
You want me to come up with one?

381
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,741
Username 4588 says, "I'll think about it."

382
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,495
"The Grateful" will be back
after the commercial break.

383
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,918
DJ Afternoon sounds odd too.

384
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,504
I'm sure they'll come up
with a brilliant nickname.

385
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,298
Our listeners are really creative.

386
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,134
Can the staff participate
and also win the prize?

387
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,844
-I'll buy you a meal.
-Not that.

388
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:39,139
It costs more than the prize.
Besides, the prize is from the company.

389
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,974
Have you thought of a good one?

390
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,184
-What meal?
-You like Korean food, right?

391
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,227
I'll treat you to some.

392
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,938
-Why do you think I like Korean food?
-You're a Korean guy.

393
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,357
And all Korean men like rice.

394
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,401
-It's either rice or noodles.
-You're right.

395
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,154
Five seconds.

396
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,949
Five seconds.

397
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,832
Someone from Chuncheon, the lakeside city,
sent us a funny story.

398
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:09,544
What do you usually tell your students
when giving advice?

399
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,171
First, I tell them

400
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:15,592
that their success as an actor
doesn't determine their success in life.

401
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,928
I emphasize that this is only
a part of their life.

402
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:23,808
"Becoming an actor is only a means.
It should only be a stepping stone,

403
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,977
not your final goal.

404
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,271
Becoming famous
doesn't define success in life,

405
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:32,192
and don't think your life is a failure
just because you're not famous either."

406
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:36,029
I make them debate among themselves,
but it's easier said than done.

407
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,114
Freshman students are accustomed

408
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,034
to the cramming they received
for the past 12 years,

409
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,203
so they have trouble
expressing their thoughts.

410
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:47,082
Once you begin teaching,
you'll realize how difficult it is.

411
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,292
They have poor presentation skills

412
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,253
and stray away from the topic often.

413
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,464
I used to be like that.

414
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,092
I understand what you're saying.

415
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:06,309
Thank you for sharing such good words
over dinner.

416
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,770
It's my pleasure.
I'm glad if I was of help.

417
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:16,444
Are you also one of those people
who are married to their jobs?

418
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,908
I guess so.

419
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,620
You must have many male fans.

420
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:26,913
I do.

421
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:32,836
They send me flowers, chocolate, books,

422
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,004
and even their artwork.

423
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,840
You're lucky to have that occupation.

424
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,259
You get to do what you want
and be popular.

425
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,511
I'm not popular, you see.

426
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,805
Maybe not to the public,

427
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,724
but I bet your students love you.

428
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,518
Am I right?

429
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:01,072
Dongmi. Is your leg feeling all better?

430
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,116
Good.

431
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:08,121
Whether it be people or animals,
their relationships matter the most.

432
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,873
I wonder if

433
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:14,711
your kids are being loved and doted on
without being abused.

434
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,838
Goodness, Dongmi.

435
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,924
Dongmi, that's your food.
Your food's here.

436
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,262
Sir, did you know
there are kindergartens for dogs?

437
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,515
-"Kindergartens for dogs"?
-Yes.

438
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,935
They're just like the ones kids go to.
They even have snack time.

439
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,690
Look into it.

440
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:49,788
Your performance was impressive.
Seo Dong-ma.

441
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,922
-That's about 100 roses, right?
-Yes.

442
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,509
So that's how big the number is.

443
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,135
-Who sent it?
-A fan.

444
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,553
A male fan?

445
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,141
I doubt "Seo Dong-ma" is a female name.

446
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,690
-Did you make a reservation?
-Under Lee Jeong-min.

447
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:18,775
This way, please.

448
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:33,706
It's not this room.

449
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,002
You're meeting President Lee, right?

450
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,504
Yes.

451
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,179
-Are you the secretary?
-I'm Seo Dong-ma.

452
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,654
Is President Lee not coming?

453
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:07,282
President Lee made
this appointment for me,

454
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,075
so no.

455
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,464
A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO MUSICALS

456
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,967
LAWYER PAN SA-HYEON

457
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,350
What's the occasion?

458
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,394
It's been a while
since we had dinner together.

459
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,188
-I was going to go work out.
-Didn't you go this morning?

460
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,733
I changed my schedule starting today.

461
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,067
Why?

462
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,695
It's too tiring to go in the morning.

463
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,572
I get drowsy in the afternoon.

464
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,407
You should use your time wisely.

465
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,660
You have work gatherings in the evening,
and I might stop by as well.

466
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,287
I can skip on those days.

467
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,873
You still have to pay
if you cancel on the day.

468
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,334
-Isn't it a waste of money?
-Don't worry about it.

469
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,085
Just work out in the morning.

470
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,129
If you get drowsy, have a cup of coffee.

471
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,673
Once you start skipping classes,
you won't go at all.

472
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,176
Okay?

473
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,933
My show's ratings were high.

474
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,434
That's great.

475
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,228
I might become busier. Do understand.

476
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,772
It can't be helped.

477
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,152
Last one.

478
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,530
Good job. Put down the dumbbell.

479
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,615
Stand up slowly.

480
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,034
-That's all for today.
-Thank you.

481
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,456
He didn't come today either.

482
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,961
He was too much of a gentleman to tell me

483
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,339
that he didn't appreciate
my obnoxiousness.

484
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,599
I should've acted my age.
I made a fool of myself.

485
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,147
Professor Park, you have such great skin.

486
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,401
-Really?
-Do you do anything special?

487
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,861
Of course not.
I'm a guy, so what would I do?

488
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,781
Many men these days
take great care of themselves.

489
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,908
Really? I only saw that on TV.

490
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,118
Yes.

491
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,465
-The sheet mask we put on…
-Yes?

492
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:33,261
Why don't we do it again?
I liked how my skin became moist and nice.

493
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,596
Sure.

494
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,267
Your wife seems to cook breakfast
for you every day.

495
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,184
Of course.

496
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,478
Home-cooked meals give us men

497
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,273
a sense of healing and relaxation.

498
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,195
When they prepare a feast,
it makes us feel like kings.

499
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,367
But if your wife is a celebrity,
you could forgo that.

500
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,703
DJs aren't that popular.

501
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,912
She's pretty too.

502
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,914
They're all the same once they age.

503
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,708
What's important is their heart.

504
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,168
Look at you all grown up.

505
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,889
-That one, please.
-Okay.

506
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,433
How many candles do you need?

507
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,394
Twenty-eight, please.

508
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:30,962
MANAGER KIM

509
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,926
Hello?

510
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,346
Hello? Mi?

511
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,056
Hello.

512
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,810
Can we talk?

513
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:46,853
Yes.

514
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,354
Are you in LA?

515
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,606
No.

516
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,276
I'm back in Korea.

517
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,528
-Where are you?
-At home.

518
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:56,571
The same apartment?

519
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,699
-Yes.
-I'll be right there.

520
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:03,286
It'll take about 50 minutes.
I'm in Bundang for horseback riding.

521
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,496
Okay.

522
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:41,324
-Just us again?
-Yes. Your dad's gone horseback riding.

523
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,785
-Doesn't he look handsome?
-He's the best.

524
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,747
You should go horse-riding too
when you go to middle school.

525
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,124
-But I'm scared.
-Don't be.

526
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,834
He's never fallen off so far.

527
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,628
I'm scared of horses.

528
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,756
They have humongous eyes
and gigantic faces.

529
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,969
Is there no meat?

530
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,805
It's beef brisket fried rice.

531
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:11,979
Even when you're having just fried rice,
don't eat it straight out of the pan.

532
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,898
Put it in a pretty bowl.

533
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,733
It makes it look nicer.

534
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,318
Yes. It looks tastier.

535
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,820
Teach your daughter to do the same thing.

536
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,490
What if I have a son?
What if I don't get married?

537
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,076
Even sons need to know these things.

538
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,745
And I'm certain you will get married.

539
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:31,082
-Why?
-Those who say they won't always do.

540
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,042
Did you not want to?

541
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,586
-No.
-Why?

542
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,213
No reason.

543
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,840
What do you mean?
You must've had a reason.

544
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,635
You first. Why do you
not want to get married?

545
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,598
I will.
I can't think of any reason not to.

546
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,935
What about you?

547
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,062
I wondered,

548
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:56,440
"Will marriage make me happy?"
I wouldn't know. I was single.

549
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,276
So how is it?

550
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,321
I'm so happy to be living
with you and your dad.

551
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,864
I'm glad I got married.

552
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,536
I should marry someone like Dad.

553
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:13,499
It'll be hard for an average man
to satisfy your dad.

554
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,001
He should satisfy me first.

555
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,841
The doors are closing.

556
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,408
PULL THE HANDLE

557
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:15,728
Mi.

558
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,662
Where were you?

559
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,166
I went down to my car.

560
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,716
I can't go anywhere dressed like this.

561
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,385
Have a seat.

562
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,487
-Is it your birthday today?
-Yes.

563
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,596
You should've called me sooner.

564
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,268
-When did you come back?
-The day I told you I would.

565
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:45,776
You should've called in the morning.
I would've booked us a restaurant.

566
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,996
-Were you sick?
-Not my body.

567
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,417
None of the medicines you gave me

568
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,919
was for the pain in my heart.

569
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,674
You should've consulted me.

570
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,342
I'll do as you say.

571
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,058
I missed you.

572
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,437
I did.

573
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,192
I just came…

574
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,126
It's wintertime.
Wouldn't it be cold for him?

575
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,045
He's healthy, so he'll stay warm.

576
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,005
He says it's cool and nice.

577
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,383
I don't get it.

578
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,842
Once you get married,

579
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:36,679
do this for your husband,
and he'll love it.

580
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,182
How could you do this every single day?
You're incredible.

581
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,726
Your dad's devoted himself to our family.

582
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,436
He's a good dad and a good husband.

583
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,605
A wonderful son and an excellent doctor.

584
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,908
I'm the best wife in the world.

585
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,937
-You're not asleep, are you?
-No.

586
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,861
Don't you smell soap?

587
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,655
I don't know. I have a stuffy nose.

588
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:41,285
-Do you have a cold?
-My limbs are aching.

589
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:43,245
I think I'm coming down with a cold.

590
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,706
I shouldn't get it.

591
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,334
Can you crank up the heat? I'm cold.

592
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,877
Do you have a fever?

593
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,589
-Do we have any black herbal tea?
-I finished it.

594
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:57,885
I had some and gave some to the staff.
You know I get cold easily.

595
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,851
You should sleep in the living room.

596
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,146
I really can't get sick.

597
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,357
-But I can?
-I have to go on air.

598
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,987
Okay? Do you really want me
to sleep in the living room?

599
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,491
-Do I have to leave?
-It's better than getting both of us sick.

600
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,919
You should've been careful like me.

601
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,346
Take out a thick blanket.

602
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,557
-Should I do it for you?
-Forget it.

603
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,872
Don't go to the gym tomorrow.

604
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,127
Good night.

605
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,936
Did Mr. Kim stop by?

606
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,104
Yes.

607
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,066
-Look at this.
-What is that?

608
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,734
Dongmi's kindergarten uniform.

609
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:42,489
-You're sending Dongmi to kindergarten?
-Yes. A kindergarten for dogs.

610
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:47,035
-You're joking, right?
-I'm not.

611
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,663
Look at this hat.

612
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,959
This is her backpack.

613
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,420
We need to pack her snacks and kibble.

614
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:57,838
Goodness.

615
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:02,134
Let me borrow Byeol-hui's words
and say, "Ridiculous."

616
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,177
A dog kindergarten?

617
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,179
She needs to go there.

618
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,598
She needs to make friends and exercise.

619
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,851
You have too much money. Unbelievable.

620
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,936
It's no different from the elderly

621
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,063
going to culture centers
or community centers.

622
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,566
Dogs can feel lonely and bored as well.

623
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:20,152
-How much is the tuition?
-You don't need to know that.

624
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,322
We live in a strange world these days.

625
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,407
So? When will she start attending?

626
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:28,744
Just pick up the phone.
And change the ringtone. It's too noisy.

627
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,919
Sa-hyeon, How surprising.
Why are you calling at this hour?

628
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:42,007
Mom, do you have
any jujube ginger tea at home?

629
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,763
There must be some extract in the freezer.

630
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,516
What's wrong with your voice?
Are you sick?

631
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,017
I have a cold and fever.

632
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,395
Oh, dear. You must've overworked yourself.

633
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,231
Do you have anything at home?

634
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,399
Didn't Dr. Cho send you
some black herbal tea?

635
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,277
-We finished it.
-What should I do?

636
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,906
Ask Hye-ryung to make you
some warm honey tea.

637
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,825
I had bought all the ingredients.
Did she not make you any?

638
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,036
It's too late right now.

639
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,080
She just needs to boil it for two hours.

640
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:17,417
Could you have Mr. Kim
bring some over tomorrow?

641
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,212
Okay. Will you be able to go to work?

642
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,216
I have a trial scheduled for tomorrow.

643
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:27,386
Then you should go to bed. Good night.

644
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,475
Did you have to make such a big deal
out of a simple cold?

645
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,144
What would that make me?

646
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:39,231
She might think I don't care
whether her husband's sick.

647
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,316
Aren't you even worried about me?

648
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,527
You might feel better tomorrow.

649
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,488
Having some hot bean sprout and rice soup
in the morning

650
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,198
could make you feel better.

651
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,162
You're so thoughtless.

652
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:57,916
Grow up. Quit acting like a baby.

653
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,712
-"Baby"?
-In that feeble voice…

654
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,881
If I were you, I wouldn't tell my parents
so they won't get worried.

655
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,758
But I need to get well soon.

656
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:09,595
You could call Dr. Cho tomorrow
and ask him to send you some.

657
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:12,639
After hearing her beloved youngest son
caught a cold,

658
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,850
she won't be able to sleep well.

659
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,446
Gosh, she's so inconsiderate.

660
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,741
She's so selfish.

661
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:36,038
Why didn't you change?

662
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,497
I was too lazy.

663
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:41,460
-I guess you guys didn't drink.
-We just chatted.

664
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:43,503
At times, men are chattier than women.

665
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,339
Tell me about it.

666
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,549
I'm sure you were just as chatty.

667
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,513
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

668
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:57,225
Chatting is more exhausting
than horseback riding.

669
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:01,021
I used up all the energy
from horseback riding on chatting.

670
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,023
You should've left first.

671
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,233
I had to maintain my connections.

672
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,778
There was one chairman
who hadn't come in a long time.

673
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,238
Are you too tired to embrace your wife?

674
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,949
I put aside some energy for that.

675
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:01,289
Song Yuan, I'm sick.

676
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:28,150
I didn't get married
to be treated like this.

677
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:33,447
-Is he coughing?
-No, not quite.

678
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,948
It's the onset of the flu.

679
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,492
I'll concoct some medicine
instead of black herbal tea,

680
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,744
in individual packets.

681
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,663
Okay. Thank you.

682
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,373
Dongmi.

683
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,250
Is Mr. Kim here?

684
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,294
He's on his way here
from Sa-hyeon's office.

685
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:48,962
His wife is of no use.

686
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:51,131
Having a wife doesn't mean
he won't get sick.

687
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,967
-Jun-jae.
-Yes?

688
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:58,430
Pack some kibble and snacks
in this bag for Dongmi.

689
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,682
-Okay.
-But not too much.

690
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,976
Dongmi's treated better than most people.

691
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:04,603
I know.

692
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,357
Puppies,

693
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,485
when your new friend hops on, don't bark.

694
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:15,197
Say, "Welcome!"
Don't scare the new student.

695
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,825
Really?

696
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:23,538
Let's go to kindergarten.
Hold on, Dongmi. Goodness.

697
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,790
Goodness.

698
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,584
Hello.

699
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,212
I'm Audrey.

700
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,548
So you're Dongmi.

701
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,051
My, how pretty you are!

702
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,302
Goodness.

703
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:42,349
Goodness, you look so young.

704
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,685
But it looks like
you've already had puppies.

705
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,854
Is she married or not?

706
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:52,275
Sir, did you pack her snacks and kibble?

707
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:57,572
All right. Say bye to Daddy.

708
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,699
Bye.

709
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,701
-What is it?
-Next time.

710
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:02,869
What do you mean?

711
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,914
She's not feeling too well today.
I'll send her next time.

712
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:09,668
We have a nurse's office. Don't worry.

713
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:12,546
-No.
-But you've registered.

714
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,339
I didn't do it.

715
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:18,343
In any case, aren't you Mr. Pan Mun-ho?

716
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,887
We received money under that name.

717
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,557
-I won't send her.
-Why not?

718
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,895
You look scary. She'll be so scared.

719
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:32,440
What did you say?
What's wrong with my face?

720
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,025
Wait, grandpa!

721
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,697
-"Grandpa"?
-You're being too rude.

722
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,323
Have you looked into the mirror?

723
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,367
I'm not a grandpa.

724
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,578
I'm her dad.

725
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,955
Whatever. I don't care what you are.

726
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:49,165
How dare you judge my face?

727
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:52,961
Forget it. I don't need a refund,
so just leave.

728
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,297
How can I when my pride is hurt?

729
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,423
Suit yourself.

730
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,303
Do you never look into the mirror?

731
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:04,723
You're going to scare her.
She'll have a fit.

732
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,685
You're giving me a fit.

733
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,855
My heart aches.

734
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:15,233
My puppies love me so much, you know?

735
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,986
Look at them. They're not even barking.

736
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:19,321
They're too intimidated.

737
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,865
-Wait.
-Stop.

738
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,825
Please don't cause a scene.

739
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:27,621
Ma'am, no one has ever humiliated me
like this before.

740
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:31,374
How could he think of judging
someone's appearance and hurting them?

741
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:35,629
What about him? What about your husband?

742
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:39,466
He and I are just the same
when it comes to looks.

743
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:42,844
He tends to talk like that.

744
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,641
She is frightening.

745
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,351
All right. You need to bounce.

746
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,603
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

747
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,897
-That's good.
-Hold the reins.

748
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,858
Relax your legs and lower your heels.

749
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,193
Lower them. Okay.

750
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,694
-Are you comfortable?
-Yes.

751
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,991
Dong-mi, sing a song for me.

752
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:13,875
A small leaf falls

753
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:19,547
From a thin branch

754
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:27,222
Even if you are a tree

755
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:31,977
Even if I'm a leaf

756
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:38,191
-Nothing is left
-This is fun.

757
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:39,401
You're doing great.

758
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:45,198
-Are you getting the hang of it?
-In our relationship

759
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:51,788
Even if you are a tree

760
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:58,003
-Don't lift the reins. Do this.
-And I am a leaf

761
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:38,710
HEAD OF DEPARTMENT, THEATER AND FILM
PARK HAE-RYUN

762
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,422
You slept in for once.

763
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,133
Goodness.

764
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,593
I couldn't sleep well.

765
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:15,348
-Are you feeling ill?
-Remember that kindergarten teacher?

766
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,684
Audrey or something.

767
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,228
-Yes?
-I saw her in my dreams.

768
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:23,356
She glared and chased me around.
I was scared to death.

769
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,483
Don't be so dramatic.

770
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,444
I should be careful today.

771
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,990
-How's Sa-hyeon doing?
-He's doing much better now.

772
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:34,701
My family never gets sick under my care.

773
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:37,412
When he ate my food,
he never caught a cold.

774
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,789
I'll give you that.

775
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:41,332
So Ye-jeong.

776
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,127
You do take great care of your family.

777
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:45,670
What else?

778
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,467
What else?

779
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,927
I have to pee.

780
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,598
I picked it out myself.
Exchange it if you want.

781
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,236
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

782
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:58,201
MY LOVE

783
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:01,329
I love it so much. I "wuv" you.

784
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:09,170
Huh?

785
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,421
You're here early.

786
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,465
A variety show producer wanted to see me.

787
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:15,176
-Are you interested?
-No, I'm too busy.

788
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,095
But we should at least talk.

789
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:19,973
Gosh, isn't that new?

790
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,183
When did you buy it?

791
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:25,061
My husband bought it for me
as a surprise gift.

792
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:28,690
Gosh, I'm so jealous.
You have a great husband.

793
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,485
Mine has nothing to offer
but his young age.

794
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:35,029
My husband wasn't good
at these things too at first.

795
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:38,950
But after some time, his love grew,
and he became sweeter.

796
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:42,745
Hey.

797
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,833
-Did you just finish?
-Yes.

798
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,710
I thought I'd see you at this hour.

799
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,839
-Maybe I'll just skip it.
-Don't do that.

800
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,716
You're going to have dinner, right?

801
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:58,094
There's a place nearby
that offers a great barbecue.

802
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:10,481
-I was sick.
-Oh, no. Was it because of that night?

803
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:13,192
No. It's because I didn't drink
any burdock tea.

804
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:16,946
Having a glass of your warm burdock tea
before working out kept me nice and warm.

805
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,157
But I had to drink cold water.

806
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:23,536
I fell ill from overworking myself.

807
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,205
Did you skip work?

808
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,708
I had a trial to attend, so I had to go.

809
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:32,045
Are you okay now?
You shouldn't overwork yourself.

810
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,173
I'm here because I am.

811
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:37,425
I was worried.

812
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,136
I kept wondering.

813
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:41,346
About what?

814
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,723
If I had made a mistake that night.

815
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,559
Gosh. You didn't.

816
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,646
It's my fault for ordering alcohol,
not knowing you can't drink.

817
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,230
I could've just drank alone.

818
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,191
At least we had fun.

819
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:58,905
My wife doesn't let me work out
in the evening.

820
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,741
She says it'll get in the way
of work and gatherings.

821
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,576
That's true.

822
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,286
What have you been up to?

823
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:09,791
Once I do my work, clean the house,

824
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:12,210
buy groceries, and work out,
it's already nighttime.

825
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:13,670
Didn't you wonder about me?

826
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,798
I was worried about you instead.

827
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:19,258
How did you come today
if she didn't let you?

828
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,968
Because I had no plans.

829
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:24,931
Then you should've gone straight home
and spent time with your wife.

830
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,265
Have dinner with her.

831
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,852
We only see each other sleeping
during the weekdays.

832
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,814
When I go to work in the morning,
she's fast asleep.

833
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:36,359
-Here's your food.
-Thank you.

834
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,072
Gosh, I want a drink.

835
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,991
Go ahead. Don't mind me.

836
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:46,411
-It's okay.
-At least a glass of wine.

837
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:49,831
I don't want to drink alone
or pay for a chauffeur after one drink.

838
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,795
Which cut is this?

839
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,714
It's beef tongue. It's good.

840
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,802
I'll skip this dish.

841
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,847
I don't want a cow's tongue touching mine.

842
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,436
Okay. Bye.

843
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:16,607
That was Ji-a. She'd like to
at least go to a skating rink.

844
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:17,859
Is that so?

845
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:21,028
We'll go wherever our granddaughter
wants to go.

846
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,740
Can you skate?

847
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:28,244
Yes, I was pretty good when I skated
with Yu-sin years back. But now…

848
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:31,122
Right. We shouldn't break our bones.

849
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:36,711
-Honey!
-Hurry.

850
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,880
Join us, Mom.

851
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:40,465
U-ram, be careful.

852
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:44,218
It would've been nicer
if Yu-sin had come too.

853
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:45,762
He loved to skate.

854
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:47,805
He told me.

855
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:50,641
You guys learned to skate
when he was in elementary school.

856
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,144
Yes. I figure-skated.

857
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:58,274
-Huh? Ji-a!
-U-Ram!

858
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,195
-I can't believe I ran into you.
-Me neither.

859
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:04,363
-Are you good at skating?
-Goodness.

860
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,990
Look at them having fun.

861
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:18,795
-Even your husband's here.
-Yes, we all came together.

862
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:21,547
My husband went to an impromptu gathering.

863
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,009
My parents-in-law are over there.

864
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:27,804
I should go say hello.

865
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,724
-She must've met a friend.
-She did.

866
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:35,102
It's great to be back.

867
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:37,522
This place has changed quite a bit.

868
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,575
Did you sleep well?

869
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:50,701
Put on your seatbelt.

870
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,122
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

871
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:01,754
-Aren't you cold?
-No. I'm dressed warmly.

872
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,467
This is the writer of my radio program.

873
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,803
Hello. Please stay seated.

874
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:10,638
-It's okay.
-And this is her husband.

875
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:13,099
Hello, I'm Park Hae-ryun.

876
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,184
Goodness. It's nice to meet you.

877
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:17,770
You seem like a wonderful couple.

878
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:21,524
Her youngest son and Ji-a
were in the same class in first grade.

879
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,818
-You must've had him late.
-I did.

880
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:25,611
Please have a seat.

881
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,239
-Let's go have some tea.
-Lunch would be better.

882
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:30,616
-Should we?
-Sure.

883
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,556
Yu-sin.

884
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:57,810
I don't expect anything from you.

885
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:02,940
I'm content with seeing you like this.

886
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,742
So don't feel pressured.

887
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,162
But I can't help but feel…

888
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:18,748
If you tell me to leave,

889
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:20,666
I will.

890
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:02,208
Let's go.
I had Secretary Yoo buy us tickets.

891
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:05,920
-When's the flight?
-We have 30 minutes to get your passport.

892
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:07,964
-How many?
-Four.

893
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,174
Don't bother to change me.
I'll never change.

894
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:15,137
Since I want you guys to be honest,
I should be honest with you first.

895
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,597
Is it still ongoing?

896
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:19,642
Nothing should be for free
which is also the case this time.

897
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:20,851
But we all like freebies.

898
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:25,106
If I could ever be born again,
I'd get married three times.

899
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:27,608
-Maybe I'll shake my butt.
-Go ahead.

900
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:30,903
Why only me though? You should do it too.

901
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:39,120
Because the stage is where Ga-bin belongs.

902
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:41,455
She should never leave the stage!

903
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:44,542
I love you with all my heart

904
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:49,422
