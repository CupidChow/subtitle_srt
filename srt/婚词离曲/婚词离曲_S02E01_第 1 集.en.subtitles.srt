1
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,725
PREVIOUSLY…

2
00:00:58,808 --> 00:00:59,684
How much do you love me?

3
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:00,935
A lot.

4
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,813
You can't be bothered with anything
when you're drunk.

5
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,231
I'm fine, you know.

6
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,442
Did you have to wear
something so complicated?

7
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,329
I bet he'll be blown away
by my beauty today.

8
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,122
It's like you both
came right out of a magazine.

9
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,666
You look like models in magazines.

10
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,668
Here comes the model.

11
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,254
-You look a lot like your older sister.
-Sorry?

12
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,256
Do you know her?

13
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,674
Aren't you Ms. Lee's younger sister?

14
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,593
My gosh!

15
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,849
Dr. Shin!

16
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,229
Are you pretending not to be drunk
when you are,

17
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,897
or are you really not drunk?

18
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,732
I'm not interested in dating.

19
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:51,194
It's bound to end,
so I see it as a waste of emotions.

20
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,987
Mom!

21
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,615
One should not have to live like this!

22
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,326
You should know about the real me
before you go.

23
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,702
I already do.

24
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,912
No, you don't.

25
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,873
You may be aware of youth,
but not what comes with old age.

26
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,626
Could I perhaps use you?

27
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,086
Use me how?

28
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,923
I'd like you to be my rebound
so that I can get over him.

29
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,133
I think it's possible.

30
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,057
How old is your son?

31
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:21,975
He's 16.

32
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,560
Then he's 12 years younger

33
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,270
than his sister.

34
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:29,899
Because our daughter is 28.

35
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,052
EPISODE 1

36
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,386
Does it hurt?

37
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,764
No.

38
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,578
The phone is turned off.
Your call will be directed to voicemail.

39
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,436
I should tell my parents about this place.

40
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,313
It was so relaxing.

41
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,065
Right?

42
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,275
Yes.

43
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,374
PREGNANCY TEST

44
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:07,718
Won.

45
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,012
Yes?

46
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,932
Are you feeling nauseous?

47
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,976
No, I'm fine.

48
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,687
Your brother wants to have
sea urchin noodles in Seogwipo.

49
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,730
Okay.

50
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,906
Okay.

51
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,621
Hye-ryung's parents will be flying out
next Wednesday.

52
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,748
We should have a meal once more
before then.

53
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,126
Right. We should.

54
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,129
No one our age should be living abroad.

55
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,173
Our country
has the best health care system.

56
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,135
You should only emigrate if you're young.

57
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,929
They're asking for trouble.

58
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,516
Anyway, I'm glad it's not cancer.

59
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,397
Is your wife okay with it?

60
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,816
I mean, you're always out until late.

61
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,611
I never went home early anyway.

62
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,905
You don't look happy these days.

63
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,075
What is it that you want to tell me?

64
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,077
Is it something I wouldn't want to hear?

65
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,246
I feel like I've been reborn.

66
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,876
-The happier I become--
-You feel sorrier for her.

67
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,920
You feel the guilt.

68
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:28,799
I won't stop you.

69
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,261
You're free to leave me…

70
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,182
whenever you want.

71
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,100
I'd rather die.

72
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,435
Don't exaggerate.

73
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,020
I'm not.

74
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,357
I don't think I can live without you.

75
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,026
I can't.

76
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,195
Never in my wildest dreams

77
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,075
did I think I'd fall for you.

78
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,709
I'd love to sing right now.

79
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,673
Nobody will recognize your face
since it's dark.

80
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,466
Maybe they'll recognize your voice.

81
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,408
Sure. You can.

82
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,059
Even if

83
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,107
The chilling wind torments us

84
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:14,947
We will just embrace each other
even tightly

85
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:21,412
As long as we're together

86
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,754
Then he's 12 years younger
than his sister.

87
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,466
Because our daughter is 28.

88
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,888
You don't seem to have thought
about her at all.

89
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,515
How could I not?

90
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,687
She grew up into a fine, young woman.

91
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:55,863
I guess everyone's bound to age,
myself included.

92
00:10:56,572 --> 00:11:00,576
You were a good-looking man
who grabbed all the women's attention.

93
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,499
Does she know about me?

94
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,876
Would you like her to know?

95
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,338
"Your biological father
is curious about you.

96
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,339
Care to meet him?"

97
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:15,841
What's her name?

98
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,018
Let me think about
whether I want that prescription or not,

99
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,019
Doctor.

100
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,105
Sure.

101
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,810
Everyone here got to enjoy
your performance for free.

102
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,271
Care for another glass?

103
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,570
Don't I look happy these days?

104
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,741
I'm sorry.
I've become more stable and happier.

105
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,119
But for you, things are more complicated.

106
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:28,497
I've decided to live a simple life,
as long as it's all right with you.

107
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,835
I don't think living a double life
is fair for anyone.

108
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,256
I'm going to tell my wife the truth
and end our marriage.

109
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,927
You're going to tell her about me?

110
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:46,515
No. I'll never tell her about you
no matter what.

111
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,687
I'll just tell her that I'm having
second thoughts about our marriage.

112
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,066
-It's true.
-Only after meeting me.

113
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,028
I just put up with it.

114
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,534
Is this too much for you?

115
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,581
I just think it's not right

116
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,209
although our relationship itself
is not right to begin with.

117
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:14,919
I'll take care of it.

118
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,295
Do you think it'll work?

119
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,088
I'll end it on good terms.

120
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,221
We couldn't shop much
because we were too busy eating good food.

121
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,723
We'll do it next time.

122
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:30,017
Brian's girlfriend is pretty.

123
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,144
She's kind and well-mannered.

124
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,606
Make sure Brandon learns horseback riding.

125
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,608
It's good for men going through puberty.

126
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,986
Wrestling with a wayward horse
will prevent him from causing trouble.

127
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,488
I'll recommend it to him.

128
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,408
-Mi.
-Yes?

129
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,661
I'm listening.

130
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:54,041
Were you ever curious
about your real father?

131
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,628
Then is our dad fake?

132
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,923
"Biological father" sounds too weird.

133
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,135
At times, I do think about him.

134
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,391
Do you want to see him?

135
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,560
Can I?

136
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,982
He's not a celebrity, right?

137
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,525
Come on.

138
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,113
Does he want to see me?

139
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,537
Forget it then.

140
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,126
Hey.

141
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,007
What's wrong?

142
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:47,887
Do you know him?

143
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,484
Who is he?

144
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,778
-He's our engineer.
-So?

145
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,990
I feel uncomfortable.

146
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,409
-It's fine.
-I'll be at the lounge.

147
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,577
See you later.

148
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,736
Come here.

149
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,370
I just don't get it.

150
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,914
You have a beautiful body.

151
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,332
It's embarrassing.

152
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,085
He didn't look like he was married.

153
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,836
-Divorced?
-Bachelor.

154
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,967
-What?
-Are you interested in him?

155
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,720
-Jeez.
-You were being dramatic back there.

156
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,138
All women are like that.

157
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,516
We don't want to show our bodies
to other men.

158
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,184
They still go to swimming pools.

159
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,396
-Then why were you blushing?
-Was I?

160
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,815
You were.

161
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,191
I was just flustered.

162
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,276
Don't show interest, or I'll scold you.

163
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,532
Please. You're the only man in my life.

164
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,789
I just complimented you.
Do you have nothing to say back?

165
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,749
Judge a man by his action, not his words.

166
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,179
Are you resting?

167
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,223
All right.

168
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,893
Pick anything you like.

169
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,104
I don't need any more bags.
How about a coat?

170
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,397
Sure.

171
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,487
-Hello.
-Hello.

172
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,573
-These are our new items.
-I see.

173
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,287
MANAGER KIM

174
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,622
My mom just went through immigration.

175
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,754
-I'd like to try this on.
-Sure.

176
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,214
See you at Sunset at 6 p.m.

177
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,145
Where have you been?

178
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,356
At my brother's.

179
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,066
In Jeju?

180
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,444
You could have at least texted me.

181
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,364
Do you know how agitated
and worried I was?

182
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,785
I missed you.

183
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:47,709
My parents-in-law flew in from Canada
to receive medical treatment.

184
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,880
They'll fly out next week,
so I'll ask for divorce after that.

185
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,092
Don't do that. I beg you.

186
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,136
Don't worry about it.

187
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,809
Don't cry.

188
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,103
I'm…

189
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,273
pregnant.

190
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,945
I cannot believe it myself either.

191
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:16,864
But…

192
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,950
all the home pregnancy tests say so.

193
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,579
Are you serious?

194
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,590
I want to give birth to a healthy baby.

195
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,177
I must, so please don't cause any trouble.

196
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,678
I beg you.

197
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,597
Not until I give birth.

198
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,641
Okay. When will you visit the OB-GYN?

199
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,768
Let's go right away tomorrow.

200
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,312
It won't show just yet.

201
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,063
Then when?

202
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,442
How are you feeling?

203
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,070
I'm okay. I'm not nauseous either.

204
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,367
When did you find out?

205
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,577
Yesterday.

206
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,163
I've been feeling out of sorts.

207
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,916
This is unbelievable.

208
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,668
Isn't it a miracle?

209
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,672
We are meant to be.

210
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,257
Don't say that.

211
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,635
I'm not relieved about this.

212
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,554
Okay. I won't say a thing
for the next ten months.

213
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,514
Is there any food you crave?

214
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,935
I had lots of tangerines in Jeju.

215
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,478
Something else.

216
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,356
Are strawberries not in season right now?

217
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,525
You should leave.

218
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,902
Why?

219
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,905
You should. Don't ever come back.

220
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,407
How could I do that?

221
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,119
Think about me.

222
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:50,332
Keep this up, and we'll get caught.

223
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,668
I promise I won't get caught
until you give birth.

224
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,211
You can't guarantee that.

225
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,881
Please help me be at peace.

226
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,050
Our baby should receive my energy too.

227
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,761
After all, I'm the dad.
It needs to hear my voice too.

228
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,806
That's the right thing to do.
It's the best for our baby.

229
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,516
Don't you think so?

230
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,188
Let's go have dinner.
Or should we unpack first?

231
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,898
I need to wash them.

232
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,067
I'll do the laundry.

233
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,236
Don't do anything. You just stay put.

234
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,405
I'll hire a helper. Don't worry.

235
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,497
How will I sleep tonight?

236
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,165
I might as well stay up.

237
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,127
I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

238
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,421
You can't do that. Go get some rest.

239
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,964
I'll go buy some food.

240
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,385
Let's just think about our baby.

241
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,470
Are you that happy?

242
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,265
I'm more than happy.

243
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,352
I could even dance.
Tell me to dance, and I will. Should I?

244
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,022
That's okay.

245
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,399
I can't believe this blessing
we've received.

246
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,109
You won't cause any trouble, right?

247
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,240
"My husband told me this.

248
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,159
When a woman in her twenties
goes to the OB-GYN,

249
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,746
they say, 'My God,
isn't she too young to be here?'

250
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,289
When it's a woman in her thirties,

251
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,416
'Why have you gotten pregnant so early?'

252
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,084
When it's a woman in her forties,

253
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,712
'Welcome. I'm glad you're here.'

254
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,213
When it's a woman in her fifties,

255
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,507
'Those in their fifties can also
get pregnant now.'

256
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,384
When it's a woman in her sixties,

257
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,802
'You must be healthy.'

258
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,262
He says it's not just a joke

259
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,307
and that it reflects the social norms
and women's conditions.

260
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,226
My husband keeps begging me
to have a baby."

261
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,437
He's desperate for a baby.

262
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:39,066
"Boom, what do you think?

263
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:43,528
I got married at 44.
Should I try for a baby?"

264
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,824
I think you could.

265
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,243
But first, you should get a checkup

266
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,412
to see if you're healthy.

267
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,873
Username 4451 says,

268
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:58,460
"My sister had her first baby at 46.

269
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,669
She got a C-section,

270
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,547
but compared to her,
you're pretty much a newlywed."

271
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:06,218
BICHSALANG WOMEN'S CLINIC

272
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,347
You should leave. I'm embarrassed.

273
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,682
What do you mean? This is only natural.

274
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,311
Ms. Song Won?

275
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,146
Coming.

276
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:33,245
Is it really possible to get pregnant
in your sixties?

277
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,456
Are you naive
or do you really not know women?

278
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,668
It's just a joke.

279
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,213
Wasn't there a woman
who gave birth again in her fifties?

280
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,256
Yes.

281
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,509
Hye-ryung, it may be too late
when you have a change of heart.

282
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,969
Have at least one baby.

283
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:52,848
She's right. Your husband may leave you,
but not your kids.

284
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,517
What's the point in having kids
if I have no husband?

285
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,810
That's not true.

286
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,563
You won't be lonely.

287
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,106
Then why are you still single?

288
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:04,317
There are countless bachelors
who want kids.

289
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,988
To be frank, I like kids.

290
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,906
But I can't raise one single-handedly.

291
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,492
-Is there no possibility?
-Of what?

292
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:16,621
Perhaps, you have a kid
somewhere in this world.

293
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:21,376
-I'm certain I don't.
-You can't guarantee that.

294
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:25,088
-That's true.
-Think about all the women you've met.

295
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,175
-It's three to one.
-What do you mean?

296
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:31,094
Enough with the teasing.
You three always gang up on me.

297
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,472
We're not teasing you.
We're being serious.

298
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,561
You are pregnant.

299
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,150
That's the womb.

300
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,363
Congratulations.

301
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,327
What do I need to do next?

302
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,351
Are you?

303
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,526
Ms. Song Won?

304
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:32,072
-Coming.
-Be careful.

305
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,629
Give me some flowers as a gift.
Just a few will do.

306
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,007
-Flowers?
-I need to be congratulated.

307
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,593
Not by anyone else, but you.

308
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:57,389
You're the mother of our baby
who I'll meet in nine months.

309
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,143
What I'm feeling right now

310
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,939
is more than mere love.

311
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,024
So congratulate me.

312
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,741
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

313
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,758
Congratulations.

314
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,984
I didn't know I was this desperate…

315
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,196
to have a child.

316
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,198
Every time

317
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,368
my colleagues celebrated
their kids' first birthdays,

318
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,164
I was simply jealous.

319
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:08,251
But right now, I'm filled with emotions
that cannot be described with words.

320
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,545
Imagine how I felt.

321
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,631
I was the only one who couldn't conceive

322
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,967
and ended up getting a divorce.

323
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,886
You two weren't meant to be.

324
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,763
But we are.

325
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,223
Don't you think so? This was fate.

326
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,894
Look at where we are now.

327
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:30,315
Don't cry. Think about our baby.

328
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,526
It'll probably think
that you're a crybaby.

329
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,237
I can't help it.

330
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,699
It has finally hit me.

331
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,708
I'd like to take you to a fine restaurant.

332
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,502
But today, I'll cook for you.

333
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,713
I want to commemorate today.

334
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,174
I'll flatter myself in front of our baby.

335
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:00,553
"The day we found out about you,

336
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:04,432
I cooked for both you and your mom…

337
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:10,438
out of gratitude and love."

338
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,784
I won't stop myself from crying today.

339
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,306
Do more of this.

340
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,105
Would you like to watch me cook

341
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,815
or just lie down?

342
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,483
I'll watch.

343
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,362
I heard lying down for too long
isn't good for the baby.

344
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,865
Then come out
once I'm done stir-frying the onions.

345
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,074
It'll sting your eyes.

346
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:11,082
I can cook this and ramyeon.

347
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,085
I can also make decent kimchi stew.

348
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,713
Are you listening, my baby?

349
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,048
It doesn't have ears yet.

350
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,342
I'm sure our baby can feel it.

351
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,095
Whatever the mother feels,
the baby does as well.

352
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,096
Who told you that?

353
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,850
My mom did,
when my sister-in-law was pregnant.

354
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,878
It's perfect.

355
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,006
Don't you need kimchi?

356
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,883
I don't crave it these days.

357
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,271
Why aren't you eating?

358
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:20,109
You're the first man to cook for me
apart from my brother.

359
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,736
Did your ex-husband not cook for you?

360
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,365
I never dreamed of it
since we lived with his parents.

361
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,493
It's going to get cold.

362
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,457
Enjoy my love.

363
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,719
It's so good.

364
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:49,639
Aren't you hungry?

365
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,766
I am. I'm going to eat with you.

366
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:53,560
Go grab a spoon.

367
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,991
It's even tastier this way.

368
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,705
I want us to do everything together.

369
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,165
I can't say that I'm happy to hear that.

370
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:17,750
I know.

371
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,503
Don't think about anything.

372
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:27,176
You told me to accept everything
without being judgmental, remember?

373
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,555
Try not to judge or discriminate anything.

374
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:33,516
Just accept it. Think only about our baby.

375
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,560
Do this for our baby.

376
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,856
Don't be concerned
about me coming or leaving.

377
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,962
I think I fell in love with omelets
because of this heart.

378
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,256
I could feel my mom's love.

379
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,469
To me, omelets represent love.

380
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,978
-Are you unhappy about something?
-Yes.

381
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,148
What is it? You were fine during dinner.

382
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,276
Don't forget that I'm your husband.

383
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,444
Ask me again.

384
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,238
You're sulking again.

385
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,491
"Sulking"?

386
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,870
You were fine during dinnertime,
so what's wrong?

387
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,082
How could you only buy sweet persimmons
when I like ripe ones?

388
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,878
-Do you like ripe persimmons?
-Do you even care?

389
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,214
-I had no idea.
-I know you like them.

390
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:50,051
But you always binge on them
and get constipated.

391
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,428
So what? You're not the one
getting constipated.

392
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:56,891
That's how you get hemorrhoids.
Haven't you heard how painful it is?

393
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,481
He always calls you, but not me.

394
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,030
-Yes, my son.
-Which son am I?

395
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,950
You're my baby lawyer boy.

396
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,911
I'm not a baby.

397
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,414
Why have you called?

398
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,166
I just wanted to hear your voice.

399
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,503
Judging by your voice,
you must be happy today.

400
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,088
Did you have dinner?

401
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,048
Of course, I did.

402
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,969
Did your in-laws arrive safely?
They called, right?

403
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,179
Yes. Is dad home?

404
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,390
He's next to me.

405
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,101
Call me too, will you?

406
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,187
I worked like a dog to pay
for your schooling and marry you off.

407
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,733
Mom, can you pass the phone to him?

408
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,986
Here you go.

409
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,867
Dad, if you worked like a dog,

410
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,120
the other dads must be bedridden by now.

411
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,374
-How are you feeling?
-Good.

412
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,752
-Is there anything you need?
-Yes.

413
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:09,464
-What is it?
-I also want to drive a sports car.

414
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,882
Will you buy me one?

415
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,551
I'll buy you one next year.

416
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,346
-You'd better keep your promise.
-You'd better not change your mind.

417
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,350
-Where are you?
-In the parking lot.

418
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,394
Bring me some ripe persimmons this Sunday.

419
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,273
Your mom refuses to buy me some.

420
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:29,817
As if I'd believe that.

421
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,612
Have I ever lied to you?

422
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,197
Fine, then.

423
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:40,953
I have great news for you guys.

424
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,791
Hye-ryung must be pregnant.

425
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,250
No.

426
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:48,503
Then what is it?

427
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,296
I just said it for no reason.

428
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,132
You're so silly.

429
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,389
I'll visit this Sunday.

430
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,475
With the persimmons.

431
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,895
Yes, with the persimmons.

432
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,189
Goodbye.

433
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:12,985
-Your mom?
-My dad. He wants me to visit this Sunday.

434
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,071
-I can't go.
-Okay.

435
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,452
The youngest is always
more affectionate even if it's a son.

436
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,539
You should have at least two kids

437
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,457
or not at all.

438
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,959
I agree.

439
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,129
Isn't it sweet?

440
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:36,425
He must have some good news.

441
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,261
He sounded very elated.

442
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:39,971
You're right.

443
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:45,226
Perhaps, it's because his in-laws
have left. And it was a misdiagnosis.

444
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,477
Could that be it?

445
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,961
I must be insane.

446
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,806
Is it already 6 a.m?

447
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,059
Yes.

448
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,187
I barely slept a wink.

449
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,657
Let me go. I need to make breakfast.

450
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,745
I'll skip breakfast today.

451
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,206
-What about Ji-a?
-I don't care.

452
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,377
Let's just stay like this
for five minutes. No, make it ten.

453
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,295
Yu-sin.

454
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,509
-Do you really like me that much?
-No.

455
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,222
I love you with all of my heart.

456
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,816
That one, please.

457
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,276
-This red one?
-Yes.

458
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,177
You're all done.

459
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,181
Thank you.

460
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,599
Goodbye.

461
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,102
Next time, I'll cut your hair.

462
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,313
It's too expensive, and you're just a kid.

463
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,149
Do you think I'm a doll?
Something you can practice on?

464
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,984
I watched her intently today.

465
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:43,404
No, thanks.
If you cut my hair while I'm asleep,

466
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:47,241
I'm going to do the same to you.

467
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,411
Fine, I won't. You care too much
about your appearance for your age.

468
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,538
There's something

469
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,167
-I'm jealous of.
-What is it?

470
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,670
When you were in 5th grade,
Mom was 42 years old.

471
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,297
Right.

472
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,383
I saw some photos, and she looked young.

473
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,969
She only aged because she had you late.

474
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,220
Do you hate it that much?

475
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:12,600
My mom came to school recently,
and some kid asked if she was my grandma.

476
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,685
No way.

477
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:18,397
The other grandmas look young.
You wouldn't have been happy either.

478
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,108
-It's upsetting.
-So what did you say?

479
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,902
Why bother asking?

480
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,445
I told the truth.

481
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,326
Life isn't always peachy.

482
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:33,204
This is only the beginning.
Brace yourself.

483
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:36,123
You need to experience
upsetting, sad, and unfair incidents

484
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,834
if you want to become a grown-up.

485
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,379
That's sad.

486
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,964
Once you overcome that,
it'll bring you happiness.

487
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,092
But if you avoid them,

488
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,094
you'll only end up a loser.

489
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,471
The decision is yours.

490
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,140
Will you be defeated or victorious?

491
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,059
I don't want to be a loser.

492
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,437
Exactly. Do you want some tteokbokki?

493
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,397
Do you have money?

494
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,026
I may not be that great of a sister,
but I still have money to treat you.

495
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,028
You are a great sister.

496
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,863
I'm talking about my decisions.

497
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:11,158
I thought too highly of myself
and made the wrong decision.

498
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,661
Everyone makes mistakes in life.

499
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,789
You sound like an older bro.

500
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,793
I'm fine with you calling me anything
but "bro."

501
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:23,295
-Why not?
-It's so tacky.

502
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,385
Oh, did you get a new phone?

503
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,220
This is our secret phone.

504
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,892
Excuse me.

505
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,230
-Is the butter unsalted?
-Yes.

506
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,195
Let me do it for you. I washed my hands.

507
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:57,371
Whenever I talk to my parents these days,
I'm dying to tell them

508
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,581
about this good news.

509
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:02,710
I have to use all my might
to stop myself from blurting it out.

510
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,920
You should.

511
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:06,922
I know.

512
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:10,468
But they'll be ecstatic once they know.

513
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,263
Time will fix everything, right?

514
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,770
Right. Are you sleeping well?

515
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,439
I'm finally sleeping well.

516
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,065
You must.

517
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,359
How about quitting work?

518
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,612
Enjoy your hobbies and just rest up.

519
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:32,823
-I make good money.
-My work isn't physically demanding.

520
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,867
I have ongoing projects too.

521
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,619
Is he going to die soon?

522
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,121
It's not like him to sing.

523
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,374
In the sweet by and by

524
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:47,671
We shall meet on that beautiful shore

525
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,757
-Doctor.
-Yes?

526
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,928
Do you know what that song is about?

527
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,305
Do you think it's about meeting in heaven?

528
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,601
-Yes.
-That's what many people think.

529
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,020
The original title is "Jordan River."

530
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:07,566
The Israelites were enslaved in Egypt
for hundreds of years.

531
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,819
-Do you know Moses?
-Yes.

532
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:14,990
Moses was commanded by the Lord

533
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:19,203
to lead his people
to the prosperous land of Canaan.

534
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:22,081
To do so,
they had to cross the Jordan River.

535
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,791
And they did.

536
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:28,963
The Israelites finally found freedom
after crossing that river.

537
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,882
So the fact of the matter is,

538
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,928
crossing that river was a blessing.

539
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,888
-It was a good--
-I see.

540
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,141
You're so knowledgeable.

541
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:46,689
Should we start going to church?

542
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:58,033
Lord, you have blessed me with a gift.

543
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,297
It's surreal.

544
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,383
It's nothing short of a miracle.

545
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:24,351
However, I'm terrified and tormented
by the thought

546
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:28,897
that this miracle and blessing of mine
could hurt someone else.

547
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,235
Please forgive my sins.

548
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:39,575
Although it was never my intention,
I have sinned.

549
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:47,666
Lord, please forgive my sins.

550
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:01,096
THE PRESENT

551
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,155
Hello.

552
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,742
-Are you going to Jeju Island?
-Yes.

553
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,745
They're my friends.

554
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,413
He's my doctor.

555
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,751
-Hello.
-Hello.

556
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,554
Which department?

557
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,806
Neuropsychiatry.

558
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,140
Do you take sleeping pills?

559
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:49,770
No. I just received a consultation
because I haven't fully adjusted here

560
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,980
and had trouble sleeping.

561
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:56,485
He's one good-looking doctor.

562
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,781
If it's not work-related,
is it about a woman?

563
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,745
Are you the one in love,

564
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,872
or is she not letting go?

565
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:11,125
Is she getting clingy
when it's just a fling?

566
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:15,587
I can't and shouldn't break up with her…

567
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:18,924
but I must.

568
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,510
Your wife must've found out.

569
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,639
Does she want a divorce?

570
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,309
She did, but she changed her mind.

571
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:35,899
Learning about your spouse's infidelity
is like having an incurable disease.

572
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,945
At first, they deny it
and then they slowly start to accept it.

573
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,697
Some even rationalize it.

574
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:45,993
They think their lack of something
encouraged their spouse to cheat.

575
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:52,040
Why would you cheat when you have
a beautiful and competent wife?

576
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:56,211
I've realized that looks don't matter.

577
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,922
As long as they're decent,
it's not a problem.

578
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,550
You're right.
What matters is their personality.

579
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,135
Is she young?

580
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,137
No.

581
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,514
Another older woman?

582
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,142
Yes.

583
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,936
You're still young.

584
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,523
With time, you'll only look at those
who are a decade younger.

585
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:19,234
Are you like that?

586
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,320
No, not me.

587
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,478
That woman wearing a hat looks familiar.

588
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,688
She's Nam Ga-bin, a musical actress.

589
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:00,567
Why didn't you tell me?

590
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,569
Since she's a celebrity, I guess.

591
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,279
Why are you flying?

592
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,534
My high school homeroom teacher is ill.

593
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,244
He lives in Jeju.

594
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,996
-Where are you staying?
-At Pyoseon Hotel.

595
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:14,665
I'm at Jungmun Hotel.

596
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:17,626
-Are you leaving tomorrow?
-In two days.

597
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,718
Text me before you go.

598
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,728
-Who is it?
-It's your daughter-in-law.

599
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,535
Did you miss your dad?

600
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:36,580
I spoke with him,
and he told me to sleep here.

601
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,998
I'm glad you're here.

602
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,916
-Have you eaten yet?
-No.

603
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,794
I saw a new restaurant on our way here.

604
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,963
Let's just eat at home.

605
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,381
I should say hi to Grandpa.

606
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,426
What a polite girl.

607
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:54,222
Have some saw-edged perches
since you're here. It's my treat.

608
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,642
-Is that a kind of fish?
-Yes.

609
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,894
They used to be rare,
but they raise them now.

610
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:04,566
The saw-edged perch set.

611
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,651
Sure.

612
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:09,446
-You must be from Seoul.
-Yes.

613
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,406
-Do you have the fermented barley drink?
-Yes.

614
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,700
-The least fermented one, please.
-Okay.

615
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:15,911
I'm excited.

616
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,706
My brother invited you guys over
for dinner tomorrow.

617
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,917
Wedding anniversaries should be private.

618
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,836
She's right.
Let's go to the beach after this.

619
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,089
The sand looked so fine and smooth.

620
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,674
What if the waves come crashing?

621
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,178
Just go to the pool in your hotel.

622
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:34,596
There's warm water,

623
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,015
and people won't recognize you
in the dark.

624
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,350
It's been a while.

625
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,564
I'm so excited.

626
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,280
This already looks so filling.

627
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,618
What about the barley drink?

628
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,578
-Did you order that too?
-Yes.

629
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,914
What about the main dish?

630
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:03,500
Would you like your stew spicy or not?

631
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,128
-Spicy?
-Sure. Spicy, please.

632
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,337
Okay.

633
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,090
The pan-fried pancakes look good.

634
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,217
This place is famous.

635
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,512
My brother told me to never skip
eating octopus.

636
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,889
-Why not?
-Because it's good for you.

637
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,268
I should try it too.

638
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,235
It's delicious.

639
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,458
-What is it?
-Is there something?

640
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,722
It's been eight weeks.

641
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,932
Congratulations.

642
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,810
You should've told us sooner.

643
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:07,522
I've seen the news about single women
choosing to have a child.

644
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,191
Is that the case for you?

645
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:14,571
I wonder who the father is.
Are you going to introduce us to him?

646
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,825
We need some time.

647
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:24,372
Is he abroad?

648
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,629
You can tell us when you're ready.

649
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,054
He has a family.

650
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,602
But…

651
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,523
he's willing to divorce her for me.

652
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,864
I'd be content with just this baby.

653
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,911
I feel extremely troubled.

654
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:11,169
To be honest…

655
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,383
I'm also in a similar situation.

656
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:27,310
Never in my wildest dreams
had I seen this coming.

657
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,611
If my parents found out, they'd pass out.

658
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:43,451
The man I'm seeing has already come clean
and left the house.

659
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,375
I'm jealous of you two.

660
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,545
You are?

661
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:58,633
-Why?
-That man we met on the plane

662
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,136
is my boyfriend.

663
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,433
Despite being in a similar situation,

664
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,019
he has no plans
to leave his family for me.

665
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,064
It's getting more and more unbearable.

666
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,526
At first, I was happy
that I could be with him.

667
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:20,614
-Is he really your doctor?
-We met on the plane

668
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,115
when I was returning to Korea.

669
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:24,534
He took over his father's hospital.

670
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:28,288
You must be tired.
You should sleep early tonight.

671
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,417
I only visited the temple. I'm okay.

672
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,921
-Are you sleepy?
-No.

673
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,884
At night, I think of my husband more.

674
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,638
Mother.

675
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,308
As a fellow woman,

676
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,893
my heart breaks for you.

677
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,437
The pain must be unbearable.

678
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,731
You should meet someone else
to help you let go.

679
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:58,151
Are you perhaps interested?

680
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:00,737
Find someone who suits you.

681
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:03,657
I know quite a few.

682
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,828
Mourning for him won't bring him back.

683
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:12,749
I'm sure he doesn't want
to see you in pain either.

684
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,378
You have been a wonderful wife.

685
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:17,754
There's no one like you.

686
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,172
I can't say the same.

687
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:21,883
I keep thinking of what I lacked.

688
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:24,344
Like what? What did you lack?

689
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,054
I regret not treating him better.

690
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,349
I thought he'd live a life of longevity.

691
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,936
I even thought we could die
on the same day.

692
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:36,856
Yu-sin also thinks it's a good idea
for you to date other men.

693
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,902
-He does?
-Yes.

694
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,655
He's worried about how distressed you are.

695
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:44,739
Really?

696
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,325
-Yes.
-Gosh.

697
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,495
Why "gosh"?

698
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,206
While you're still young--

699
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:56,292
-Do you think I should remarry?
-I don't see why not.

700
00:54:57,002 --> 00:55:00,046
If you find a decent man,
date him two to three years--

701
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:03,341
Forget it.
It's not like I'm desperate for men.

702
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,593
A colleague of mine
saw you during the funeral

703
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:08,138
and said you looked too young
not to remarry.

704
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:11,558
You're only in your sixties,
and you're competent.

705
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,101
I said I'm not interested.

706
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,855
A decent man my age
would want a woman in her thirties.

707
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,820
Don't eye my husband.

708
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,238
How dare you?

709
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:27,574
Good night.

710
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,256
He hasn't texted for two days.

711
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,010
He's ten years younger,
and yet, he likes you?

712
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,555
He must have grown on me.

713
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:52,432
That's uncontrollable.

714
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:57,062
I have no right to say this,

715
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,939
but I hope you reconsider your situation.

716
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,234
I understand.

717
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,738
But I can't seem to be interested
in anyone else.

718
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,531
Even in the States?

719
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,159
Yes. You can relate, right?

720
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:13,369
I just can't help but be in love with him.

721
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,371
He's so alluring.

722
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,457
For me, it's different.

723
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:23,713
I find solace and comfort

724
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,091
when we're together.

725
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,760
He's quite considerate and caring.

726
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:32,138
Are you really going to marry him
once the cooling-off period is over?

727
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:34,557
Yes.

728
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,394
I don't feel at ease,

729
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:41,064
but I'm the reason why
his family fell apart.

730
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:43,608
I also know I have no right to say this,

731
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,361
but I think you can do better.

732
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,447
I'm not that great, you know?

733
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,324
Fame is all I have.

734
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,244
Let's just leave it up to fate.

735
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:58,873
In any case,
I think you two are meant to be.

736
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,125
I agree.

737
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:03,461
Have you come up with a nickname
for the baby?

738
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,130
Not yet.

739
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,100
Aren't you going to bed?

740
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,729
Can I trust that you'll end it with her?

741
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:26,568
By next week?

742
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,532
You don't think you can?

743
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:34,367
That's not why.

744
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:39,456
She's in Jeju right now.
I'll tell her once she returns.

745
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:42,125
She's on a trip while carrying a baby?

746
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:43,877
Her brother's there.

747
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,505
Is that her hometown?

748
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:51,968
No. Only her brother's family is there.

749
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,722
-No parents?
-No.

750
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,474
Are they divorced?

751
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,517
Or did they pass away?

752
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,813
That doesn't matter.

753
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,034
What time is Dad coming?

754
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:18,161
He'll arrive at Gimpo Airport at 1 p.m.

755
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:21,080
Let's have breakfast and go.
I should buy some groceries.

756
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,167
Good morning, Grandma.

757
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,336
Good morning.

758
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:27,462
Are you feeling unwell?

759
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,756
I was sick all night.

760
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,884
Oh, dear. You should've called me.

761
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:35,678
What for? I'd rather be sick by myself.

762
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,347
Where does it hurt?

763
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:42,143
By the way, call Yu-sin.

764
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:46,189
Tell him I'm sick and that he doesn't need
to buy any tangerines.

765
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,527
Hurry up.

766
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:54,364
If you don't,
he'll definitely buy boxes of them.

767
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,115
He's only there for one day.

768
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,826
Hurry. It's too exhausting to speak.

769
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,037
Okay.

770
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:06,042
Grandma, go to Dad's hospital.
There are doctors there.

771
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,962
Getting a shot won't help.

772
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,714
Mother says you don't need
to buy any tangerines.

773
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,509
Where does it hurt?

774
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:19,305
My fever's finally going down.

775
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:22,892
My entire body was sore.

776
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,355
Did he reply?

777
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:31,859
He's probably taking a shower.
Would you like some porridge?

778
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,571
I have no appetite.

779
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:38,241
Maybe get me a cup of warm milk.

780
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,374
She asks for too much.

781
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,918
Do you want a massage?

782
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,588
What can you do with those tiny hands?

783
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,172
I'm surprisingly strong.

784
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:02,015
It's hot and tasty. Where did you get it?

785
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:05,268
From a fan. It's apparently home-made.

786
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,356
It has a distinct taste.

787
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:19,032
They say you get pregnant
when you're at peace.

788
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,159
That's true.

789
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:23,411
It all depends on how you see it.

790
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:25,455
Sa-hyeon has never gone back on his word.

791
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:28,708
It wasn't just a fling. She's pregnant.

792
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:32,295
Even if I was in his shoes,
I wouldn't be able to end it that easily.

793
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,048
-I need your help.
-What should we do?

794
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,592
We've already taken care
of half the problem.

795
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:39,927
Meet with her as soon as you can.

796
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,722
Once she promises to end it,

797
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:44,641
get her a place without his knowing.

798
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:45,850
An apartment?

799
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:48,353
A decent one.

800
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:53,733
Getting her a place isn't hard,

801
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,526
but she's carrying his baby.

802
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,904
I doubt she'd agree to it.

803
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:00,782
I should confront her
and see to it myself,

804
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:03,451
but he just won't tell me where she is.

805
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:05,453
Because you'd snatch her hair.

806
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:08,039
I want to see her myself.

807
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,669
-That will come to no good.
-It'll upset you even more.

808
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,754
I can trust you two, but not him.

809
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:18,549
He's been deceiving me all along.
I doubt he'll end it that easily.

810
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,968
He'll meet her every now and then.

811
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:23,596
He's too softhearted like me.

812
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,681
As if.

813
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,810
For the record, I am softhearted.

814
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:30,645
Only to Dongmi.

815
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:31,896
You're ridiculous.

816
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:34,232
That's not the issue here.

817
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:37,110
Meet that woman at all costs.

818
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:41,656
If she promises to end it with him,

819
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:45,201
get her a place
without Sa-hyeon's knowing.

820
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,120
What if she doesn't listen to us?

821
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,872
It's a scary world.
What if she's a wicked one?

822
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,375
Only then will I find peace
and get pregnant.

823
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:55,336
I can't get pregnant when I'm stressed.

824
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:58,047
All right. Don't you worry.

825
01:01:58,673 --> 01:01:59,674
We'll do as you say.

826
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:02,009
Sa-hyeon must not know about this.

827
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:05,346
Please take care of her

828
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,890
until she fully recovers from childbirth.

829
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,392
You want us to keep tabs on her

830
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,562
in case she's still in contact with him?

831
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:16,482
I think that's the only choice we have.

832
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,276
It's morally right as well.

833
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:20,611
And most importantly,

834
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:23,156
make sure she changes her number
in front of you.

835
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,867
Go with her to get it changed.

836
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:29,537
First, we should persuade Sa-hyeon
to let us meet with her.

837
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,457
If he won't tell us,
we'll just get him drunk to confess.

838
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:36,085
He can hold his liquor.
He'll drink you under the table.

839
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:39,380
What did you say?

840
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:47,722
I made some porridge.

841
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:53,436
I told you I didn't have an appetite.

842
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:55,980
Force yourself to have some,
or you'll faint.

843
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:58,191
Imagine collapsing in the bathroom.

844
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:01,861
Whenever that happens to old people,
they can never get up.

845
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:06,240
Are you calling me old?

846
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,451
Of course. Do you think you're young?

847
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:12,038
When women skip a meal,
we get sunken eyes.

848
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:14,207
Are my eyes sunken?

849
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,709
A bit.

850
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,352
You said you were leaving soon.

851
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:37,104
You should go. Don't worry about me.

852
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,773
That way, I'll have him all to myself.

853
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:40,441
Yu-sin will be coming here anyway.

854
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,652
What a leech.

855
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:48,199
That must be him.

856
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:06,884
Dr. Shin called.

857
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:10,888
This way.

858
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:12,890
-Hello.
-Long time no see.

859
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:15,601
Would you like some coffee or tea?

860
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:16,936
I'm okay.

861
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:30,575
It's an emergency,
so I'll head straight to the hospital.

862
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:33,160
-See you in the evening.
-Your vitals are stable.

863
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:38,416
I was sick all night long.

864
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:42,920
There's an emergency, so Yu-sin is going
straight to the hospital.

865
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:44,255
More urgent than seeing me?

866
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,508
When will he be here then?

867
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:48,467
Does he have to?

868
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,472
Should I ask him?

869
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,183
Forget it.

870
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:59,478
Please tell Dr. Shin that she's okay.

871
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:00,771
Yes, ma'am.

872
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:03,524
Tell me if you want a certain medicine.

873
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:06,694
Why would I? It's not a snack.

874
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:08,988
Have some rice for dinner.
You need energy.

875
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:11,240
The helper will be here soon.
I called her.

876
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:13,284
What for?

877
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:15,578
She hates working on the weekends.

878
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:18,581
She should come since you're sick.

879
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:21,709
My God, she's brilliant.

880
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:24,545
I was afraid they'd get a divorce.

881
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,214
Sa-hyeon's no match for her.

882
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,760
I was hoping he'd distance himself
from that woman.

883
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:34,472
He was just infatuated.

884
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:37,725
Hye-ryung is an excellent wife.

885
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,854
She's a clever girl.

886
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,148
How did she think
about getting her a new place?

887
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:45,816
Women are shrewd like that.

888
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:50,571
Imagine if I wasn't wealthy enough.

889
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:53,366
That's how important money is.
Be stingier.

890
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:56,535
Why are you suddenly changing the subject?

891
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,204
I'm not wrong, am I?

892
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:02,541
Let's visit her from time to time
and take care of her.

893
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,877
We'll even get to hold our grandchild.

894
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,629
We might even be able to raise the baby.

895
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:09,548
Do you seriously think Hye-ryung
would raise the baby?

896
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:10,591
She'll have her own.

897
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:14,178
Then we'll raise the baby.
We could even raise ten of them.

898
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:17,056
Look at you being all excited.

899
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,558
We'll be getting a grandchild either way.

900
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,268
What's important is the outcome.

901
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,105
I'm going to be a grandpa.

902
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:28,734
You should visit well-known temples
and pray.

903
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,194
For easy labor?

904
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:32,655
For a boy while we're at it.

905
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:37,118
Goodness. It's too late.
It's already been eight weeks.

906
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:39,745
-When will we know?
-Don't be greedy.

907
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,580
We'll at least have one boy.

908
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:45,751
It could be that woman's or Hye-ryung's.

909
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,125
You can talk to me.

910
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,551
Does your family know?

911
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:22,515
Yes.

912
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:29,582
You've been happily married
to Ms. Kim Yeon-joo.

913
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:31,500
Have you had any problems…

914
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:34,044
You want something sensational, right?

915
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:36,589
I wonder what my daughter's hobbies are.

916
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,174
-Hello.
-Hello.

917
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:40,134
How about a musical actor
for our guest artist?

918
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:41,635
-Who?
-Nam Ga-bin.

919
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:42,845
I'll do it.

920
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:44,638
Nam Ga-bin won't do.

921
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:46,891
Why are you telling me to go?
I'm here because I'm worried.

922
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:49,602
Forget about me and go be a family man.

923
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,353
I see that you're upset, Ms. Kim.

924
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:54,398
Why did you send Dr. Min then?
You should have gone yourself.

925
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:56,734
Don't get so upset. It's nothing.

926
01:09:56,817 --> 01:09:59,069
-Are you upset?
-You saw Dr. Shin?

927
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:00,529
My gosh.

928
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,157
This is my mother.

929
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,702
-Nice to meet you.
-An older woman again?

930
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:11,207
I got divorced after five years
because I couldn't get pregnant.

931
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:16,295
