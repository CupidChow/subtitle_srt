1
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,143
What's the name of the show?

2
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,437
Boo Hye-ryung's Love, Memories, and Music.

3
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,861
Hello? Am I breaking up?

4
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,112
No, I heard you.

5
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,367
-I'll have to call you back.
-Sure.

6
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,772
-Have you eaten?
-Of course.

7
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,024
-Did you two argue again?
-Not at all.

8
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:50,235
Let her eat in peace and quiet.

9
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,162
PARK HAE-RYUN

10
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,847
-Here are tomatoes and some nuts.
-Thanks, Mom.

11
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,557
-U-ram.
-Yes?

12
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,519
Grow up just the way you are now.
It's always good to be well-mannered.

13
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,566
-I'm off to school.
-You'll be home early today.

14
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,526
Bring your friends over.
I'll make some snacks.

15
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,278
-Really?
-Yes.

16
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,071
But it'll be a hassle.

17
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,158
Nonsense. You know how much I love kids.

18
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,368
Have you been able to contact her?

19
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,287
We met a few days ago.

20
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,790
-Together?
-No, she went without me.

21
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,501
-What is she like?
-Nothing special.

22
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,420
How old is she?

23
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,798
Is this an interrogation?

24
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,676
I'm sorry.
I just can't be nice about this.

25
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,596
Wouldn't you be curious if you were me?

26
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,389
I didn't ask,

27
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,975
but I could tell she's older.

28
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,272
I'm sorry if I'm making you uncomfortable.

29
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,858
Don't be. You've done nothing wrong.

30
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,695
They say that even Buddha
is appalled by adulterers.

31
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,323
He may be my son, but…

32
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,576
What does she do for a living?

33
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,369
She's a translator.

34
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,415
Sa-hyeon promised me
that he'd end it for sure.

35
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,334
So you won't get her the apartment?

36
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:33,087
I'll decide on that
after I meet her today.

37
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,380
Don't you worry about it.

38
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,592
According to them,
nothing was going on between them.

39
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:41,721
They became friends,
but that one night of misjudgment…

40
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,265
It's the truth.

41
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,475
But he said he loves her.

42
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,061
You heard him too.

43
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:51,356
The news of the pregnancy
probably clouded his judgment,

44
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,858
but sense has been kicked back into him.

45
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,860
Reality finally kicked in.

46
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,320
The reality is this.

47
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,323
In eight months, your grandchild
will be born out of wedlock.

48
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,200
What can we do about it though?

49
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,620
It's not like we can stop
the baby from being born.

50
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:09,415
Although we can't undo what's been done,

51
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,710
I'll check in on her
and monitor her behavior

52
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,588
so that you won't have to worry.

53
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,507
We agreed to meet at her place today.

54
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,345
There are worse cases
than the situation you're in.

55
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,847
What Sa-hyeon did is nothing.

56
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,268
How can a lawyer of all people
be morally impaired?

57
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,852
Even in foreign countries,

58
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,523
presidents are often caught in scandals
involving illegitimate children.

59
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,526
Officers of the law and politicians too.

60
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,027
It's like I said.

61
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:42,323
If you don't consider their social status,
this is just a matter of boy-meets-girl.

62
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,117
Have you ever read about

63
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,995
a woman in those fields
with illegitimate children?

64
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,789
Well, men can't get pregnant on their own.

65
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,457
The partners were all women.

66
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,918
They say mankind
is the lord of all creation,

67
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,920
but we're animals
controlled by our emotions.

68
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,632
And being swayed by those emotions
is what leads us to cause trouble.

69
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:06,055
It's not easy to be someone like me
who has a strict moral compass.

70
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,647
He's probably up by now,
but he hasn't texted.

71
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,818
He won't even care if I go missing.

72
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,112
It might be what he secretly wants.

73
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,573
He probably assumed
you left for the salon already.

74
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,617
Should we tell him that you came by?

75
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,869
No, don't.

76
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:34,125
-What does "shut your trap" mean?
-Trap is slang for "mouth."

77
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,419
-Like a muzzle?
-More like a bottle.

78
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,963
A bottle?

79
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:43,509
It's the same as "shut your hole."

80
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,347
Where did you hear it though?

81
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,310
From some kids.

82
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,936
I'll trust you and head back.

83
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,815
Please have this sorted.

84
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:07,200
MISSED CALL: PARK HAE-RYUN

85
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,338
I'm appalled to the point
that I'm speechless.

86
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,924
No matter how upset,
you should watch what you say.

87
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,551
Especially to a husband
who has provided for you.

88
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,304
Have both mother and son lost it?

89
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,892
It's not like I'm wrong.

90
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,897
Have I ever thrown profanities
at your face?

91
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,484
The people of Chungcheong Province
are known to be noble.

92
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:54,038
Could you perhaps cancel
today's radio show?

93
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,457
Say something came up.

94
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,584
-Why?
-I'll tell you tonight.

95
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,044
Right now, I have a meeting.

96
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,214
But I'll be blacklisted.
Rumors fly in this industry.

97
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:07,468
You can't cancel hours before the show
unless you get in an accident.

98
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,566
MISSED CALL: MY DARLING RYUN

99
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,364
-Hello?
-You called me while I was showering.

100
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,409
-I'm heading into a meeting.
-Okay.

101
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,126
-Greetings.
-Please head on in.

102
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,048
-Boo Hye-ryung?
-Yes.

103
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,300
How did you run into her?

104
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,178
By chance, at a wine bar.

105
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,473
I sent over a bottle of wine for her
and her older friend, but she declined.

106
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,892
-And?
-I paid for her table on my way out.

107
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,186
Should I tell her that you're my brother?

108
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,105
That I'm your half-brother?
I'm only joking.

109
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:06,068
Anyway, I just wanted to do something nice
for your colleague.

110
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,280
I don't want to be at the center
of anyone's gossip.

111
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,948
I know your style, brother.

112
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,493
Got it. Have a good day.

113
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,251
-Good morning.
-You too.

114
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,464
-Where are you headed? It's almost time.
-It won't take long.

115
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,090
The doors are closing.

116
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,138
We can't go empty-handed.

117
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,517
Right?

118
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,901
I'm sorry, but who sent these?

119
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,363
Can you stop by a fruit shop?

120
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,033
-Can you look one up?
-There will be one in the complex.

121
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,036
-I already sent some.
-Sure.

122
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,038
Then you should've told me.

123
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,499
She's so vicious.

124
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,266
Hello?

125
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,143
Yes, are you here?

126
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,437
I'll be right down.

127
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,523
That's hardly necessary.

128
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,192
Just open the door when we ring the bell.

129
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,155
It's true how they say
that the one in the wrong sulks more.

130
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,702
Are you still angry
even after saying the unthinkable to me?

131
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,955
Any other man
would've responded with his fist.

132
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,373
Go ahead.

133
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,418
-Right here?
-Bring it on.

134
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:52,174
Don't tell me you used to
be a bully back in the day.

135
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,010
Of course, you'd think that.

136
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,680
I was a bully back in the day
while Kim Dong-mi was a delicate flower.

137
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,849
Like the azalea flower you gave her.

138
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,394
Don't expect me to treat you with respect.

139
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,149
Goodness.

140
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,785
Who should I introduce you as?

141
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,246
I'm Song Won, sir.

142
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,957
Hello.

143
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,355
-Can we get some water?
-Sure.

144
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,940
-Will Sa-hyeon be late?
-He's on his way.

145
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,662
You can leave those here, you know.

146
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,080
But they'll collect dust.

147
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,960
I didn't expect her
to be this well-mannered.

148
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,463
She was taught well.

149
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,808
Shouldn't you go and see a doctor?

150
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:27,812
There's nothing a doctor
can do for me anymore.

151
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,689
How does it hurt?

152
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:37,696
You sent me a lot of fruit. Thank you.

153
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,491
Thank you also for the flowers.

154
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,411
When you're pregnant,
fruits are the easiest to stomach.

155
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,043
-Right.
-Please speak casually.

156
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,840
Did you have lunch before you left?

157
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,716
Yes, we did.

158
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,097
It's nice and quiet.

159
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,433
Your neighbors must not be so loud.

160
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,727
Kids must come by every once in a while.

161
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,771
I hear them stomp around
every now and then,

162
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,898
but I don't complain.

163
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,942
She's understanding too.

164
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,239
I've been brought up to speed

165
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:24,326
and Sa-hyeon let us see the sonogram.

166
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,413
It's been stressful, right?

167
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,540
It's still quite manageable.

168
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:34,753
You must be fatigued. At this age,
it happens after skipping even one meal.

169
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,007
They say you should enjoy
what you can't avoid.

170
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,510
Not everyone gets to experience this,

171
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:46,474
and I have no other choice
but to think positively.

172
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,895
The difficulties I'm facing
don't seem like a hassle.

173
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:54,899
There's no denying
that Sa-hyeon crossed the line,

174
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,361
but this is the outcome we're facing.

175
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,574
As his parents, we're in no position
to tell you what to do

176
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,910
or not to do.

177
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:10,414
I honestly informed Ms. So of my feelings

178
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,957
and the determination I have.

179
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,252
Still, we can't pretend you don't exist.

180
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,713
I meant what I said, though.

181
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,217
I don't want to burden you with this.

182
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,428
That's hardly the case.
Just think of it as our duty.

183
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:28,140
We'd like to help you in any way.

184
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,809
I've worked as a translator
for quite some time

185
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,813
and my parents left me with enough money,

186
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,815
so I'm financially stable.

187
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,195
Is this apartment yours?

188
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,446
Yes.

189
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,118
Do you harbor any resentment
toward Sa-hyeon

190
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,788
or us?

191
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,082
The guilt is mine to bear.

192
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,626
Think of the baby you're carrying

193
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,338
and do not blame yourself
for what happened.

194
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:03,592
We should be on the same page
both in our heads and in our hearts.

195
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,303
The baby isn't to blame
and must be born healthily.

196
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,514
What did the doctor say?

197
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:13,060
All the tests I took showed good numbers.

198
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:16,063
Were you told you were doing all right?

199
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:21,777
The mother's health
always comes first in a pregnancy.

200
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,196
-Yes, I'm good.
-That's good to hear.

201
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:28,200
It hardly seems right
to part ways after a brief conversation.

202
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,077
How about we grab a bite to eat?

203
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,162
We'll be seeing more of each other.

204
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,374
I did some prepping for tteokguk
just in case you didn't eat.

205
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,667
It won't take long.

206
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,420
You shouldn't have,
especially while carrying the baby.

207
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,255
Isn't Gangnam Hotel nearby?

208
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,549
They'd be on a break at this hour.

209
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,176
What would you be able to stomach?

210
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,638
I saw Korean thistle rice on TV just now.

211
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,056
Is that what you're craving?

212
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,018
-Yes.
-Then you should have it.

213
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,520
I'll look it up.

214
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,607
I've had it a few times
at restaurants in Seoul,

215
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,400
and they're pretty much the same.

216
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,360
Chungcheong Province does namul the best.

217
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,155
A place close to where we live
serves the best dish.

218
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,907
It won't take long at this hour.

219
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,909
Will that be all right?

220
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,036
What could possibly stop us?

221
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:16,373
People of this country go on trips
just to enjoy delicious food.

222
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:20,628
He's right.
Our driver will bring you home later.

223
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:24,632
Stop that and speak casually to her.

224
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,091
You should.

225
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,136
You'll only need to put on a jacket.

226
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,972
We'll put these in the fridge for you.

227
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,432
No, that's not necessary.

228
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,435
Go on and grab your jacket.

229
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,068
You can sit in the back.

230
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,569
-Gosh, no.
-Go on.

231
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,529
I will take the front seat.

232
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,293
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

233
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,630
Drive safely and go easy on the brakes.

234
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,799
-Yes, sir.
-The Korean thistle rice restaurant.

235
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,717
Got it.

236
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:19,395
This from a man who cursed her out
and called her a gold digger?

237
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,814
-He's U-ram.
-Hello.

238
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:25,442
Goodness.
What a dependable-looking young man.

239
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,945
-Thank you.
-There's no need to thank her.

240
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,242
-No way. Hamburgers.
-It's hamburgers.

241
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,954
I made it myself with Korean beef.

242
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,288
-You're the best.
-The best.

243
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,708
The fried chicken wasn't delivered either.

244
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,835
-Did you fry them yourself?
-Yes.

245
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,545
-No way.
-No way.

246
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,630
-We all washed our hands.
-Good.

247
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,589
You should join us.

248
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,717
I tasted the burgers while making them.

249
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,176
Gosh, it's super delicious.

250
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,639
Slow down and drink some juice too.
You don't want indigestion.

251
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,516
-Sure thing.
-Mi-so, was it?

252
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,018
Yes, ma'am.

253
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,936
Doesn't she have a great smile?

254
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,730
All smiles are beautiful.

255
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,816
So why don't we all laugh together?

256
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,830
Hello?

257
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,791
So, did the show go well?

258
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,168
Yes.

259
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,420
Did you meet the show's writer too?

260
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,546
Yes.

261
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,258
Are you coming over today?

262
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,928
-Yes, but I have to be somewhere first.
-Sure.

263
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,056
A NEW MESSAGE HAS ARRIVED

264
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,433
-Sorry, I got a text.
-Okay.

265
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:52,029
SI-EUN

266
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,081
Hello?

267
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,000
It's me.

268
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,960
Yes?

269
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,670
We should meet.

270
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,422
Why?

271
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,508
There's something I need to say.

272
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,137
I'll text you the location in a moment.

273
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,347
Sure.

274
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,516
You must have done a lot of interviews.

275
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,892
Actually, not that much.

276
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,689
This is our engineer.

277
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,858
This is Nam Ga-bin,
today's celebrity guest.

278
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,776
Greetings.

279
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,281
I was too busy
to go over today's cue sheet.

280
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,565
-What's with the C-collar?
-It's only for a few days.

281
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,697
I ordered in advance
since you're always on time.

282
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,241
-What did you think I'd order?
-An Americano.

283
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,245
-Do you want a latte?
-It's fine.

284
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,714
I must've lost my mind for a while.

285
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:38,051
If you'll take me back, I'll come home.
For the children's sake too.

286
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,146
Is it a slipped disc?

287
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,190
A fender bender.

288
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,524
Did you cause it?

289
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,484
No, a young lady bumped into me,

290
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,695
-Today?
-Yes.

291
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,238
In front of the broadcasting station.

292
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:03,118
-What about your show then?
-I asked a colleague to fill in.

293
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,794
Why did you want to see me?

294
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,800
You'll find out soon anyway.

295
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,304
The woman I'm seeing…

296
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,348
is Nam Ga-bin.

297
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,018
That Nam Ga-bin?

298
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,106
Is that why you called me this morning?

299
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,946
To tell me to be nice to your future wife?

300
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,991
Still popular with the ladies, are you?

301
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,452
What do you want me to say?

302
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,913
Judging by how she
gladly came on the show,

303
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,791
she probably doesn't know about me either.

304
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,837
Tell her

305
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,840
that the writer of the show she was on
is your ex-wife.

306
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,219
It'll be entertaining
to watch her reaction too.

307
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,847
What would Hyang-gi say?

308
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,892
-For the time being--
-Keep her in the dark?

309
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,770
-Her CSAT is coming up--
-Don't pretend like you care.

310
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,021
Must I say this again?

311
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,399
That you pushed for divorce
despite her situation?

312
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,360
-I know I lack--
-It takes more to shatter a marriage.

313
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,073
I created this mess
and she is of no fault.

314
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,325
What did you just say?

315
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,161
Did she not know
about your marital status?

316
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,205
Did she think you were single?

317
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,708
Did she not realize it was an affair?

318
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,042
Couldn't she tell?

319
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:40,924
No wonder you asked for a divorce
naming the most ridiculous reasons.

320
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,384
I finally get it now.

321
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,345
It was to protect Nam Ga-bin.

322
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,598
You were afraid she'd dump you
if we told her about the man you are.

323
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,601
-That's not--
-No? How about I sit down with her then?

324
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,855
Maybe I should pull her by the hair.
Do you think I can't do it?

325
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,734
I'm not the Lee Si-eun you used to know.

326
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,236
-I can do much worse.
-Calm down.

327
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,322
Why can't I get worked up?

328
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,450
Do you see me as some sort of saint?

329
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,786
They say that even Buddha
turns his back to adulterers.

330
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,165
But what was the excuse you gave me?

331
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,834
The scent of my medicated patches
sickened you,

332
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,755
watching me wear myself out agonized you,

333
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,089
and we were married for too long.

334
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,967
That was hard work on your end.

335
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,178
You had to come up
with all sorts of excuses

336
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,929
to get me to sign the papers.

337
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,308
Hyang-gi will soon find out anyway.

338
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,603
The media will report
the musical actor's dating life

339
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,271
especially now that

340
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,566
she's dating a man
who divorced his wife for her.

341
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,444
So when's the wedding?

342
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,073
You must be dying for
the consideration period to end.

343
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:51,828
I don't want to talk about this
let alone even mention it in passing.

344
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:56,166
So sit your children down yourself
and brag about your new girl.

345
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:59,753
"My wife-to-be is none other than
the musical actor Nam Ga-bin."

346
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,091
You had to come home to a wife

347
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,551
who was worn out
from her job and household chores.

348
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:11,932
Of course, you were captivated
by a charming musical actor.

349
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,602
You'd be able to divorce me
all over again for her.

350
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:20,065
Who cares if you had a grown daughter
and a son in elementary school?

351
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:25,112
What do you want from me?
To keep quiet until the wedding?

352
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,074
Last summer,

353
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,369
when you wanted to take me to that motel,

354
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,871
you said I elevated your class.

355
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,333
Doing so was worth it, I guess.

356
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,418
She's not some younger non-celebrity.

357
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,630
Her profile says she's only 40.

358
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:48,051
A beautiful celebrity
ten years your junior.

359
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,886
Her parents are rich,

360
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,930
so she doesn't have to work for a living.

361
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,682
She said so in her interview.

362
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,103
Congratulations.

363
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,647
Your latter years will be golden.

364
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,527
What more could you want, right?

365
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,822
Marrying a woman like that at 50
isn't easy.

366
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,742
It hurts too much.

367
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,870
Here you go again playing the victim.

368
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,289
In your eyes, does it seem like

369
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,708
I'm enjoying this conversation?

370
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,296
Have a good life.

371
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:26,965
What about your ride?

372
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:07,756
Goodness, Chairman Pan. It's been so long.

373
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,966
-Is the room vacant?
-Yes, please head on in.

374
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,469
Mrs. Pan never seems to age.

375
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,806
Two bowls of Korean thistle rice

376
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,099
and a mackerel…

377
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,770
Would the fish smell too much?

378
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,607
-Three Korean thistle rice sets, please.
-Yes, ma'am.

379
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,984
I don't think we've met before.

380
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,654
She's a relative.

381
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,198
I see.

382
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,328
We should decide on what to call you.

383
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,163
We can't call you by name.

384
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,375
What should we call each other?

385
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,377
Address her casually.

386
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,129
You're only making it
uncomfortable for her.

387
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,593
How about Song Yuan?

388
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:57,639
It's my name in Chinese, you see.

389
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,642
Then that's what we'll call you too.

390
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,771
Song… Song Yuan?

391
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,024
Will we be mister and ma'am to you?

392
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,611
Anyway, the baby you're carrying…

393
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,949
That reminds me.
Aren't babies given nicknames these days?

394
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,450
It's Bada.

395
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:22,455
Xiexian dreamed of embracing a pig
by the sea, you see.

396
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:26,251
Is that so? A pig fell into his arms?

397
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:30,255
A pig as big as a calf
suddenly appeared from the sea.

398
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:35,885
It splashed its way to Xiexian
and landed gently in his arms.

399
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,138
That's what I call a great dream.

400
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:43,184
Pigs usually mean…
No, I shouldn't say that

401
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,478
Anyway, Bada is good.

402
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,545
You were lost and gone forever

403
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:14,007
Dreadful sorrow, Clementine

404
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,638
If only your grandfather were here too.

405
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:29,481
His one and only granddaughter
was the apple of his eye.

406
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,651
I miss Grandpa too.

407
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,613
But we're all living on borrowed time.

408
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,783
Don't say that, Dad. It makes me sad.

409
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,577
How silly of me to break into tears.

410
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,871
You should at least live longer, Grandma.

411
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,000
You and Mom must live long lives too.

412
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:50,919
Got it.

413
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,631
Isn't your mom home yet?

414
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,716
She runs late
when she has to buy groceries.

415
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:58,635
Here.

416
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,806
-Thank you.
-Have it now or put it in the fridge.

417
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,015
Sure.

418
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:12,357
-Weren't you at our house today, U-ram?
-Yes.

419
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,485
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

420
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,654
No, but I picked up a late snack.

421
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,697
I shouldn't eat anything more.

422
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:24,285
-What about you guys?
-It'll be just me. U-ram's still full.

423
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,747
-Can I get you a beverage?
-I'm good. Why don't you have a seat?

424
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,876
Your mom didn't say anything
to keep you from worrying,

425
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,087
but she got into a fender bender.

426
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:35,630
Was she injured?

427
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:39,092
The doctor said
that she only needs to wear

428
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,885
a C-collar for a few days.

429
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,098
Are you going to call her?

430
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,184
I'll do it instead.

431
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,192
Si-eun, where are you?

432
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,819
I'm over at your place.

433
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,321
Sure.

434
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,033
She's on her way home.

435
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,289
Season it to fit your palate.

436
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,791
Right.

437
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,679
Like Sa-hyeon,
you must have trouble eating hot food.

438
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,809
Meanwhile, we like ours boiling hot.

439
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,276
How is it?

440
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,072
It's delicious.

441
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,949
I'm glad.

442
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:49,746
We'll have dessert over at our place.

443
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,915
It's not far from here.

444
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:56,127
Tell the housekeeper
to prepare some desserts.

445
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,968
Definitely better, isn't it? It's tender.

446
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,346
-It has an earthy aroma.
-Exactly.

447
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,389
One should eat aggressively.

448
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,309
The little guy growing inside
will need the nutrients.

449
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,144
Why is he such a chatterbox today?

450
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:19,484
Hold on. Why don't we order
a plate of acorn jelly?

451
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,236
It's made from real acorn powder.

452
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,155
Sure.

453
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,033
-Excuse me!
-Yes?

454
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,954
Acorn jelly salad?

455
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,497
Cold acorn jelly soup?

456
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,960
-The salad.
-Got it.

457
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,796
Top it off with
freshly squeezed sesame oil, please.

458
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,172
Sure thing.

459
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,133
Go ahead and dig in.

460
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,219
Okay.

461
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,856
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Yes.

462
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,315
You obviously got lucky.

463
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,359
I know.

464
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,487
To know that things
could've been much worse

465
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,864
fills me with gratitude.

466
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,700
You two should go and study.

467
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:11,286
-U-ram, you haven't washed up yet.
-No.

468
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,923
Wouldn't it be better to lie down?

469
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,508
No, I'm good.

470
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,094
Did Nam Ga-bin make it to the show today?

471
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,972
-Of course.
-How was she?

472
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,559
No wonder she made it as an actress.
She's incredibly charming.

473
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:41,941
Joining us today for Art and Culture Talk
is musical actor Nam Ga-bin.

474
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,693
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

475
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,653
The tone of your voice
is lighter than expected.

476
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,155
Is that so?

477
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,742
You always belt out the notes
whenever you take the stage.

478
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,661
The dialogue and lyrics
have to reach the audience.

479
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,496
-My energy, too.
-I see.

480
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,458
I'm sure our listeners
have many questions to ask.

481
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,877
While we listen to a song,

482
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,713
please send us your questions
and I'll ask on your behalf.

483
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,720
-You're very feminine.
-You too, Ms. Boo.

484
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,805
-Are you an only child?
-Yes.

485
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,849
Didn't you get lonely growing up?

486
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,476
I had cousins to make up for that.

487
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,605
From what I heard,
your parents moved to another country.

488
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,523
Yes, to Spain.

489
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:26,527
I went to watch your show
and I enjoyed it very much.

490
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,445
Thank you.

491
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,531
What other projects do you have lined up?

492
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,450
How did she seem as a person?

493
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,703
Feminine in every way.
I found her adorable too.

494
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,664
No wonder she has many male fans.

495
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,624
Why hasn't she married yet?

496
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,543
Number 5425 asks
why you haven't tied the knot yet

497
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,588
and if there's someone
you're currently dating.

498
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,465
I'd also like to know.

499
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,843
Is it too warm in here?

500
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,012
I wore too many layers.

501
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,432
In terms of marriage,

502
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,559
it's more like I couldn't.

503
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,437
Is marriage something
you see for yourself?

504
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,355
Yes.

505
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:06,025
That's kind of surprising.
People in this line of work

506
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,236
tend to prioritize work over marriage.

507
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,031
-Not you though.
-Yes, one thing led to another.

508
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:19,247
I have my parents to thank for that.
They're still very much in love, you see.

509
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:23,209
I grew up learning
how happy marital life can be.

510
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,754
It's why I always wanted to get married.

511
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,383
I see. Then you just haven't
met anyone you love that much yet.

512
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,144
I have.

513
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:44,230
Goodness.
Someone you're considering marrying?

514
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:49,902
It wasn't love at first sight,
but my trust for him built over time.

515
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,699
You know how important that is.
I have no reason not to marry him.

516
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:58,995
Of course. Trust is very important,
especially in a romantic relationship.

517
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,538
Congratulations.

518
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,790
That's great news.

519
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,168
Could you perhaps tell us
a little about who he is?

520
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,627
Not today.

521
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,881
Her honesty shined.

522
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,133
She is beautiful, talented, and gracious.

523
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,094
Gracious?

524
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:20,183
You should rest, Si-eun.
You seem absolutely exhausted.

525
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,233
-Yes?
-Are you perhaps having a drink?

526
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:33,321
-Should I pick you up?
-I'm at Si-eun's.

527
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,739
Is that where you gathered?

528
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,200
-I'll be right home.
-Sure.

529
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,703
-Have a good night.
-Sure.

530
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,123
Si-eun, get some rest and watch your neck.

531
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,500
Thanks.

532
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,336
Drive home safely.

533
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,379
Got it.

534
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,927
Mom, I'll have some cake.

535
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,347
I thought you ate a lot at Ji-a's place.

536
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,932
And now I'm hungry again.

537
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:17,198
Hye-ryung's like a prickly rose

538
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,618
while Song Yuan is like a lilac.

539
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,204
It's not the most beautiful flower,

540
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,414
but its scent catches your attention.

541
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,921
I can understand
why Sa-hyeon fell for her.

542
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,341
She's graceful too

543
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,344
and knows
how to be courteous toward elders.

544
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,388
Her parents passed away early,

545
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:45,351
but they made sure to give her
the right kind of education.

546
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,316
Can't you hear me over there?
Am I on mute to you?

547
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,114
Why are you always like this?

548
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,826
I don't keep it bottled up inside
because I don't know how to vent.

549
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,120
Should I demonstrate?

550
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,916
Two-faced is what you are.

551
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,920
Go ahead and take Kim Dong-mi in your arms
for all I care.

552
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,840
I couldn't care less and I won't.

553
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,178
Live your life however you want.

554
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:24,015
Why stop at herbal medicine?
Give her your money too.

555
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,308
That'll win her over.

556
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,270
If only I had known you were this toxic.

557
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,356
I'm not as toxic as the man
who never moved on from his first love.

558
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,984
I've been living with a shell of a man.

559
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,903
You got the cream of the crop.

560
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,864
-Lights off.
-It's not even 10 p.m.

561
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,200
We should wait for Song Yuan to get home.

562
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,367
I'm not going to sleep.

563
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,746
You just don't give a damn, do you?

564
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,172
You should be careful on the road too.

565
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,299
That won't stop others
from crashing into me.

566
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,801
Si-eun's been driving for 30 years,
you know.

567
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,554
She must've had a car since college.

568
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,015
Well, she comes from a wealthy family.

569
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,686
Despite having rich parents,
marrying the wrong man ruined her life.

570
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,855
All this time,
I thought he was a decent man.

571
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,277
I feel bad for Si-eun,
but especially for her kids.

572
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,331
You should give me your feet too.

573
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,960
I'm good. I'm not that tired
since I came home early today.

574
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,799
Go ahead and lie down.
Don't fight the sleep that comes your way.

575
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,467
I'd rather not.

576
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,261
-Why not?
-Because this feels good.

577
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,472
Give me your feet
so that I can rub yours too.

578
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,182
It'll be your loss then.

579
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:52,478
You'll have to massage my big feet
with those tiny hands of yours.

580
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,318
If only you'd consider
being a stay-at-home mom.

581
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,696
The thought of you driving worries me.

582
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,781
Then get me a driver.

583
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,284
Sure thing. I'll find a female driver.

584
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,202
I was joking.

585
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,580
You're like a child at shore.

586
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,835
I don't worry you like that, do I?

587
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,087
You worry me more when you're in my sight.

588
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,505
Don't worry about me though.

589
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,466
Do you remember Dr. Cho?

590
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,594
-The director of the oriental clinic?
-Right.

591
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,806
He said that after marriage,

592
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:32,643
men should decide
whether to live as a dad or a son.

593
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,106
-Which one am I?
-What do you think?

594
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,860
Aren't I closer to a dad?

595
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,447
That makes you my eldest daughter!

596
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,953
How about a raise in allowance?

597
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:52,872
Sounds good.

598
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,416
Now, come on up here.

599
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,585
I should do something
to deserve that raise.

600
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,587
How about a shoulder massage?

601
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,547
This is you being a good daughter.

602
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,717
Washing away your tiredness makes my day.

603
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,909
You caught the show when you're that busy?

604
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,328
Right.

605
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,498
You see…

606
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,338
Thanks for that. Sure.

607
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,007
Maybe some other time.

608
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,385
Sure thing.

609
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,598
I've been getting a lot of phone calls.

610
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,183
Is the feedback positive?

611
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,227
Didn't you read the articles online?

612
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,478
I didn't have the time.

613
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,898
They asked me if I was seeing someone
and if I was intending to marry him.

614
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,400
I said yes.

615
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,613
Maybe I shouldn't have.

616
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:10,366
Then the wedding announcement
will seem like a betrayal.

617
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,369
You did the right thing and I'm grateful.

618
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:19,208
People are now curious
as to who I'm dating.

619
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:24,088
I hope you'll bravely face the public
when the time comes.

620
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:26,590
I'm more worried about you.

621
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,968
A lot of hate will come your way.

622
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,053
People will move on soon enough.

623
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,601
Is something troubling you today?

624
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,356
You can tell me.

625
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,901
Is it money?

626
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,238
I should turn my phone off.

627
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:59,874
The radio show you were on today
had a fill-in writer, right?

628
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:04,003
Yes, the head writer got into
a fender bender and couldn't come.

629
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,380
Who told you that?

630
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,052
That writer is the mother of my children.

631
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,603
-The writer who filled in or--
-The head writer.

632
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,608
I would've stopped you from going
if I had known sooner.

633
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,945
I talked to her briefly on my way here.

634
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:31,947
Is she all right?

635
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,743
She only has to wear a C-collar
for a few days.

636
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:39,955
Since you're a public figure,
I wanted to break the news slowly.

637
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,459
What did she say?

638
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:49,590
I guess all that's left is for us to meet.

639
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,176
If she calls, let me know right away.

640
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,846
She's not hotheaded, but you never know.

641
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,724
All right?

642
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,562
It's probably something
that we can't avoid.

643
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,469
I'm prepared for any hardship.

644
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:39,890
I'll deal with anything
that could annoy or frustrate you.

645
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,017
That lessens my worries

646
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,520
and reassures me.

647
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,136
-Aren't you going to shower?
-No.

648
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,804
I can't be bothered today.

649
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,771
Buy a few pregnancy test kits tomorrow.

650
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,983
I can't really be seen buying those.

651
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,324
BOO HYE-RYUNG'S LOVE, MEMORIES, AND MUSIC

652
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,413
WRITER: LEE SI-EUN

653
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,855
ZOLPIDEM TARTRATE

654
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,708
Why aren't you in bed? It's past 2 a.m.

655
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,795
There's something I must watch.

656
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,590
-I'll be done soon.
-Is that a musical?

657
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,966
Yes.

658
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,220
That's when it all began.

659
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,437
-Are you going golfing?
-No, horseback riding.

660
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,773
I'll be home for dinner.

661
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:53,941
Do you ride all day?

662
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,943
The members are having a barbecue.

663
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,569
A time for the guys to chat.

664
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,114
You and Ji-a should go and watch.

665
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:04,034
The members won't be fond
of family members coming and going.

666
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:07,162
They might spook the horses
and disrupt the mood.

667
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:08,789
The sport requires good manners.

668
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:10,916
I see.

669
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,585
I went with him once,
but I couldn't stand the smell.

670
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,383
-Always be careful.
-Sure thing.

671
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:22,428
-We'll have an early dinner.
-At 5 p.m.?

672
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,974
Nice job.

673
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,268
Good.

674
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,525
The cake is divine.

675
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,195
-After I'm done.
-I'll do that, so dig in.

676
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,364
It was from Ms. Sa. You should have some.

677
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,076
Go back to your room and study.

678
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,245
Breaks help the brain function better.

679
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:55,377
I hear the musical actor Nam Ga-bin
was on your radio show.

680
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,089
Yes, did you tune in?

681
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,216
No, I read about it online.

682
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,886
She's getting married soon.
They say she has a boyfriend.

683
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:07,723
The wedding date must already be set
for her to mention her boyfriend.

684
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:10,350
She's 40, but doesn't look her age.

685
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,894
Maybe not marrying kept her young.

686
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,396
It doesn't seem like she had surgery.

687
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,858
You would've met her
if not for that accident.

688
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,110
Right.

689
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:23,363
Her honesty only adds to her charms.

690
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,746
-What is it?
-My mind just drifted elsewhere.

691
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,081
Let's watch a musical after my CSAT.

692
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:34,833
Sure.

693
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,960
Can I play at Gi-ppeum's house?

694
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,922
You went to Ji-a's yesterday,
and now Gi-ppeum's?

695
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:40,964
You should be reading.

696
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:44,551
To be successful in life,
one must read books.

697
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,887
Go ahead, but don't be home too late.

698
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,138
Got it.

699
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,102
People are not always what they seem.

700
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:57,689
Don't idolize her
just because she's a good actor.

701
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,067
There's more to people than meets the eye.

702
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,779
Right? Did you get wind of any rumors?

703
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:07,324
You have. Can you tell me?

704
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:08,951
I didn't pay attention.

705
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,538
Anyway, I'd like to lie down.

706
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:13,747
Sure.

707
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:17,960
You should've stayed
at the hospital for a few days.

708
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:24,800
Oh, no.

709
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,469
What now?

710
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:38,188
-You're here.
-Yes, hello.

711
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,607
That cousin of yours…

712
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:42,818
She's here too.

713
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,820
Is she seeing anyone?

714
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:51,159
I think so. Why do you ask?

715
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,578
Someone asked me

716
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,830
if I knew a lady
willing to go on a blind date.

717
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:59,334
The younger generation
prefers random encounters.

718
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:00,752
Yes, of course.

719
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,469
-Hello there.
-Yes, hello.

720
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,430
-Is that yulmu tea?
-Yes.

721
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,601
I see you prefer healthier choices
when most are caffeine addicts.

722
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:19,229
My dad prohibited me
from drinking caffeinated drinks.

723
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,441
Good for him. They're hard to do without
once you're hooked.

724
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:25,902
I don't crave them much
since I never have them.

725
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,989
But coffee smells incredible.

726
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,866
Just the smell.

727
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,662
I asked Dr. Shin if you were seeing anyone

728
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,956
to suggest a blind date,

729
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:40,542
but he says you are.

730
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,880
Do you take after your mother?

731
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:46,965
Yes.

732
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,801
Let's go.

733
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,511
-Don't you want any tea?
-I'm good.

734
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,056
-I'll see you next time.
-Sure.

735
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:58,644
-Is your bag loaded?
-Yes.

736
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:09,237
I wonder if my daughter
takes after me in any way.

737
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,324
How about we play Truth or Dare?

738
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,618
-Sure.
-I'll go first.

739
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,912
Is the skin on your ass grazed?

740
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,164
It is.

741
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,416
Should I tend to it?

742
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,922
Wait. I have nothing to ask.

743
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,549
I'll go again then.

744
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,551
Have you been on a blind date?

745
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,682
Judging by your hesitation, you have.

746
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:39,309
Do you want me to or not?

747
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,520
-I asked first.
-Just once.

748
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,526
-Are you upset?
-How was it?

749
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,444
Did I have fun or did I like him?

750
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,405
Was it nice?

751
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,614
So-so.

752
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,951
A close friend introduced me to her cousin
without asking first.

753
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,871
Was that it? No second date?

754
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,957
No, he wasn't my type.

755
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,460
I'm in no position to tell you what to do,

756
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,921
and you can go on
all the blind dates you want,

757
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,841
but I just hope
your feelings for me never change.

758
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,510
-I'm being greedy, aren't I?
-Yes.

759
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:16,179
I can't help but feel that way though.

760
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,223
It's selfish.

761
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,101
Would it be less selfish if I stopped you?

762
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:30,444
How about some music?

763
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:36,742
Just don't doubt my feelings for you.

764
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:40,203
It annoys me that I can never have you
all to myself.

765
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:43,874
Our lives are full of things we lack.

766
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,084
For me, it's you.

767
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:52,507
My feelings for you deepen every day.

768
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,218
But there's nothing I can do about it.

769
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,804
There's a solution,
but you'll never consider it.

770
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,641
You know I can't because of my daughter.

771
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,070
-Some ice wine?
-I'll get a glass.

772
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,955
Is it too sweet for you?

773
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,042
It's good as a standalone drink.
I find it refreshing.

774
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,835
Anyway, what do you want for dinner?

775
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,296
My gosh. I should be the one to cook.

776
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,924
Take advantage of me while I stay here.

777
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,134
Staying busy
helps me keep my mind off things.

778
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,302
Sure.

779
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:41,389
What is it?

780
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:44,184
I remember the day
you met us for the first time.

781
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,020
You were in a light-green dress.

782
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:49,272
My gosh. Do you still remember that?

783
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:52,943
Of course. You were stunning
and like a breath of fresh air.

784
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,361
You're still that stunning.

785
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:56,905
I'm too old now.

786
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,491
If you're too old, what does that make me?

787
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:02,953
You never gave birth to a child,
so no parts sag.

788
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:05,247
I also have hidden inches here and there.

789
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,503
First impressions last forever.

790
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,965
You, my late husband, and Yu-sin…

791
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:18,635
I called him by his name
until Ji-a was born.

792
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:23,098
To me, Yu-sin is still
the same seven-year-old.

793
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:26,601
Even to this day, I remember
how you and his father were

794
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,937
the first time I met you.

795
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:33,233
You were nothing but gracious,
but I was still a nervous wreck.

796
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,734
It seemed that way.

797
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,988
That's why I felt bad.
I could see myself in you.

798
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,371
My father passed away
while I was still a child

799
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,916
and my mother put me through school
by sewing for money.

800
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,753
Thanks to her, I finished nursing school.

801
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,549
She had a rough life.

802
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,843
So I knew how your life had been.

803
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:03,722
When I heard that your father
had passed away when you were a child,

804
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:07,058
I wanted to make this marriage
happen for you.

805
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,645
It didn't take long
for his father to come around.

806
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,148
Thank you.

807
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:16,234
It's just that you were meant to be
a part of the family.

808
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,739
I was terribly lonely growing up.

809
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,576
I had no younger or older siblings.

810
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:28,121
My mother died a month before my wedding.

811
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:33,376
I even thought she left me so that
she wouldn't have to see me get married.

812
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:37,005
You see, she fell ill
after meeting Yu-sin's father.

813
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:41,760
A lot of times, I cried even on good days.

814
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:44,054
When in joy

815
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,140
and when in sorrow, I cried in secret.

816
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:48,975
I knew others wouldn't understand.

817
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,811
I can imagine what it was like for you.

818
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:56,441
No one knows
that I get depressed once in a while.

819
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,278
No one can see past my smiles.

820
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,280
They shouldn't, but still.

821
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,032
Yu-sin knows.

822
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:08,119
He told me how he was never loved enough
by his late birth mother.

823
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,788
That trauma of his…

824
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,959
I tried all that I could
to fill the void she left in him.

825
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:18,964
What was his birth mother like?

826
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,257
She was cold-hearted.

827
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,806
I felt bad for him, you know.

828
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:31,601
The crestfallen and timid seven-year-old
would follow me around

829
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,020
because I looked out for him a lot.

830
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,190
They lived near the hospital back then,
you see.

831
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,901
Yu-sin's fully aware
of what you did for him.

832
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,820
-Really?
-Yes.

833
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,995
Most families don't get along well

834
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,288
when the fathers remarry.

835
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:55,333
Some families get completely shattered.

836
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,877
After her first marriage failed,

837
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,422
a friend of mine married a divorced chef.

838
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:04,384
She's still at war with her stepchildren.

839
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,098
-I can hold my liquor easily today.
-Me too.

840
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,850
Then let's keep drinking.

841
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:22,318
I know I can never be like
a mother to you,

842
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:25,113
but think of me as an aunt or sister.

843
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,200
-Sure.
-Don't worry about managing the house.

844
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,453
You know I'm an expert at that.

845
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,413
You're an expert in every aspect.

846
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,752
I'm a woman too,

847
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,755
so of course I wanted a child of my own.

848
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:46,760
But I couldn't do that
to the young Yu-sin.

849
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,928
You know how selfish people can be.

850
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:53,224
Blood is thicker than water.
If I had a child of my own,

851
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,560
I would've cared more for him or her.

852
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,854
It's why I gave up on the idea.

853
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,482
That wouldn't have been easy.

854
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:04,527
As a woman yourself,
you understand the sacrifice.

855
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,947
Of course, and I'm truly grateful.

856
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:12,327
Because I was busy
and Father was there for you,

857
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,954
I didn't get around
to care for you enough.

858
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,707
I'll do even better from now on.

859
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:24,214
Love is supposed to trickle down.
I should be the one to open up first.

860
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:28,760
If you're irritated
or frustrated in any way,

861
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:30,345
let me know immediately.

862
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,139
Not doing so
will only lead to misunderstandings.

863
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,849
-You too.
-Of course.

864
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:42,148
I won't doubt your intentions anymore.

865
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,735
-Thank you.
-Good job, everyone.

866
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,085
PRODUCER SA PI-YOUNG

867
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:09,801
Hello, this is Nam Ga-bin.

868
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,681
Yes, I received a lot of calls.

869
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,643
It's all because
you invited me to the show.

870
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:25,066
Anyway, I was hoping to get
the head writer's contact information.

871
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,404
Yes, Ms. Lee Si-eun.

872
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,657
Her number wasn't on the question sheet.

873
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:37,412
Hello?

874
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:40,331
Hey, Si-eun. How's your neck?
Did it get any worse?

875
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:41,791
No, I'm good.

876
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,043
And we enjoyed the cake.

877
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:45,712
Wasn't it delicious?

878
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,882
Yes, it only took a day
for the kids to finish it.

879
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:53,678
Nam Ga-bin called just now
to ask for your number.

880
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,807
Should I tell her?

881
00:57:58,725 --> 00:57:59,559
Sure.

882
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,936
She probably wants to
wish you a full recovery.

883
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,316
-I see.
-See you on Monday, then.

884
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,567
Sure thing.

885
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,643
Are you here?

886
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:43,520
Yes.

887
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,649
-Hello?
-It's me, Father.

888
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:50,318
-I know.
-Did you meet her yesterday?

889
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:54,948
Hello?

890
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:59,577
FATHER

891
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:03,873
What was that?

892
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,710
Is he avoiding my calls?

893
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:24,686
-What about Mother?
-It's just me.

894
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:30,108
-Where's Sa-hyeon?
-He went out a few minutes ago.

895
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:35,446
You should've called, Father.
I would've put together some dinner.

896
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:38,324
I had a big lunch, so I'm good.

897
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,121
Have a seat.

898
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:49,210
Anyway, please call in advance next time.

899
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:51,254
You know I'm hardly home.

900
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,506
I don't want you
to make the trip for nothing.

901
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:57,885
I met her and there's nothing
for you to worry about.

902
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,098
Did she seem decent?

903
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:05,101
She doesn't look like a gold digger

904
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:10,315
and has no intention
of forcing Sa-hyeon into marrying her.

905
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:13,109
Your mother-in-law was right.

906
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:16,613
Anyway, I think you can
forget this matter now.

907
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,323
We'll care for the baby instead.

908
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,576
Even the nicest things
get old when mentioned often.

909
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,246
Let it slide,
and don't dig the matter back up

910
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,832
whenever Sa-hyeon gets on your nerves.

911
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:30,001
-That could--
-That could what?

912
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,753
Could it push him into her arms?

913
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:33,504
That's how it is with people.

914
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:37,592
Men are especially wired that way.

915
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:41,262
Maybe she's playing you
so that she wouldn't have to move.

916
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,514
She seems conniving to me.

917
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:46,392
First Mother and now you
have fallen into her trap.

918
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,561
Her trap? We're not animals.

919
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,814
Anyway, I'm a good judge of character.

920
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:55,526
-Even you--
-I know you weren't fond of me at first.

921
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,321
To be honest,

922
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:00,823
it was because of your age.

923
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,034
Mother says she seems older too,

924
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:07,288
but you don't harbor
any bad feelings for her.

925
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,749
Only because she's carrying a child.

926
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,753
How can I force her to do anything
when she's carrying a baby?

927
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,713
What if something happens to it?

928
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,050
Besides, she's not his wife.

929
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:22,470
Forget about it as of today
and try mending your relationship.

930
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,390
-That's most important.
-As if nothing happened?

931
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:26,516
That's right.

932
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:30,019
As if nothing happened.

933
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:32,980
This is killing me from inside.

934
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:37,485
Would it kill her
not to talk back once in a while?

935
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,862
I'm her father-in-law for god's sake.

936
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,740
Women from back in the day

937
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:46,536
internalized their pain
when they had it worse than this.

938
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:49,789
Take it as a learning experience
and move on.

939
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,541
It'll feel like nothing over time.

940
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,209
There's the saying, ilcheyusimjo.

941
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,129
Don't you know what it means?

942
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:59,048
"The heart controls it all."

943
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,217
It depends on your attitude.

944
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,636
Where are we headed?

945
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,139
North of the Han River.

946
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,725
Why there?

947
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:13,438
The city is not as dry
as it is south of the river.

948
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:19,360
By the way, my father might contact you.

949
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,445
I met him yesterday.

950
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,740
-Where?
-At my place.

951
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:27,285
My mom, too?

952
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:31,664
Yes. They bought me a lot of fruit

953
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,416
and sent over flowers.

954
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,544
What did my father say?

955
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:38,880
He was very considerate.

956
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:41,883
Really? Didn't he say anything else?

957
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:42,800
Not really.

958
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:46,596
We had dinner at the Heungbu
Korean thistle rice restaurant.

959
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,849
-Near my parents' place?
-Yes.

960
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:52,143
-I even visited the house.
-Really?

961
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,944
My dad must've taken a liking to you.

962
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:05,114
I knew it. All people think alike.

963
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:08,576
What about you? What was your take on him?

964
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,286
What did you think?

965
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,497
He's an affectionate man

966
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:15,166
although he doesn't quite show it.

967
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:17,585
I won't have to eat to be full today.

968
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:20,379
Then let's do something else.

969
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:24,467
You should eat for Bada's sake though.
It needs the nutrients.

970
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:25,802
Aren't I right, Bada?

971
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:30,765
So how are you feeling?
Did you stomach the rice yesterday?

972
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:33,851
Yes, I was able to.

973
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:36,229
We should go back there sometime.

974
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,690
If only we didn't have a reservation.

975
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,235
We can't go to Daejeon at this hour.

976
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,611
Why not?

977
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:46,656
I'd take you to Jeju
if hairtail soup is something you want.

978
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:47,907
I really mean it.

979
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,370
What's wrong?

980
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:56,999
Here you go.

981
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:11,324
Hello?

982
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:22,793
Is this Ms. Lee Si-eun?

983
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:25,880
Yes.

984
01:05:25,963 --> 01:05:28,883
This is Nam Ga-bin.

985
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:02,249
I've been casted.

986
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,626
-In a drama?
-A movie.

987
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:05,002
Nam Ga-bin's seeing someone.

988
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:06,170
Was she on your show?

989
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,506
-I'm his daughter.
-Hyang-gi.

990
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:10,508
I was dying to see
who Dad had cheated with.

991
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:13,052
To see what kind of a tramp
he abandoned his family for

992
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,388
and forced his wife
into getting a divorce.

993
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:16,514
I can see why, now.

994
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:18,349
I thought you liked rough hands.

995
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:19,850
I just wanted to get a good look

996
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,436
to see if our baby's hands
will resemble yours.

997
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,523
-Young master!
-I'm going to cheat on him at least once.

998
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:27,274
This is going to end happily
no matter what.

999
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:29,735
I'm more at ease with you
than I am with my own mother.

1000
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:32,029
-My gosh.
-I really am.

1001
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:36,784
Honey?

1002
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,582
What brand is that jacket?

1003
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:50,506
