EPISODE 4

2
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,354
-What the heck?
-Damn it.

3
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,196
What's going on?

4
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,286
What the heck?

5
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,083
Did you hurt your back?

6
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,085
No, I'm fine. Damn it.

7
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,708
Where are the nightgowns?

8
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,794
-Over there. Please follow me.
-Thank you.

9
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,089
Just a second. You can take a look.

10
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,181
Hello, this is No Wire.

11
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,988
Would you like to take a look?

12
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,867
What size is this?

13
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,942
Sister, what could you
desperately be praying for?

14
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,353
Thank you.

15
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,905
Turn the radio on.

16
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,450
-To Hye-ryung's show?
-Yes.

17
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,036
I'd rather not be distracted.

18
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,537
It's not for the songs.

19
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,248
We need to hear her voice
to know how she's feeling.

20
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,883
-Is Hye-ryung here?
-Not yet.

21
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,934
I'm sorry. Hi, Ms. Lee.

22
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,396
"This happened ten years ago
when my mom turned 60.

23
00:05:56,105 --> 00:06:00,068
She and her high school friends
agreed to party at a night club,

24
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,236
and I remember that night clearly.

25
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,449
She did her best
to look younger than her age.

26
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,410
I asked why she was dressed
in such a different way,

27
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,872
and she told me
she was going out with her old friends.

28
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,165
I thought nothing of it.

29
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:18,753
But it turned out that the five old ladies
went to a club in Gangnam.

30
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:22,673
A club that was known
for only letting in the hottest people.

31
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,719
Anyway, they entered the club
while encouraging each other,

32
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,388
and the waiters kindly escorted them.

33
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,850
They were thrilled to see
that their outfits, makeup,

34
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:36,479
and the dim lights made them
seem like they were in their 30s.

35
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,815
They followed the waiters escorting them

36
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,735
while being careful not to trip
on their high heels in the dark.

37
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,237
Then the waiter stopped

38
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,489
and pointed to a door
they should go through.

39
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,201
They figured
they were being escorted to a room

40
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,037
considering how they were older
than the average clubbers.

41
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,580
However, that door

42
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,083
was the back door leading outside.

43
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,461
They were being kindly gestured to leave.

44
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,881
-How silly.
-Talk about being humiliated.

45
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,926
The incident is still a sore memory
to my mom and her friends.

46
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,221
That outing of my mom's

47
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,390
taught me to live my life
according to age.

48
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,600
I also learned how we must

49
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,228
sacrifice many things as we age."

50
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,189
That's right.

51
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,401
Giving up sounds so easy and simple,

52
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:28,781
and it might be easy
when it comes to hobbies or preferences.

53
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,369
But if it's a person
that you must give up on,

54
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,829
then it won't be easy.

55
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,374
Username 4475 says,

56
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,544
"The waiters would've been
more flustered than the moms."

57
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,504
That may be right.

58
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,632
Username 3216 says,
"The mothers are adorable."

59
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,886
Username 9338 says,
"I turned 40 this year,

60
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,805
but I still want to go clubbing. Boo-hoo."

61
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,600
The fun comments keep coming up.

62
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,101
Username 3812 says,

63
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,438
"What you said really hit home with me,
Hye-ryung.

64
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,025
I've given up on my son."

65
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,780
I don't know what led to that,

66
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,700
but it must have been devastating.

67
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:17,914
I hope this next song
can bring you a little solace.

68
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,375
It's "Oh, My Darling" by Humming Love.

69
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,795
If you're out there
dozing off after lunch,

70
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,424
sway gently to this beat,
and you'll feel afresh.

71
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,263
Hye-ryung always has the best ad-libs.

72
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,606
Pan Sa-hyeon, you rascal.
Maybe I should have an affair too.

73
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,567
I'm Boo Hye-ryung.

74
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,195
I could seduce a pop singer
if I wanted to.

75
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:24,230
I'd give anything to buy eyes
that haven't seen her dance.

76
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,281
Nice.

77
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,116
Let me take a photo.

78
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,702
Please don't.

79
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,999
Seriously? Don't take photos.

80
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,502
Don't.

81
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,550
Come here, Doctor. Join me.

82
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,108
-Gosh, my back.
-Take your time.

83
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,026
Dr. Shin.

84
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,486
Hello.

85
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,780
-Did your daughter visit?
-Yes.

86
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,742
-How long did you walk?
-Quite long.

87
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,327
Then you'll sleep well tonight.

88
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,955
-Has she eaten?
-A quarter of a rice bowl.

89
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,211
Doctor, you're unbelievably handsome.

90
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,506
Just the sight of you makes my day.

91
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,427
And seeing you walk like this
makes my day too.

92
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,595
I'll keep walking.

93
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,055
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

94
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,935
KIM:
I WANT TO SEE CATS WITH YOU

95
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,358
Boo Hye-ryung's Love, Memories, and Music
comes to a close.

96
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:37,530
Listeners, don't get exhausted
and stay lively throughout the day.

97
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,032
We'll end the show
with an upbeat song today.

98
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,202
Here is "The Artist."
Sa Pi-young is the producer,

99
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,832
and Mr. Seo is the engineer.

100
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,146
"Mr. Seo"?

101
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,899
Wasn't the engineer's name Seo Ban?

102
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,193
Right.

103
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,654
Was that a mistake?

104
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:22,867
I'm sorry.

105
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,870
I should change my name
to "Executive Manager."

106
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,124
My mind went blank.

107
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,586
What do we do?

108
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,593
Yes, sir.

109
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:47,933
Ji-a,

110
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,020
what would you do
if your parents got in an argument?

111
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,607
Would you look the other way
or would you get them to reconcile?

112
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,943
-Reconcile.
-That's what I did.

113
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,697
Did your parents argue?

114
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,991
Not exactly.

115
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,451
Dad asked for a divorce.

116
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,578
Really? Why?

117
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,914
I'm sorry for causing a mess.

118
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,665
It's all right.

119
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,168
We get good ratings,
so nothing much was said.

120
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,545
I'm sure Mr. Seo was a bit upset

121
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,005
even though he didn't show it.

122
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,926
I was about to close the show
when his name slipped my mind.

123
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,719
Besides, it's not like

124
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,180
I could leave the booth and ask his name.

125
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,349
I couldn't text him either.

126
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,352
Why did you and your husband argue?

127
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:35,147
It was about having kids.
He suddenly suggested we have one.

128
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,608
Your kids would be blessed
with your genes.

129
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,360
Your beauty, his brains,

130
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,736
and your in-laws' fortune.

131
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,613
If I were you, I'd have three.

132
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,448
Isn't it exhausting?

133
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,076
You don't know
because you're not a mother yet.

134
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,787
Babies are adorable and fun to raise.

135
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,790
They're adorable
and they bring you more joy.

136
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,669
Doors to another world open
the moment you take one in your arms.

137
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,755
-A miracle.
-It's that good?

138
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,550
Words can't possibly describe it all.

139
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,885
Imagine the universe in your arms.

140
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,098
So it's like being
in the arms of a man for the first time.

141
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,517
-At what age?
-Wow.

142
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,355
By the way,
I saw Mr. Seo at your in-law's golf club.

143
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,856
He didn't see me though.

144
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,276
-Really?
-Does Mr. Seo play golf?

145
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,279
Honestly, that's unexpected.

146
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,031
I was surprised too.
He seemed like a different person.

147
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,534
Like a pro golfer almost.

148
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,536
His clothes were all from designer brands.

149
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,954
Really?

150
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,372
Was he with a woman?

151
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,623
With two men.

152
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,627
By the looks of it, he seemed like
a member of your in-laws' golf club.

153
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,464
No way. The membership price is steep.

154
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,134
-I know.
-Someone must have invited him.

155
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,970
I'm just telling you what I saw.
You could find out.

156
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,432
Could he have a sponsor?
A middle-aged rich woman, perhaps?

157
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,686
No way. He's not really
the flirtatious type.

158
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,563
He could have an alter ego.

159
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,273
A man living a double life.

160
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,067
Why else wouldn't he marry?

161
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,029
He's good-looking and has a decent job.

162
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,615
-He's a mysterious old man.
-A mysterious bachelor.

163
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,208
Something came up,
so I'll be having dinner outside.

164
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,880
I should grab some light dinner with Ji-a.

165
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,423
My husband will be late today.

166
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,675
Is that too much rice?

167
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,886
-It's fine.
-Grilled hairtail and radish salad.

168
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,388
Dad's favorite.

169
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,433
How do you get it golden-brown?
I can never grill it properly.

170
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,519
With time and effort.

171
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,063
-Thank you for the meal.
-Sure.

172
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,607
U-ram, measure your weight every morning.

173
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,652
Okay. I gained one kilogram,

174
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,154
but it's because I got taller, not fatter.

175
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,531
But your pants still fit.

176
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,491
You didn't even grow five centimeters.

177
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,494
I hear Winter Love is fun.
Want to go watch it?

178
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,122
Are you free?
What about the opening script?

179
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,708
-I can write it once I get back.
-And cut back on sleep?

180
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,752
Let's go on the weekend.

181
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,296
I hear it's tear-jerking,
but well-executed.

182
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,007
I hate sad movies.

183
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,634
-I prefer comedies.
-That will change with age.

184
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,726
You're good at everything, Mom,
especially cooking.

185
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,768
I approve.

186
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,689
-You sound like an old man.
-Look here, fair lady.

187
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,775
I'm being a gentleman, not an old man.

188
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,528
Where did you pick that up?

189
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,447
In a comic book.

190
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,744
That reminds me.
Hye-ryung slipped up today, didn't she?

191
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,203
Yes.

192
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,457
It wasn't anything big.

193
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,709
Our engineer's name
suddenly slipped her mind.

194
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,338
"Sa Pi-young is the producer,
and Mr. Seo is the engineer."

195
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:38,182
-Do we still have the portable bed?
-It's in the shed.

196
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,226
Can you bring it out?
Sa-hyeon will be here for it soon.

197
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,978
-Yes, ma'am.
-And dust it.

198
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,563
I kept it well-covered.

199
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,607
Honey?

200
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:49,818
Honey!

201
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:52,946
Yes?

202
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,824
Does he want the portable bed?

203
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,077
Yes.

204
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,789
They'll be sleeping apart.

205
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,958
I know, but I needed a reason
to get him here.

206
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,670
Hye-ryung will be fine
if we get Sa-hyeon to end things.

207
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,381
He'd better do as he's told.

208
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,712
I can't believe you.
How can you eat right now?

209
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,048
How's Hye-ryung doing?

210
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,300
Not even a mutt
gets interrupted when eating.

211
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,219
I'm just hungry.

212
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:05,978
Yes, Mr. Choi.

213
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,147
Really?

214
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,357
Tell them I'll be right there.

215
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,192
Sure.

216
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,156
-What did Mr. Choi want?
-It's about…

217
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,033
Chairman Oh.

218
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,703
He runs a big business abroad.

219
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:24,872
He's here.

220
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,045
You need to end it right away.

221
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,214
Or kiss your inheritance goodbye.

222
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:42,306
Wait. Where's my jacket from Italy?
Get it quick.

223
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,393
Did Hye-ryung kick you out of your room?

224
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,687
Mom.

225
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,191
Just beg forgiveness and end the affair.

226
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,234
That's the only option for you.

227
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,404
You know that your dad isn't one to bluff.

228
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,239
No one can persuade him otherwise.

229
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,452
-Mom--
-I'll say this again.

230
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,330
A true man should admit his mistakes.

231
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,207
You made a terrible mistake.

232
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,250
If you were a son-in-law, I'd…

233
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,505
She's pregnant.

234
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,553
Hye-ryung?

235
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,347
No.

236
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,140
Then who?

237
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,768
She's five weeks pregnant.

238
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,438
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

239
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,858
Goodness.

240
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,526
Does Hye-ryung know?

241
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,364
-We need to handle this.
-Did I get her pregnant?

242
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,281
Why should I?

243
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,909
I'll do it myself, but I need…

244
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,036
I need your help.

245
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:47,871
Mom.

246
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,123
I even had a conception dream.

247
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,626
Is it a girl or a boy?

248
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,712
Hold on a second.

249
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,632
Then the dream your father had…

250
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:02,386
-Dad had one too?
-This is huge. Goodness.

251
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,596
It is huge indeed.

252
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,056
What if Hye-ryung finds out?

253
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,227
And what about your father?

254
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,647
Hye-ryung's the one
who didn't want to have kids.

255
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,191
So you make one out of wedlock?

256
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:20,153
-You agreed to stay childless.
-Because Hye-ryung wanted to.

257
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,490
So this is what you do?
Are you kidding me?

258
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,285
Why marry her in the first place then?

259
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,578
-You were head over heels for her.
-I know.

260
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,294
This isn't the time to question
who's right and wrong,

261
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,963
but to join forces
and use collective wisdom.

262
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,089
First,

263
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,175
when should I tell Hye-ryung?

264
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,802
She'll freak out for sure.

265
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:47,431
She won't. She's not the type.
I'll eat my hat if she does.

266
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,391
Whatever! This is your mess.

267
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,059
And I'll take care of it.

268
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,395
Damn it!

269
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,773
-That hurts.
-I'm that furious!

270
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,987
We must stay calm at times like this.

271
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,364
Being rational is the solution
to any crisis.

272
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,241
That's the case for us.

273
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,910
I need to live through this.
You and Dad too.

274
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,662
You should live a long, healthy life

275
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,582
and watch your grandchild grow up.

276
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,543
You're shameless.

277
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:20,047
Mom, all you need to do is
to tell Dad about this.

278
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,757
I'll handle the rest by myself.

279
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,177
Don't blindly take Hye-ryung's side

280
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,970
or mine for that matter.

281
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,306
You and Dad just need to remain neutral.

282
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,185
-It's not that hard, is it?
-Not at all.

283
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,980
So you're adamant
about divorcing Hye-ryung?

284
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,318
-Yes.
-Who is this other woman?

285
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,279
She deliberately got pregnant
to marry you.

286
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:47,282
That's not the case.
This is a gift from God.

287
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,704
I'm caught between a rock
and a hard place. What do I do?

288
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,624
You'll divorce Hye-ryung
because of the baby?

289
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:57,542
I don't

290
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,921
love Hye-ryung anymore.

291
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:04,591
I can't believe I wasted 10 months
carrying you in my womb.

292
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,302
Mom, what do you know about love?

293
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,930
You didn't marry Dad
because you loved him.

294
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,973
-You were--
-But you loved Hye-ryung.

295
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:14,893
I know.

296
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,147
I fell out of love with her,
even when I thought I wouldn't.

297
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,819
I loved her when I married her.
God knows that.

298
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,196
You'll only get divorced again
after a few years.

299
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,739
Not this time.

300
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,828
-Jun-jae.
-Yes?

301
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,996
-I'd like some water.
-Yes, ma'am.

302
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:38,834
Mom.

303
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,461
I almost got doused with water last night.

304
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,689
I might have had a heart attack
from the water

305
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,941
if she didn't trip and fall.

306
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,653
-Really?
-Why would I lie?

307
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,280
You can ask her if you want.

308
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,198
I was lucky.

309
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,286
How will she react
if she finds out about the pregnancy?

310
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:17,455
I'll run for it when I sense danger,
and save myself first.

311
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:23,879
Mom.

312
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,591
Aren't you happy, to be honest?

313
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,301
Deep down, I mean.

314
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,471
How old is she? Young, right?

315
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:38,518
I'll tell you all about her
once I end it with Hye-ryung.

316
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,146
I can't tell you right now.

317
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,648
You're ashamed to introduce her.

318
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,276
Is she a bar hostess?

319
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,654
Are you insane?
Do you think I'm that stupid?

320
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,782
Sure, you're the smartest.
You have to be smart to cheat.

321
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:56,077
Mom, please.
Will you stop putting it like that?

322
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,330
-Stop calling me a cheater.
-Fine!

323
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,749
Adulterer.

324
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:07,005
Can't you please think of this
from my perspective?

325
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,340
No, I can't.

326
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,302
Mom, U-ram is quite prudent, you know.

327
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,555
How do you know that word?

328
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:19,768
Grandma taught me the word
while describing Dad.

329
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,479
Your dad isn't just prudent,
but also sweet.

330
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,688
-Right?
-Yes.

331
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,025
U-ram's dad wanted a divorce,

332
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:32,447
but he and his sister
persuaded him to change his mind.

333
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,074
Really?

334
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,077
I guess it just crossed his mind.

335
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,580
He says that he knows

336
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,499
he's been having mood swings.

337
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,918
I called it a mid-life crisis.

338
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,379
Yes, that's what it is.

339
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:52,133
Si-eun, you look amazing all dressed up.

340
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,345
-Don't flatter me.
-You look terrific.

341
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,934
I'm going to dress up from now.

342
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:05,105
This recent incident
made me look back on my life too.

343
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,733
My mother-in-law said,

344
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,860
"Women are still women,
even when they're 100.

345
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,696
We should never lose our femininity."

346
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,450
It's easier said than done.

347
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,329
Si-eun, nothing's easy in life.

348
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,874
But if you try hard, the effort pays off.

349
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,796
Marriage is something
that truly requires a lot of effort.

350
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,933
I knew you'd still be awake,
my beloved wife.

351
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:49,899
I missed you.

352
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,320
Come home late more often.
I'm loving the flattery.

353
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,821
Do you think this is flattery?

354
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,741
I'm kidding. Take a bath.

355
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,830
What will the grandchild will be like?

356
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,757
I wish I had known about it sooner.

357
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,217
I shouldn't have persuaded Hye-ryung.

358
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,527
The soap smells great.

359
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,488
I'll do it.

360
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,283
Just one scoop each.

361
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,956
I shouldn't eat this, but it's so good.

362
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,543
Why not?
A single scoop won't make you fat.

363
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,337
Says the doctor?

364
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,006
I can back it up with facts. It's true.

365
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,674
But we put Ji-a to bed.

366
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,386
She can have some tomorrow.

367
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:03,264
It's weird how this tastes better
when you pick it up to eat at home.

368
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,058
Right?

369
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,646
Don't make it a habit though.

370
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:16,528
You're not like other women, you know.

371
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,156
When other husbands come home late,

372
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,701
most wives ask questions like
where they were and whom they were with.

373
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,913
How do you know that so well?

374
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,624
From watching my employees and friends.

375
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,460
Don't you want to ask?

376
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,212
I do want to ask,

377
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,089
but you must be too tired to answer.

378
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:40,009
I guess it might be
if you asked me all the time,

379
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:45,265
but I'll never be tired
of the questions you ask me. Never.

380
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:48,685
I trust you so much
that I don't feel the need to.

381
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,062
-Besides…
-Besides, what?

382
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,482
You might think I have Othello syndrome,

383
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,109
since you're a psychiatrist.

384
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,988
I'm sure there's no other wife as wise

385
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,282
and generous as you are.

386
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,909
You're truly one-of-a-kind, Sa Pi-young.

387
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,455
Is that flattery or a compliment?

388
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:10,457
The truth

389
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,250
from deep within my heart.

390
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,337
You know I can't live without you.

391
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,112
The woman Sa-hyeon's been seeing

392
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,907
is pregnant.

393
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,661
That's why he can't help it.
She has to give birth--

394
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,581
Should she get an abortion then?

395
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:55,752
-That punk-ass brat. I should--
-Stop it.

396
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,297
We can't let the child grow up fatherless,

397
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,800
and we most certainly
can't steal the baby away.

398
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,052
Betraying your devoted wife…

399
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:09,015
However devoted,
a daughter-in-law isn't blood-related.

400
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,517
But a child is!

401
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,460
You know…

402
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,714
Pan Mun-ho?

403
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,471
Wake up, stubborn man.

404
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,110
You sure have gotten old.

405
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,029
Nothing's left besides your vanity.

406
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,846
-What is it?
-Open up.

407
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,140
Let's talk tomorrow.

408
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:35,977
Open up!

409
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:04,213
You're the reason
I made a mistake on-air and got an earful!

410
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,008
Why is that my fault?

411
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,762
I couldn't focus on my work!

412
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,847
And why did you lock the door?

413
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,141
I didn't mean to!

414
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,189
Dongmi, here's your breakfast.

415
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,527
Humans and animals are alike.

416
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,488
Childhood makes your breasts saggy.

417
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,132
-When did I get back last night?
-Around one in the morning.

418
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,804
So what did Sa-hyeon have to say?

419
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,931
It's a long story.

420
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,225
You should eat first.

421
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,142
A long story?

422
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,936
Will he not break up?

423
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,313
Breakfast is ready.

424
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,148
Coming.

425
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,486
If he doesn't sort this out within a week,

426
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,613
I'll be there to see him.

427
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,713
Thank you.

428
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,054
We'll begin the weekly briefing.

429
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,765
Please, go ahead.

430
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,559
We'll start with the abnormalities.

431
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,645
There were no issues
with the male patients in Ward Five.

432
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:46,607
There's a 55-year-old male patient
who was supposed to be admitted

433
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,151
to Ward Seven last Thursday.

434
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:51,571
We were made aware
of a previous trauma to the head,

435
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:54,407
but his guardian told us
he couldn't even go to the store

436
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,576
to buy drinks for the past two weeks,

437
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,453
so we suspected a cerebral hemorrhage.

438
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,664
We were correct,
and he was transferred to Joseon General.

439
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,334
He'll be transferred back to our hospital
after his surgery.

440
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,295
That's all.

441
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,172
Who's his surgeon at Joseon General?

442
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,176
I'll find out, sir.

443
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,387
What were the signs of his condition?

444
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:20,933
Are you sure?

445
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,019
Yes.

446
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,649
How far along is she?

447
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,110
She's now in her fifth week.

448
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,407
What's done is done,

449
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,787
so maybe it's time
to look for other options.

450
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,958
He wouldn't tell me her age or occupation.

451
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,754
He'll introduce her to us
once he divorces Hye-ryung.

452
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:50,880
Says who?

453
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:53,424
Who says we even want to meet her?

454
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,468
Think about it.

455
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,054
Isn't Hye-ryung just as responsible?

456
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,474
She wanted a quiet marriage without kids,

457
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,435
but that meant she put her job first.

458
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,770
Even so,

459
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:09,023
how could we kick her to the curb

460
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,527
just because Sa-hyeon
got another woman pregnant?

461
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,196
I told him to take care of it on his own.

462
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,325
What can we do
when the kids are just as stubborn?

463
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,786
We can't live their lives for them.

464
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,791
This isn't right though. It just isn't.

465
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,627
It's not humane.

466
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,380
Kings in the past had dozens of wives.

467
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,674
I'm sure you understand him, man to man.

468
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,676
Not all humans think alike.

469
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,345
Not all men are like animals, you know.

470
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,974
I promised him

471
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,269
that I wouldn't blindly take
anyone's side.

472
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,313
The baby is also a living thing.

473
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,274
We can't get it killed.

474
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,068
We can't force Hye-ryung
to divorce him either.

475
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,487
Don't you think so?

476
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,409
He completely betrayed us, you know.

477
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,120
Hye-ryung too.

478
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,582
Right. Don't make any plans
for next weekend.

479
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,750
It's my girl's first birthday.

480
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,794
Really? Already?

481
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,797
They grow so fast.
Anyway, we're only inviting close friends.

482
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,550
-Does she recognize you?
-Of course.

483
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:23,055
So forget about not having kids
and get one of your own.

484
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,725
-Your world changes.
-Maybe I will.

485
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,189
THE LIA ORIENTAL CLINIC

486
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,067
I added in the best ingredients.

487
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,777
Thank you.

488
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,946
Am I really paying enough?

489
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,489
Just buy me dinner sometime.

490
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,159
Of course. When are you free?

491
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,706
This is as good as what we get at home.

492
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,626
I think the nutritionist takes extra care
on Mondays.

493
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,753
-Because of me?
-Yes.

494
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,843
It's a little bland,

495
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,137
but it's hospital food, so it's okay.

496
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,349
Ms. Kim said
she wants to try hospital food.

497
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,726
Hasn't she tried it?

498
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,895
No, for over ten years.

499
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,522
Then she can come have some tomorrow.

500
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,113
Don't you sometimes get lonely
being alone?

501
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,617
How am I alone?
I have you two, Pi-young, and--

502
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,410
You know what I mean.

503
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,537
I'm not sure.

504
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,499
I wouldn't have minded a younger sibling.

505
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,584
I wanted to give you one,

506
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,877
but Ms. Kim…

507
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,713
You're rubbing off on me.

508
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,591
Later on,

509
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,387
things could get messy
over the inheritance,

510
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,182
so she insisted that we focus
on giving you everything you need.

511
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,894
It's not an easy decision.
As a woman herself,

512
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,689
she would've wanted a child of her own.

513
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,983
It's not like she couldn't afford to.

514
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,904
-To us, she's--
-The best.

515
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,948
Time flies when we're having fun,

516
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:08,035
and we're getting old
whether we like it or not.

517
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:12,707
If I end up dying before she does,

518
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,294
I want you to take good care of her.

519
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,797
As if I'd allow you to leave so soon.

520
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,340
Enjoy your happiness longer.

521
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,012
I want to live until Ji-a gets married.

522
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,556
You can live way past that.

523
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:50,786
In a movie, a wife asks her husband

524
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,456
how long tomorrow will last.

525
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,374
The husband couldn't seem to answer,

526
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,044
so she said, "Eternity and a day."

527
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:02,506
"Eternity and a day."
To anyone who's listening,

528
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,384
how was your day so far?

529
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,721
Boo Hye-ryung's Love, Memories, and Music
begins now.

530
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,103
Which movie is it from?

531
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,940
Take a guess.
I'll treat you to a meal if you're right.

532
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,695
Is it Eternity and a Day?

533
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,782
-Yes.
-You need to treat him to a meal.

534
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,201
I will.

535
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,870
Sure, but I'll pay.

536
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:35,831
-Are we allowed to join you?
-Of course.

537
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,169
Hye-ryung, are you free for dinner?

538
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,129
Mr. Seo's buying.

539
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,132
Sorry. My schedule's full this week.

540
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,511
-Next week then.
-Don't you forget it.

541
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,308
I feel bad.
You're spending too much for us.

542
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,436
I'll split the bill with you
since this is like a team dinner.

543
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,815
He should split it with me.
I'm the one who first offered to buy.

544
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,275
There's no need to decide who should buy.

545
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,028
It doesn't really matter who pays.

546
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,864
I thought you preferred Korean food
like soup or stew.

547
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,117
-I don't like hot dishes.
-Really?

548
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,619
Yes. I usually let my soup cool
before I eat it.

549
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:16,414
Did your mother approve of that or not?

550
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,540
She let me be.

551
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,126
Why aren't you married?

552
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,836
I never said I wasn't.

553
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,587
Gosh. Then, are you married?

554
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,257
We all thought you're a bachelor.

555
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,093
Aren't we the same age?

556
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,762
-Are we?
-You're 50, aren't you?

557
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,305
Yes.

558
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,015
Did you just reveal a lady's age?

559
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,308
I'm not a gentleman.

560
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,228
That's not what I meant.

561
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,480
-Are you divorced then?
-No.

562
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,400
Many are curious
about confirmed bachelors,

563
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,026
but I'm just as curious

564
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,070
as to why people marry.

565
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,533
That's how God made us.

566
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,827
To mate with the opposite sex.

567
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,580
Are you happy to live
as we were designed to?

568
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,958
Yes, I'm happy.

569
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,669
Are you happy on your own?

570
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:07,465
They say there's no way to happiness.
Happiness is the way.

571
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,175
Enough with the quotes.

572
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:12,094
I want to know if you're really happy.

573
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,345
I have no idea.

574
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,307
I don't know what happiness is,
so I don't know what it is to be unhappy.

575
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,683
Then you're not unhappy.

576
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,518
So you think it's just a made-up word?

577
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,979
The word was coined by humans, wasn't it?

578
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,023
I just don't want it to sway me.

579
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,984
-Does it hurt your pride?
-Yes.

580
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,777
You must have a big ego then.

581
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,614
That is also a word
artificially coined by humans.

582
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:35,201
Did you aspire to become a writer,
not an engineer, when you were young?

583
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,803
Going down.

584
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,350
The doors are closing.

585
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,355
-It's simple.
-I see.

586
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,315
-And clean.
-Right.

587
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:09,193
This is what would describe it perfectly.

588
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,195
I'm suddenly craving cold noodles.

589
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:14,240
It's almost whispering, "buckwheat."

590
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,952
Let's go. It's not too late yet.

591
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,371
But we already had dinner.

592
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:23,582
So what if we did?
Having an extra bowl of cold noodles

593
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,000
is a breeze, as Ji-a says.

594
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:28,045
It'll be over nine
after I get changed and all.

595
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:31,340
Come to think of it, it's been a while
since we had cold noodles.

596
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,159
What the heck?

597
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,036
You're quite good.

598
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:06,750
-Go on. You have an audience now.
-Forget it.

599
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,419
Why not show Mom and Dad?

600
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:11,672
Would you like it
if anyone peeked at you dancing?

601
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,673
I would.

602
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,767
-You're home.
-Hey.

603
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,686
-Dad.
-Hey.

604
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,563
Mom's eating dinner with the team.

605
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,815
Right. U-ram, why are you still up?

606
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,901
He lost track of time while dancing.

607
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,445
I did not!

608
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:35,904
He's quite the dancer, Dad.

609
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,866
-Why don't you show me?
-Next time.

610
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,035
That's right.
Practice and do it perfectly.

611
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,077
Not for free though.

612
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,330
You're not a pro dancer.

613
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:47,041
Besides, you're too young
to be money hungry.

614
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,536
COURT

615
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,666
I'm on my way to court.

616
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,001
Okay. Bye.

617
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,839
He's headed to court, so we'll talk later.

618
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,843
We'll have lunch by ourselves.

619
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:47,393
This place is still so popular.

620
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,603
Please stay in the car
while I stand in line.

621
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,481
-There's no need.
-Waiting in line is half the fun.

622
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,197
Doesn't Ji-a love cold noodles, too?

623
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,200
That's right.
She's enjoyed it since she was young.

624
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,619
She knows how to enjoy it.

625
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:09,623
I can't believe how it's harder
for kids to make time these days.

626
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,126
There's a lot for them to learn.

627
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,753
Kids should have more fun outside.

628
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:17,423
Goodness.

629
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,134
Mun-ho!

630
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,640
-Are you here to eat cold noodles?
-That's right.

631
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,268
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

632
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,729
-The line seems long today.
-You can join us.

633
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:34,648
-Come on in.
-They're with us.

634
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:38,318
I guess we were bound to meet today,
here or at the golf club.

635
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,112
-Right, Mun-ho?
-That's right.

636
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,656
She calls him so sweetly.

637
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:46,618
I come here at least once
out of three times when I visit Seoul.

638
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,579
I see.

639
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:52,166
You two seem healthy enough,

640
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,377
but you can come to my hospital
if you feel sick.

641
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,130
I'll make sure you're well taken care of.

642
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,423
You should, Mun-ho.

643
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,677
You too, Ye-jeong.

644
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:08,140
We have all experts except neurologists,
orthopedists, and ENT doctors.

645
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:11,226
You're been having a rough time
with your menopause.

646
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,438
Not really. I'm just a little tired.

647
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,524
You break into a sweat so easily
these days.

648
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,694
As if you don't.
Everyone sweats when eating hot food.

649
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:23,822
You even wake up every now and again
while sleeping.

650
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,325
That's due to my pent-up anger!

651
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,702
Did he give you a hard time?

652
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:32,748
Of course not.
She's had a good life thanks to me.

653
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,166
Don't you agree?

654
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,126
He's pickier than he seems.

655
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,463
Dong-mi, does menopause pester you, too?

656
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,089
Mind your language.

657
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:45,260
-How impolite. What a snob.
-I haven't quite experienced it.

658
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,013
You must be taking estrogen then.

659
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,973
-I'm not.
-She's not.

660
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,059
She hasn't been taking any pills.

661
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,062
Her health care regimen is
better than mine, and I'm a doctor.

662
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,022
She helped me regain my health.

663
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,983
I used to be skinny, you see.

664
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:03,654
That's not true.
You were fashionably slender.

665
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,239
Then am I not desirable now?

666
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,992
Men should be your size
when they become old, you know.

667
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,245
You look just perfect.

668
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,580
She takes good care of me.

669
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:17,209
Her cooking is so great
that I can't help but stuff myself.

670
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,210
She doesn't eat it.

671
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,921
Rather than eating it myself,

672
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:24,341
I feel more satisfied
when watching him eat my food.

673
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,969
What a cheesy old couple.

674
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,142
JI-A'S HOMEROOM TEACHER

675
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,813
Hello, it's been a while.

676
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,024
This is from the manager.

677
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,652
-I see.
-Please extend our gratitude.

678
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:44,611
Yes, ma'am.

679
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,781
The owner must be a patient of his.

680
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,993
-He must have recognized him.
-Seems that way.

681
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,288
We should've ordered boiled pork too.

682
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,498
-It wasn't enough, was it?
-It was.

683
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,208
I'm trying to eat less.

684
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:02,212
We are going to karaoke.

685
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,047
Would you like to join us?

686
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:07,217
-Karaoke?
-We do it every now and then.

687
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,429
Singing helps you practice
abdominal breathing.

688
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,265
Well…

689
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,100
Why not?

690
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:19,396
We were wondering what to do
until our son gets off work anyway.

691
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:23,025
The emerald stream and green mountains

692
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:28,322
stay the same

693
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:32,492
But our lives

694
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:37,164
reshape day by day

695
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:42,794
It's still one world though

696
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:47,466
It's still our lives

697
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:52,262
Money, fame

698
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:58,518
And even love is now all meaningless

699
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,062
Goodness.

700
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,190
That was amazing.

701
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,277
Women

702
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,988
are scarier than you think.

703
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,449
They're not easy at all.

704
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,202
-She's after the money.
-Dad.

705
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:17,788
I'm a lawyer.

706
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,957
I have first-hand experience
of the weirdest cases

707
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,626
and went to the doctor with her.

708
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:27,673
Here's the sonogram.

709
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,758
Here. The dot.

710
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,305
Is it true?

711
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:37,391
It is.

712
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,030
There's no need to sigh.

713
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,826
I should be thrilled about it then?

714
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:59,037
If Hye-ryung chooses to,

715
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,580
she could ruin your life.

716
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,416
She's not the type you think she is.

717
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,584
-She's a decent person.
-And you?

718
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,087
These are the cards I've been dealt.

719
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,922
Even marrying Hye-ryung…

720
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:15,470
My university friend
studied fortune-telling

721
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:16,596
and became an expert.

722
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:21,685
He said I'd marry twice.
I brushed it off at the time.

723
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,312
But it turns out…

724
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,398
Here I am.

725
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:33,780
Dad, I need your help.
It's for your future grandchild.

726
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,659
What's she like?

727
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:40,078
-An angel.
-Is Hye-ryung a devil then?

728
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,583
How can an angel have an affair
with a married man and get pregnant?

729
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:49,129
You'll understand
once you hear the whole story later.

730
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,965
As if there is one.

731
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:54,342
Dad, you're a man too, aren't you?

732
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,178
You sound just like your mother.

733
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,472
Do men not have a conscience?

734
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,183
Also, stop addressing me informally.

735
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:05,479
What kind of grown son
speaks that way to his father?

736
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:07,230
I'm still your youngest.

737
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,026
I'm sure you're aware of this by now,

738
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:13,570
but Hye-ryung thinks
the world revolves around her.

739
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,322
Didn't you know?

740
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,532
Didn't you think it through
before you married an announcer?

741
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,993
She's like that every day though.

742
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:21,369
I have a limit too.

743
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,079
The marriage hasn't been that long.

744
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,958
Anyway, I'll persuade her
and resolve the issue this week.

745
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:32,506
So please don't do anything,
even if Hye-ryung goes after me. Okay?

746
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,549
I'm begging you.

747
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,676
Let's go before Hye-ryung comes home.

748
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,221
How can we possibly face her?

749
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:40,472
True.

750
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,935
ART SCHOOL
1-ON-1 CONSULTING

751
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,150
HUSBAND

752
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,694
Hello?

753
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,405
-I need to ask for forgiveness.
-For what?

754
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,158
Can you first promise not to get angry?

755
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,702
-What is it?
-Where are you?

756
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,622
At the art studio to pick Ji-a up.

757
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,290
Then I'll tell you later.

758
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,629
Sure.

759
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,053
What brings you here?

760
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,514
I'm here to have dinner with you.

761
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,851
I hope you like flowers.

762
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,895
Who hates flowers?

763
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:33,650
Should we eat out?

764
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:36,486
Or you can make me kimchi fried rice.

765
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,656
Have a seat.
I have kimchi and some fish to grill.

766
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:48,874
I got that photo taken
when I stopped by last week.

767
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,501
Didn't Pi-young tell you?

768
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,130
It looks nice up here.

769
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,425
How could you take your friends' money?

770
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,719
-Why not?
-You're not a singer.

771
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,262
You're just a student.

772
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,972
A pure and innocent one.

773
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:06,933
Being pure or innocent
has nothing to do with it.

774
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:10,145
A boy named Seong-jun heard me hum
and asked me to sing,

775
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,315
so I said, as a joke,
that I wouldn't for free.

776
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,483
He then offered me money.

777
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,944
Why would I turn it down?

778
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,487
But from six friends?

779
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,573
I gave it all back today.

780
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,993
Why are the moms meddling in our business?

781
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,703
I would too if someone robbed you.

782
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,705
I didn't force anyone.

783
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:31,791
I sang upon their request
and got paid for it.

784
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,209
Is that stealing?

785
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,586
In some ways,

786
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,296
your words sound right.

787
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,714
I am right.

788
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,967
I don't think I did anything wrong.

789
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:44,262
It took me a month, you know.

790
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,306
Memorizing English lyrics wasn't easy.

791
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,892
-Why did you memorize it?
-To sing it.

792
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,770
Because the song touches me.

793
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,230
Is that so?

794
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,275
I know it's upsetting, but…

795
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,485
I get it.

796
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,738
You spent your time and energy
to practice the song,

797
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,114
so you could've thought

798
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:05,575
that it was okay to take money
for singing it.

799
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,577
Singers get paid, don't they?

800
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:10,372
Because that's their job.
But you're only a student.

801
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:11,831
Singing isn't your occupation.

802
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,458
Occupation or not,

803
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:16,461
I was fairly paid for my hard work.

804
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,130
If I'm not a shoeshine girl,

805
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,217
why do you give me pocket money
for cleaning Dad's shoes?

806
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,470
Teachers get paid for teaching us.

807
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,514
What did I do wrong?

808
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:31,142
I didn't bully or hit anyone.

809
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:34,479
I never forced anyone to pay me
or steal the money.

810
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,315
Those who told on me
after willingly paying me

811
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:41,486
and the moms who told my teacher
are all the same.

812
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:43,738
Ji-a, my daughter.

813
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:47,534
Logically, everything you said is right.

814
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,452
Nothing's for free in this world,

815
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:53,164
so your friends weren't wrong
to pay you to sing,

816
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,709
and you aren't at fault for accepting it.

817
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,545
But your talent.

818
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:01,089
Your singing that your friends
wish to hear.

819
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:04,009
You could've performed without being paid.

820
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:06,636
That would make it more meaningful.

821
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,723
It's not like we're poor.

822
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,767
And we never taught you to be calculative.

823
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,186
Rather than earning some money,

824
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,356
I'd like my Ji-a to be someone
who can share

825
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,943
her love and friendship
out of the goodness of her heart.

826
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,988
That would make me a prouder parent.

827
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:30,160
It's not wrong to share what you have
in exchange for money.

828
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,038
However, if you sing for your friends

829
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:36,791
when they want to hear it
for nothing in return,

830
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,626
your friends will like you more.

831
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:42,130
And that would give you a better image.

832
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:46,217
Sharing what you have
without expecting anything in return

833
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:48,136
isn't something everyone can do.

834
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,890
Only those with a big heart can do it.

835
00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,898
I understand what you're saying.

836
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,901
It wasn't very generous of me.

837
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:04,319
I admit it.

838
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,660
Did you accept U-ram's money too?

839
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,542
Ji-a loves your gifts.

840
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,003
Really?

841
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,880
And people complimented me on this tie.

842
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,222
Don't you feel lonely at times?

843
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,183
Not really.

844
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,477
Why not date someone?

845
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,980
At this age?

846
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,398
You're still in your prime.

847
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:46,486
I know someone decent, you see.
Someone you'll get along with.

848
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,987
I'm good.

849
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,914
We'll be right back.

850
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:04,796
I'll

851
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,924
make you laugh tomorrow.

852
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,470
-How?
-What will I get in return?

853
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:15,431
I'm not sure. What should I do for you?

854
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:17,976
I'd like you to call me
in a different way.

855
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,436
Different how?

856
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,439
Call me by my name.

857
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,318
-Go ahead.
-Come on.

858
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,320
But you call him by his name.

859
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:32,574
It's because we grew up
in the same neighborhood.

860
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,117
Whatever.

861
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:37,537
I don't want to hear you
call me "Doctor" or "Director."

862
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,666
-Okay?
-Well…

863
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,794
Make me laugh tomorrow,
and I'll give it a try.

864
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,838
No tickling, though.

865
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,840
Why would I tickle you?

866
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,343
How about a practice run?

867
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,429
Stop it. The masseuses will be back soon.

868
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:56,139
They're not back yet.

869
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,434
Don't you want to?

870
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:03,855
Gi-rim.

871
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:12,447
Don't laugh. You'll get wrinkles.

872
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,658
Did you date your wife
before getting married?

873
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,368
Yes.

874
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:20,497
You must have made a lot of effort,
considering her beauty.

875
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,833
She liked me a lot too. We both did.

876
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,345
For Whom the Bell Tolls.

877
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,013
Know the movie?

878
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,390
Yes, I saw it twice.

879
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:42,810
While prescribing herbal medicine
that improves men's stamina,

880
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:47,023
I kept wondering who the concoction

881
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:48,441
is actually for.

882
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,860
Your mistress? Or your wife?

883
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,697
Which is the case for you?

884
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:05,124
If it's a mistress,
they have it delivered elsewhere.

885
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,418
They pick it up themselves like you

886
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:10,964
or have it delivered to their workplace.
Mostly, the latter.

887
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:17,095
How far have things gotten? Is it serious?

888
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,432
Does your wife still not know?

889
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:24,310
No.

890
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:28,982
Break up immediately
unless your wife did something wrong too.

891
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:31,985
As if it's that easy.

892
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,028
Easier said

893
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:37,657
than done.

894
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,867
Right.

895
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,663
How long has it been?

896
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,082
About a year now.

897
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,169
Is she single?

898
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,840
Does she want you to divorce your wife?

899
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,010
-They're both important.
-"Both"?

900
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:00,263
I can't live without either of them.

901
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,308
I married my wife
because I loved her so much,

902
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,268
so I know how you feel.

903
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,980
But you have your kids to consider.

904
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,358
That's why I'm in a dilemma.

905
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,777
I can't decide what to do.

906
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,284
Call me anytime
when you need someone to talk to.

907
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:22,910
Thanks.

908
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,872
I feel like I'm talking to Hae-gang.

909
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:30,209
I'm just as comfortable too
like I'm with an old friend.

910
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,795
So what did you do wrong?

911
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,006
Should I get on my knees?

912
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,425
Enough with the jokes.

913
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:39,969
I stopped by your mom's place

914
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,555
and had the dinner she cooked for me.

915
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:47,518
I offered to set her up with someone,
but she declined.

916
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:51,022
She seemed to be worried
about what you'd say.

917
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:54,692
Are you against the idea of her dating?

918
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,739
There's an outpatient of mine
who'd be a good match.

919
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:01,741
Let her make the choice.

920
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,345
Do you have plans for lunch?

921
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,722
Yes, but not for dinner.

922
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:28,226
-Let's meet at Napoli then.
-Got it. At what time?

923
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:30,228
-At 7 p.m.
-Got it.

924
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,689
-Book a table.
-Sure.

925
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,671
When will you make me laugh?

926
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,841
It's not time yet.

927
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,969
-Are we going somewhere?
-Yes.

928
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,930
But you don't need to dress up.

929
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,475
Don't you think the three of us click?

930
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,227
We sure do.

931
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:14,605
I don't have any friends in Korea,
so I've been lonely.

932
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:17,817
I'd love to get together
at least once a week.

933
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,737
We're unmarried freelancers, so why not?

934
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,781
-Until you need to be on stage, I mean.
-Sure thing.

935
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:27,368
It's just me in Korea too.
My entire family moved to Spain.

936
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,661
I see.

937
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:32,915
I haven't been there yet,
but I hear it's splendid.

938
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,959
It sure has a unique culture.

939
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:36,836
I've been to the Alhambra.

940
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,629
To Granada and Seville too.

941
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,382
The Alhambra is more beautiful at night.

942
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,134
It looks fantastic.

943
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,636
I'll be sure to visit it sometime.

944
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,264
We should go together.
I'd love to go back there.

945
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:50,391
Trips are better with a company.

946
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,486
-A movie?
-Yes.

947
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,531
The mobile ticket's on your phone, sir.

948
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,449
Got it.

949
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:21,214
-Here's your coffee. Please enjoy.
-Looks great.

950
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,007
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

951
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,263
We should get something to eat too.

952
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:35,436
What are we watching? Is it a fun one?

953
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:37,480
Yes.

954
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:41,734
I don't have to call you by your name
if I don't laugh, right?

955
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:43,820
So you'll hold it back?

956
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,200
I don't like dark and serious movies.

957
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:50,701
Me neither.

958
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:53,162
I'm not one to like
robots battling either.

959
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,999
But Marvel movies will grow on you.

960
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,125
Count me out.

961
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:07,260
Korea is a good country, indeed.

962
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:10,263
There's a defibrillator
practically everywhere.

963
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:11,472
Right.

964
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,308
Is that what we're watching?

965
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:16,227
Yes.

966
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:19,856
Your Spy is now open!

967
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:21,732
-That's us.
-Right.

968
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:11,282
I…

969
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,793
I'll let it slide

970
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:48,462
just this once. Bring her to me instead.

971
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:50,381
I need to see her in person.

972
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:52,925
Ji-a. Your maternal grandma's here.

973
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:57,555
I'll send over some medicine
for you to recover.

974
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:58,806
Don't you dare send it.

975
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:01,726
-Have you ever done it for me?
-Get it yourself.

976
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:06,856
-You startled me.
-I give up.

977
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:10,693
-Let's have a baby.
-She says he's not hungry.

978
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:12,486
-Eat it with Ji-a.
-What are you doing now?

979
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:15,156
I'm alone as well. Should I come over now?

980
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:18,993
He was going to die soon anyway.
I've done my best until now.

981
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:21,245
Lean on me from now on.

982
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:23,414
Though I'm not as good as Dad.

983
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:55,988
