EPISODE 16

2
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,326
What's so funny?

3
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,080
Your grandma came by
and said something funny.

4
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,414
What did she say?

5
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,917
It's a joke only grown-ups can understand.

6
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,963
Whether I can understand it or not
is for me to decide.

7
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,507
Right?

8
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,759
It's about someone she knows,

9
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,845
and it doesn't feel right
talking behind their backs.

10
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,513
It should stay with me.

11
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,764
Let's get married.

12
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,685
Marry me.

13
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,567
This isn't a joke.

14
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,155
At this moment, you're probably serious.

15
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,698
Just go.

16
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:45,039
Professor Park isn't the man for you
in more ways than one.

17
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,751
Is him not being right for me
the reason you want to get married?

18
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,129
-Of course not.
-He's someone I can talk to.

19
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,715
That's why I was drawn to him.

20
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,092
What you feel for him isn't love then.

21
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,635
What we had wasn't love either.

22
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,220
You know you're lying.

23
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,180
Don't deny the truth.

24
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,934
Is breaking up with someone
you love a pastime for you?

25
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,936
Emotions aren't that simple, you know.

26
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,646
It's all in the past now

27
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,065
-and I'm over it.
-Are you sure?

28
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,109
I don't want to argue with you.

29
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,071
It's not like it'll make a difference.

30
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,744
VOLUME

31
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,299
The phone is turned off.
Your call will be directed to…

32
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,908
Here you go, Mother.

33
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,458
Yu-sin, isn't the living room floor shiny?

34
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:14,045
I vacuumed the floor
and wiped it with a rag.

35
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,463
With a mop.

36
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,923
It's the same thing.

37
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,467
I did two batches of laundry

38
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,969
to wash all the cushion covers.

39
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,596
Back in the day, laundry was done by hand.

40
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,598
The machine does all the work anyway.

41
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,976
Unloading and hanging is a lot of work--

42
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,520
-Do you know how expensive--
-It can be washed.

43
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,481
Don't be too harsh on her.
Where's the housekeeper?

44
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,068
It's worth its price.
I'll have it dry-cleaned.

45
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,905
The housekeeper
hasn't been here for a while now.

46
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,366
She said we don't need one
since two women live here.

47
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:48,579
I used more elbow grease
when I vacuumed your room, Mother.

48
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,875
-Call the housekeeper.
-I'll take care of it.

49
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,336
Just focus on your work at the hospital.

50
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,840
I sleep like a baby
after doing household chores all day.

51
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,133
All day, my foot.

52
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,551
I wash dishes after breakfast

53
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,553
-and after lunch.
-The machine does the work.

54
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,471
Someone has to load it though.

55
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,975
After the machine is done,
the dishes must go back in the cupboard.

56
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,351
Then I do the laundry.

57
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:14,397
No matter how fast I work, cleaning
still takes me at least three hours.

58
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,317
I have to clean the bathroom,
fold the laundry,

59
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,777
-go grocery shopping, cook--
-I make the side dishes.

60
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,238
But I prepare all the ingredients

61
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,616
and the big pots
have to be washed by hand.

62
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,953
I had to wash these strawberries
under running water too.

63
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,041
Time has been flying by every day.

64
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,709
I may not even have time to read,

65
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,045
but I'm still happy.

66
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,464
Call the housekeeper.

67
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,051
We're doing a favor by hiring help.

68
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,012
-I'm already paying her.
-But you're not making her clean?

69
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,182
Why? To make me do the chores?

70
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:50,975
No, that's not it.

71
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,770
To teach me how to manage a house?

72
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,772
That's just wrong.

73
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,358
How can you pay someone
when they're not even working?

74
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,069
Have her back starting tomorrow.

75
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,112
I made barley tea

76
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,031
and porridge just in case.

77
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,908
I want to be alone.

78
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,661
My mom and dad…

79
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,165
I feel like they followed me back here.

80
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,835
I'm sure they're here.

81
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,800
All right.

82
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,386
Did you send them off okay?

83
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:45,530
The chairman said that breakfast
will be at Shimseong Hotel.

84
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,117
Got it.

85
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:54,205
Can you ask Gyeong-suk
to pack some meals for a picnic?

86
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,499
-Right now?
-Bring it to the firm by 11 a.m.

87
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,376
-Two portions.
-Sure.

88
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,962
I'll prepare the wine myself,
so it won't be necessary.

89
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,213
Sure thing.

90
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,558
Yes?

91
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,811
I'm not feeling so good.

92
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,232
Cunning bitch.

93
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,924
Sure, Dad.

94
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,012
-Mom.
-Yes?

95
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,931
Dad will be here soon to please us

96
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,516
and he wants breakfast.

97
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,853
His presence alone pleases us, doesn't it?

98
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,397
That must be him.

99
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,736
-Welcome, Dad.
-Thank you.

100
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,697
I smell the sweet scent of oil.

101
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,282
-You're here.
-Hey.

102
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,910
-Is this guacamole?
-Yes.

103
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,161
It's been a while.

104
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:19,207
-How will you please us?
-Later. Eating should come first.

105
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,793
Dad, you're always hilarious.

106
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,712
-Isn't he, Mom?
-Sure.

107
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,925
Mom, did you finally get it?

108
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,676
-Yes.
-What do you mean?

109
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,846
See how paper-thin this is?

110
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,015
-You could see through it.
-Tell me about it.

111
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,059
-What's the secret?
-Love.

112
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,062
No way. I'm sure there's a secret recipe.

113
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,021
I won't tell you.

114
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:45,483
I'm your daughter,
not your daughter-in-law, so tell me.

115
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,776
Maybe later.

116
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,278
You wouldn't be able to make it yet
even if you knew.

117
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,073
Gosh, this is delicious.

118
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:57,036
I prefer wheat pancakes over nacho chips.

119
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,788
-I agree.
-The texture's better too.

120
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,666
-Interested in a part-time job?
-Doing what?

121
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,042
I'll come for breakfast every day,

122
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,670
-but not for free.
-Deal!

123
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,463
You're not the one cooking.

124
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,383
But you'll get paid
for adding a set of cutlery.

125
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,927
-It'd be weird to decline.
-Exactly.

126
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,639
And we'd get to see Dad.
Dad, you truly have a big heart.

127
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,392
Although, it's probably
out of love for Mom.

128
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,768
Just your mom?

129
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,896
Let's be honest.
I know I'm second on your list.

130
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,731
There's no list when it comes to love.

131
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,777
So how will you please us?
Is it an allowance?

132
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,529
An allowance and then some.

133
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,615
Starting today, I'll drive you to school.

134
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,951
-Is it doable?
-I quit swimming in the morning.

135
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,245
-It's fine.
-You're far more of a priority.

136
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,372
Then do that
without coming in for breakfast.

137
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,125
You can serve me cold rice,
soy sauce, and salted shrimp.

138
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,127
Am I pleasing you or what?

139
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,211
I'm more than pleased.

140
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,008
-Mom, have you changed?
-What do you mean?

141
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,844
You usually give him a kiss
in these situations.

142
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,179
-On his cheek.
-Not when I'm eating.

143
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,639
Here.

144
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,669
Your wife's here.

145
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:33,007
You can drive Ji-a to school,
but don't come in for breakfast.

146
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,843
Does it make you uncomfortable?

147
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,762
When it's just breakfast?

148
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,723
Yes, it is. Very much so.

149
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,395
Just be grateful that you can
see Ji-a anytime you want.

150
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,606
They say greed leads to one's demise.

151
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,149
Aren't I already at rock-bottom?

152
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,400
What if I told Ji-a?

153
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,569
She won't even want to see you anymore.

154
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,738
Is that what you want?

155
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,533
I'm being as generous as I can be,
so don't test my patience.

156
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,539
Just because
he's the son of SF Electronics' CEO,

157
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,042
you're drawn to that
old man who's an engineer.

158
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,128
You're just as
materialistic as other women.

159
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,297
As a man, I'm far better.

160
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,386
Got it.

161
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,904
-Feels good, right?
-You have it better than me.

162
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,240
The chairman even bathes you himself.

163
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,583
Yes, Father.

164
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,920
Do you know those bubble baths
you see on TV?

165
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,214
I'm in the bathroom.
Do you perhaps have any?

166
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,716
-I do.
-Don't tell Sa-hyeon's mother,

167
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,552
and let me find it myself.

168
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,888
Did Sa-hyeon's father go out for a walk?

169
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,850
Isn't he in the bathroom?

170
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,017
Still?

171
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,186
Could he be sick?

172
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,024
-Lady So!
-He must be.

173
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,198
I knew that big breakfast
would cause trouble.

174
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,787
Aren't you sick?

175
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,707
Take off your clothes.

176
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,001
My clothes? Why?

177
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,752
Let me give you a bath.

178
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,670
Who?

179
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,800
-Me?
-Yes. Consider it a service.

180
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,801
Let me help.

181
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,762
What are you doing?

182
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,598
You were jealous of Dongmi.

183
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,642
Are you insane?

184
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,479
I made you a bubble bath, so get in there.

185
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,399
-Have you lost it?
-Yes, I have!

186
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,113
Song Yuan will laugh at us.

187
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,074
Why would she when we're a married couple?

188
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,326
Act your age, will you?

189
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,663
-I'll scratch you.
-Go ahead.

190
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,624
Give me five red lines, if you must.

191
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,170
Unbelievable.

192
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,297
Just think of it
as a memorable experience.

193
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,257
One that displays my love.

194
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,385
How's this for an experience?

195
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,221
Let me wash your hair.

196
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,098
-Stop--
-I'm sorry, but Boo Hye-ryung is here.

197
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,477
-Who's here?
-Hye-ryung.

198
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,189
-As if she's welcome here.
-Maybe we heard wrong.

199
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,236
Hello.

200
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,532
I know I'm the last person
you want to see,

201
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,076
but I couldn't shake off the guilt.

202
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,790
On the day of the press conference,

203
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,709
my emotions got the best of me.

204
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,047
It's been hard on Sa-hyeon, hasn't it?

205
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,634
It was difficult for us too
with all the phone calls.

206
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,135
I'm sorry, Mother.

207
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,806
Maybe I should talk to the press again

208
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,142
and tell them that
the divorce was amicable

209
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,937
and that nothing bad
should be said about it--

210
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,606
Forget it.
It's better not to be in the spotlight.

211
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,110
-It'll only do worse.
-I'm upset about this too.

212
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,571
I can only imagine how you're feeling.

213
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,664
Are you feeling all right?

214
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,709
Recent events
must have been stressful for you.

215
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,127
I'm fine.

216
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,091
Since her due date is this month,
I figured you'd be staying here.

217
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,636
If it were me, I would have been upset.

218
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,929
We were at first.

219
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,141
We're human after all.

220
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,476
Phones rang off the hook,
which startled us.

221
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,605
I'm sorry, Father, Mother.

222
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,566
Don't you have a show to be on?
You don't want puffy eyes.

223
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,152
It's a radio show, so no one will see me.

224
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:08,866
I cry a lot these days.
Just about anything makes me cry.

225
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:13,412
It's in the past now, so all we wish
is for you to meet someone better.

226
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,916
Someone who doesn't cause you trouble.

227
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,710
I've lost faith in men now.

228
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,006
People are all different, you know.

229
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:28,093
Sa-hyeon's young, so consider that
as the reason for his shortcomings

230
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,846
and let go of any bad feelings.

231
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,599
I already have for the sake of you two.

232
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,017
Have some tea.

233
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,063
Could you contact me
when you start having contractions?

234
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,691
-I'd like to be there.
-But you're busy.

235
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,234
To congratulate you.

236
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,571
Would that be okay?

237
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,075
Sure.

238
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,412
I don't have anyone in Korea, remember?

239
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,831
We may not be a family anymore,

240
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:02,294
but I truly meant what I said last time.

241
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,214
I'd like to see you from time to time.

242
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,424
Sure.

243
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,302
What's there to life…

244
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,554
without love, right?

245
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,392
Please invite me to your baby shower too.

246
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,936
When the child is being bathed?

247
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,271
People hold parties when babies are born.

248
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,482
-The 100th-day party?
-No, it's different.

249
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,860
Let me know if there's anything you need.

250
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,260
I know you're home.

251
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,687
-Hey.
-Please leave. I want to be alone.

252
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,605
I'll just drop the coffee off then.

253
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,566
You like the coffee Gyeong-suk makes.

254
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,110
-I'm fine.
-Open up.

255
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,502
You were crying.

256
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,852
I quit coffee for a while, you know.

257
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,525
So what will it be?

258
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,820
Would you rather
lean on me and sleep or go out?

259
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,364
-Leave.
-I'lI do the opposite.

260
00:17:55,949 --> 00:18:00,287
You did more than any sibling would
despite your busy schedule.

261
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,332
-Thank you.
-Just in words?

262
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,918
Express your gratitude.

263
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,337
I hate when it's just words.

264
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,632
Come on. Let's go out.

265
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,092
Why are you doing this?

266
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,011
Do you feel sorry for me now?

267
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,472
No. My feelings for you are back.

268
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:23,352
You'll soon move onto how you felt
when you broke up with me.

269
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,687
-I won't.
-I've moved on

270
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,190
and I'll be married soon.

271
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,525
But you haven't yet.

272
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,319
I don't have the energy to talk

273
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,530
and I'm not in the mood.

274
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,740
You will be after spending a day with me.

275
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,620
You can just leave as you are.

276
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,420
Put me down.

277
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,757
Are you insane? Put me down.

278
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,636
At least let me put on some shoes.

279
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,057
What if someone gets on?

280
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,271
-Pretend to be sick.
-You're out of your mind.

281
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,732
Do you think you can
treat me however you want?

282
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,068
-When you're in a good mood.
-Well, I'm not.

283
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,955
Basement floor one.

284
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,874
She must be sick.

285
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,876
Yes, a little.

286
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,420
-Did she pass out?
-Yes.

287
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:35,924
Goodness me. How did this happen?

288
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,301
She's anemic.

289
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,137
Eating well is the best cure then.

290
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,473
Raw liver does wonders, you know.

291
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:47,019
-I see.
-You have to be able to stomach it though.

292
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,729
She's not one of those people.

293
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,148
This is the first floor.

294
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:52,858
Thank you.

295
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,694
You're killing me.

296
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,738
They didn't see your face.

297
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:02,159
When did you get so light?
The key is in my left pocket.

298
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,050
Can I at least get my shoes?

299
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,642
-You always do what you want.
-But with reason though.

300
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,814
She was like
a completely different person.

301
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,441
Her face and gaze especially.

302
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,944
She only looks different
because of her makeup.

303
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:41,490
Come to think of it,
she no longer has soot on her eyes.

304
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,117
I can't believe her anymore.

305
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,912
Does she mean it or doesn't she?

306
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,041
Her tears seem like she's genuinely sorry.

307
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,793
Dogs are clever animals.

308
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,670
Especially our Dongmi.

309
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,339
-But she didn't greet Hye-ryung.
-I know.

310
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:01,051
When Song Yuan first visited,
she couldn't stop wagging her tail.

311
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:04,263
Dogs know whether they're loved or not.

312
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,389
That's right.

313
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,683
Hye-ryung never patted Dongmi

314
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,310
because she didn't want
to get covered in dog hair.

315
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,855
Are you really going to
invite her to your baby shower?

316
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,482
She wants me to.

317
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,651
I think it'll look weird.

318
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,446
Do you know my shoe size?

319
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,031
I remember all your measurements.

320
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,621
The phone is turned off.

321
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,375
Your call will be directed
to voicemail after the beep.

322
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,633
Do you have that in size 36?

323
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,032
Okay, go again.

324
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,501
Should I buy you a phone?
One for just us two.

325
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,236
-Do you know how to play hwatu?
-Go-stop?

326
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,863
-Yes.
-Of course.

327
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,741
I'm on my way to buy the cards.
Can you teach me?

328
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,289
They look good on you.

329
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,128
Don't I still have good taste?

330
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,321
Do you really think
I'm in the mood to drink wine?

331
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:29,032
-Besides, you have to drive.
-My secretary will pick me up.

332
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,035
Wine is offered even at mass.

333
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:37,040
Sometimes, you need a buffer
to remedy the pain and sorrow.

334
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,042
-It won't work.
-Still.

335
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,879
I'll pour two glasses.
Your parents enjoyed wine, right?

336
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,858
They left such a beautiful world.

337
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,821
No, not just the world.

338
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,574
They left you behind too.

339
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,036
I don't have many regrets,

340
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,331
but seeing your parents off

341
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,293
got me thinking.

342
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,170
I should have met them

343
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,047
when we went to Granada.

344
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,052
Not just as your boyfriend,

345
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,346
but as your husband-to-be.

346
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,602
It's not like you
to say what you don't mean.

347
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,022
-I mean it.
-Don't mess around with me.

348
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,318
I know Seo Dong-ma better than anyone.

349
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,862
You've had misutgaru before, right?

350
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,741
I only had it a few times
because it had a grainy texture.

351
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,660
But the grains

352
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,455
sink to the bottom after a while.

353
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,250
Those grains at the bottom?

354
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,046
To me, that's you.

355
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,092
-You are deep inside my heart.
-And you didn't notice?

356
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,636
I mistook those feelings for you

357
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,680
as a signal to end things.

358
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,974
You don't want to get
involved with me again

359
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,310
and I feel the same way.

360
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:23,730
Accept me as your husband.
I'll be by your side forever.

361
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,529
My recent trip to Spain

362
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:38,370
taught me that I'd never
be able to be free from you.

363
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:42,374
Once time passes, you'll realize
you were only being sentimental.

364
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:47,045
What you feel for me isn't love.

365
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:51,800
-You pity and feel bad for me--
-Yes, I feel bad for you.

366
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,427
I pity you too.

367
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,472
It's like my mom often says.

368
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,058
My heart aches for you.

369
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,229
But I don't want to
be with you out of pity

370
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:09,234
and pitying someone
is disrespectful in a way.

371
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,320
I just want to be with you.

372
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,865
I want to see you every day
and talk about the little things.

373
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,703
I gave in to my true feelings.

374
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,288
It must have hurt your pride.

375
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,289
I love you.

376
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:29,129
I won't ever ask you
if you love me though.

377
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,590
Because I can feel it.

378
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:35,844
True feelings,

379
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,139
whether it's hatred or affection,

380
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,350
are directly conveyed.

381
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,355
You never got over me, did you?

382
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,232
I haven't,

383
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,235
but I don't want this.

384
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,740
Someone I know well told me

385
00:26:56,823 --> 00:27:00,785
to only marry a man who I knew
I wasn't going to fall in love with.

386
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,162
A man told you that, right?

387
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:06,124
Anyway, I want to go home now.
Give me 50,000 won so I can take a cab.

388
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,128
-I'll tell him myself.
-As if you have the right.

389
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:13,131
I do, as the man who loves you
and your future husband.

390
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,299
You're so arrogant.

391
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,134
Hardly. This is me in love.

392
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,845
During our marriage,

393
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,848
I might be tempted by other women.

394
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,603
But I won't wreck our marriage,
so let it slide.

395
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,942
Gyeong-suk
took the time to make this for you,

396
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,778
so have a little to stay focused.

397
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:47,499
Whether dead or alive,
saying goodbye is a part of life.

398
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,668
I believe that those
who can accept it are the strongest.

399
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,588
Are you drawn to weak people?

400
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:01,763
I, the man who loves you,

401
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,016
is five years younger,

402
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:09,813
and am more fragile than I seem to let on.

403
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,442
I'll always show you my true self.

404
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,237
Even when I'm vulnerable.

405
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,452
You should share these among you.

406
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,705
-What's this?
-Hotel breakfast vouchers.

407
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,041
You're the one
who needs them for breakfast.

408
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:30,959
I have too many.

409
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,462
-Who gifts you with such valuable things?
-We all have our guardian angels.

410
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,172
-Thank you.
-Me too.

411
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,133
-I'll see you at seven tomorrow.
-Mr. Seo?

412
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:39,968
Sure.

413
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,181
Which hotel is it?

414
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,060
The Palio Hotel in Yeoksam-dong.

415
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,437
It's a six-star hotel.

416
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,066
I expected no less from him.

417
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,828
You're home early today.

418
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,371
What do you think?

419
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:12,083
She made a sincere apology
and it looked like she meant it.

420
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,503
-I don't want to see her again.
-Likewise.

421
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,798
She might not even mean it.
I can't tell anymore.

422
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,050
-It didn't seem that way.
-Whatever.

423
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,346
Hey, the monk came up with a name.

424
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:31,561
This for a girl and this for a boy.

425
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,814
-I like them.
-Song Yuan?

426
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,442
They're both beautiful and meaningful too.

427
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,488
Your credit card was delivered.

428
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,830
Mother, let's play hwatu.

429
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,333
I learned how to play with you.

430
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,126
As if I like stupid games like that.

431
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,712
They say it helps prevent dementia.

432
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,172
Worry more about yourself.

433
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,382
You've been quite forgetful lately.

434
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,636
You look for your phone
when it's in your hand.

435
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:08,014
When I opened the microwave
to heat up some water the other day,

436
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:12,060
I found some tenderloin
defrosted in the microwave.

437
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,436
A phone call distracted me.

438
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,480
People forget things.

439
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,940
Not as often as you though.

440
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,820
Even yesterday,
you called me over to say something

441
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,196
but completely drew a blank.

442
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,909
Did you perhaps forget about that too?

443
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:34,415
-Are you saying I have dementia?
-But it's the truth.

444
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:38,419
You sometimes take sea bream out
after saying you'll grill corvina.

445
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,339
-You know I never lie.
-Is that so?

446
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,843
Yu-sin, isn't hwatu
good for preventing dementia?

447
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,846
You should play.
She took the time to learn it for you.

448
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,808
Play it yourselves.

449
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,395
I'll write down a list of mountain names
for you to memorize

450
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,148
starting with those in Gyeonggi Province.

451
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,782
Why that little…

452
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,201
You're the one who poked the bear,

453
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,329
so get ready to have your head bit off.

454
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,920
Let's get pregnant
and welcome a baby next year.

455
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,298
You'll be 42 next year,
so let's not drag it out.

456
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,595
My mom says that praying actually works.

457
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,013
So go to a temple

458
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,681
and pray for your parents

459
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,560
to be born as your children.

460
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,855
Say that's how much

461
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,858
you want them back in your lives.

462
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,786
I saw that the lights were on,

463
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,664
but you weren't answering your phone.

464
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,291
Have you had dinner?

465
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,001
I had a late lunch.

466
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,338
Were you out?

467
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,049
Yes.

468
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,514
Mango or cherry?

469
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,475
Neither.

470
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,518
-How about some milk tea?
-I'm good.

471
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,278
The living must keep living.

472
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:32,533
I'm sure that's what
your parents want too.

473
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,828
I'd like to go out on a walk.

474
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,455
Really?

475
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,333
You should put something on.
The night air is chilly.

476
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,252
The sky's clear of fine dust.

477
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,047
Wasn't the weather great today?

478
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,766
I'm here for you, Ga-bin.

479
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:01,312
I'll forever be
the solid rock by your side.

480
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:07,485
A tree with a thick trunk doesn't sway
no matter how strong the wind blows.

481
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,782
Will your phone be off tomorrow too?

482
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,452
We should get you a phone just for us two.

483
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,337
Is it hard to walk?
Do you want me to carry you?

484
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,218
Please get back up.

485
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,054
But no one's around.

486
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,640
And who cares if anyone sees us.

487
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,685
I'm sorry.

488
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,275
About what?

489
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,278
I know how you must be feeling

490
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,364
and how difficult it is for you.

491
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,117
They say you can move on
when your parents pass away.

492
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,786
That's not always the case though

493
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,455
since it was hard for me too.

494
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,291
My mom and my dad…

495
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,543
While sending them off,

496
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,965
I realized that I should marry someone

497
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,718
I truly love.

498
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,471
What they had was true love

499
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,183
and they even died together.

500
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,520
I like you, Professor Park.

501
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,524
But…

502
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,862
I don't think it's love I feel.

503
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,117
I told you everything

504
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,704
as honestly as I could from the start.

505
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,584
But…

506
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,420
I can't marry you.

507
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,047
I just can't.

508
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,593
I'm sorry.

509
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,139
Don't you like me anymore?

510
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,228
That fan who came by
your green room to see you.

511
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,024
He's your ex, isn't he?

512
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,070
Yes.

513
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,577
Are you seeing him again?

514
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,329
He's not the reason.

515
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,419
I just want to marry someone
when my heart is filled with love.

516
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,589
This isn't that moment.

517
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:36,968
Please forgive me.

518
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,391
I know I'll regret it.

519
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,567
Please don't cry.

520
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,402
I'm pathetic, aren't I?

521
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,700
You're honest, not pathetic.

522
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,288
And it's better to be honest,
as cruel as it may be.

523
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,381
I didn't get you a gift.

524
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,967
As if I expected one.
So why did you go there?

525
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,261
I'm going to marry Ga-bin.

526
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:24,473
Mom and Dad won't approve though, right?
If you back me up that would be great.

527
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,225
-Did she agree?
-We're discussing it.

528
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,394
What about the man she's about to marry?

529
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,479
-She can dump him.
-As if it's that easy.

530
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:34,317
There's nothing that can't be done
if you put your mind to it.

531
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,068
This shouldn't be a passing thought.

532
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,154
You might hurt her again.

533
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,071
I won't.

534
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,365
-As if.
-That was before I wanted to marry her.

535
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,535
It's different this time.

536
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,713
Take good care of yourself.

537
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,843
Your heart will need time to heal,
but at least let your body rest.

538
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,307
I can't tell you not to mind me
and say I'd be all right.

539
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,643
To be honest,

540
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,520
it hurts.

541
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,649
However, it's something
I need to deal with myself

542
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,985
and my pain is probably
nowhere near yours.

543
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,491
If you change your mind…

544
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,331
That won't happen though, will it?

545
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,769
It was a joy being with you.

546
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,562
I'll cherish the memories.

547
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,609
I don't want to live with you.

548
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,902
You want a divorce?

549
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,943
PI-YOUNG

550
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:30,034
-Yes?
-My computer broke down.

551
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:34,455
I called the repair man,
but he couldn't come at this hour.

552
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,207
-I'll be there.
-I need to use it.

553
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,333
Sure.

554
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,766
You don't always get
what you want in life.

555
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,812
Mom was the only person
who catered to you at all times.

556
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,106
And there's no one like her.

557
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:03,150
Mom was your lottery ticket.

558
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,208
Does this actually work?

559
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,210
Yes, my friend guarantees it.

560
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,008
How do I look?

561
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,679
I can't just wear anything
when we're going to a hotel.

562
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:35,015
When you're young,
you look good in practically anything.

563
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,356
I brought my laptop just in case.

564
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,694
-Is Ji-a asleep?
-Yes.

565
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,781
-Yes?
-I didn't want you to meet Mr. Park.

566
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:54,326
I know his number,
so I was going to see him tomorrow.

567
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,537
I ended it a moment ago.

568
00:40:58,622 --> 00:40:59,707
Good.

569
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,918
This doesn't mean
we'll pick up where we left off.

570
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,421
I never said we should.

571
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,382
We should move on
in the direction of marriage.

572
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,636
One's feelings have no shape

573
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,055
which is why they can easily change.

574
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,517
Get some rest for now.

575
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,061
I'll leave you a text tomorrow.

576
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,190
All right?

577
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:39,872
Thanks.

578
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:44,168
I'm standing by 24-7,
so think of me as your errand boy.

579
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:49,548
Can I get a glass of water?
I'm thirsty from running over here.

580
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,258
Have a seat.

581
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,971
-Don't wake her.
-I won't.

582
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,806
-You'll give her a kiss.
-I won't.

583
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,266
I'm just going to take a peek.

584
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,617
I'm craving some ice-cold beer.
You don't have any, do you?

585
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,244
But you drove over here.

586
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,578
I'll call a driver.

587
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,372
When you live close by?

588
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,257
You don't even have
barley tea let alone beer.

589
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:45,145
I'm useful though, aren't I?
I will forever be that way.

590
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,772
Must you be so arrogant?

591
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:48,732
I'll stop.

592
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,947
If only there were stars tonight.

593
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,782
There are. We just can't see them.

594
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,167
Don't you still find me
comfortable to be with?

595
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,129
I am.

596
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,006
This is something I can settle for.

597
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,092
Seeing you every once in a while.

598
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,845
I'll be your plumber,

599
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,014
electrician, and computer guy.

600
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,017
You can call me for just about anything.

601
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:30,149
-Do you know what today is?
-It's not a special day.

602
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:38,782
I meant to give it to you this morning.

603
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:43,037
-What's it for?
-I'll take it back if you don't want it.

604
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:53,464
It's the day we went
on our first official date.

605
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,347
-You wore a flowy dress.
-That's a silly thing to remember.

606
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,473
It's not silly at all.

607
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:07,061
I guess the memory is etched in my heart.

608
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,316
Don't you want it?

609
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,318
It's only a gift.

610
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,736
Put it on me.

611
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,086
-It looks good on you.
-Thanks.

612
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,088
For gladly coming over.

613
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:37,257
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm grateful that you called.

614
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,594
I feel guilty for receiving
a gift without giving one.

615
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,097
You're the receiver and I'm the giver.

616
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:44,890
That's how it'll be.

617
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,350
You'll be in the red then.

618
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,560
Love isn't a business transaction.

619
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,358
I know myself,
and my feelings won't change.

620
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,113
This may sound like an excuse to you,

621
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,448
but it's like

622
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:06,078
I got drunk and tripped myself over.

623
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,916
But you're drinking again.

624
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,836
A glass of beer hardly counts as drinking.

625
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:19,925
Do you like it?

626
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,386
I'm grateful.

627
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:26,140
Could we get together
once in a while for a meal like this?

628
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,064
Who's texting you at this hour?

629
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:37,526
Si-eun wants me to join her
for breakfast at a hotel tomorrow.

630
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,570
Professor Park must still pay the bills.

631
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,615
Mr. Seo gave us vouchers. Ten each.

632
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,165
There she is.

633
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,006
I texted her to pick you up.

634
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,299
Hi.

635
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:01,967
Hey.

636
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,636
I'll get going,
so finish up here if you want.

637
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,056
-I'll drive you home.
-I live just around the corner.

638
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:43,091
Did Nam Ga-bin give birth?

639
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,678
Is it a girl or a boy?

640
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,771
NAM GA-BIN

641
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,233
-Hello?
-It's me, Nam Ga-bin.

642
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,486
I'm at your apartment complex.

643
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:05,739
I looked up your address before
to send a gift during the holidays.

644
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:12,454
-You're at my apartment complex?
-Yes.

645
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,666
Why? Are you with Hae-ryun?

646
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:18,377
No, I'm alone.
Will he be all right though?

647
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,174
What if something happens to him?

648
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,133
Is something wrong?

649
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,593
I have a bad feeling.

650
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,304
Are you really outside Building 1703?

651
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,389
Yes, should I come up?

652
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:34,142
No, just hang up for now.
I'll be right down.

653
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,138
I'm being punished.

654
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,604
My mom and dad

655
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,648
died because of me.

656
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,693
Because I sinned.

657
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,237
I caused your divorce.

658
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,531
This is karma.

659
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,743
So what now?

660
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:38,081
-You should get back in your car.
-Please forgive me.

661
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,375
Hasn't Professor Park called?

662
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:43,962
Please call him.

663
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:58,226
I heard about your parents.

664
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,854
I'm being punished, aren't I?

665
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,692
Did you perhaps take any pills?

666
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,569
Mom and Dad…

667
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,697
I miss them so much.

668
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,576
But…

669
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,623
I can no longer see them.

670
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:25,128
I had their remains rest in a temple.

671
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,172
Could you go there with me sometime?

672
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,758
I'll ask for forgiveness

673
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:31,927
in Buddha's presence.

674
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,512
When did you last see Hae-ryun?

675
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,562
I'm sorry.

676
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,023
I know what I did was wrong.

677
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,904
But this whole situation…

678
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:56,910
I don't know.

679
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:59,246
How did things get this way?

680
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,960
What I do know

681
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,465
is that this all started
because of what I did.

682
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:14,720
Please forgive me.

683
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,416
Why did I turn out like this?

684
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:49,463
This isn't how my mother raised me.

685
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,428
Mom!

686
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,725
Get the car key.

687
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:07,981
Because of their immoral daughter,

688
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:11,651
my parents were taken from this world.

689
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,531
God took them.

690
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,410
It's all my fault.

691
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,584
I finally get it now.

692
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,796
Mom…

693
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:32,756
Help me with her.

694
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,773
What if something happens
to Professor Park?

695
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,400
I'll be sinning once again.

696
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,027
What is this about?

697
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,196
We broke up.

698
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:02,118
I told him that I didn't love him.

699
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,291
Is there a way
to turn the clock back a year?

700
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,795
If I could, I wouldn't do what I did.

701
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,806
I only thought of myself

702
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,182
and my pains.

703
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,437
Please call him.

704
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:32,107
Check where he is. I'm losing my mind.

705
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:49,624
The phone is turned off.

706
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,544
Your call will be directed to voicemail
after the beep.

707
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,052
This is his house, right?

708
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:04,180
Put these on.

709
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,560
How can I move on with my life?

710
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,646
I don't think I can.

711
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:18,278
I miss my mom.

712
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,031
Dad…

713
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,578
I'm so sorry.

714
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:32,500
Please forgive me. I'm sorry.

715
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:35,128
I'm so sorry.

716
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:55,440
-There you go.
-Good job.

717
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,651
You did great.

718
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,988
-Goodness.
-Good job.

719
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,908
You did well. Great job.

720
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:16,544
Okay, here we go. One, two, three.

721
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:20,632
All right. One, two, three.

722
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,842
Could you look into the camera?

723
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,344
Here we go again.

724
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,721
One, two, three.

725
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,861
Wake up, husband.

726
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,154
Can you sit down for a second?

727
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:48,618
Once Bada is born
and if you're feeling up to it,

728
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,413
let's have
a simple wedding at the hospital.

729
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,665
It'll be meaningful.

730
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:56,626
Just me, you, Bada, and my parents.

731
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:57,669
Let's ask them first.

732
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:00,338
Why bother when
it's our decision? They'd love it.

733
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,967
The birth has to go smoothly then.

734
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,677
I'm sure it will.

735
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,389
My parents pray every day and so do I.

736
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,599
So how about it?

737
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,059
I think it'll be meaningful.

738
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,936
Exactly.

739
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,063
I'll prepare everything
including your dress.

740
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:22,068
And the official wedding will take place
in the fall after careful planning.

741
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,196
Would you have the time
when you're busy day and night?

742
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,908
You can do anything
if you have the time to eat and sleep.

743
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,182
You're here.

744
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:57,228
Mr. Seo won't know what hit him.
You look exceptional today.

745
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,649
I could say the same for you, Ms. Sa.

746
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,570
I couldn't wear anything to a hotel.

747
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,489
The food here is really amazing.

748
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,741
It's almost therapeutic.

749
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,577
Let this feeling keep you on your feet.

750
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:15,288
He says to hang in there.

751
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:17,749
Let's all cheer up.

752
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,834
Maybe I should get all teary-eyed myself.

753
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,419
That would fluster me.

754
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,965
If I cry my eyes out?
Because you'll have to treat me to meals?

755
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,634
I could treat you every day.

756
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,094
-Do you mean that?
-Yes.

757
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:32,972
How will you manage
if you spend all your salary on us?

758
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,265
I'll spend less on myself.

759
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,392
He doesn't need much being a single man.

760
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:39,521
I bet you haven't thought about
what it's like to be poor.

761
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,566
That's not something he knows about.

762
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,569
-Do you?
-Not really.

763
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,115
-And you, Ms. Boo?
-I guess it's inconvenient.

764
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,700
Why not answer your own question?

765
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:57,413
I was reminded of a poem
that I had read recently

766
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:59,624
while I was having this food.

767
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:00,667
What kind of poem?

768
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:08,550
Emptiness, on nights I call your name.

769
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:14,305
One day, you settle quietly
like a deserted island

770
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:21,479
and a cellophane-like stillness
gets caught in my mouth.

771
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:28,528
The wailing of the night
buried under low eaves.

772
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:35,452
In the morning
when green leaves lift their heads,

773
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:40,874
Emptiness, you come to me straight

774
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,919
in the form of freshly cleansed sunlight.

775
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,798
The bored window

776
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:53,428
pulls and pushes the clouds all day.

777
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:56,014
And I, who's even more bored,

778
00:57:57,056 --> 00:58:00,268
pull and release
the clouds by their horns.

779
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:05,732
And between the lines of my poem

780
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,943
spreading like ink

781
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,739
you come to me, Emptiness.

782
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,329
My gosh.

783
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:21,748
What's it called?

784
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,628
Take a guess.
Like you did with the movie before.

785
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,549
"Emptiness"?

786
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,551
Yes.

787
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,845
I was just about to say that.

788
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:43,228
The poet wanted to portray
"unstained poverty."

789
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,730
Can you text it to me? It was nice.

790
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:46,856
Me too.

791
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,735
Isn't he good?

792
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,071
She's having contractions!

793
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:55,490
Contractions?

794
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,991
But you still have a week left.

795
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,497
What else do you enjoy apart from golfing?

796
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,332
Listening to music.

797
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:07,293
When I'm feeling down, I play the drums.

798
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,753
-The drums?
-Yes.

799
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,213
She's quite good.

800
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:13,007
-You should show him today.
-Maybe I should.

801
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,052
We'll all go together.

802
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:21,599
-I have to get back to Ji-a.
-U-ram's home alone too.

803
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,851
-Can I play baseball with U-ram sometime?
-Sure.

804
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,520
Can you let Ji-a join and watch?

805
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,522
Sure.

806
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,899
We'll go when the others are available.

807
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:31,526
Sure.

808
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,454
-You look great!
-Such a handsome groom.

809
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,748
-You look dashing!
-Nice!

810
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,001
-You look great.
-How handsome!

811
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:57,010
-Congratulations.
-Can the bride say a few words?

812
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,387
-My gosh.
-Gosh, are you all right?

813
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,450
You can put it back down at the venue.

814
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:58,339
The bride and groom will enter together.

815

Here comes the bride and groom.

816
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:10,787
OPEN DOOR

817
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,915
Did you forget the lock combination?
It's still the same.

818
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,337
That's not very ladylike.

819
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:20,713
Son, let's go golfing.

820
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,466
-Get ready.
-Ji-a.

821
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,593
Are you mimicking your grandpa?

822
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:30,306
Goodness. Ji-a, you're here.

823
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:38,981
Kim Dong-mi!

824
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:48,241
You're the reason I…

825
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,785
You're the reason I…

826
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:53,746
Ji-a!

827
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:21,023
