1
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,630
Then here it goes.

2
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,923
EPISODE 6

3
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,550
I'd like to marry

4
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,971
the woman in front of me.
That's you, Ms. Sa.

5
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,142
What was that again?

6
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,311
I want to marry you, Ms. Sa.

7
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,440
Stop joking around.

8
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:08,026
A sane person wouldn't make
this kind of a joke.

9
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,321
I'm telling you the truth.

10
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,118
-But why?
-You have a certain fire within you.

11
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,079
-I do?
-Yes.

12
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,955
But what did I do?

13
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:22,999
What fire?

14
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,751
You stood out

15
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,295
when we first met at the golf club.

16
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:31,382
It's not easy
to be so open about being divorced.

17
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,717
Especially if it was recent.

18
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,968
That's why?

19
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,236
EASY BABY FORMULA

20
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,632
Last Saturday,

21
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,426
weren't you
at Sinhangang Dermatology Clinic?

22
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,555
-Yes.
-And you got cryotherapy.

23
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:24,394
I'm not entirely sure,
but I think that's the one.

24
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,066
A woman was screaming
in the treatment room.

25
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,693
What treatment did she get?

26
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,528
Oh, her? It was cryotherapy.

27
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,572
-Is it that painful?
-Of course.

28
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,783
I imagined what it would be like,
and it seemed pretty painful.

29
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,327
Why were you there?

30
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,954
-To get a corn removed.
-I see.

31
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,498
I got a laser treatment,
and it was completely removed.

32
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,462
Anyway, when I heard you screaming,

33
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,799
it felt indescribably electrifying.

34
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,887
To be honest, it sounded pleasurable.

35
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,139
It's hard to describe.

36
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,934
Then you broke into tears.

37
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,646
I'm embarrassed.

38
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,773
-You heard that?
-Yes.

39
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,526
No woman has ever felt
that endearing to me.

40
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,156
I wanted to embrace you,
but I stopped myself.

41
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:23,536
If I hadn't been called back to work,

42
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,706
I would have treated you
to dinner like today.

43
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,417
Look.

44
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,254
You seem like a very spontaneous man.

45
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,507
I'm actually the opposite.
All my ex-girlfriends complained the most

46
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,301
about how rational I was.

47
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,011
I'm not easily swayed.

48
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,681
But I was swayed by you.

49
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,142
In a way I couldn't handle.

50
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,105
You want me to believe that?

51
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,108
Yes. I'll prove it to you from now on.

52
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,695
Look.

53
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,490
You could be momentarily infatuated.

54
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,159
Crazy things happen in life all the time.

55
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,413
Feelings are fickle.
They can't always be constant.

56
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,250
For you, they can be.

57
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,086
I only called you
because I was sure of it.

58
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,839
WHAT IS HIS DEAL?

59
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,383
I can't call this love.

60
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,469
It's an indescribable feeling.

61
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,473
Anyway, you sucked me in
like a black hole.

62
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,851
I can't say the same.

63
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,788
Here's an amuse-bouche.

64
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,624
-You can eat it with your hands.
-Okay.

65
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,960
Eat up. You said you were hungry.

66
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,059
So you're going to Germany tomorrow.

67
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,730
Safe travels. You'll regain
your composure when you return.

68
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,691
What if I don't?
What if it's the opposite?

69
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,944
Do you know yourself well?

70
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,529
I do.

71
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:26,743
Objectively speaking, I understand
that this is out of the blue.

72
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,747
Please give it some thought
until I return from Munich.

73
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,332
You can do that much, right?

74
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,669
I don't think I'll be able
to stop myself from thinking about this.

75
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:41,049
You can't help but think about things
that happened unexpectedly.

76
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,342
But put yourself in my shoes.

77
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:48,431
"Oh, is that so? I'm suddenly starting
to develop feelings for you as well."

78
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,766
"Let's get married."

79
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,435
Would you say that?

80
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,811
Depends on who it is.

81
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:58,316
If we click, then why not?

82
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,401
It's not like one of us is married.

83
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,612
I believe I'm older than you.

84
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,615
-How old are you?
-I'll be 36 next year.

85
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,033
I'm five years older.

86
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,827
I was married before
and even have a child.

87
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,956
She'll be in sixth grade soon,
and I want her to be proud of me.

88
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,500
I may be five years younger,

89
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,461
but I've probably read
more books than you have.

90
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,047
What does this
have to do with reading books?

91
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,632
Feelings are like clouds.

92
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,885
Big puffy clouds can turn into wisps.

93
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,680
And clouds as big as a field can disperse.

94
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,224
The same goes for feelings.

95
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,852
My feelings could change
during my time abroad,

96
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,729
but I doubt it.

97
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,316
Being single forever
doesn't make you a terrific mom.

98
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:44,779
Will marrying me make you
a bad mother who deserves criticism?

99
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,908
I'll be honest with you.

100
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,703
Unlike my brother,
I've had many girlfriends.

101
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,998
I also broke up
with my fiancÃ©e because of you.

102
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,418
No way. How could you?

103
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,420
Because I know myself the best.

104
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,214
Don't justify your actions like that.

105
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,801
-You should have taken responsibility.
-Then why do people get a divorce?

106
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,970
Why do they break up?

107
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,682
She'll meet someone
better than me since she's kindhearted.

108
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,143
-Does that make you feel better?
-But I wasn't attracted to kindness.

109
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,937
Then what am I?
A narcissistic and sly woman?

110
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,023
Your charms have nothing to do
with being good or evil.

111
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,194
But I guess for some people,
being kind could be a charm.

112
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,362
It is for women.

113
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,990
Mr. Seo has a heart.

114
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,701
What's that based on?

115
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,871
The number of women he's been with?

116
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,125
Because he can understand others.

117
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,918
I hope you could do the same for me.

118
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,086
Then what about me?

119
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,715
Please don't judge me for what you see
without getting to know me first.

120
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,175
Please hold that thought.

121
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,469
I'm not saying that I'm perfect.

122
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,304
I have flaws

123
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,139
but many more merits.

124
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,060
I believe having the ability
to make your partner happy

125
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,313
is a must in a marriage.

126
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,356
What do you think?

127
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,233
I had a perfect marriage.

128
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,235
I was happy while it lasted.

129
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,906
My ex-husband was devoted to his family.

130
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,950
Then he cheated on me behind my back.

131
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:14,952
That's why I left him.

132
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:15,953
Good.

133
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,039
Trust is the most important.

134
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,708
Keeping that trust is also
an important ability.

135
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,296
I told myself never to get into
another fickle relationship.

136
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,508
I have zero expectations
and interest in men.

137
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:32,595
We don't expect our partners
to change when we're in love.

138
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,307
You may think they'll eventually change
and break that trust.

139
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,934
But that might not happen.

140
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,812
You'll only know if it's a thorny path
or a beautiful forest trail

141
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,356
by taking it yourself.

142
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,858
The same goes for life.

143
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,320
Are you refusing to go down a path
just because it might be thorny?

144
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,074
-What was your major?
-Business.

145
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,452
Do I seem like a player?

146
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,039
People are like icebergs.

147
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,335
There are many small icebergs,
and what you see is what you get.

148
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,963
But like the phrase,
"the tip of the iceberg,"

149
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,633
there are some you can only
fully understand with time.

150
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,387
Please grant me your time.

151
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,712
I've never felt

152
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,717
such wistful and strong emotions before.

153
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,178
And this is my first time
using the word "wistful".

154
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,888
Have you ever dated a divorcÃ©e before?

155
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,600
Have you ever dated someone
younger than you?

156
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,063
Being in the same room
with you alone makes me happy.

157
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,523
It's even touching.

158
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,858
I'm surprised

159
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,651
by these emotions.

160
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,362
That also means
you don't see me as a woman.

161
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,865
I'm like a cozy sister,

162
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:20,036
-since you never had one.
-I envied my friends who had sisters.

163
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,080
But that's definitely not why I like you.

164
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,000
I met Ban for the first time
when I was just a kid.

165
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,629
But we only started keeping in touch
after I went to university.

166
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,464
I love him more than he loves me.

167
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,550
It takes five texts or calls from me

168
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,261
to receive one reply from him.

169
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,513
And that's still the case.

170
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:44,810
I don't resent him
since I understand him the best.

171
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,897
Honestly, I feel guilty.

172
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,108
Because our parents gave me
all the love and not him.

173
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,238
I was showered with love,

174
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,450
so I have more than enough to spare.

175
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,910
And he was my first choice.

176
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,496
Everything that I have,

177
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,082
both material and emotionalâ¦

178
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,002
I feel like I can freely share it all
with you, which is a first for me.

179
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,756
I'm sorry to say this,

180
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,342
but you scare me.

181
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,344
How so? In what ways?

182
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,096
Your persistence.

183
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,141
-It's too much for me.
-I chose to be straightforward.

184
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,811
Just think of it in a good way.

185
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,231
It just means I like you that much.

186
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,609
I'd like us to continue to see
and get to know each other.

187
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,947
We can be acquaintances or friends.

188
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,449
I don't want that. That's a waste of time.

189
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,284
I know you're my soulmate.

190
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,037
Well, that's a pity
because that's all I can offer.

191
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,332
You think it's a waste of time?

192
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,711
You're being selfish.
You're not considerate or understanding.

193
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,256
-Do you not trust people?
-I already told you.

194
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,259
My ex-husband whom I trusted the most
painfully betrayed me.

195
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,802
-Does it still hurt?
-No.

196
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,262
Humans can adapt to anything.

197
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,931
I agree. And you'll eventually
get what I mean.

198
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,559
Or it could be the other way around.

199
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,769
They say reason will always prevail.

200
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,814
Ask anyone. You're--

201
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,941
-Not in my right mind?
-Confused.

202
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,401
It would have shown if that was the case.

203
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,653
-We need time.
-For you?

204
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,654
No, for you.

205
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,407
Time will fix everything.

206
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,536
So this also means
that you're granting me a chance and time.

207
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,290
You just said, "Eventually."

208
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,667
That means we'll be spending
some time together.

209
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,256
How about you put yourself in my shoes?

210
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,925
This woman stood out to me
when we first met.

211
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,304
And I ran into her once again
at a dermatology clinic.

212
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:48,476
Her screams completely shook
my body and heart.

213
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,354
It was so intense

214
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,400
that I desperately wanted
to get married to her and start a family.

215
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,110
Am I that unique and unbelievable?

216
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,237
That's not the point here.

217
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,031
The feeling isn't mutual.

218
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,365
If I were you,

219
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,242
Ms. Saâ¦

220
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,411
I'd go along with it.

221
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:13,751
"What kind of a person
would like me this much?"

222
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:17,338
I'd be excited to find out
how well he'd treat me.

223
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,715
What's there to lose?

224
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,426
This isn't something to be criticized for.

225
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,636
It's marriage.

226
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,517
Are you afraid?

227
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,605
Are you worried
I'll taint your reputation?

228
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,149
Don't worry about that.

229
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,320
Only those of low caliber
weigh their options.

230
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,574
Look into my eyes.

231
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,619
Come on.

232
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,791
The eyes are the window to the soul.

233
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,419
Even your eyes are clear and shining.

234
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,383
I promise I won't betray or lie to you.

235
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,470
We may get tired of each other
or we may not.

236
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,638
Think positively.

237
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,431
If you're pessimistic,

238
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,309
you can't do anything
and nothing will happen to you.

239
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,228
You'll have a boring life.

240
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,565
Put your trust in me,

241
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,025
and say yes.

242
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,280
Should we reheat it?

243
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,182
I won't look if you're uneasy.

244
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,810
But I can't help it.

245
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,897
It's like how women
can't help but look at flowers.

246
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,276
You know too much about women.

247
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,155
I'm sure you know a lot about men
since you were married to one before.

248
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,824
We're seeing eye to eye.

249
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,494
Does a child and a teenager
see eye to eye?

250
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,498
It may be possible
if the latter plays along,

251
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,791
but it won't last long.

252
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,805
Marriage and dating are different, right?

253
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,142
Dating is like something sweet.

254
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,728
For example, it's like dessert.

255
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,316
And marriage is like rice, soup,
kimchi, and vegetables. A standard meal.

256
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,737
But at times, you get to feast
on bulgogi and braised short ribs.

257
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,866
Men prefer that kind of meal to dessert.

258
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,495
We get sick of dessert.

259
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,664
We crave a simple meal.

260
00:15:56,747 --> 00:16:00,000
Food from Gyeonggi Province
is light and clean.

261
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,545
But in Honam,
it's salty and strong-flavored.

262
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,465
Once you have
enough of the food you can find in Seoul.

263
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,301
you'll be curious and crave other things.

264
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,302
What about women?

265
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,515
The intensity may differ,
but many women are voracious too.

266
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,905
I know you don't have an appetite,
but try to eat.

267
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,533
You need to start going to work again.

268
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,202
She's right.

269
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,746
You need to move on.

270
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,915
Think about your baby.

271
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,376
You should be healthy
and live a long life for him.

272
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,293
Please eat.

273
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,802
-Is Hye-ryung not coming?
-She was just drunk and didn't mean it.

274
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,679
I doubt she even remembers.

275
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,142
If she comes, don't ignore her.

276
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,727
Is that her?

277
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,521
Have it with the bisque.

278
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,815
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

279
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,411
It's not bad, right?

280
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,456
It's delicious.

281
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,503
The road is filled with cars
on their way home.

282
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:39,058
They say marriage
is about looking in the same direction.

283
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,685
I think that's true.

284
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:45,064
That only pertains to healthy marriages.

285
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,066
This is nice.

286
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,071
What are you thinking?

287
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,324
I want to chat all night long.

288
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,367
About our childhoods,

289
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,162
happy memories, and struggles.

290
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,455
I want to know everything.

291
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,541
Feel free to ask me anything.

292
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,502
Do you have many stories to tell?

293
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,046
I'm not sure what you exactly mean.

294
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,965
But my love stories were just so-so,

295
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,426
and I've had a simple life until now.

296
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,012
But I've had many ups and downs with work.

297
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,097
And you, Ms. Sa?

298
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,432
You don't like me calling you that, right?

299
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,600
I'm used to it.

300
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,311
Let's be casual.
We're not business partners.

301
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,438
I don't want you
to address me formally either.

302
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,525
What's your ideal type of man?

303
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,194
It changed.

304
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,863
Most of all, he needs to be trustworthy.

305
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,949
You're not that honest.

306
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,493
You're not going to date

307
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,955
some mediocre guy
just because of his unfaltering kindness.

308
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,042
Like I said, no one's perfect.

309
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,711
Do you know your flaws?

310
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,296
I told my daughter this once.

311
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,091
I can't forgive easily.

312
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:59,221
Deep down, I want to forgive
my ex-husband and move on.

313
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,931
But it's not easy.

314
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,809
I should never wrong you then.

315
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,229
But it doesn't mean
I took revenge or cursed him.

316
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,730
Let's get to know each other.

317
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,608
But not for too long,
and with marriage in mind.

318
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,987
I've given it some thought,
but this is ludicrous.

319
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,113
It depends on how you take it.

320
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,573
Let me say this again.

321
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,285
One's flaw may be perceived
as merit to someone else.

322
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,620
And when two merits clash,
they become flaws.

323
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,248
Your scream wasn't that intense,

324
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,126
but I always disliked
and felt irritated when people screamed.

325
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,711
But your scream

326
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,630
sent shivers down my spine.

327
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,090
How could that be?

328
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,596
Every time I think about it,
my heart races.

329
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,182
I can't put my finger on it.

330
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,809
That's not something I have
to take responsibility for.

331
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,894
You're right.

332
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,855
But I believe
some people are destined to meet.

333
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,523
"Who is she to me

334
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,860
for me to feel this way about her?"

335
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,070
I concluded after thinking long and hard.

336
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,117
Some relationships happen
when the feeling is mutual.

337
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,161
But there are others that begin

338
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,121
after one side reaches out to the other.

339
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,332
The latter happens more often.

340
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,792
Do I sound illogical, Pi-young?

341
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,962
You're a bit impudent
although not flat-out rude.

342
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,590
You shouldn't call me by name.

343
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,425
Saying that won't change my feelings.

344
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,178
And I know
you're doing this intentionally.

345
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,055
I like it, even if you're
really nagging me.

346
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,682
Pi-young, if Iâ¦

347
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,269
Ms. Sa.

348
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,606
You'd pass out
if I pulled down my pants and peed.

349
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,066
But if you were a parent,

350
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,945
you wouldn't be appalled
by your child doing that.

351
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,988
Rather, you'd be happy and proud.

352
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,575
You don't have to remind me
that I'm five years younger.

353
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,577
But you seem younger than me.

354
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,996
I don't know why though.

355
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,584
That's why I addressed you
casually without realization.

356
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,253
I didn't mean to be rude.

357
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,215
You're adorable.

358
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,468
I want to hug and pat you on the back.

359
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,053
And comfort you when you're mad.

360
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,140
But, at the same time,
how are you still sexy?

361
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,103
I don't know what's wrong with me.

362
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,316
Now that I've opened up to you,

363
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,902
I'm even more confident.

364
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,948
The person

365
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,243
I'll spend the rest of my life with

366
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,954
is definitely you.

367
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:34,876
-Do my feelings not matter to you?
-I'm only explaining because they do.

368
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,337
For me to be happy,
you need to be happy as well.

369
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,757
And you can't be happy if I'm miserable.

370
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,106
Something came up, so mom will be late.

371
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,399
Should we eat without her?

372
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,326
Do you have anyone you're worried about?

373
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,080
You've probably guessed it,
but it's my brother for me.

374
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,919
After I became more mature,

375
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,214
I wondered why he rarely smiled.

376
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,760
It was because of my mother.
There was nothing I could do.

377
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,847
It didn't seem like that was the case.

378
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,809
But I did feel that he had
a bit of resentment toward his father.

379
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,227
It's both of them.

380
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,855
Marriage unites two people after all.

381
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,986
Until not too long ago,
it was my mother for me.

382
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,822
She passed away.

383
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,827
There's nothing I can do now.

384
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,538
But I hurt her a lot.

385
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:58,585
Ban, me, and you.

386
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,880
Everyone is hurt in life.

387
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:05,092
You didn't hurt your brother.
You just feel sorry for him.

388
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,385
You weren't the cause.

389
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,553
Recentlyâ¦

390
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:12,766
he told me that
I inherited my father's flaws.

391
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,142
And I'm aware of that too.

392
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,603
I thought you wanted to meet me
because of your brother.

393
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,146
-About Si-eun.
-Do you know her?

394
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,399
She's the writer of our show.

395
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,526
I didn't know that.

396
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,236
I refuse to talk about them.

397
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,531
How will I look him in the eye?

398
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,783
-Imagine what he'll say.
-What would he say?

399
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,827
-He's not the type to.
-But he scolded you before.

400
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,079
-Are you and her on bad terms?
-Si-eun?

401
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,164
-No.
-Then it's fine.

402
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,792
-It works out.
-It's ridiculous.

403
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,586
We've been colleagues.

404
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,464
She's also like a big sister to me.

405
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:48,093
-And now, we're dating brothers?
-Is that wrong?

406
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:53,557
Some sisters marry brothers.
They share the same in-laws.

407
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,100
That's not normal.

408
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,560
We only met once at the golf course.

409
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,478
This is ridiculous.

410
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,355
-We met twice.
-It's once for me.

411
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:03,984
Normality and rules are all man-made.

412
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,070
We should each live our lives
the way we want.

413
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:10,740
Also, don't we make a good-looking couple?

414
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,617
Let's take a photo.

415
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,078
What about my daughter?

416
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,956
What would she think?
She doesn't even know I'm divorced.

417
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,542
And I'm sure your parents
don't know this as well.

418
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,918
There's an order to things.

419
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,379
But they won't affect any of this.

420
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,381
I should make my own decisions.

421
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,675
Do all couples live happily ever after

422
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,719
if they receive their parents' blessings?

423
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,179
The conditions don't matter.

424
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,889
Neither does duration.

425
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,934
I'm sure you married
according to what was normal.

426
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,145
We are all different just like our faces.

427
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:44,107
Your ex-husband
and I look different, don't we?

428
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,990
Give me your hand.

429
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,409
Come on.

430
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,643
Am I the only oneâ¦

431
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,355
who feels this way?

432
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,737
Are you offended and creeped out?

433
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,834
Close your eyes.

434
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,630
I won't do anything rude.

435
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,383
Close them and listen to my voice.

436
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,272
Throughout the day,

437
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:09,025
when I'm in bed or in my car,

438
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,237
your painful cry

439
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,615
pierces through my heart and my head.

440
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,577
"It's not normal."

441
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,206
"I don't trust men anymore."

442
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,793
Should I just accept that and give up?

443
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,006
That's just an obstacle I need to face,
something I need to go through.

444
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,426
I knew it wouldn't be a cakewalk.

445
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:39,139
Despite that, I still drove
to your workplace and called you.

446
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,864
These are seared scallops.

447
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,325
Do you not like the food?

448
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,745
-We do.
-We were busy chatting.

449
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,706
Should we serve
the rest of the dishes slowly?

450
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,623
Yes, please.

451
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,929
-Seat 7.
-Seat 7.

452
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:23,808
I'm so excited.

453
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:35,987
I bet you were a great daughter.

454
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,782
I only pretended to be in front of others.

455
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,700
I'm sure you had your reasons.

456
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,791
Do you think
your mother would have liked me?

457
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,127
She wouldn't have been delighted.

458
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,718
When was the toughest time of your life?

459
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,429
I don't want to talk about that today.

460
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,223
We can talk about whatever you want.

461
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,894
Everyone has their ideal type
when it comes to looks.

462
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,646
Am I anything close?

463
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,190
Not at all.

464
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,984
In what ways?

465
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,780
-I'm not sure.
-That's the right answer.

466
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:24,494
Let's meet often, eat good food,
and chat until you do.

467
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,162
I'll give in.

468
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,373
I'll be a gentleman.

469
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,499
Are you a good son?

470
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,921
For now, yes.

471
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,175
You lived up
to your parents' expectations.

472
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,552
I didn't rebel much.

473
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,556
I heard kids give their parents
a hard time at least once.

474
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,307
Don't feel too bad for your mother.

475
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,059
Think that you were just being her child.

476
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,770
Whether there's an afterlife or not,

477
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,273
I wouldn't want my kid
to blame herself when I die.

478
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,733
That's easier said than done.

479
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,610
How about we role-play?

480
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,238
I've never done it before.

481
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,991
Imagine that I'm your mother
and say whatever you want.

482
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,285
I saw it on TV,
and it seemed pretty effective.

483
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,458
What's your daughter's name?

484
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,254
-Ji-a.
-Does she take after you?

485
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,716
-Yes.
-She must be smart.

486
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,884
How do I look?

487
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,263
You look cold and level-headed.

488
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,723
I'm not that level-headed.

489
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,183
You'd be surprised.

490
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,020
Have you been to France before?

491
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,272
I have.

492
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,149
How about Aix-en-Provence?

493
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,650
-I have.
-Wasn't it nice?

494
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,943
The scenery there

495
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,071
was beautiful beyond compare.

496
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,698
Let's go there for our honeymoon.

497
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,913
Yes. It's all about marriage for me.

498
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,624
I want to hear about your breakups.

499
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,459
Which one was your most painful one?

500
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,048
I don't have one.

501
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:05,428
I tend to forget the past and move on
unless it's something important.

502
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,679
Such as?

503
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:10,016
I believe family
is more important than work.

504
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,352
And a girlfriend isn't family.

505
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,521
She's just someone I'm dating.

506
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,856
How busy are you normally?

507
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,943
Oftentimesâ¦

508
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:23,238
I live as if a day has 36 hours.

509
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,073
Skipping meals is normal for me.

510
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,035
If I'm not meeting anyone,
I often just eat a panini.

511
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,789
But tonight,
I'm having a relaxing dinner with you.

512
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm not flattering myself.

513
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,504
I'm saying that this is a meaningful
and precious time for me.

514
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,882
I'm curious about Ji-a.

515
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,055
How old were you when you had her? 28?

516
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,015
Yes.

517
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:55,186
You're open to having a second child
even if you're past 40, right?

518
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:01,651
I want you of all people
to have our child.

519
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,444
Ji-a's sibling.

520
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,037
-I should leave.
-Then I'll leave too.

521
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,540
But why so suddenly?

522
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,335
-We're still eating. This looks bad.
-This isn't a debate.

523
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,088
Anyway, my answer is no.

524
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,340
Can't you see how sincere I am?

525
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,970
I know you don't dislike me.

526
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,807
-I can see that.
-Because you're Mr. Seo's brother.

527
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,603
Let's call it a night.

528
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,693
I'm going to leave soon.

529
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,445
Can I stop by?

530
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,740
-You must feel troubled.
-Yes.

531
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,533
-Did you have dinner?
-No.

532
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,452
Come. There's a tasty udon place.

533
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:56,456
I'd like to see the woman I cherish
while I still can.

534
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,750
Don't say such things.
You'll live a long life.

535
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,460
Sang-cheol passed away suddenly.

536
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,170
Nothing troubled you much in life,

537
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,880
and you've kept your body healthy.

538
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,173
I've gone through a lot.

539
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,799
I didn't know as a kid.

540
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,801
But now, I know.

541
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:14,641
I can see that you want children.
You should've gotten married early.

542
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,476
I couldn't because of Ban.

543
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,019
I'm kidding.

544
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:21,189
Men can have kids even when they're old.

545
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,652
I was destined
to meet my soulmate later in life.

546
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,530
Do you have a hobby?

547
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,449
Not going to work is my hobby.

548
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:35,495
Just being home in itself relieves stress.

549
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,621
That's great.

550
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,749
I saw an old drama on TV.

551
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:43,252
The male character proposed saying,
"I promise to put food on the table."

552
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:46,881
You'll eat good food and wear nice clothes
until the day you die.

553
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,633
Enjoy your life from now on.

554
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,134
I'll be the sole breadwinner.

555
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,428
I have some money
that my mother left for me.

556
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,056
I'm not working to make ends meet.

557
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,600
-Then you're working to better yourself?
-That too.

558
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,978
Life is too short to be a housewife.

559
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,147
I loved being greeted
by my mother when I came home.

560
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:04,565
Do you think

561
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,860
Ji-a is happy that her mom
comes home late due to work?

562
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,696
If I'm only a stay-at-home mom,

563
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:13,116
what happens after she meets a nice man
and leaves me?

564
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,243
I know she wants me
to stay home as of now.

565
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,286
But I'll eventually become a burden.

566
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:21,499
She won't be able
to get married and move out

567
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,917
if her mom isn't independent.

568
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,045
Kids nowadays often move out
even if they don't marry.

569
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:29,090
It's not too late to find something to do
after your kids grow up.

570
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,009
There are various hobbies

571
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,386
and things to learn and enjoy nowadays.

572
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,346
What else do you like other than golfing?

573
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,224
I don't really enjoy playing golf.
It's more for business.

574
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,935
Ban and I used to enjoy motorcycling.

575
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:46,232
I heard there's a motorcycle salesman
who says this whenever he makes a sale.

576
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,609
"And so another widow is made."

577
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,611
We can't control when we die.

578
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,030
Car crashes happen all the time.

579
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,991
I haven't ridden one in a while.

580
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:58,077
One time, it started raining
on our way back from Cheongpyeong.

581
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,164
It was the start of the winter like now,
so it was freezing.

582
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,166
It was pretty windy too.

583
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,127
-Don't bikers wear leather jackets?
-Yes.

584
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,504
Do you know what I did?

585
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:12,341
I bought a huge garbage bag
at the convenience store.

586
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,762
I ripped the bottom
just enough to fit my helmet in

587
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,388
and wore it.

588
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,516
-Did your brother do the same?
-Yes.

589
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,046
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

590
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:51,839
Didn't people stare?

591
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,799
They laughed at us.

592
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,968
Some women don't like oysters.

593
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,554
You know everything about women.

594
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,972
It's better than being ignorant.

595
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,322
Let me do it for you.

596
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:19,200
-It's okay.
-Let me. You need to squeeze hard.

597
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,569
I haven't had oysters this year.

598
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,572
They're fresh.
Seafood should be eaten somewhere nice.

599
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,699
I doubt you rebelled much during puberty.

600
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,492
Are you complimenting my personality?

601
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,911
I was slightly a clean freak.

602
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,581
I didn't want
our housekeeper to enter my room.

603
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,166
I didn't want her to be nosy.

604
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,335
-Why didn't you lock your door?
-Mom had a spare key. It was useless.

605
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:15,298
So I put raunchy photos
all over the walls,

606
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,632
and she couldn't enter.

607
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,218
You're mischievous.
How did you clean your room then?

608
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,388
I used a lint roller for my bedsheets
and mopped the floor.

609
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,015
Dust is everywhere anyway.

610
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,517
Do all boys grow up
looking at raunchy photos?

611
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,643
Yes.

612
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:31,772
It'll be strange if you're not
interested in things like that.

613
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,191
What about you?

614
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,402
I'm sure you are
since you've been married.

615
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,530
A university friend of mine
was a heavy drinker.

616
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:43,576
Getting married didn't change anything,
so his wife was sick of it.

617
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,120
He got drunk easier as he aged.

618
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,875
We drank together once,
and I had no choice but to drop him off.

619
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,419
I called his wife, and she came.

620
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:56,088
She flung open the car door
and glared at him.

621
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,340
That's when he said,

622
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:02,011
"You look like my wife."

623
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:06,682
Feeling irritated, she grabbed him
by the collar and pulled him out.

624
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,602
Then he said, "Oh, you are my wife."

625
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:12,206
SECURITY CALLING

626
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,297
What books do you read business-wise?

627
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,339
I'm not picky.

628
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,050
-Have you read The Analects?
-I stopped midway.

629
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,011
It mentions what a wise man should do.

630
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,179
But replace that with "CEO",

631
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:30,182
and the book becomes Leadership 101.

632
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,060
Do you believe
in blood types and personalities?

633
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,603
I think they're somewhat correct.

634
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,106
-What's yours?
-A kind type B.

635
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,944
Those who are truly kind
don't need to tell others.

636
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,195
Can I guess yours?

637
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,697
Type O.

638
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,115
You're right.

639
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,617
Some people respond to questions
with another question.

640
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,579
When I asked you
if you believed in blood types,

641
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,622
you said yes and asked about mine.

642
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,291
Many type Os are like that.

643
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,418
You're rather perceptive.

644
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,795
Type Os are considerate toward type Bs.

645
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,965
We're considerate toward all blood types.

646
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,551
-Even with other type Os?
-Of course.

647
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,720
Don't you think we click?

648
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,350
Women who are type Bâ¦

649
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,686
Once, I went on a trip with two girls
who were type B and A.

650
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,814
I had my own room, and they shared one.

651
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,442
Type A sat on the toilet andâ¦

652
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,030
Can I really tell this story?

653
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,615
Why not? Let's hear it.

654
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,618
She sat on the toilet
and saw that there was no toilet paper.

655
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,537
So she said,
"Yeon-hui, there's no toilet paper."

656
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,999
That's what she said. Then type B said,

657
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,334
"Really?"

658
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,170
That was it.

659
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,173
That's what type Bs are like.

660
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,884
I'm not like that. I'm not that dull.

661
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,177
So what did she do?

662
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,512
Type As are so timid.

663
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:54,141
We would have said,
"Can you give me more toilet paper?"

664
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:58,020
But since her friend just said, "Really,"

665
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,855
she couldn't ask for any.

666
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,274
I told them they were the same.

667
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:06,237
She should have offered her toilet paper
since there wasn't any.

668
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,407
-Don't you agree?
-I do.

669
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,535
She just thought type A
would ask for some if she needed it.

670
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,163
I correctly guess what someone's
blood type is 80 percent of the time.

671
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:20,209
-Isn't your brother either type A or AB?
-Yes. He's type A.

672
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,585
So is Si-eun.

673
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:25,589
They will be careful
and considerate toward each other.

674
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,841
Is she a good person?

675
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:30,302
Of course. Your brother isn't the type
to give his heart to just anyone.

676
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,138
You'd be captivated by her singing.

677
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,682
Me? I meanâ¦ Me, ma'am?

678
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,350
We can talk casually.

679
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,603
I thought she was a professional singer.

680
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,897
Could that be why he fell for her?

681
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,190
That's not why.

682
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,193
We found out about them
last night during his farewell party.

683
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,529
Let me tell you in advance.
I'm a terrible singer.

684
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,989
That makes two of us.

685
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:53,200
What are your thoughts
on moving in before marriage?

686
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,413
-I don't mind what others do.
-So you don't like it.

687
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,831
That's not what I said.

688
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:02,293
Since I've dated enough women
and had my share of fun,

689
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:03,878
I can be devoted now.

690
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,714
Did you say, "I love you,"
to all of your girlfriends?

691
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,549
-Only twice.
-And to your parents?

692
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,843
I think I used to when I was young.

693
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,012
I did.

694
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,097
I couldn't tell my mother
that I loved her.

695
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:18,142
Maybe I did as a kid, but I don't recall.

696
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,685
But not as an adult.

697
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:25,983
Is there a moment in your past
that you want to go back to if you could?

698
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:31,614
I want to turn back time
even if it's just one year.

699
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:37,119
Then I'd tell my mom how much I love her.

700
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:44,001
Treat your parents well
if you don't want to regret it.

701
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,838
And take someone home
that you know they would like.

702
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,633
-Be a good son.
-I'd be an awful son

703
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,719
if I married the woman they liked
then got a divorce.

704
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,473
They say women have a sixth sense.

705
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,725
I may be a man,
but I have a sixth sense too.

706
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,979
You and I will eventually get married.

707
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,067
I just don't get it.

708
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,612
What did you tell your fiancÃ©e
when you ended it with her?

709
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,155
I told her the truth.

710
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,032
She asked if I fell for someone else.

711
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,784
I told her I fell for your voice.

712
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,745
You're terrible. And then?

713
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:20,996
She hit me a few times.

714
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,208
I'll be punished for it if there is a god.

715
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,876
Would you be okay

716
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,922
if your family member suffered
because of something you did?

717
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:37,137
Just like how
I've always moved on from my past,

718
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:42,226
I hope you won't judge me
based on my past mistakes and flaws.

719
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,978
I'm aware of them myself.

720
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,939
Like how everyone has an excuse,
I have my weaknesses too.

721
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:50,192
Didn't you just say that
you liked it even if I nagged you?

722
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,735
It depends on the subject.

723
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,279
I'm human too.

724
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:57,157
I may act tough, but I'm soft too.
Let's talk about good things only.

725
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,035
What should I get you from Germany?

726
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:12,464
Don't I scrub you better than Mom does?

727
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,175
Yes. You're much stronger than her.

728
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,220
Gosh, that feels nice.

729
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,060
Who'll scrub Dad's back?

730
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,520
He can buy a loofah.

731
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,981
They offer scrubbing services
at the sauna as well.

732
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:31,191
He can't go there in his current state.

733
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:37,323
Why not? Those who had a stroke
also go out, you know?

734
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,662
What kinds of food do you dislike?

735
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,164
Dishes such as yeongyangtang.

736
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,499
Can you eat it?

737
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,085
No. I'm a picky eater.

738
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,339
I bet you're picky with everything,
not just food.

739
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:54,840
Find out for yourself.

740
00:43:55,883 --> 00:44:00,429
Your brother said he craved
his mother's wheat pancakes at times.

741
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,558
He never told me that.

742
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,643
He just mentioned it.

743
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:09,563
Wouldn't it be nice to be in-laws
with that writer he's dating?

744
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,232
I'm pretty strong-willed.

745
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,276
I'll treat Ji-a well.

746
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,361
I can be a good dad.

747
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,781
The age gap between you and Ji-a isâ¦

748
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,241
only 23 years.

749
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,535
Many become a dad at the age of 20.

750
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,038
I'd be a young dad. It'd be nice.

751
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:29,166
-But not a biological one.
-Why does that matter so much?

752
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,669
What about those who adopt children?

753
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,588
Some parents are cold enough
to abandon their own kids.

754
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:38,217
Not all biological parents are wonderful,
and not all stepdads are horrible.

755
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,595
-Jeez, you're rationally eloquent.
-I'm not eloquent.

756
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,930
I'm just stating the facts.

757
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,022
Have some of mine.

758
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:06,286
I'm not interested in other women anymore.

759
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,206
How much can you drink?

760
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:13,085
Call a chauffeur. I can take a cab.

761
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:14,753
I'll get your car fixed.

762
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:16,713
I'll get Ban to do it.

763
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,591
He'll pick it up tomorrow.

764
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:20,676
CONTACTS
BAN

765
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,597
-I'll tell him about us today.
-He'll scold you.

766
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,932
He won't be against it.

767
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:29,518
After all, he wants to marry Ms. Lee.

768
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,937
He might even congratulate us.

769
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:37,401
This isn't some fleeting emotion
or infatuation.

770
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,154
I'll wait for you
no matter how long it takes.

771
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,364
I'm going to do my best.

772
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,325
Will that be enough
to show you how sincere I am?

773
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,414
Listenâ¦

774
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,584
-What is it?
-Never mind.

775
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:54,960
Tell me.

776
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,011
If I couldâ¦

777
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:05,971
If you could?

778
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,306
Never mind.

779
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,351
I'll tell you if you tell me first.

780
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,944
-Let me ruin your fantasy.
-It's not a fantasy. But how?

781
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,779
-You first.
-Promise you won't hit me.

782
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,364
I don't mind if you do,

783
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,534
but this is our first meal
and I don't want that to be our start.

784
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,038
I don't want us to part ways like this.

785
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,916
Like I said before,
I want to spend all night chatting.

786
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,667
What about your business trip tomorrow?

787
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,669
I can still catch my flight.

788
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,005
Communication is when we open our hearts.

789
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:43,008
Doing that will help you
understand how I feel.

790
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,178
Or how I feel.

791
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,972
Should we give it a try?
I'm not trying to debate.

792
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,735
-Do you have a bucket list?
-No.

793
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,153
How do you want to grow old?

794
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:06,949
I want to be healthy
and look distinguished as I age.

795
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:10,118
No one wants to be weak
and hideous when they're old.

796
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,704
It depends on the effort you put in.

797
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:15,290
Many can't follow through
even though they want to.

798
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,709
Your future wife should be on her toes.

799
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,921
Two of my friends have gotten a divorce.

800
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,715
-Seeing eye to eye is important.
-Or one needs to yield all the time.

801
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,593
Don't resent your ex-husband too much.

802
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,763
Men can cheat if they didn't have
many past relationships.

803
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:31,557
-I've accepted it.
-Accept me too.

804
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:35,561
Like how you were able to accept
how you've been hurt.

805
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,646
Give me a chance.

806
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,901
I will never hurt you.

807
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,487
Love endures all things.

808
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:46,905
Give yourself a chance to love me.

809
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,169
-How are you?
-I'm glad you came.

810
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,087
Have you been well?

811
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,298
-Of course. I missed you.
-You're so much prettier.

812
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,841
Do you still remember?

813
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,389
Does drinking coffee
interfere with your sleep?

814
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,225
-No. How about you?
-Yes, if I have a lot.

815
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:16,893
You should've had tea.

816
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,478
I said I didn't want to sleep.

817
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:22,774
Neither of us is a good singer.

818
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,526
How about we go dancing?

819
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,321
Or how about

820
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,657
I book a room
since this place closes at 10 p.m.?

821
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:36,413
I should just drop you off
and head to my brother's.

822
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,916
When was the last time
you and Ji-a went to an amusement park?

823
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,335
It's been a while.

824
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,964
Let's go today. She'll love it.

825
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,760
I want to see you two having fun.

826
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:52,763
I won't talk. I'll just follow you
instead of meeting my brother.

827
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,181
Are you serious?

828
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,893
Yes. We can't part ways like this.
I'll be away for an entire month.

829
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,227
Don't you think I'll be tired?

830
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:02,022
Is spending time
with your pretty daughter tiring?

831
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,608
She'll think I'm weird.

832
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,652
I doubt it. She'll love it.

833
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,951
Will you really tell
your brother everything if I don't go?

834
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,119
Yes.

835
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,205
Why are you in a rush?

836
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,874
He'll be so dumbfounded.

837
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,756
I'm stopping myself from hugging you.

838
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,220
Sixth floor.

839
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:46,650
I'll be waiting there.

840
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,402
Text me when you arrive.

841
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,357
-When are you coming?
-I'm on my way.

842
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,776
-Did you eat?
-Yes.

843
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,654
I suddenly want to go
to an amusement park with you.

844
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,740
I doubt you mean today.

845
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,074
-Today.
-Really?

846
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,617
-Yes.
-I'll get ready.

847
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,744
Okay.

848
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:57,137
The phone is turned off.
Your call will be directed to voicemail.

849
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,808
Just your luck, Dad.

850
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:05,645
The male lead was amazing.

851
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:09,024
I loved the movie.

852
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,276
I love this music too.

853
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,236
Pack some clothes in the van.

854
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,155
Something comfortable.

855
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,161
This way, Mother.

856
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:28,376
You're dressed so young
that people will think you're my aunt.

857
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,754
You should go to work like that.

858
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,385
We're buying the tickets now.

859
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:20,262
Grandma wore hanbok here before.

860
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,431
Coming here today with me

861
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,100
will also be a memory.

862
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,268
A lovely one.

863
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,147
-Will you ride something?
-Yes.

864
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,732
I'm too scared to get on one.

865
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:33,984
It's not that scary.

866
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:37,529
I used to cry when I got shots as a kid,
and you used to say,

867
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,781
"It'll just sting."

868
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,117
And you were right.
It just stung a little.

869
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:46,288
I saw many photos of you
on these rides in our family album.

870
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,706
I was young and fearless.

871
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,249
You're still young.

872
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,751
Let's ride that.

873
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:57,424
Yu-sin.

874
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:00,385
You didn't get changed?

875
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:01,469
I'll shower first.

876
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,230
I enjoyed the movie,

877
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:14,941
but I couldn't help thinking about Father.

878
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,527
After what happened last time.

879
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:20,363
-Shouldn't you look into it?
-But how?

880
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,325
I heard psychiatrists can do hypnotherapy.

881
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,621
And tell my mother I'll hypnotize her
since I suspect her?

882
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:31,166
-In a roundabout way.
-She'll know it's because of Ji-a.

883
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:34,377
You are your father's son
and Ji-a's father.

884
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,630
-She's not your real mom.
-You don't know our past.

885
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,131
She raised me with love.

886
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:40,050
I can't betray her.

887
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,885
How is this betraying her?

888
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:44,763
We just want to find out
what exactly happened.

889
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:47,807
Don't you feel uneasy?
This keeps bothering me.

890
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,894
Not at all.
You and Pi-young get along so well.

891
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,938
Is suspecting her all you can do?

892
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,315
Would you do that if you were in my shoes?

893
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:59,903
Ji-a isn't my daughter,
and I've never met your father before.

894
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:03,281
Are you really unfazed
by Ji-a's behavior when she was possessed?

895
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,491
He wants us to move on.

896
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:05,909
That's what she says.

897
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:11,665
You and Pi-young should live together.
You can be best friends.

898
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,001
You must love your mother more than us.

899
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,046
I guess you'll always love
your first love.

900
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:19,255
Neither of you is sane.

901
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:22,717
Seeing how you're reacting,
Pi-young isn't sane either.

902
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,971
I respect and like Pi-young
more than your mother.

903
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,056
She called me Fish Head.

904
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:29,391
How is she so childish?

905
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,819
I'm sad U-ram couldn't come.

906
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:41,903
Maybe next time.

907
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:45,073
I'm not scared of pirate ships.

908
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:47,242
Me neither.

909
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:51,162
But my body can't take it
when I'm swinging downward.

910
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,236
That was so fun.

911
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,947
-Wasn't that stress-relieving?
-Yes.

912
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,618
-That looks fun too.
-Okay.

913
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:44,651
Grandpa, our little general is hungry.

914
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,568
Okay.

915
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:48,029
Coming.

916
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,117
Isn't it still hot?

917
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,369
-Goodness.
-No.

918
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,704
It's just right.

919
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:57,956
Here you go.

920
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,415
Can I feed him?

921
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:04,212
Hye-ryung can't help
but feel concerned about Jeong-bin.

922
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:06,756
That's because fewer people
give birth these days.

923
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,259
I think they'll get back together

924
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:12,554
-even without our help.
-That would be great.

925
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:14,305
But that's selfish.

926
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,933
I bet on Jeong-bin's first birthday,

927
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:20,395
Hye-ryung will be greeting the guests.
I have a hunch.

928
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:23,940
Your hunches have never been right.

929
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,864
I have so many rides I want to go on.

930
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,407
and visit the aquarium too.

931
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,075
Come in the morning during your break.

932
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,077
The Christmas parade will be amazing.

933
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,704
Here's your ice cream.

934
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:38,788
Thank you.

935
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:55,513
I called Dad after you called me,
but his phone was off.

936
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,439
He called me.

937
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:07,150
Don't. He's probably with guests.

938
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,280
Is it him?

939
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:13,323
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SEO

940
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:17,410
-Is it him?
-No.

941
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,860
It's melting.

942
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,612
Right.

943
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,283
Don't you miss Dad?

944
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,161
I have no time to see him.
I'm busy these days.

945
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,746
He's busy too.

946
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:04,582
In our family,
Dad loves you more than you love him.

947
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:05,583
It's actually nice.

948
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:22,976
Let's ride a couple more and go.

949
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,083
DELUXE TAXI

950
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,962
I think that van has been following us.

951
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:43,342
It's been behind us
ever since the amusement park.

952
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,513
Maybe it's going the same way.

953
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:15,208
I felt happy just watching you today.

954
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:27,178
I have a favor to ask.

955
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:28,846
Your wish is my command.

956
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:34,560
Promise me you'll always
look happy in front of our baby.

957
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,854
That goes without saying. What else?

958
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:42,193
Even if he acts out, don't yell.

959
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:46,280
Promise me you'll be patient
with him until he finally understands.

960
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:48,241
Yes, ma'am.

961
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:51,262
I promise.

962
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:54,974
I won't look sad in front of our baby.

963
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,228
I'll force myself to smile.

964
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:30,343
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SEO:
I FELT HAPPY JUST WATCHING YOU TODAY

965
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,887
YOUR ADORABLE DAUGHTER LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU

966
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:36,724
I'LL LEAVE NOW
SINCE YOU'RE HOME SAFE AND SOUND

967
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:42,563
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SEO

968
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:48,945
I stopped by before leaving.
I'm in the underground parking lot.

969
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:51,864
Can I see you for a minute?

970
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,337
Did you sleep well?

971
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:52,258
-Yes.
-I only slept for three hours

972
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:53,384
since I had to pack.

973
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,386
You should hurry.

974
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,475
Will you give me a hug?

975
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:06,731
Or should I give you one instead?

976
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:10,860
I'll be away for over a month.

977
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:14,363
-Maybe when you return.
-Really?

978
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:21,162
Okay.

979
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:24,749
Will you park at the airport?

980
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:25,750
Someone will pick it up.

981
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:35,468
I'll text you.

982
01:08:57,716 --> 01:09:00,136
She'll give in
if I ask for forgiveness every day,

983
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:02,388
given our kids and her personality.

984
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:03,597
Let's get married before the holidays.

985
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:06,225
-Who is she?
-I don't know what to say.

986
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:08,477
Is he eating and doing well?

987
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:09,645
I wish you were here.

988
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:12,022
-Then shorten your trip and come.
-You're so mischievous.

989
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,858
-Cheer me up.
-How?

990
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:17,069
-What if I had dated his brother.
-I know.

991
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:20,281
Mr. Seo and my mom are getting married.

992
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:21,574
What puzzles me is

993
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,868
why did Mr. Seo
pick U-ram's mom and not you?

994
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:26,412
I didn't know you liked him as well.

995
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:27,329
-Hye-ryung.
-Yes?

996
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,081
How about you two get back together?

997
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,499
-A diamond ring?
-Yes.

998
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:31,458
How many carats?

999
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,043
How many carats is this?

1000
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,044
Are you his girlfriend?

1001
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:36,213
-Yes.
-Tell me about your family.

1002
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:37,756
Let's go back to how things were.

1003
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,217
I'm going to devote myself
to you and the family.

1004
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:41,552
I'm getting married.

1005
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:48,100
