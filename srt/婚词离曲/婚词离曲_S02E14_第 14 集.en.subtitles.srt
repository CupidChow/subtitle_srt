1
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,892
Is something wrong?

2
00:00:58,975 --> 00:00:59,809
EPISODE 14

3
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,078
It's been a while.

4
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,920
Thank you.

5
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,673
Were you on your way somewhere yesterday?

6
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,801
Home. I stopped by the book store.

7
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,929
How was golf on Saturday?

8
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,013
Good.

9
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,517
What you said that day
wasn't a joke, was it?

10
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,978
-Of course not.
-I was a bit surprised.

11
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,859
If you're not busy,
can you buy me a latte?

12
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,695
Do you know CafÃ© Deung?

13
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,132
Coffee always tastes good.

14
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,050
No wonder it's addictive.

15
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,512
We can't help but have them
in our line of work.

16
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,973
Why do you think I got a divorce?

17
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,268
As if you'd actually answer.

18
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,062
They all say it's because
they have nothing in common.

19
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,106
That's only true for celebrities.

20
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,151
My husband dumped me.

21
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:36,447
He fell for another woman,
so what else could it be?

22
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,241
Did he ask for the divorce?

23
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:42,245
No. He wanted me to forgive him
and move on,

24
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,831
but I couldn't.

25
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,749
Should I have?

26
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,627
Time will only tell
if you've made the right choice.

27
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,839
Taking action can sometimes
give you the best result

28
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,716
while sometimes it doesn't.

29
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,348
You seemed all right that day.

30
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,436
At the golf club, I mean.

31
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,980
It was nice to see you be open about it.

32
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:12,442
I'm probably at ease
since I didn't cause the divorce.

33
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:17,196
Being the victim
could lead to more anger at times.

34
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,867
-It wasn't easy.
-Of course it's not.

35
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,121
Why are men like that?

36
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:28,833
Why can't they be loyal
and keep their promises?

37
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:29,959
Is that so hard to do?

38
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,461
I wouldn't know.

39
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,923
I don't understand people
who break their promises.

40
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:38,009
What about your friends?
The ones who are married.

41
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,427
About a third are divorced.

42
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,721
-For what reason?
-Personality differences.

43
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,556
I should hear both sides of the story,

44
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,560
but some say they had no chance
because their wives weren't up to par.

45
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,686
There are many reasons,

46
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,689
just like how there's a reason
behind every death.

47
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,107
Has anyone switched partners?

48
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,401
-Two.
-How are they?

49
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,237
One of them is living a good life

50
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,822
while another had to try four times.

51
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,867
-He married four times?
-Yes.

52
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,911
How can someone marry four times?

53
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,454
Once is stressful enough.

54
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:10,250
From what I can tell,
only the first divorce is the hardest.

55
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,210
Do you envy them as a man yourself?

56
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,003
Of course not.

57
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:18,258
Life should be simple
especially in this hectic world.

58
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,098
How's Ji-a?

59
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,225
Goodness. Do you remember her name?

60
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,644
It's not like I have dementia.
Of course I remember.

61
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,313
She's in my care, of course.

62
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,984
I was sitting on the fence because of her.

63
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,946
You wouldn't know
since you're not married,

64
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,616
but trust is the most important thing
between a married couple.

65
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,119
It is for any relationship.

66
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,871
Where will you go from here then?

67
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,500
-Forget I asked.
-Are you headed home then?

68
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,710
Yes.

69
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,546
Do you cook for yourself?

70
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,797
Only on rare occasions.

71
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,966
I order in or eat at
a restaurant near home.

72
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,468
You eat just about anything
apart from caviar.

73
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,929
That's right.
So how did you send your mother off?

74
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,349
-My mom?
-Was there a burial?

75
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,228
Yes, she was laid to rest
beside my father.

76
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,815
What about you?

77
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,608
Do you know what I regret the most?

78
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:21,696
My mother wanted
to have her ashes scattered in the water,

79
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,656
so that's what I did.

80
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,034
I regret it though.

81
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,370
Cremating her
or scattering her ashes in water?

82
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,496
Both.

83
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,792
I should have buried her ashes
below a tree or kept it someplace.

84
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,755
Did your mother appear in your dream?

85
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,424
-No.
-Then she's resting in peace.

86
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:46,137
My mom visited me in my dream many times
and said she was cold.

87
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,599
Goodness.

88
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,185
But her ashes are already gone.

89
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,394
Oh, dear.

90
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,482
-What about memorial services?
-I hold a small one every year.

91
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,155
Parents are meant to sacrifice
and children are born to regret.

92
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,241
And I do a lot of that.

93
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,327
I'm no better.

94
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,870
You seem like a good daughter.

95
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,247
Most daughters are good to their mothers.

96
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,125
I know, but it's a long story though.

97
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,461
Us brats should
grab a drink sometime then.

98
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,755
Sure.

99
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,257
MADAM HONG

100
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,260
MADAM HONG

101
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,303
I should take this.

102
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,597
Sure.

103
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,727
Where the hell were you all day?

104
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:35,853
I had a meeting.

105
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:36,979
All day?

106
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,023
I also worked out.

107
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,360
Mother, put up your hands like this.

108
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,113
Come on.

109
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,914
You've got to be kidding me.

110
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,416
Are you playing games with me?

111
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,461
You should try boxing too.

112
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,629
It's a great exercise.

113
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:02,713
Save it for yourself.

114
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,216
Mop the floors and then help with dinner.

115
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,300
Sure.

116
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,931
Isn't the housekeeper here?

117
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,019
-I hear you hire help.
-Money doesn't grow on trees.

118
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,689
Why do we need one
when there are two women in the house?

119
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,400
Of course. You're absolutely right.

120
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,739
Is she an idiot?

121
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,495
Sa Pi-young, you foolish girl.

122
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,581
You let some idiot replace you.

123
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,963
-Maybe she's not home.
-Didn't you call her?

124
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,756
I had no time for that today.

125
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,427
She might be washing. Call her.

126
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,388
Don't you know the combination?

127
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,556
Hello?

128
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,099
Aren't you home?

129
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,102
I'm out to buy some twisted doughnuts.

130
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,187
Twisted doughnuts?

131
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,941
Yes, I had a sudden craving.

132
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,235
Where are you? Someplace far?

133
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,155
I'm behind Gangnam Sauna on foot.

134
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,364
I'll be right there.

135
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,116
You'll come to me?

136
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,577
Are you at my place?

137
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,541
You crave everything and anything
when you're pregnant.

138
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,377
I remember you craving pheasant dumplings

139
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,796
when you had Sa-hyeon.

140
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,382
That was with our eldest, not him.

141
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,967
Was it our eldest?

142
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:34,555
Anyway, we couldn't kill
since it'd be bad luck,

143
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,475
so I went through hoops
to buy pheasant meat.

144
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,435
I can't believe you remember all that.

145
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,774
Are you upset? What's with the long face?

146
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:51,197
Just imagine all the cravings she
would have had. I wasn't there for her.

147
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,241
I told her to call us anytime.

148
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,326
If only we had lived closer by.

149
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,537
Even today, she went out
to get some herself.

150
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,831
You have the last month to make up for it.

151
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:04,418
Of course. It's your heart that matters.

152
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,463
There's a big difference
between helping reluctantly

153
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,590
and doing so because you want to.

154
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:14,637
What was that word again?
It starts with a Q.

155
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,721
Right.

156
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,473
Quality is what matters.

157
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,692
Don't scoop the rice. It'll get cold.

158
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,735
We should have dinner.

159
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,823
Don't you have any common courtesy?
The head of the household isn't home.

160
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,535
Yu-sin will be late.

161
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,495
-He's running late?
-Yes.

162
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,414
Why didn't you tell me though?

163
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,708
Team dinners aren't important enough
to mention.

164
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,586
Then I wouldn't have made all this.

165
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,673
You and I need to eat though.
Should we starve instead?

166
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,800
As Ji-a says, you're super annoying.

167
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,468
Why go to these lengths then?

168
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:58,431
My grandma said that
eating well gives you a glow.

169
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,182
Who the hell do you think you are?

170
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,060
-Me?
-You keep talking backâ¦

171
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,897
How could you not tell me
when you saw me making all this food?

172
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,358
I thought you knew.

173
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,486
SHOULD I JUST SLAM HER TO THE FLOOR

174
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,156
AND FLATTEN HER LIKE A GUTTED SQUID?

175
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,574
You eat this much, right?

176
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,248
Get in!

177
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,876
Father, the shop's right over there.

178
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,297
-Welcome.
-Gosh, it smells incredible.

179
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,800
This is unbelievable.

180
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,469
Do you like snacks like these?

181
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,179
I'm just like everyone else.

182
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,184
Those are twisted doughnuts
and those are spicy corn dogs.

183
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,227
Honey, it's the doughnuts you love.

184
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,438
Do you like doughnuts, Mother?

185
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,814
Those with red beans inside.

186
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,069
The cheese doughnuts are good too.

187
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,529
-We'll take a few of everything.
-Sure.

188
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,074
They use glutinous rice.

189
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,450
-Glutinous rice?
-Yes.

190
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,743
Go ahead and eat one.

191
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,628
Just watching you has our mouth-watering.

192
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,338
Is it good?

193
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:17,510
-I feel so much better.
-Is there a decent restaurant nearby?

194
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,345
We should have them while they're hot.

195
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:20,805
Here you go.

196
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,057
Thank you.

197
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,604
We'll order bossam and three bowls of
makguksu. Make one of them spicy.

198
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:29,522
We'll share.

199
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,150
-Right away.
-Let's see.

200
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,532
We'll have the noodles when they get here.

201
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,492
We didn't even have a proper lunch today.

202
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,828
-Goodness.
-We had the final payment to make.

203
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,998
Hye-ryung's moving the day after tomorrow
and they've filed their papers.

204
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,546
This is really good.

205
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,589
This too.

206
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:57,925
How about another?

207
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,468
I'll have it for dessert.

208
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,187
Isn't it good?

209
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,190
This isn't like the twisted doughnuts
I've had before.

210
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,331
Mother, your galbijjim is the best

211
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,499
as are the other food.

212
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,670
Did I cook for hours
just to feed this bitch?

213
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,755
Some enjoy food made by others

214
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,133
while some like to cook themselves.

215
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,302
I guess you'd rather
have others cook for you.

216
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,137
Just eat quietly.

217
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,263
Sure.

218
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,516
I get so hungry after a workout.

219
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,398
Are you finished already?

220
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,236
Are you perhaps feeling under the weather?

221
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,911
I feel much better
now that my stomach's full.

222
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,663
You should stay with us.

223
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,207
For what?

224
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,834
What do you mean?
It's better than her being alone.

225
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:17,004
We have a yard big enough for walks,
so you won't have to go out.

226
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,924
I can look after you,
and we've already told his brother.

227
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,676
She should move into my house
since it's safe there.

228
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,930
-And our house is a hazard?
-Her due date could be pushed up

229
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,598
and her ob-gyn is close by.

230
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,849
I guess he's right.

231
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,893
Why don't you two stay at my place?

232
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,521
-You should.
-You want us to live together?

233
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,939
There are three rooms.

234
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,068
It'll take a month
for the papers to be finalized.

235
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,695
We can have the wedding later,

236
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,198
but I want her to have the baby
while we're around.

237
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,116
Of course. That's how it should be.

238
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,955
Shouldn't you at least
take a photo to celebrate?

239
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,748
Of course they should.

240
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:56,085
At the thought of you

241
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,380
I toss and turn in my sleep

242
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,716
A smile spreads over my face
at the thought of you

243
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,053
And that gets me through the day

244
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:09,348
At the thought of you

245
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:13,018
I only await this day

246
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,562
There was something

247
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:20,442
I wanted to say in your presence

248
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:26,198
So I held back and endured the wait

249
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,120
Everyone in this world

250
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,792
May call me a fool

251
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,422
But it's all right

252
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,634
Because

253
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:51,849
I love

254
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:58,939
You

255
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,538
-Hey, Madam Hong.
-What time do you get off work?

256
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,706
I already am.

257
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,125
-Han-seung wants to meet up.
-I have plans.

258
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,960
With whom? I doubt it's a woman.

259
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,712
Why not?

260
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,881
I'll eat my hat if that's true.

261
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,634
Put it in writing
that you'll eat your hat.

262
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,801
Got it.

263
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,764
Hello?

264
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,685
Where are you?
I'll feed you the hat myself.

265
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,938
Who was that?

266
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,564
Don't change the subject.

267
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:44,068
Bring her with you.
Drinks will definitely be on me today.

268
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,528
-I'll call you back later then.
-Bring her!

269
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:49,990
Why Madam Hong?

270
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,409
His name is Do-dam
and he's extremely talkative.

271
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,370
It's been his nickname since high school.

272
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,042
-You should get going then.
-They gather to drink and talk nonsense.

273
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,556
It's been a while.

274
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,434
He's a fan.

275
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,357
This is Professor Park Hae-ryun,
my fiancÃ©.

276
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,733
I see.

277
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,239
It's your last week, isn't it?

278
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,282
Yes.

279
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,911
-You did great.
-Thank you.

280
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:38,956
Goodbye.

281
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,832
Let me know in advance
if you're eating out for dinner.

282
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,044
Sending a message is not difficult.

283
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,337
But I did.

284
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,839
I mean, to me.

285
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,425
I cooked all sorts of dishes

286
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,178
only to hear you were eating out.

287
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,019
Mother, you should put this on.

288
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,730
It's for your eyes and mouth.
Your neck too.

289
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,733
Should I do it for you?

290
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:55,157
You don't have deep wrinkles,
but the shallow ones must bother you.

291
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,950
It's common at your age though.

292
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,120
How dare you!

293
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,207
I just wanted to help you look young.

294
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,255
This is a great product.

295
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,520
How dare she call me old
in front of Yu-sin.

296
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,702
Should we pack the dishes
in that cupboard too?

297
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,745
Yes, please.

298
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,165
You can pack all of those too.

299
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,168
-Please have this while you work.
-Thanks.

300
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,889
DONG-MA

301
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,240
-Hello?
-It's me.

302
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,160
I'm at your apartment complex.

303
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,997
-Can't you come out?
-I'm outside.

304
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,124
You sound like you just woke up

305
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,377
and your car's here.
Should I come to you instead?

306
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,547
-What's this about?
-I want to talk.

307
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,050
I'll be at Sagye.

308
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,559
-One Americano, please.
-Sure.

309
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,438
It's not like you to order coffee.

310
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,862
You know, right?

311
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,156
That's the style I like.

312
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:03,577
Messy hair and clothes
you can fall asleep in.

313
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,706
What's going on?

314
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,918
How are your parents?

315
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,298
I dropped by because
you seemed upset the other day

316
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,009
and to say I enjoyed your performance.

317
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,555
-You always deliver.
-They passed away.

318
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,142
Both of them.

319
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,144
When?

320
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,775
Was it yesterday?

321
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:44,159
But I can't fly out to their funeral

322
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,245
because I'm the sole lead of the show.

323
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,481
My dadâ¦

324
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,318
fell down while playing tennis

325
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,070
and fractured his collarbone.

326
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,115
That's why I pushed back the wedding.

327
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,576
My mom was driving him back
from the hospital

328
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,872
after taking off his cast whenâ¦

329
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,586
Your dad's younger brother
lives close by, right?

330
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,515
I'll send an employee
from our branch in Germany.

331
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,601
-I still can't believe it.
-When did you last see them?

332
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,062
Last fall.

333
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,573
You can't fall apart.

334
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,117
Stay strong.

335
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,460
How did you still manage
to perform last night?

336
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,300
Your parentsâ¦

337
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,846
were probably there to see you.

338
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,060
I'm sure they were.

339
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:38,565
Bada. Live a long, healthy life, okay?

340
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,321
Hye-ryung wants to buy us dinner tomorrow.

341
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,823
But I was going to do that.

342
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,576
It doesn't matter who does.
We should still have one last meal.

343
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,828
She has a new name now. It's Bada.

344
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,872
What for? It's not like she knows.

345
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,874
She's a smart one,
so she'll catch on soon.

346
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,086
Dogs take after their owners.

347
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,880
Isn't that right, Bada?

348
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,257
There you go.

349
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,806
How's the house? Is it in a pleasant spot?

350
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,391
Yes, I slept well.

351
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,561
That was probably because
you were exhausted.

352
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:21,316
I can't believe things happened so fast.

353
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:22,984
We used to be family after allâ¦

354
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,569
Tell me about it.

355
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,657
I was truly happy
on my wedding day, you know.

356
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,200
We're sorry about what happened.

357
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:35,372
Catholicism teaches us that we
have no one to blame but ourselves.

358
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,208
I will just accept things as they are.

359
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,670
You must have been an angel
in your past life,

360
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,589
which is why you were born so beautiful.

361
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:48,135
That must mean you were an angel too.

362
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,220
Sa-hyeon as well.

363
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,681
I guess only I was a menace.

364
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:56,852
That's ridiculous.
You're nothing but masculine.

365
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,103
-An alpha male.
-Exactly.

366
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,646
An alpha male?

367
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:04,651
Anyway, I'm relieved that we can part ways

368
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,570
with smiles on our faces.

369
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,363
Are you never going to see me again?

370
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:11,491
That's not what I meant.
We're technically not a family anymore.

371
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,410
Once a family, always a family.

372
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,452
Of course.

373
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,290
That's why I asked him
to let me see the baby once it's born.

374
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,960
Right. You should stay friends.

375
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:25,839
In foreign TV shows,
you see divorced couples stay friends.

376
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,382
With no hard feelings.

377
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,759
Sa-hyeon, let's do that.

378
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,141
Although I don't regret it,
I've given it some thought.

379
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,269
Maybe I should have had a baby
right after the marriage.

380
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,104
That would have been nice.

381
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,522
That was foolish of me.

382
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,525
You had a different view of life.
You can't call yourself a fool.

383
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,653
Anyway, I'm grateful for the generosity
you showed me.

384
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,740
I should've cooked a meal for you myself.

385
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,868
Nonsense. All that matters
is that we've had this gathering.

386
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:55,994
Of course.

387
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,830
Can I still visit you in Daejeon
from time to time

388
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:02,626
as if you were my Mom and Dad,
and not in-laws?

389
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,503
Of course. Come by
whenever you go golfing.

390
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,339
And tell me what you'd like to eat.

391
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,090
Yes, Mother.

392
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:14,387
That's great. Congratulations.

393
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,722
You too.

394
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,183
The wedding will happen in no time.

395
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,100
Yes.

396
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,230
What about Ga-bin though?

397
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,690
I can't think of anything to say.

398
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,150
Same here.

399
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:31,071
Why don't we just go
to her final performance?

400
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:34,324
I have a meeting
with the publishing agency that day.

401
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:35,992
Thank you for dinner.

402
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,912
Don't mention it.
Have a safe trip to Daejeon.

403
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:39,871
Sure.

404
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,792
Mother, I'll text you from time to time.

405
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,418
Sure thing.

406
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,573
Thank you.

407
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,213
Have a good life.

408
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,091
You too.

409
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,336
They say you need to spend time
with people to know them.

410
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,670
Hye-ryung's proof of that.

411
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:11,880
Tell me about it.

412
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,883
She ended it all with a smile on her face.

413
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,634
She was an angel in disguise.

414
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,970
This is why people should be generous.

415
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:23,475
Because you did everything she asked for,

416
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:24,976
things ended amicably.

417
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,811
I hope she finds someone nice.

418
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,856
Of course she will.
She's still quite young.

419
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,359
Although, people will gossip for a while.

420
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,528
What will she say when people
ask her about the divorce?

421
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,864
What celebrities always say.

422
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,824
"We had nothing in common,

423
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,869
but we've decided to stay as friends."

424
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,718
-Hello?
-Mr. Seo.

425
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,512
Are you already home?

426
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,263
Yes, I just got back.

427
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,643
-What's this about?
-How about a cocktail?

428
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,061
I'm buying.

429
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,860
Where did you get this money?

430
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,906
Mom.

431
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,784
-Yes?
-We need to talk.

432
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,415
It's from Dad.

433
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,584
Did you see him without telling us?

434
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,919
Three times.

435
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:38,299
-What did he say?
-He misses me and wants to know

436
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,384
how I'm doing.

437
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,804
-Did he tell you to keep it a secret?
-I just thought that I should.

438
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,305
When did you last see him?

439
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,807
About a month ago.

440
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,226
Are you a saint or just stupid?

441
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,936
He's still our dad.

442
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,480
And we're his children.

443
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,649
And look what he did to us.

444
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,654
The bartender's cool, isn't she?

445
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,671
You should try a sip of this too.

446
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,340
-It's good.
-Isn't it sweet?

447
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,300
-Only a little.
-Then I'll pass.

448
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,844
I'd like to be comforted
with a touch of sweetness today.

449
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,472
I moved out, you see.

450
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,937
What did you think
of my husband when you saw him?

451
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,148
He was charming.

452
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,610
A woman was drawn to him
because of that charm

453
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,320
and she got knocked up on purpose.

454
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,533
My husband fell for her antics
and requested a divorce.

455
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:28,910
I agreed.

456
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,004
What do you think of that?

457
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,383
It's nonsensical.

458
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,134
That's what I thought too.

459
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,806
It's not my place to ask,
but does he really love this woman?

460
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,225
Or is it because of the baby?

461
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,729
Both, I guess.

462
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,483
My pride is wounded

463
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,151
and it hurts, honestly speaking.

464
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,362
You should meet someone better.

465
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,572
That'll heal your heart.

466
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:10,285
AND THAT SOMEONE IS YOU

467
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,455
I don't know. I've lost confidence now.

468
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,292
In yourself?
Or have you lost trust in men?

469
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,544
I've lost confidence in myself.

470
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,171
We all have
our ups and downs in life, right?

471
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,840
Things might get better for you.

472
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,550
Like the actress Oh Yu-rim.

473
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,387
Marrying the eldest son
of SF Electronics' CEO

474
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,514
would be the most thrilling payback.

475
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,642
This could just be temporary.
He might come back to you.

476
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:38,229
-But there's a baby now.
-Kids don't keep people from divorcing.

477
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,941
My father divorced my mother
after they had me too.

478
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,323
How old were you?

479
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,241
I was in my teens.

480
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,494
It must have been tough for you.

481
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,537
Was it amicable?

482
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,206
I said goodbye with a smile on my face.

483
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:01,127
There's no need to end a chapter with
a frown. Easier said than done though.

484
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,974
-You have a suitcase, right?
-Yes.

485
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,310
That should be reserved for valuables.

486
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,269
But it's nighttime.

487
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,313
You don't want to leave anything out

488
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,815
and things will be hectic tomorrow.
Just say the word.

489
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:26,027
You're wearing yourself out.
It was already a moving day for you.

490
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,904
-I didn't do any work.
-You should rest at night.

491
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,113
It won't wear me out.

492
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,449
You're overestimating yourself.
Take it back.

493
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,785
There.

494
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,710
Maybe you were right not to get married.

495
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,172
Do you regret it?

496
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:50,009
No. In a few years, you might
be glad that you had that divorce.

497
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,095
Right.

498
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,306
I'm not going to regret
my marriage or my divorce though.

499
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,518
They're all valuable life lessons.

500
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,146
Any experience that you have in life
can be put to good use.

501
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,565
How long does it take
for divorces to be finalized?

502
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,236
A month if there's no child.

503
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,947
Once it's over,
reporters will get wind of it.

504
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,620
I know you're close to Ms. Sa
and Ms. Lee, but I'm also your teammate.

505
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,831
Call me if you need any help.

506
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:25,086
The conversation we had tonight
has already helped me alot.

507
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:30,008
I'm feeling a lot better now.

508
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,846
Keeping it bottled inside
ate away at me, you see.

509
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,389
Does Ms. Sa know?

510
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,852
I told her and Ms. Lee a few days ago.

511
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,564
-What did they say?
-That's a story for another time.

512
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:48,860
HE SHOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT
MS. SA'S DIVORCE UNTIL MUCH LATER

513
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,613
You should head back then.
Thank you for today.

514
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,657
I didn't want to go home
to an empty house.

515
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:58,202
I hate it too,
but it's not so bad sometimes.

516
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,287
When?

517
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,914
After exhausting social gatherings.

518
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:05,126
They wear you down
and it's tiring to listen to others.

519
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,671
-I'd rather just head home.
-Maybe that's how you feel about today.

520
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,214
Of course not.

521
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,474
-My younger brother's visiting.
-Gosh, I didn't know you had one.

522
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,142
Didn't Ms. Sa tell you?

523
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,311
We ran into her at the golf club
last Saturday.

524
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:27,732
Things have been hectic for me
due to the divorce and all.

525
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:30,985
Did you drive here?

526
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,572
What about you?
My manager will be picking me up.

527
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,699
Plate number 7120, please.

528
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,243
Here's for two. 7120 and 6850, please.

529
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,246
Is she on her way?

530
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,664
Yes, there she is.

531
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,000
Hello.

532
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:51,130
I'll take pistachio,

533
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:52,965
chocolate, and strawberry.

534
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,509
Got it.

535
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:12,944
So you've been singingâ¦

536
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:15,947
Off to bed.

537
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,824
But I'm not sleepy.

538
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,618
If you keep sleeping late,
it'll become a habit.

539
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,582
It's Dad!

540
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,043
Mom, it's Dad.

541
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,966
-Dad!
-Hey.

542
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,635
I'm glad my princess is still awake.

543
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,264
I bought gelato.

544
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,766
-Dad, I see you drank.
-Only a little.

545
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:48,855
-You should've called first.
-I suddenly missed her.

546
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,483
Mom, let's have some before it melts.

547
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,944
Right now? But it's bedtime.

548
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,529
I didn't have a big dinner.

549
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,030
Gelato's fine.

550
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,538
Mom, make sure to serve it
in a pretty ice cream bowl.

551
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:06,664
Got it.

552
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:07,790
Can I get some too?

553
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,209
Of course you can.

554
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,297
I'm growing fonder of pistachio
just like you, Mom.

555
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:19,218
Text me anytime you want them.
I'll get you more.

556
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,055
Have you been good?

557
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,018
-Yes.
-You're not going to ask how I'm doing?

558
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,229
-They all say I look gaunt.
-It's better than being chubby.

559
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,357
She's not wrong.

560
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,527
How have you been?
I bet school life hasn't been easy.

561
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,407
Why aren't you eating? It'll melt.

562
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:45,870
Well, I'm only here
to see my two princesses.

563
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,039
Mom's more like a queen.

564
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,710
To me, she's also a princess.

565
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,048
You're giving me goosebumps.

566
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,009
I'll turn into a goose because of you.

567
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,637
Your driver must be waiting.

568
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,932
-I sent him off.
-Then call another.

569
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:06,974
It's her bedtime.

570
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:08,851
Right.

571
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,569
Is that honey water?

572
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,196
Yes.

573
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,091
Have a seat.

574
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,977
When an elder asks you to sit,
you answer first.

575
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,104
Don't sit without saying anything.

576
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,606
-Sure.
-Call to see if he's on his way home.

577
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,150
The phone is turned off.
Your call will be directed toâ¦

578
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,569
His phone is off.

579
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,864
A lot of married couples
get back together after getting a divorce.

580
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,702
It's not like they broke it off
because they fell out of love.

581
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,453
They got along famously.

582
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,331
-I know.
-What do you know about men?

583
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,544
There are only two reasons
why men cheat on their wives.

584
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,046
Because they're fed up with their wives

585
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,756
or out of curiosity. Just for fun.

586
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,175
He didn't date me just for fun.

587
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,261
-He loves me.
-Did he actually tell you that?

588
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,264
-Yes.
-As if he meant it.

589
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,932
He could have been lying.

590
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,977
You probably know him well
since you raised him.

591
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:37,815
Yu-sin's not like that.
I wouldn't have fallen for him if he were.

592
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,362
A friend of mine got remarried, you see.

593
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,740
After signing the divorce papers though,

594
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,200
her husband's ex-wife became the mistress.

595
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,581
He married my friend, but he got caught
seeing his ex-wife behind her back.

596
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:57,084
My friend, who was disgusted,
left him after that.

597
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,088
Who is he with again?

598
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,715
I didn't ask him.

599
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,094
If he's not wasted,
it means he was with Ji-a's mom.

600
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,971
He wouldn't lie about things like that.

601
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,099
He even took Ji-a swimming a few days ago.

602
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,392
Want to bet on it?

603
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,395
He may have been drawn
to you because you're new,

604
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,565
but women are pretty much the same
after some time passes.

605
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,984
Just like how we all look different,

606
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,111
we're all charming in different ways.

607
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,490
What do you think makes you charming?
Your youth?

608
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,369
Your pretty face?

609
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:35,122
Ji-a's mom was way prettier at your age.
And she's still stunning.

610
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:40,836
Socrates said we should know ourselves.

611
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,672
And he didn't mean it
in the literal sense.

612
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,927
Having lived all those years,
I think I finally know what he meant.

613
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,888
Socratesâ¦

614
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:54,767
I'm certain he was a spiritual man
and not just a philosopher.

615
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:58,020
Most people don't know about themselves.

616
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,065
A gifted person knowing that
he's gifted isn't a shame,

617
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,901
but even those that aren't think they are.

618
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,070
-That's the problem.
-So I'm not good enough?

619
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:09,281
What would people say
if they knew that you were living here?

620
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:12,743
What about your parents in the US?
Don't you have younger siblings?

621
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,913
Would they be proud of what you're doing?

622
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,415
-You--
-"Mother".

623
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,001
Mother, do you think you're admirable?

624
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,922
I majored in nursing

625
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:27,716
and lived as the wife of
a hospital director for 30 years.

626
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,301
Technically though,

627
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,054
you're only his second wife.

628
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,017
That's still way above a mistress.

629
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,353
I was Dr. Shin's official wife
whom he married.

630
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,980
Meanwhile, you're only a mistress.

631
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:47,403
On paper, Ji-a's mom is still his wife.

632
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,073
So how about that bet?

633
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:54,493
With one phone call,
we'll know if he went to Ji-a's mom--

634
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,745
-Go ahead.
-Well,

635
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,205
we can't bet money.

636
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:00,916
I'd like that necklace.

637
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,127
I'll bet my new purse.

638
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:09,508
Hello?

639
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,969
-It's me.
-Yes?

640
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,848
Did Yu-sin perhaps stop by today?

641
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,767
He did.

642
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,061
I see.

643
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,606
Is that what you called to ask?

644
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:26,150
He's running late, so I got worried.

645
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,903
I see. Good night then.

646
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,112
Sure.

647
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,206
You know what wake-up calls are, right?

648
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:43,459
This will end in tears for you,
so get out of that bubble.

649
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,588
You're too naive
so you don't know how men really are.

650
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,591
It's not like
you know Yu-sin inside and out.

651
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,385
You weren't even aware of our affair.

652
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,639
Married couples have their own secrets

653
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,891
and that's how Yu-sin and I are.

654
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,560
Just hand me that purse of yours.

655
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:13,531
Why are you so late?
You don't even seem drunk.

656
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,741
I stopped by Ji-a's.

657
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,412
-Is that ice cream?
-Gelato.

658
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,415
I already had some.

659
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,461
-What for?
-I went to see my daughter.

660
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,969
You don't like eating cold things, right?

661
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,012
Are you saying I shouldn't eat?

662
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,357
Here you go.

663
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,036
It's great. What is it?

664
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,122
That's blended yogurt,
banana, and avocado.

665
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,373
I see.

666
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,633
Maybe I should just stay the night.

667
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,680
Bada, that sounds better, doesn't it?

668
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:23,142
-Gosh.
-What are you trying to say?

669
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:26,562
-You should sleep in your own bed.
-I've never stayed the night here.

670
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:29,690
My feet and heart won't let me leave you.

671
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,151
Yet, your feet moved.

672
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,903
Push me again.

673
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,491
Hey, that's not fair.

674
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:43,287
You have no idea
how I hated leaving you home all alone.

675
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,874
-Is that so?
-It's just so cozy here.

676
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,460
I wanted to stay
even more when we had wine.

677
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,342
Don't you want me to stay?

678
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:58,510
Be honest with me.

679
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:06,060
No, wait. I can't.

680
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,145
I have no change of clothes.

681
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,855
-Can I sleep naked?
-No way.

682
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,732
But the lights will be off.

683
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,944
I don't necessarily have to share
your bed. I'll sleep on the couch.

684
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,991
There's no need for us
to stay apart anymore.

685
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,618
I just can't leave you here alone.

686
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,037
I'll drop the boxes off at home
early in the morning

687
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,372
and change into comfortable clothes.

688
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:29,416
You won't feel refreshed
if you don't sleep in a comfortable bed.

689
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,170
Wait. Your maternity clothes.

690
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,153
There was plenty of dry ice
so it shouldn't have melted.

691
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,446
Yes.

692
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:05,035
Yu-sin, can't you come with me
to Ga-bin's show?

693
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,578
You've already been though.

694
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,164
Both her parents passed away, you see.

695
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,794
In a car accident.

696
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,845
Aren't I sexy?

697
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,349
You're adorable. Especially in my eyes.

698
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,601
I have the biggest heart too.

699
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:30,978
I know.

700
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,729
Where are you off to?

701
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,982
-To get some melons.
-Why?

702
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,942
Aren't you thirsty? You worked all night.

703
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:40,279
I'm not. Here.

704
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:44,908
Besides, I'll get it myself
if I want some.

705
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,034
I'll go get a pillow.

706
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,872
As if I need one. I don't.

707
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,833
Do you sleep without a pillow?

708
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,042
Come on.

709
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,337
But my head's heavy.

710
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,964
It's not.

711
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,558
How do you feel?

712
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:13,479
For me, it's like I'm dreaming.
But it shouldn't be one at all.

713
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,857
Can you pinch me?

714
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,990
It doesn't hurt, so it must be a dream.

715
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,244
I must be dreaming.

716
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,582
I guess I'm not.

717
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:40,130
What if you're not here
when I wake up tomorrow?

718
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,509
That might happen.

719
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:50,265
I'll probably be making
our first breakfast together for you.

720
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:53,435
That's absurd. I can't make a guest cook.

721
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,147
-A guest?
-That's what you are for now.

722
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:00,484
Those words hurt your baby daddy's heart.

723
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:05,739
How about we have the wedding
on our baby's 100th day anniversary?

724
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:07,032
Maybe.

725
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:10,953
We'll discuss it with your parents first.

726
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:13,372
A 100th day party for Bada in the day

727
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,290
and our wedding in the evening.

728
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:16,833
We'll ask your parents.

729
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,669
Would a month be enough
for you to recover?

730
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,880
-You should go to sleep.
-Why do you want me to?

731
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,174
What are you planning on doing
after I doze off?

732
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,719
There's no reason.
I'm just worried you might be tired.

733
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:30,931
I'm not tired at all.
I couldn't be more alert right now.

734
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:34,059
Being with you washed away the exhaustion.

735
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,145
How can your company alone
make me this happy?

736
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,858
That's how it is
when you're with someone you like.

737
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:46,989
Is that the case for you too?

738
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:53,203
Could you brush my hair too?

739
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,047
That feels amazing.

740
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,757
Are you feeling sleepy?

741
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,886
I can help you
sleep like this every night.

742
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,763
Me too.

743
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,725
We can do it for each other.

744
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,067
I bet it's hard for you
whether you're seated or lying down.

745
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,616
I'm dying to meet our child,

746
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,451
so I hope you give birth soon.

747
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,245
It's okay to give birth 15 days earlier.

748
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,206
Fate decides when we're born anyway.

749
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:43,587
What if I wake you
with my frequent trips to the bathroom?

750
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,798
I'm aware of it. The book says
the baby pushes on your bladder.

751
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,009
When did you get around to reading a book?

752
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,344
I had to make time.

753
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:53,597
I may not have been with you,
but I was still worried.

754
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,602
I always sleep like a log, you know.

755
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,690
You're really handsome.

756
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,235
Is that a joke or do you really mean it?

757
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,780
I mean it. I truly do.

758
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:11,239
You too.

759
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:14,409
You're the epitome of an Asian beauty

760
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,787
but you're also sexy.

761
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,164
I'm not sexy at all.

762
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:22,000
That night in Gangneung
taught me otherwise.

763
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,505
But I was serious that day.

764
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:31,259
I know.
I could tell with every fiber in me.

765
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,848
There's that song.

766
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:42,688
It snows from the sky

767
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:47,401
Because our love is that beautiful

768
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:53,532
It must be a gift from the sky

769
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:57,077
For you and me

770
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,122
Do you know this song?

771
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:04,668
The love we have for one another

772
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:08,088
and the longing we felt.

773
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,299
The sky must have noticed.

774
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:19,808
Bada, who do you take after?

775
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,727
Your mom or your dad?

776
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,106
Aren't you happy to hear my voice again?

777
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,779
Wait, did it just kick?

778
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,532
It answered you and said that it's happy.

779
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:44,416
For the first time in a while,
I head to the gym

780
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:47,794
Boy, do I look fine on the treadmill

781
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,921
I run like there's no tomorrow

782
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,715
And that's when I spotted you

783
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:55,051
You in the short shorts

784
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:59,514
Your long straight hair is tied back
Your lips are tightly pressed together

785
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,224
Whenever you lift the weights

786
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,435
I'm touched with your grace

787
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:06,563
Humming to a song
coming from your earphones

788
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,232
Sir.

789
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:13,737
Could I hold a press conference tomorrow?

790
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:18,200
Get me some coffee.
One for the makeup artist too.

791
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:19,993
Sure.

792
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,996
Hello.

793
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:28,543
I want a natural look today.

794
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:34,299
BOO HYE-RYUNG PRESS CONFERENCE

795
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,470
Hi there.

796
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,975
-Do you like gatkimchi?
-Of course.

797
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,772
There's juice and also club soda.

798
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:49,981
No, I'm good.

799
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,072
He has an errand to run.

800
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:03,370
Side dishes are a nuisance to make.
You didn't need to make this much.

801
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:06,957
As if this is a lot. It's only the basics.

802
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,708
I have help anyway.

803
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,128
I'll help too once I'm done recovering.

804
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,922
I should learn your recipes.

805
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:22,222
There's no need to help,
so visit often with the baby.

806
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:25,267
When will you and Father
come to stay with us?

807
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:28,436
You two enjoy your time together first.
We're in no rush.

808
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,815
It'll be even better with you two.
Double the joy.

809
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,739
Gosh, that looks delicious.

810
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,741
I want to have that for lunch today.

811
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,368
Sure. It'll cleanse your palate.

812
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:46,788
My bride, you're a bonafide
a Chungcheong-native now.

813
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,832
How can you call me
your bride at this age?

814
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,000
As if you're any old.

815
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:53,461
In my eyes,
you're still my young, beautiful bride.

816
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,881
She'll say you're being silly.

817
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,760
He's not wrong though.

818
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,929
Not many women are as fair as you.

819
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,472
-Right?
-Of course.

820
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,475
Was it her beauty that you fell for?

821
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:08,685
Like you have to ask.

822
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:17,277
BOO HYE-RYUNG PRESS CONFERENCE

823
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:22,073
BOO HYE-RYUNG

824
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:25,577
Hello, I see some
familiar faces here today.

825
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,704
Anyway, it saddens me

826
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:32,000
to deliver the news
that isn't all that pleasant.

827
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:37,339
I got a divorce.

828
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,307
-When?
-Fairly recently.

829
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,809
Why?
Is it because you have nothing in common?

830
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,979
Is there perhaps another reason?

831
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:56,524
My husband requested
a divorce and I agreed.

832
00:53:58,526 --> 00:53:59,527
STAR DJ BOO HYE-RYUNG ANNOUNCES DIVORCE

833
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:04,240
Your husband requested the divorce?

834
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,493
-Yes.
-For what reason?

835
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:11,915
He met someone new.

836
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,458
So he had an affair?

837
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,380
-Who's the other woman?
-It'sâ¦

838
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:22,759
not my place to disclose that.

839
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,844
You were married for three years, right?

840
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,096
Yes.

841
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,848
I know this is hard,
but please tell us how you're feeling.

842
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:42,070
It's just like you said.

843
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,907
Honestly speaking, it's been hard for me.

844
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,371
So you calmly agreed
to the divorce request.

845
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,457
I had no other option.

846
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:55,959
You could have held out.

847
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,796
How could I when he loves her?

848
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,637
Look after her.

849
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:12,851
I'm sorry for asking,
but what about the alimony?

850
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:17,230
I just took what they offered.

851
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:25,530
Your husband is known
to be younger than you.

852
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:28,408
-By a year.
-How old is the other woman?

853
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,202
-That I don't know--
-Aren't you being too nice?

854
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:36,166
As a woman myself,
I'd like to keep her privacy.

855
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:40,295
But she's the woman who stole
your husband. Must you be considerate?

856
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:47,385
She's pregnant, you see.

857
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:55,810
BOO HYE-RYUNG'S SHOCKING DIVORCE

858
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,112
No way.

859
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,448
Hye-ryung's divorce was announced.

860
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:17,707
Were you aware of it?

861
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,585
It's just like you said.

862
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,880
Honestly speaking, it's been hard for me.

863
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:31,054
BOO HYE-RYUNG ANNOUNCES
THE END OF HER MARRIAGE OF 3 YEARS

864
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,732
What's the deal? Did you get a divorce?

865
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,319
Yes.

866
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,114
Who did you hear that from?

867
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:51,491
It's a trending topic online right now.

868
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,870
LAW FIRM JIDAM

869
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,294
BOO HYE-RYUNG'S HUSBAND DOXED

870
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:17,851
Sa-hyeon wants you
to come up with a name for the baby.

871
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,018
Gosh.

872
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,855
Can't we just decide on a random name?

873
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:26,651
He went to a monk who's good at
creating names for Byeol-hui and Hae-ri.

874
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:29,195
They're beautiful
and have a great meaning.

875
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,322
They should sound nice too.

876
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:34,409
Sa-hyeon was given his name
so that he'd be a judge or prosecutor.

877
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,494
"Pan Sa-hyeon."

878
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:39,706
Better a lawyer
than a judge who punishes people.

879
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,417
My goodness!

880
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,421
Must they ring like that
and startle us silly?

881
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:49,299
Stay seated.
You shouldn't be getting up like that.

882
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,967
It's all right.

883
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:59,017
Hi, Yun-sim. It's been a while.

884
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,520
What's the matter with you?
How could you do such a thing?

885
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,523
What do you mean?

886
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,234
Your son had an affair
and kicked Boo Hye-ryung out.

887
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:11,779
That's inhumane, you know.

888
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:14,616
It's cruel to hurt
other people's children.

889
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:15,575
Yes?

890
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,370
Where?

891
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:23,541
-What?
-You have it all wrong.

892
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:26,669
So?

893
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,380
It's not true.

894
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:42,018
If my daughter had been
kicked out like Boo Hye-ryung,

895
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:44,604
I would have buried my son-in-law myself.

896
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,732
No one kicked her out.
She offered to divorce--

897
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:49,651
Why would she lie about that?

898
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,986
I feel so bad for her.

899
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,280
Even I cried while watching her interview.

900
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,658
You should listen
to both sides of the story.

901
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,119
What you don't know--

902
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,500
I'm getting another call.

903
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:17,262
Did you read the articles?
Hye-ryung is in no shape to go on air.

904
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,763
We'll have to air a recording.

905
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,815
She seemed okay with it despite the tears.

906
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:37,031
Wouldn't it have been better
to wait for them to find out?

907
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:40,159
That's like living
with a ticking time bomb.

908
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,204
It's better to rip off the Band-aid.

909
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,164
They say you can't truly know a person.

910
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,751
Her husband, I mean.

911
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,838
I guess men are defenseless
when women throw themselves at them.

912
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:55,883
It would have been much better
to not have let it affect him though.

913
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,176
The gossip will subside.

914
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:01,139
That will be true for Ms. Boo
and she'll win sympathy votes too.

915
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:04,726
But her husband
is being dragged through the mud.

916
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:07,353
What can you do? He had it coming.

917
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,733
You're saying that
because you're also a man, right?

918
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,151
Because all guys stick together?

919
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:14,986
-Is that not true?
-Of course not.

920
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,405
He was once her husband,

921
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:19,657
so did she have to bury him socially?

922
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:22,243
People who don't know him will forget

923
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:25,204
and move on to new gossip,

924
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,040
but not those close to him.

925
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,625
It'll be hard on his parents too.

926
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,627
I guess she didn't see it coming.

927
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,796
She was only trying to take initiative
before word got out.

928
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:37,884
You know how manic people get
over other people's lives.

929
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,763
There was no need to dox her husband.

930
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:46,225
Could news about Hae-ryun's engagement
to Nam Ga-bin hurt our kids?

931
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,897
The wrong person
can ruin a whole household,

932
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,191
and that's exactly what happened.

933
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,903
How could she stab us
in the back like this?

934
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,738
Unbelievable.

935
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,866
No wonder they say humans are the worst.

936
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:07,330
You're a poor judge of character.
And you call yourself a lawyer?

937
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,874
You just fell for her pretty face.

938
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,835
That can be said for us too.

939
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,796
I was clearly against the marriage.

940
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,006
-I'm sorry.
-What did your boss say?

941
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,508
Didn't he tell you to resign

942
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,803
for tarnishing the firm's reputation?

943
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:25,139
There's no loyalty
among colleagues when in a crisis.

944
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,766
Let's just give it a few days.

945
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,227
How could she when we did
everything she asked for?

946
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,479
She even bought dinner to thank us.

947
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:34,315
She even mentioned Catholicism

948
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:37,694
and said she'll just
accept things as they are.

949
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:42,031
She also said she'd see us
as her parents and not her in-laws.

950
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,367
She even said she'd visit us in Daejeon.

951
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,453
And with a smile on her face!

952
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:50,415
It hasn't even been a month.
It was two days ago!

953
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:55,253
Divorce isn't anything to be proud of,
so why hold a press conference?

954
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:57,839
I get why she announced it,

955
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,507
but how could she

956
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:02,635
make Sa-hyeon look like
the vilest cheater on Earth?

957
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,304
We even hugged when we parted ways

958
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:08,599
-and wished each other the best.
-Why would you?

959
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,977
It was a way of saying goodbye.

960
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,730
You see foreigners do it in movies.

961
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,022
And this is what she does?

962
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:16,899
Just how many faces does she have?

963
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,986
I shouldn't have told her
to visit us when she golfed.

964
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:24,407
She played us.

965
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:28,327
After taking what she needed from us,
she told her story in tears.

966
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,705
Why not say he crippled her heart too?

967
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:34,083
Could it be that she never had one
in the first place?

968
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,501
Just think about it.

969
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,671
How could she do something like this?

970
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:42,633
She may be pretty on the outside,
but how ugly can she be on the inside?

971
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,552
I can't show my face anymore.

972
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:47,096
Everyone I know
wants nothing to do with me now.

973
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,598
What about him then?

974
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:51,309
No firm in Korea
will want to work with him now.

975
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:53,269
He's still young!

976
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,773
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

977
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,860
How is this your fault? It isn't.

978
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:03,863
-Of course not.
-The marriage was cursed, to begin with.

979
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,365
There's even a song about it.

980
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,076
-Right?
-Yes.

981
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,997
You and your poor judge of people.

982
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,667
You should have checked to see
if she was pretty on the inside too.

983
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:17,835
Just like your mom.

984
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:20,463
Don't stress yourself over this.

985
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:22,924
-This is our issue to handle.
-Of course.

986
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,803
Meet your future sister-in-law.

987
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,808
It's nice to see you again
as a future family member.

988
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:32,975
Same here.

989
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,365
I'll be back in just a moment.

990
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:58,209
What's done is done,
so as long as we pull it together--

991
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,170
You should turn it off.

992
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,133
It's Hye-ryung.

993
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:08,302
Answer it.

994
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:16,018
-Yes?
-Father, I'm terribly sorry.

995
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,313
The reporters spun my story their own way.

996
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,315
-Is that so?
-Yes.

997
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:26,863
Those reportersâ¦ Their only concern
is to sensationalize the story.

998
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,156
I regret doing the interview.

999
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,491
Weren't you the one who said it?

1000
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:33,661
As you know, what we say
can be taken in the wrong way.

1001
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:35,663
You parted ways with a smile on your face,

1002
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:37,665
but there you were in tears.

1003
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:40,042
The reporters hounded me with questions

1004
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,795
and that led to a burst of emotions.

1005
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:45,965
I couldn't lie

1006
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:49,343
and the truth would come out anyway
even if I tried to keep it a secret.

1007
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,179
Things might have backfired.

1008
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:56,976
I only stuck to the facts,
but that's how they wrote their articles.

1009
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:59,228
I feel terrible myself.

1010
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:02,648
-About what?
-I've made a big mess of things.

1011
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:05,359
They were going to find out anyway,

1012
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,320
so I wanted to break the news myself.

1013
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:10,072
It's always better
to rip the Band-aid off.

1014
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,241
There was no Band-aid on your arm though.

1015
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:13,951
Only on ours.

1016
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:17,204
The biggest one was on Sa-hyeon.

1017
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:19,290
The whole nation calls him a bastard now.

1018
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:20,458
Is it that bad?

1019
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:23,878
He was doxed thanks to you.
Didn't you know?

1020
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:27,298
I was too upset
to read any of the articles.

1021
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:28,257
Is that so?

1022
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:31,177
Anyway, it'll soon blow over.

1023
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:34,388
-Don't worry too much.
-Is that why you called?

1024
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:36,182
-Yes.
-All right then.

1025
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:39,310
Sure thing. Have a good day, Father.

1026
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:50,029
That conniving snake.

1027
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:51,447
What did she say?

1028
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,783
Mom, what are you up to?

1029
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,162
I know. Things were tense today.

1030
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:01,999
Don't you worry.

1031
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,002
I actually have a better image now
because of it.

1032
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,421
The sympathy votes keep coming in.

1033
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:13,052
Won't you and Dad visit sometime?

1034
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:16,013
My new house is wonderful.

1035
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:19,642
The view of the Han River at night
is amazing.

1036
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:39,495
Goodness. Are you here by yourself?

1037
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:40,997
Yes.

1038
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,417
-Really?
-Have I ever lied to you?

1039
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,920
That's not what I was implying.
Maybe a joke perhaps.

1040
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:52,675
Did you go that day
to see your friend Madam Hong?

1041
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:55,845
-No, so my friends came by my house.
-Do you invite people over?

1042
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:59,015
You seem to enjoy being alone.

1043
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,476
I get that Ms. Boo can't be here,

1044
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,312
but I'm sure Ms. Lee came.

1045
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:08,691
She went to the restroom.

1046
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,996
It'll be past ten when it's over.

1047
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:31,839
Is Ms. Lee still not back?

1048
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,676
Maybe she isn't feeling well.

1049
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:38,888
Will you get her some medicine too?

1050
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:41,432
I came alone.

1051
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,393
Did she already see this show?

1052
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:46,270
You should ask her later.

1053
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:48,564
Thanks for this.

1054
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,610
Do you like this musical?

1055
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,695
Are you a fan of Nam Ga-bin's?

1056
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:57,198
I just thought I should watch it.

1057
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:03,579
I feel bad. I shouldn't have
joked about her being here.

1058
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:08,084
Food shouldn't be wasted,
and also beverages for that matter.

1059
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:09,710
Of course not.

1060
01:08:10,377 --> 01:08:12,213
How can you drink two cups though?

1061
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:30,689
Goodness.

1062
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,781
Isn't that your husband?

1063
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:42,451
It is.

1064
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,210
You better shut your trap

1065
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:34,420
before I pour cold soup over you.

1066
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:35,754
They're my eyes.
I'll do what I like with them.

1067
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,882
-Why youâ¦
-You're going to pour cold soup over me?

1068
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:45,431
It's been so long since I last
saw you laugh out loud like this.

1069
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:48,184
I'll be honest.
I have a thing for Mr. Seo.

1070
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:49,643
You will help me, right?

1071
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:51,520
So you're going to beat me to it?

1072
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:55,191
She's nuts. How could she
put her hands on the elderly?

1073
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:56,483
Why do you always have to fight?

1074
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:58,694
I'm truly grateful
for what you did for me.

1075
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:03,782
I'm over what we went through in the past,
so you don't have to feel sorry.

1076
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,076
Let's get married.

1077
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:09,580
She's seeing that Mr. Seo guy.
I don't know since when though.

1078
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,707
You've played me for a fool.

1079
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:13,292
And yet you blamed me for everything.

1080
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:15,669
-That's ridiculous.
-I'll take care of Ji-a from now on.

1081
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:21,133
