EPISODE 7

2
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,645
PORK BELLY

3
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:21,998
Thank you.

4
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,249
-Thank you.
-Dad…

5
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,881
Thank you.

6
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,388
I'm going to take a walk.

7
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:19,931
Okay.

8
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,611
Your husband isn't in a rut
due to long years of marriage.

9
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,155
He is cheating on you.

10
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,574
Others can't possibly know
about other couples.

11
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,410
It's harder to know
what's happening under your nose.

12
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,430
Shall we go?

13
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,260
Hello?

14
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,429
Where are you? Are you there?

15
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,847
Come inside the park.

16
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,751
Where did you spend the night?

17
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,962
At a friend's house.

18
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,924
Female or male?

19
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,009
Why do you ask?

20
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,515
I saw you at Gangnam Mart yesterday.

21
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,642
Who was the woman in your car?

22
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,022
Did you spend the night at her place?

23
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,861
Dad.

24
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,864
What will you do if Mom finds out?

25
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,951
-She knows.
-She does?

26
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,916
I have no excuse.

27
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,460
I know I don't.

28
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,504
But it can't be helped.

29
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,506
You can't understand love--

30
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,885
How?

31
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,514
How could you, of all people?

32
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,184
This isn't right.

33
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,062
Who is she?

34
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,190
No, I don't need to know.

35
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,484
She's a piece of trash anyway.

36
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,677
Is Dad still asleep?

37
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,888
He spent last night at a friend's.

38
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,515
-Where's Hyang-gi?
-Exercising.

39
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,894
Is this your love for me?

40
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,103
Yes.

41
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,658
I want to eat this again tomorrow.

42
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,535
Sure. Do you like it?

43
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:13,539
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…

44
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,424
Why is your phone off?
I was worried about you.

45
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,887
I thought you were Hyang-gi.

46
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,347
She didn't come home?

47
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,224
She went for a walk.

48
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,850
Have some breakfast.

49
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,023
Hi, Dad. You're home early.

50
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,192
Hey.

51
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,751
I don't think I could ever get sick
of omurice.

52
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,253
I'll make it often then.

53
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,803
You should come eat.

54
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,851
Hyang-gi found out.

55
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,479
About what?

56
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,400
You told her?

57
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,200
Yesterday, I went to Gangnam Mart

58
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,327
to buy some pork belly.

59
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,747
That's when Hyang-gi saw us.

60
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,333
You were grocery shopping with that woman?

61
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,503
No, by myself. She was in the car.

62
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,798
She saw us driving out.

63
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,262
She called earlier in the morning
to ask me to meet her at Banpo Park.

64
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,014
She confronted me.

65
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,476
I told her the truth since she saw us.

66
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,690
She was worried about you,
so I told her that you knew as well.

67
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,949
Was the pork belly delicious?

68
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,212
I'm sure she's fine.
She just doesn't want to see me.

69
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,423
So you want to move out?

70
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,383
No.

71
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:30,927
Oh, dear.

72
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,351
MY DAUGHTER

73
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,770
Aren't you going to eat?

74
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,523
Coming.

75
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,072
Did you guys fight?

76
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,908
No, we were talking about Hyang-gi.

77
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,915
-I'm worried about her.
-Don't be.

78
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,678
Why aren't you eating?

79
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,596
I was waiting for you.

80
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:21,060
Ji-a, there's not a single thing
that you lack.

81
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,228
You're polite and--

82
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:26,023
Grandma, in Korea,
we say "there's not one thing" instead.

83
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,650
That's what we say now.

84
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,026
-"One thing"?
-Yes.

85
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,528
Okay.

86
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,614
I learned something new again
thanks to you.

87
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,326
Why aren't you eating much?

88
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,913
Well, I'll have some more later.

89
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,041
I don't want to gain weight.

90
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,962
It feels like a dream.

91
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,132
That we're here? Or that I slept over?

92
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,925
This moment.

93
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,513
I can't

94
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,810
come here alone for breakfast
looking all lonely.

95
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,354
You're right. You'd be bored too.

96
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,860
Ji-a, you're not a picky eater, are you?

97
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,613
You brought a variety of food.
Even the potatoes.

98
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,115
I love potato wedges.

99
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,957
Have you been to Hanguk World before?

100
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,836
I went twice with your mom and her sister
when they were young.

101
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,505
The place has become even better.
You'd be in awe.

102
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,757
Is that so?

103
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,885
Why don't we go there?

104
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,178
What about shopping?

105
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,180
We can do that afterward.

106
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,478
I'd like to meet your sister one day.

107
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,149
You will see her soon

108
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,194
once I die.

109
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,204
That's a proper continental breakfast.

110
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,915
You and I would do fine living abroad.

111
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,042
That's true.

112
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,797
Pi-young can't go a single day
without kimchi.

113
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,884
Most Koreans are like that.

114
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,929
Look at those twins.

115
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,560
-Dad, is Hanguk World far?
-No.

116
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,604
Gosh. Don't drop your food.

117
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,648
-Focus on eating, okay?
-Okay.

118
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:36,821
Do you remember how you took me
to Hanguk World when I was little?

119
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,657
-I remember.
-I had a blast.

120
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,743
It wasn't that fun
when our kindergarten class went.

121
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,083
Did you ever go there again?

122
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,001
No.

123
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,336
Let's go today.

124
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,924
-Well…
-Let's see how much it has changed.

125
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,677
Let's go.

126
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,681
Let's enjoy other people's company
and forget about everything.

127
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,684
Thank you. Let's go.

128
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,769
Goodness.

129
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,190
-Gosh.
-This is amazing.

130
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,281
Goodness.

131
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,783
They just got dressed up. It's a costume.

132
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,453
-Why don't we do it too?
-I'm good.

133
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,580
There are many pretty ones too, you know?

134
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,747
Really?

135
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,292
Yes. Come on, let's go.

136
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,668
This is it.

137
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,631
They look wonderful.

138
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,467
-Don't they look pretty?
-Yes.

139
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,718
Let's go inside.

140
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,182
Hello, Father.

141
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,516
Are you home?

142
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,227
No, I'm at work for recording.

143
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,645
When will you be done?

144
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,608
I came to Seoul to buy you
some good herbal medicine.

145
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,902
I wanted to see you too.

146
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,612
I don't like herbal medicine.

147
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,656
You should still take them.

148
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,992
Your body needs to stay warm
if you want a baby.

149
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,619
What about in an hour?

150
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,498
No. I'll just take them
when I feel better.

151
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,000
All right, then. Goodbye.

152
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,712
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, Mr. Chairman?

153
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,380
Don't address me like that.

154
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:20,883
How's your condition?

155
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,676
I'm always doing great.

156
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,762
It's all thanks to you.

157
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,348
-Are you doing fine in bed?
-I am.

158
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,684
-How about you?
-I'd give myself a B plus.

159
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,395
I have aged, you know?

160
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,022
I see.

161
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,362
I wonder how the original Dong-mi
is doing.

162
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,738
She hasn't contacted me.

163
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:00,381
Everything has changed.

164
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,924
You're right.

165
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,185
Let's go.

166
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,567
Yes. This is it.

167
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,694
Take your pick.

168
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,036
Can you ride that?

169
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,039
Of course not. But you should.
I'll take photos.

170
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,374
Okay.

171
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,377
They're screaming.
Will you really be okay?

172
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,920
I always sit in the very back.

173
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,513
Ji-a!

174
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:12,119
We definitely click.
We look great together.

175
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,538
I shouldn't laugh.

176
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,540
It's okay.

177
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,877
Oh, dear. This is driving me crazy.

178
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,670
Let's go.

179
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,592
That's terrifying.

180
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:33,015
Goodness. It feels like
it's flying toward me.

181
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,446
Doors opening.

182
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,951
-Hello.
-Hello.

183
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,124
Do you have any pets?

184
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,376
No.

185
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,753
Do you not like furry animals?

186
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:06,340
I do. I just choose not to have one.
I can't.

187
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,883
You must be allergic.

188
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,218
I'd feel sorry

189
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,845
leaving them home all day.

190
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,139
It's not right.

191
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,686
Is Hyang-gi still not home?

192
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,772
Okay.

193
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,655
Hello.

194
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,801
What?

195
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,975
Hello?

196
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,351
Hello, madam.

197
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,980
Don't call me that.
We've known each other for years.

198
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,107
Are you well?

199
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,484
Yes, I am. But…

200
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,403
Did my husband

201
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:13,115
ask you to concoct some herbal medicine?

202
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:14,992
No.

203
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:18,287
He's such a softhearted and nosy man.

204
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,499
He always sends herbal medicine
to people around him if they seem unwell.

205
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,003
I see. That must be why
he's still so successful.

206
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:29,506
Oh, please. Anyway, all right then.

207
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,216
Okay. Goodbye.

208
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,010
Bye.

209
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,647
Goodness. Let's go now.

210
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,025
-We should go shopping.
-Okay.

211
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:51,403
-Did you have fun today?
-Yes. It was terrific.

212
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,948
Thanks to you, I had a blast as well.

213
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,078
Let's take a selfie.

214
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,871
One, two, three.

215
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,714
-Grandma, over there.
-Yes?

216
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,841
-Sure.
-Let's go.

217
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,601
Grandma, she looks terrifying.

218
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:32,111
"My girlfriend's puppy had died.
She was completely heartbroken.

219
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,654
So I gave her mine.

220
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,491
My dog is an intelligent black poodle.

221
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:41,203
-Doesn't her face look pallid?
-Thankfully, my girlfriend got over it.

222
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,331
-She does look unwell.
-We fought over something trivial one day,

223
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,583
refused to reconcile,
and broke up instead."

224
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,168
Goodness.

225
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,754
"How do I get my dog back?

226
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,090
I feel heartless doing so

227
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,717
since she just got over the loss
of her puppy.

228
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,346
But I miss my dog terribly.

229
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,390
Please give me some advice."

230
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,770
Doctor, please share your thoughts.

231
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,939
He must be in a serious dilemma.

232
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,774
Do you have a dog?

233
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,527
Yes, I have two.

234
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,864
What's important is determining

235
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,449
whether his dog is happy living with her.

236
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:23,036
Judging by the story, she seems to be
taking good care of the dog.

237
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,581
So I think it's doing well.

238
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:29,376
While they were still dating,
his dog was probably doing well

239
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,628
-since he'd visit often.
-What would you do?

240
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,549
I should bring the dog back
and get her a new dog.

241
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:39,052
-Dogs can get stressed too.
-Exactly.

242
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:43,098
That's what you should do for the dog.
But in the girlfriend's case,

243
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:47,311
her ex-boyfriend she used to love

244
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,354
is asking for his dog back.

245
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:53,192
That'll only taint all the good memories
they had together.

246
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,862
She'll think, "Is this
what the man I loved is really like?"

247
00:19:56,945 --> 00:20:00,449
It would be impossible
not to think that way.

248
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,160
You're right.

249
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:07,706
In my opinion, you should let her
keep your dog.

250
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:12,336
Also, your ex-girlfriend will think of you

251
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:16,715
every now and then
while taking care of your dog.

252
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,716
Right.

253
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,428
-She may even call you one day.
-That's true.

254
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,804
A breakup is a breakup.

255
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,309
Many couples break up because they refuse
to swallow their pride.

256
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,437
-And refuse to call as well.
-That's right.

257
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,483
She may call him if his dog is sick
or not doing too well.

258
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,859
That could be her excuse.

259
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,029
Exactly. They might be able
to get back together.

260
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,074
I hope we were of help.

Hye-ryung!

00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:14,898
This is CSB Station in Sangam-dong.
This is an emergency. Please hurry.

MS. SA PI-YOUNG

266
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,626
-Hello?
-This is Sa Pi-young.

267
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,421
Hello.

268
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,172
Hye-ryung coughed up blood.

269
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,091
Blood?

270
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,468
Yes, we're waiting for the ambulance.

271
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,013
We'll probably head to Sangam Hospital.

272
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,307
Okay.

EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

274
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,736
What if it's stomach cancer?

275
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,029
It can't be.

276
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,530
Then why would she vomit blood?

277
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,407
Shouldn't we go to your hospital?

278
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,950
Let's wait for the result first.

279
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,372
She's getting a checkup.

280
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,957
She vomited a lot of blood.

281
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,422
I've never been to an amusement park
in Korea.

282
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,631
Seriously?

283
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:22,966
I never got the chance to.

284
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,677
Poor thing. They're really amazing.

285
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,346
Yes, I saw them in dramas.

286
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,057
We should go. Maybe today?

287
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,558
I'd love that.

288
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,602
You've been to Disneyland, right?

289
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,103
Yes.

290
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,356
I prefer the ones here to Disneyland.

291
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,400
Me too.

292
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,027
When did you move to the States?

293
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,195
When I was four.

294
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,946
Did you not visit Korea sometimes?

295
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,157
Once when my grandmother passed away.

296
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,826
-Maternal?
-Yes.

297
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,579
I think of her every now and then.

298
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,757
It doesn't taste non-alcoholic.

299
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:10,972
It is.

300
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,893
When I was young,

301
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:18,563
you'd often take me
to museums and exhibitions.

302
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,941
I thought
they'd help you grow emotionally.

303
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,401
And it was emotionally helpful today too.

304
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,946
It was fun.

305
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,615
It took my mind off things.

306
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:44,840
Not many old women have
a beautiful profile like you.

307
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,387
I know I'm old.
You don't have to remind me of that.

308
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,306
You're just gorgeous
no matter how old you are.

309
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,433
You're the only one who compliments me.

310
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,061
How about me?

311
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,356
I can't pick one since there are
so many things to compliment.

312
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,901
I'll hang in there.

313
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,196
Don't force yourself
to take care of me anymore.

314
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,115
You've done enough.

315
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:13,410
Do you think I'm forcing myself?
That hurts.

316
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,246
Then did you force yourself

317
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,039
to treat me well?

318
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,501
No, it was genuine and natural.

319
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,336
Likewise.

320
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,755
You and I

321
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,592
are bound to take care
of each other forever.

322
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,093
That's our fate.

323
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,221
Do you believe in a past life?

324
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,309
From what I've experienced,
it's hard to say no.

325
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,978
What kind of relationship
do you think we had?

326
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,441
We could've been lovers

327
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,402
or mother and son
who loved each other dearly.

328
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,322
In any case, I think we were close.

329
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,698
That's how I feel.

330
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,996
If Dad didn't have me,

331
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,248
he wouldn't have been
able to rest in peace.

332
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,667
He wouldn't have been able

333
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,336
to leave you behind.

334
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,132
You need to overcome this

335
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,092
and bid him a good farewell.

336
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,973
They say the dead can't leave in peace
if their family is grieving too much.

337
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,898
I'll be okay. Don't worry about me.

338
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,692
Stop saying that.

339
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,371
To be honest,

340
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:42,374
I was a bit hungry in Chuncheon,
but I held back.

341
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,458
Why?

342
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,627
You would've been drowsy

343
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,796
driving on a full stomach.

344
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,924
Don't be absurd.
I intentionally took us that far.

345
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,596
You would've been drowsy

346
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,350
if you filled your stomach
with carbs such as buckwheat noodles.

347
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:04,187
Don't worry about me.
Let me worry about you instead.

348
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,150
Answer me.

349
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,361
Fine.

350
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,369
If Hyang-gi comes home,

351
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,707
call me right away, U-ram. Okay.

352
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,296
Did Hyang-gi leave home?

353
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,301
My husband…

354
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,931
was seeing someone.

355
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,936
And Hyang-gi found out,
so she won't come home.

356
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,192
So that was why?

357
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,361
Yes, that was the reason.

358
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,656
Hye-ryung was right.

359
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,909
I found out on Saturday night.

360
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,954
The kids were having a sleepover.

361
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,041
He came home drunk and came clean.

362
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,085
I lived my life in vain, haven't I?

363
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,212
I can't believe it.

364
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,883
I can't fathom
how you're feeling right now.

365
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,093
I just gave up and accepted everything.

366
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,346
Yes, but you must've felt so betrayed--

367
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,805
Hyang-gi

368
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,018
loved and respected her dad the most.

369
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,813
I'm sorry to ask this.

370
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,524
But who has he fallen head over heels for?

371
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,068
What kind of woman is she?

372
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,569
Who cares?

373
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,780
Knowing that won't change anything.

374
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,535
MY LOVELY SON

375
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,414
-Did she come home?
-Yes, just now.

376
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,459
Put her on the phone.

377
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,629
No. I'll go home right now.

378
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,713
Okay.

379
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:00,470
Where have you been all day?
Mom was worried sick.

380
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,222
What if…

381
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:06,309
Let's say Dad made a huge mistake.

382
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,937
What would you do?

383
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,063
What do you mean?

384
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,315
Would you still love him?

385
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,567
No, could you?

386
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,528
Mom used to tell us

387
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,280
that everyone makes mistakes.

388
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,698
What if it's a big one?

389
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,286
I'm sure you've read news articles

390
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,080
and seen dramas about it.

391
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,790
Dad…

392
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,335
is seeing another woman.

393
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,005
You know what it means, right?

394
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,094
Will you still love him?

395
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,596
I'm not sure.

396
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,683
So there is a possibility.

397
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,728
-What about you?
-I want to hear your opinion first.

398
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,231
I'm not sure. Does Mom know?

399
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:59,571
But she seemed completely fine.

400
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,365
It's because of us.

401
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,910
She hid her feelings for our sake.

402
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,371
She didn't want to hurt us.

403
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,543
Imagine how much pain she's in.

404
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:18,089
If that's true, I feel terrible for her…

405
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,301
I can't believe it.

406
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,595
I wouldn't have either
had I not witnessed it.

407
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,558
Let me ask him myself.

408
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,809
Brace yourself first.

409
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,147
-What if he admits to it?
-What about you?

410
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,275
I don't want to live with him anymore.

411
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:40,653
Since Mom's married to him,
she may want to turn a blind eye.

412
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,573
You can't live apart from him, right?

413
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,617
Right.

414
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:49,954
A family shouldn't deceive one another.

415
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:54,042
They should love
and be honest with each other.

416
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,922
He may repent.

417
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,175
Then we should forgive him.

418
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,676
Don't get your hopes up.

419
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,555
You may be able to forgive him,
but I can't.

420
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,391
I think Mom's opinion matters more

421
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,769
than ours.

422
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,397
Let's hear Dad out later. But…

423
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,026
In any case,
I hope you won't get hurt too much,

424
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,278
although it may be inevitable.

425
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,490
Don't worry too much.

426
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,641
She has an acute duodenal ulcer.
Was she very stressed lately?

427
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,646
Yes, a bit.

428
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,275
Stress is the main cause.

429
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,610
Is her job strenuous?

430
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:06,281
Don't read the hate comments.

431
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,074
I saw quite a bit of them.

432
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,203
There will be a vacant room soon.

433
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,205
How long will she be hospitalized?

434
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,141
We don't cover our patients' faces.

435
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,448
Where's U-ram?

436
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,450
At Gi-ppeum's.

437
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,037
So you know that he's having an affair?

438
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,415
He came clean on Saturday.

439
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,000
What time?

440
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,085
During the sleepover?

441
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:09,218
-How did you feel?
-I'm not sure.

442
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,805
I hid my feelings because of the kids.

443
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,891
How could he do such a thing?

444
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,227
Him of all people?

445
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,605
Because of you two,

446
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,649
I told him I won't divorce him.

447
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,318
But I'll let him do whatever he wants

448
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,987
and allow him to spend the night out.

449
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,572
Don't worry about us.

450
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,282
How could I not?

451
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,118
Remember what you guys said last time?

452
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,411
This is totally different.

453
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,831
We can overcome any hardship
if we stay levelheaded.

454
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,793
Let's do that.

455
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,253
Okay.

456
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,506
I know you two can get divorced for good,

457
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,009
but I'm your daughter. I'm a part of you.

458
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,595
I want to hear your honest thoughts.

459
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,556
Do you want him to stay?

460
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,062
Me neither.

461
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,357
I know you're devastated,
but you and I are different.

462
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,277
It's possible for me
to never see him again.

463
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,698
But he is your dad.

464
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:15,660
But he doesn't seem to care about us.

465
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,786
That's not true.

466
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,038
I don't think you know him that well.

467
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,790
They say

468
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,793
you never know
what someone's true feelings are.

469
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:24,836
This is exactly that.

470
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,588
How could he

471
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:31,300
deceive all of us all this time?

472
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,760
I'm sorry.

473
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,679
Why would you be sorry?

474
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,348
I feel like this is all my fault.

475
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,434
Don't be ridiculous.

476
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,102
If that's the case,

477
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,229
what about all the other moms?

478
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,939
It's true I neglected him

479
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,151
because I was too busy with work.

480
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,736
Is that what he said?

481
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,863
That he cheated because of that?

482
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,282
No. I'm just saying I could be to blame.

483
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,284
He's the one to blame then.

484
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,746
He should be forever grateful
for everything you've done.

485
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,581
How dare he betray you?

486
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:04,208
I guess not everyone thinks the same way.

487
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,754
At times, you can't even control
your own feelings.

488
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,423
Don't defend him

489
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:13,176
or bottle up your emotions.
They'll eat away at you.

490
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,679
Curse him if you want. He deserves it.

491
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,514
I'm fine.

492
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,601
As long as you and U-ram are okay,

493
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,145
I'll be thankful for that.

494
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,731
Life is full of twists and turns.

495
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,318
Anyway,

496
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:34,072
if you don't want him to stay,

497
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,239
tell him to leave.

498
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,784
What about you two? U-ram is still a kid.

499
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,202
He'll hit puberty soon.

500
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:42,080
I told him, and he couldn't believe it.

501
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,249
I understand him.
He wants to hear him out himself.

502
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,085
Why did you tell him?

503
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,003
He has the right to know about this.

504
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,465
And I can't pretend nothing's happened
like you.

505
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,634
We were deceived all along.

506
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,140
I know you've endured it for us,

507
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,977
but I think this is better
than any of us falling ill.

508
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,020
You're right.

509
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,651
Like you said, this kind of thing
can always happen in life.

510
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,861
U-ram

511
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,156
is more thoughtful than you think.

512
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,869
He'll be okay since you and I
will be by his side.

513
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,421
You're all grown up now,
my sweet daughter.

514
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,221
You and U-ram are all I need.

515
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,890
We feel the same way.

516
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,438
Dad.

517
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,317
I didn't know you were home.

518
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,278
I just came home.

519
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,821
What is all that?

520
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,073
She bought it for me.

521
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,200
Have a seat, please.

522
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,418
Would you like something?
We probably have some fruit.

523
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,462
It's the holidays, so the helper isn't in.

524
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,131
I'm still full.

525
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,758
She eats little to maintain her figure.

526
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,512
You must've spent a lot today.

527
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,638
Not at all.

528
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,725
-We went to Hanguk World too.
-Hanguk World?

529
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,561
I was there with your grandma as well.

530
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:31,564
Seriously? I should've called you then.

531
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,275
I know. I had no idea you'd be there.

532
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,359
Me neither.

533
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,323
That's a beautiful dress.

534
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,283
You'll finally look like a princess.

535
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,827
I can't wear this to school.
I'll stand out too much.

536
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,246
Maybe for family gatherings or parties.

537
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:52,376
Let's have dinner.
There's a good restaurant nearby.

538
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,171
I'm still full.

539
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,590
Stay longer, Grandma.

540
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:01,510
I should go home and rest.
I've been walking around all day.

541
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,554
Did you do your homework?

542
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,433
-Let me drop you off.
-No.

543
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,061
Don't leave Ji-a home alone.

544
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,314
Then I'll call a cab for you.

545
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,170
Thank you.

546
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,215
I had a great day with Ji-a today.

547
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,972
-Yu-sin called a cab for me.
-You should go.

548
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,433
Can we talk for a moment?

549
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,644
I can wait.

550
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,817
I offered to drive her home,
but she turned it down.

551
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,193
She lives nearby anyway.

552
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,614
You're home early.

553
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,034
Hye-ryung vomited blood today.

554
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,078
It must've been an acute ulcer.

555
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,246
Mom.

556
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,584
Gosh, how pretty.

557
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,546
Ta-da.

558
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,090
Your mom must've spent a lot of money.

559
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,384
Did you shop around all day?

560
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,679
We also went to Hanguk World.
Dad was there as well,

561
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,139
but we never crossed paths.

562
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,600
-With your mother?
-Yes.

563
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,271
That's a bit weird.

564
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,481
We just went to reminisce.

565
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,487
It's pretty.

566
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,202
You should've told me

567
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,913
if you had blood in your stool.

568
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:53,974
When did you come home?

569
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,657
-Did you have dinner at Gi-ppeum's?
-Yes.

570
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,540
Say what you need to say.

571
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,169
First,

572
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,214
I'd like to tell all of you

573
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,467
that I'm sorry and have no excuse.

574
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,345
I don't know how much U-ram knows.

575
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,638
Almost everything.

576
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,306
You must be disappointed.

577
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:40,438
In any case,
it's true I'm seeing another woman.

578
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,650
But everyone is bound to part ways
one way or another,

579
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,026
like when they die.

580
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,987
As for us,

581
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,658
we'll only be physically apart.

582
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,327
But you'll still love us?

583
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,415
A parent's love for their children
never changes.

584
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,250
You'll know once you become a mom.

585
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,210
But your love for Mom changed.

586
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:11,218
You're making her look pitiful
in front of her own kids.

587
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,137
-Hyang-gi.
-So?

588
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,097
I can see you'll be moving out.

589
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,724
What about a divorce?

590
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,268
Tell us.

591
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:22,730
I caught you grocery shopping
with your mistress,

592
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,857
so what's there to hide now?

593
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,193
Your mom and I should end it.

594
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,447
So you're getting a divorce?

595
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:33,824
With mom?

596
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,911
Answer him.

597
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,456
Yes.

598
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,999
Why?

599
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,836
What did she do so wrong?

600
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,297
She did nothing wrong.

601
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,549
It's just that I'm inadequate.

602
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,677
Please choose your words carefully.

603
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,554
This isn't about inadequacy.

604
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,682
Being inadequate means you lack skills

605
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,267
or competence.

606
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,771
But this is about you having an affair.

607
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,607
-Hyang-gi.
-I'm right.

608
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,693
Are you seriously defending him right now?

609
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,738
After what we found out
and what I witnessed?

610
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,616
Yes. You're right.

611
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,495
To put it elegantly,
you have poor character.

612
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:22,039
You always made sure
we had good characters.

613
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,667
"You should have good character.

614
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,002
Don't inconvenience others.

615
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,463
Be honest and upright."

616
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,343
Go on.

617
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,847
If you want to pack your bags
and leave right now, be my guest.

618
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,102
Is some random woman

619
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,646
more important to you

620
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,774
than us?

621
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,327
That happened to be the case.

622
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,456
Why?

623
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,126
I had never planned for this to happen.

624
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:10,004
But I couldn't help it.

625
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:11,839
I'm sorry.

626
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,095
You can resent me all you want.
I deserve it.

627
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,471
Resentment is only

628
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,640
for those who have expectations.

629
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:26,937
But I have absolutely no expectations
for you now.

630
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,317
Your happiness is just around the corner.

631
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,027
Don't you worry.

632
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,196
We'll take good care of Mom without you

633
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,034
until the day she dies,
so you can leave now.

634
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,468
Are you happy now?

635
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:03,098
I'm just curious how elated you are
to fall in love with a new woman.

636
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,231
You shouldn't do this to Mom.

637
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,734
You of all people

638
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,904
can't do this to her.

639
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,783
You became a professor thanks to her.

640
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:24,536
You told us that she'd paid
your tuition many times.

641
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,622
She supported you when you studied abroad.

642
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:29,958
She even worked part-time while in college
to support you.

643
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,921
Her family turned their backs on her
because of you.

644
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:37,091
She finally saw her mom again
when I had turned three.

645
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:42,137
She chose you over her family
knowing that she'd be ousted.

646
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:46,475
Look at what's become
of a wealthy family's daughter

647
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,477
who used to lead a comfortable life.

648
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,356
She has sacrificed her fingers and wrists.

649
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:57,277
Like a mother dog who has given
all her milk to her puppies.

650
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,863
Am I wrong?

651
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,908
There's no vitality or youth left in her.

652
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:06,453
She's an exhausted woman in her 40s.

653
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,372
That's all that she is.

654
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,999
Is that why you don't love her anymore?

655
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:16,296
You're pretty much telling her
that you no longer see her as a woman.

656
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,133
Even so,

657
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,219
she's been through so much

658
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,179
because of us.

659
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,808
How could you be so ungrateful
and abandon her?

660
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,312
Does that woman make you that happy?

661
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,773
-That's not it.
-Then what is it?

662
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:38,193
I won't deny it.
Everything you said is true.

663
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:42,322
I know that I'm a despicable man.

664
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,323
No.

665
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,909
You still don't get it.

666
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:51,999
You don't mean any of it.
You're not truly sorry.

667
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:56,003
Did that piece of trash demand
that you divorce Mom?

668
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,088
Don't call her like that.

669
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,381
Let me correct myself.

670
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,967
Did that despicable woman
tenaciously refuse

671
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,721
to remain your mistress?
Does she want to be your legal wife?

672
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:11,518
Hyang-gi, that's enough.
U-ram needs to go to bed.

673
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,854
He's not a baby.
How can he sleep right now?

674
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:20,360
Last time, we took your word for it
so naively

675
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,904
and begged you not to leave.

676
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,364
But now, we don't want you here.

677
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:26,867
Right?

678
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:32,456
I feel the same way.

679
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:36,668
Why don't you hand in
the divorce papers tomorrow?

680
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,879
There's no need to stall it.

681
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,839
Wash up and go to bed, U-ram.

682
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,843
We're done talking here.
You should go to bed as well.

683
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,512
Have you ever

684
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,431
gone grocery shopping for us?

685
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,058
You never have.

686
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,645
But that day
when you were getting into your car,

687
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,440
you looked so lively.

688
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:04,655
She has prepared countless meals for you

689
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,782
her entire life.

690
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,242
And yet,

691
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,245
you've never done the same for her.

692
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,164
Imagine being in her shoes.

693
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,792
How would you feel if you were her?

694
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,296
I'm so confused.

695
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,176
After all that you've taught us,

696
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,013
how could you do this to us?

697
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,474
Which one is your true face?

698
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,978
Which character should we learn from?

699
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,355
I really have nothing to say.

700
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:41,066
While talking about drugs
and gambling last time,

701
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:44,027
you told us never to go down
the wrong path.

702
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,072
Then did you think

703
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,616
having an affair was right?

704
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,329
Hyang-gi, I'm sure he understands
how you're feeling right now.

705
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:57,541
Do you?

706
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,335
Do you feel how I feel?

707
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,049
Then despite everything,

708
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,513
are you willing to change your mind?

709
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,354
I thought you understood me.

710
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,358
I saw my dad, who I respected and loved,

711
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:26,778
getting in a car with some other woman
with my own eyes.

712
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,156
Mom got that car for you

713
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,366
on your birthday
with the money she saved up

714
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,869
while she worked her butt off!

715
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,126
You don't understand.

716
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,129
If you did,

717
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,840
you wouldn't have done this.

718
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,429
I do have one question.

719
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,266
Is she a divorcée or a bachelorette?

720
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,394
The latter.

721
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,981
Then you can have kids with her.

722
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,400
I hope you live a happy life.

723
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,445
I have no desire to get married anymore.

724
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:09,696
How could I trust men?

725
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,782
We can't guarantee anything.

726
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,618
It might sound like an excuse,

727
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,496
but I didn't see this coming at all.

728
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,289
I don't know about U-ram,

729
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,000
but I'll never forget this.

730
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,252
Me neither.

731
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:28,632
You taught us that hard work always
pays off. But you should've taught us

732
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:33,679
that you may be betrayed
instead of being rewarded with gratitude.

733
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,889
If you did,

734
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,850
U-ram and I…

735
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:43,480
wouldn't be in this much pain now.

736
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:48,318
I really have no excuse.

737
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,529
However,

738
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:54,449
I will fulfill my duties as your dad.

739
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,617
Do you mean money?

740
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:00,372
Forget it.
We'll manage with what Mom makes.

741
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,416
I'll work part-time as well.

742
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,627
What do you say?

743
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,006
You should focus on your studies.

744
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,092
You won't earn much from a part-time job.

745
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,719
I don't want any money from you.

746
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,974
I have no desire to receive money
from my dad who has abandoned his family.

747
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,436
I don't need to go to the academy.

748
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,690
Must you

749
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,068
go this far?

750
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,112
That's what I want to ask you.

751
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,450
You broke Mom's heart twice.

752
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:39,077
And I'm brokenhearted as your child.

753
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,124
Any last words?

754
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,086
I'm not necessarily saying this to him.

755
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,549
I finally know how it feels

756
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,720
to be heartbroken.

757
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:06,331
Hang in there. You have Mom and me.

758
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,124
You too.

759
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:09,960
I'm a man.

760
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:14,548
Once I grow up, I'll take care of you two.

761
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:21,972
Can I ask for a favor?

762
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:27,269
Let's not break her heart no matter what.

763
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,522
If we make life difficult for her too,

764
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:32,983
her life will be meaningless.

765
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,443
It'll be unbearable for her.

766
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,515
Let's be honest.

767
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,936
You should also get the chance
to meet other men.

768
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:54,689
Shut up. Don't you dare pretend
to care for me.

769
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,399
It's only human.

770
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,444
You've worked with countless producers
until now.

771
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,197
Were you never interested in anyone?

772
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,326
You've all made me out to be the bad guy.

773
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,246
Fine. I am.

774
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:13,792
But can't you at least try
to be in my shoes to understand me?

775
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,045
-Try?
-I've made one mistake

776
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:20,173
in my lifetime. And yet, did you see
how I was reviled by Hyang-gi?

777
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:24,302
What about all the hard work I've done
until now as their dad?

778
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:29,724
Everyone makes mistakes.
I've also worked hard for our family.

779
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:34,646
Apart from this mistake,
I've lived a righteous, ethical life.

780
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,064
And this wasn't on purpose.

781
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,657
Pack up quietly and leave.

782
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,493
We'll meet in a day or two
and submit the papers.

783
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,328
As if I'm being kicked out?

784
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:51,663
You are.

785
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,917
You're actually happy, aren't you?
Since we're not being clingy?

786
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,836
I'm grateful.

787
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,380
But we could part ways better.

788
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,923
By wishing each other good luck?

789
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:03,967
By praying for each other?

790
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,345
Was what Hyang-gi did not enough?

791
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,556
What better goodbye could there be?

792
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,560
Did she say something she shouldn't?
Did she curse you?

793
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,854
She did something worse
that broke my heart.

794
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:19,274
Do you want Hyang-gi to apologize?

795
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:22,694
"Console your dad's broken heart"?

796
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,531
Don't you care
about the kids' broken hearts?

797
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,908
You're the one who caused all this.

798
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,744
They're innocent.

799
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:35,415
Why do our good kids have to be
abandoned and heartbroken?

800
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,339
They may seem
completely fine and rational today,

801
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:47,385
but the aftereffect will be worse
than that of an accident.

802
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:50,305
And there's no medicine for broken hearts.

803
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,100
Am I the only one to blame here?

804
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,227
All men are the same.

805
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,812
Don't you watch the news?

806
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,814
Is that all you can see?

807
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:02,484
Does the news only cover
such nasty stories?

808
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:05,487
What about those articles
about upright husbands?

809
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,322
That may not be their whole story.

810
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,699
People may seem upright.

811
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,869
But they're like the two sides of a coin,
the sun and the moon,

812
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:16,623
and black and white.
Everyone has two faces.

813
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,792
Don't justify your actions like that.

814
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,920
Have I ever let you go hungry
or frittered my salary away?

815
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,671
Did I assault our kids or you?

816
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,882
This is the only thing I did wrong.

817
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:27,759
Do you really think so?

818
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:30,595
It's just one mistake?

819
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,973
Did you sleep with her just once?

820
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,059
And then ask for a divorce?

821
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,524
Respectable Professor Park,

822
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,360
please pack your belongings.

823
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,945
Don't be sarcastic.

824
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:49,364
You're upset
because your kids blamed you a little?

825
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,033
Imagine how they must feel.

826
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:56,746
Their dad chose some other woman
over them.

827
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:01,584
Hyang-gi

828
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:05,797
neither raised her voice
nor glared at you.

829
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,884
You should at least have
an ounce of conscience.

830
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,945
Guys, come on out.

831
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:23,791
You too, U-ram.

832
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:28,963
What is it?

833
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,466
Sit down.

834
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:40,099
If I were you,
I would've felt just as betrayed.

835
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:44,771
Hyang-gi, everything you said to me
was right.

836
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:48,900
But could you at least try
to understand me?

837
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:53,112
It's been 31 years
since your mom and I first met.

838
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:56,533
I was her first man,

839
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,535
and vice versa.

840
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,455
Forget about the statistics.

841
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,875
How is it possible to be in love
with the same person forever?

842
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:10,129
It's almost impossible.

843
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:14,968
The only problem we had
was that we met too soon.

844
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:19,389
Had we dated other people
before getting married,

845
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,850
this wouldn't have occurred.

846
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,395
Am I wrong?

847
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:31,776
I truly believed that I'd love your mom
forever, and I've strived to do so.

848
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,697
Unprecedented situations happen.

849
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,073
That's what this is.

850
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,535
My heart was stolen just the same way
your mom had stolen it.

851
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,079
I was helpless.

852
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,039
I admit.

853
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,750
I couldn't think straight.

854
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:52,171
I'm just an ordinary man before being
a father, a husband, or a professor.

855
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,966
There are things I can't control.

856
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,885
After all, I'm not God.

857
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,764
Is that so wrong of me?

858
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:05,977
You may not have cursed at me,

859
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,605
but your words ripped my heart.

860
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:10,773
If I were to exaggerate,

861
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:14,068
I felt so mortified
that I wanted to jump off the balcony.

862
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,778
Are you threatening us?

863
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,864
I'm just being honest.

864
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,407
Then I should console you.

865
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:23,119
I apologize for burdening your heart
before you leave.

866
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,913
I didn't mean to.

867
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,666
I wanted to be rational,

868
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,835
but my tongue refused.

869
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,505
Answer this one question.

870
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,009
Would you be able to love one man forever?

871
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:39,677
Why not?

872
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,723
Mother Teresa loved God and Him only
her entire life.

873
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:47,101
And there are countless devoted couples
as well.

874
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:50,813
There was even a documentary
about an old couple. You know about it.

875
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:53,858
But they're not common.

876
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,986
There are people like them
and others like me.

877
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,655
Then there are worse ones too.

878
01:00:58,738 --> 01:00:59,989
So please understand me.

879
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:02,116
Must we do that while being abandoned?

880
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,661
Thanks to Mom's sacrifice…

881
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,164
No, I won't use that word.

882
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,833
Thanks to her devotion

883
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:13,795
and support,

884
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:17,340
you were able to study abroad
and become a professor as you wished.

885
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,550
With that fancy title,
you met a new woman.

886
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,387
And we let you go
without begging you to stay.

887
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,640
And yet, you're not satisfied?

888
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,185
You want to be at peace too?

889
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:30,520
Isn't that too selfish?

890
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:32,772
I'm just asking you to think in my shoes.

891
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,733
I want you guys, of all people,
to understand me.

892
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,322
It breaks my heart to think
that you despise me.

893
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:43,491
You don't always get
what you want in life.

894
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:48,037
Mom was the only person
who catered to you at all times.

895
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,581
And there's no one like her.

896
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,584
You won't be happy forever.

897
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:58,172
Mom was your lottery ticket.

898
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:02,427
That's enough. It's all over now.

899
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,560
"For everything you gain,
you lose something."

900
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,187
For the new love you just found,

901
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,481
you lost our respect. That's all.

902
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:19,193
A divorce doesn't sever ties
with one's kids in other countries.

903
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,864
Things may end for your mom and me,

904
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,908
but must you sever ties with me?

905
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,077
We might as well become strangers.

906
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:31,164
A complete stranger
doesn't stab you in the back.

907
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,710
As your children,

908
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,880
we greatly respected and loved you.

909
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:42,467
Did any of us let you down?

910
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:45,678
Was it us

911
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,556
who betrayed you?

912
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:52,602
Mom woke up early in the morning
every single day

913
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:53,895
to pack your lunch.

914
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,440
You had it every day,
but you still cheated on her.

915
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:01,402
You should try for yourself
and see how exhausting it is.

916
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:04,614
U-Ram and I made gimbap last year
and became dog-tired.

917
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:09,827
Mom's life has been a waste.

918
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:12,330
She wasted decades in vain.

919
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,043
It wasn't in vain.

920
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:20,213
You two grew up so well.
That's meaningful enough.

921
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:28,179
It's over between us. We get it.
So just stop this.

922
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:29,847
Stop pestering them.

923
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:34,143
Explaining yourself repeatedly
won't justify what you did.

924
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,834
Can you blame the lightning
when there's a rainstorm?

925
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:01,754
In life, you go through
countless ups and downs.

926
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:04,799
A married couple could get a divorce.

927
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:09,136
I'm just another human being.
What did I do so wrong?

928
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:20,815
How could you all bash me like this
for a single mistake I've made?

929
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:35,454
I was born to a poor family.

930
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:39,792
Unlike me, my father was irresponsible.

931
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:44,672
I know how well you've treated me.

932
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,801
You are a perfect wife

933
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:51,095
and a wonderful mother.

934
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,890
I'm nowhere on par with you.

935
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,101
I'm sorry.

936
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,229
But I'm just not good enough.

937
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:02,940
That's my limit,

938
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:06,319
and there's nothing I can do about it.

939
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:11,532
Just slap me instead.

940
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:13,242
Must I feel guilty forever?

941
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,411
You reap what you sow.

942
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:17,914
Must I repeat myself?

943
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,957
For everything you gain,
you lose something.

944
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:25,963
Ask anyone on the streets

945
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:30,509
if it's possible for a man
to love one woman forever.

946
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:33,763
It's not like I'm Jesus Christ.

947
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:36,182
I'm no Buddha either!

948
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:16,889
I saw your husband and your mother-in-law.

949
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,308
They seemed too close
and were having a good time.

950
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:20,351
How's Ms. Boo doing?

951
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:23,270
Would you like to come with me?
Shouldn't you visit her?

952
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:24,855
Take us to the woman.

953
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,524
-Where is she?
-Dad!

954
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:29,151
I'll have us drive around all night
until I meet her.

955
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,778
Ending it with her is your only option.

956
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:34,407
This is where
my journey with your father ends.

957
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,701
Be nice to your dad when you see him.

958
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,494
I don't think I can for a while.

959
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:40,746
-I'm going to Jeju Island.
-Is it for a family event?

960
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,248
-Come with me.
-We should go.

961
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:43,541
What time is his flight?

962
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:46,502
He'll board soon. It's the 3 p.m. flight.

963
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:48,087
If I'm being completely honest,

964
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:52,133
I married your father because I wanted
to take care of you myself.

965
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:09,525
