00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:00,477
EPISODE 6

2
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,105
Dr. Shin is here, ma'am.

3
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,024
I see.

4
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,541
-Is she in bed?
-No.

5
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,418
In the bathroom.

6
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,620
What are you doing?

7
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:02,997
Are you washing up?

8
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,045
I'm coming in.

9
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,427
I'm here.

10
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,602
Wake up. What's wrong?

11
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,360
Is your head spinning?
Did you just pass out?

12
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,695
I don't know.

13
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,699
I can't even lift a finger.

14
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:45,290
Just give me five more minutes.

15
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,419
Have you had lunch?

16
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:50,879
Some scorched rice.

17
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,298
That's not enough.
You should have had some meat.

18
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,718
At this time of the day,

19
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,765
your father and I used to listen to music

20
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,852
while drinking tea.

21
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,061
Let's do that.

22
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,126
Do you remember

23
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,713
how you bathed me as a kid?

24
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,715
Of course.

25
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,634
I hated the nanny's touch,

26
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,596
but I didn't mind it
when you helped me shower.

27
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,723
One day,

28
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:48,311
I saw how dirty
the back of your neck and ears were

29
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,897
because you hadn't washed them properly.

30
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,901
I was seven years old after all.

31
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:00,198
To be honest, it did embarrass me a bit.

32
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,785
Still, I liked it. Your hands were soft.

33
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,955
My mom usually had my nanny wash me

34
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,415
and rarely washed me herself.

35
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:14,045
But even when she did,
she'd smack me for fidgeting.

36
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,256
You didn't deserve to be smacked.

37
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,008
That little boy grew up

38
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,219
and is now aging.

39
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,223
And I'm now someone's grandmother.

40
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,933
That's only by name.

41
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:31,229
Technically, I should call you Mom too.

42
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,605
But I've never done that.

43
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,654
Why not?

44
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:40,989
No reason.

45
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,033
You're more like a sister
than a mom to me.

46
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,953
A young mom?

47
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,248
I considered you as a sister first.

48
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,209
How can I suddenly refer to you as my mom?

49
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,170
Even Dad understood.

50
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,383
You grew up to be such a fine man.

51
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,177
Both mentally

52
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,179
and physically.

53
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,347
All thanks to you.

54
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,019
I can't forget your love and sacrifice.

55
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,687
I won't.

56
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,317
What sacrifice?

57
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,528
Don't force yourself to be good to me.

58
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,654
I'm forcing myself?

59
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,407
That's upsetting to hear.

60
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,076
Did you force yourself to be good to me?

61
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,330
My life was full of joy thanks to you.

62
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,540
It was worthwhile.

63
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:33,916
Exactly.

64
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,127
And so was mine.

65
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,641
The water's cold.

66
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,319
It's too late to go to the oriental doctor
and I'm tired.

67
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,989
Give me the number.
I'll go by myself tomorrow.

68
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,158
Don't go there on your own.

69
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,205
Excuse me.

70
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,166
Get out.

71
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,043
Yes?

72
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,096
The chairman of Signal Country
sent over some medicine.

73
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,430
Medicine?

74
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,974
Herbal medicine.
His assistant dropped it off.

75
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,976
-Did the assistant leave?
-Yes.

76
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,105
What medicine is it?

77
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,608
Your tea got cold,
so I reheated the water.

78
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,651
Thanks.

79
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:50,535
A noted doctor I know
made this with the best ingredients.

80
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:56,541
I know how devastated you must be,
but I hope it will pick you back up.

81
00:06:56,624 --> 00:07:00,211
I wish you would come by
to play golf with me.

82
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:04,090
Anyway, call me if you need anything.

83
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,968
I'm here for you as a friend.

84
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,720
I see you still have feelings for me.

85
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,431
Do I seem easy now that I'm a widow?

86
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,189
Not all widows are alike, though.

87
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,750
I'll buy dinner today
to thank you for last time.

88
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,545
-Maybe next time.
-Do you have other plans?

89
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,088
Yes.

90
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,852
I was going to take you here.

91
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,063
-Really?
-Take this first andâ€¦

92
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,525
Never mind. I should give him a call.

93
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,240
-Hello?
-Hello, Doctor.

94
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,201
Yes, hello.

95
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,411
Didn't you say
you were moving to a new clinic?

96
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:17,872
Right.

97
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,751
Anyway, I called to ask
about Chairman Pan Mun-ho.

98
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,420
Yes, of Signal Country.

99
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,340
He sent us herbal medicine
from your clinic.

100
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,467
So that's where he sent it.

101
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,551
That's right.

102
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,888
I wasn't sure if it's safe to take

103
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,349
since she wasn't examined.

104
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,602
Oh, I see.

105
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,271
Right.

106
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,610
Actually, I was thinking about
visiting your clinic with my mother too.

107
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,195
If you're worried,

108
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,572
get her constitution checked
before she takes it.

109
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,783
The tonic is fit for anyone though.

110
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,245
Sure. Anytime.

111
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,289
So how are things?

112
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,086
Really?

113
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,256
I didn't know.

114
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,926
Wasn't there an obituary?

115
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,180
Don't stop me from drinking today.

116
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,598
I'm stressed out.

117
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,892
They say that day drinking
makes you a dog.

118
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,562
It's early in the evening
and way past noon.

119
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,860
I'm good.

120
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,112
Have a sip.

121
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,947
She's right. Have a sip.

122
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,408
People drink wine even during Mass.

123
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,836
To your hard work.
A death in the family is no joke.

124
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,588
Especially when it's sudden.

125
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,841
It's good.

126
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,968
I hardly know my wine,
but I know what's good.

127
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,846
-That's all there is to it.
-Did you study wine?

128
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,890
My first boyfriend imported wine.
I learned a bit then.

129
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,185
-How old were you?
-I was a sophomore in university.

130
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,022
Marrying your first love
makes you miss out on many things.

131
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,565
You were right not to marry him.

132
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:12,069
I tell my daughter to date
at least five men before getting married.

133
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,573
Your first love being your last?

134
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,951
I say from experience
that it's not worth it.

135
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,832
I was quite naive.

136
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,375
No, you were innocent.

137
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,754
Wives as devoted and innocent as you
are a rare species now.

138
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,263
My husband loves gnocchi, you know.

139
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,854
Going down.

140
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,030
Ms. Lee.

141
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,492
How long did it take
for you to fall into a rut?

142
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,244
I was too busy to notice
that it was happening.

143
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,414
Does your heart still skip a beat
at the sight of your husband?

144
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,707
Of course not.

145
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,919
-And you, Ms. Sa?
-I do still find him sexy at times.

146
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,087
When exactly?

147
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,508
He looks great from behind.

148
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,426
I'm so jealous.

149
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,804
But you're still in your honeymoon phase.

150
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,931
Ms. Lee, Ms. Sa,

151
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:26,852
what do you think of me
from an objective standpoint?

152
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,980
Am I attractive or not?

153
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,025
-Be honest.
-Very charming.

154
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,486
You have a stunning face,
a phenomenal body,

155
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,822
a sweet career as a DJ,
a big fat paycheck,

156
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,366
and a lawyer husband
who's younger than you.

157
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,409
You have everything.

158
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,327
I wouldn't say it was a country,

159
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,579
but you must have saved the capital,

160
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,707
and Hye-ryung must have saved
a metropolitan city.

161
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,251
What about you?

162
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,461
-Me?
-You have a daughter and a son.

163
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,298
You can count on U-ram,
since he's mature for his age.

164
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,341
You knowâ€¦

165
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,094
You see, Ms. Lee,

166
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:03,556
your husband isn't in a rut
due to long years of marriage.

167
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,141
He is cheating on you.

168
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,897
Others can't possibly know
about other couples.

169
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,109
It's harder to know
what's happening under your nose.

170
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,156
I guess I can't know what he does outside.

171
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,992
Don't trust men too much.

172
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,994
You too, Ms. Sa.

173
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,498
Hye-ryung,
I guess you're stressed out today.

174
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,835
And this isn't something
a newlywed should say.

175
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,045
Are your in-laws
still pressing for a baby?

176
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,591
I'm going to have one.

177
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,301
Good thinking.

178
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:44,680
Even the great Boo Hye-ryung
can't possibly disobey her rich in-laws.

179
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:51,437
She could at least text me
to let me know she received the tonic.

180
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,065
Don't you find Mr. Seo admirable?

181
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:59,528
Any other man would have grabbed
the opportunity excitedly.

182
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,239
-Don't you agree?
-He said he had other plans.

183
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:06,035
That's just what he said.
Dinner plans, my foot.

184
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,662
He's quite noble.

185
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,831
He doesn't flirt with women

186
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,374
or say silly things.

187
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,169
And he's bold and manly.

188
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,379
There's this one flaw, though.

189
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,674
He never changes his clothes.

190
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,760
He's always wearing that black sweater.

191
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,220
It's not his only one.

192
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,555
He owns several similar sweaters.

193
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,432
The textures are different.

194
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,642
Really?

195
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,603
You have an eye for detail.

196
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,406
-Are you waiting for a text?
-No.

197
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,742
Then what's the reason
behind the disappointment?

198
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:50,204
Don't be ridiculous.
The alarm just startled me.

199
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,289
I've never seen you
getting startled by that.

200
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,042
You and Hye-ryung.

201
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,212
Sometimes I feel like
you two might be blood-related.

202
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,171
Are you kidding me?

203
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,800
She nags me endlessly, just like you.

204
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,970
It must be tiring for our youngest.

205
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,222
He dug his own grave though.

206
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:11,267
Are you saying you did too by marrying me?

207
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,435
I didn't dig my own grave.

208
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,271
You dug it for me, woman.

209
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,023
-"Woman"?
-You are one, aren't you?

210
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,611
Fine. We'll call each other
"woman" and "man" from now on.

211
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,281
Woman, get me a glass of honey tea.

212
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,116
Get it yourself, man.

213
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,370
The thirsty one digs his own well,
so get your own honey water, you jerk.

214
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,247
"Jerk"?

215
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,710
You know
what's the equivalent of that, right?

216
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,671
Should I call you that word too?

217
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,886
Why on earth is Dongmi
barking her head off at this hour?

218
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,556
You never used such language.

219
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,851
There's something sly
about Dongmi, you know.

220
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,853
Sly, my foot.

221
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,230
That's more of who you are, woman.

222
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,149
Don't be mean to the poor dog.

223
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,776
You take pity on everyone
except for me, right?

224
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,447
You feel bad for everyone else,
whether it be a dog or a person.

225
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,032
Are you telling me to pity you?

226
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,286
If the wife of Signal Country's chairman
should be pitied,

227
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,246
then what about all other women?

228
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,751
Don't you dare say
anything like that in public.

229
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:22,087
There's a good chance
you'll be pummeled to death.

230
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,423
I'm only saying it to you.

231
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,468
You never show me an ounce of affection.

232
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,095
Because you never show me any first.

233
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,307
No affection. Nothing but nagging.

234
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,684
You took the words right out of my mouth!

235
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,680
You saw me. Why didn't you wait?

236
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,684
I was tired. I had few glasses of wine.

237
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,686
It was still mean.

238
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,314
How was Mother today?
You dropped by her place, right?

239
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,234
-Yes.
-Did she eat anything?

240
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,153
By force. Without me, she'd starve.

241
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,659
Cutting back on food for a few days
might be better for her.

242
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,547
Tell me. You must be taking it
because you're sick.

243
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,675
An oriental clinic caught my eye one day.

244
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:36,722
I've never visited one to be examined,
so I went in to ask about my constitution.

245
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,808
But the doctor recommended
some herbal tonic.

246
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,102
He says I'm lacking energy.

247
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,305
What about this?

248
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,015
It's a pajama party.

249
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,351
I won't be wearing one all day.

250
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,435
I love it.

251
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,814
Ji-a's coming, but she'll leave at nine.

252
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,649
-She won't stay over?
-No.

253
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,360
Be grateful she's coming.
If I were her, I wouldn't come.

254
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,447
-Help with the food before you leave.
-Got it.

255
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,534
-Give me that.
-No way.

256
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,452
-That's wrong.
-What do you mean?

257
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,079
They're giving me a headache.

258
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,957
How did moms raise
six to seven kids back in the day?

259
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,708
You find a way.

260
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,628
Our power to adjust is incredible.

261
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,677
Kids, it's time for dinner.

262
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,928
-Okay!
-Okay!

263
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,556
-All that laughing made me hungry.
-Me too.

264
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,475
That looks delicious.

265
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,375
This is what you're applying?

266
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,752
My heels were cracked.

267
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,131
How could you apply this on your feet?
This is eye cream!

268
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,593
Eye cream, nose cream, lip cream.
What's the difference?

269
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,469
They're all for the skin.

270
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,138
Where I apply it is my choice.

271
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,056
You've got to be kidding me.

272
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,641
Are you upset over some cream?

273
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,728
Imagine how I feel all the time.

274
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,645
I mean,

275
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,689
you could have asked me first.

276
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,319
There's this and also this.

277
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,779
-Can't you tell which one's expensive?
-No.

278
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,449
Even I use them in tiny amounts.

279
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:04,036
It's not just your kids
that squeeze money out of you.

280
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:08,707
You also spend my hard-earned money
buying this and that

281
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,418
for your body and your face.

282
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,882
If I don't take care of my skin,
you'll compare me to other wives.

283
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:20,427
Putting lipstick on a pig
doesn't change anything.

284
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,780
Goodness. Thank you.

285
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,203
Hello.

286
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,248
I'm Ji-a's father. Sa Pi-young's husband.

287
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:51,667
Hello.

288
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,045
I'm here to pick Ji-a up.

289
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,465
I've had one too many drinks.

290
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,509
I see. Go home safely.

291
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,594
When your father passed away,

292
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,097
I wasn't able to attend the funeral.
U-ram's mother--

293
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,308
Right. She stayed with us until the end.

294
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,353
Goodness.

295
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,522
Sit down.

296
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,778
Where's Hyang-gi?

297
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,656
At Jae-in's.
She said the noise keeps her up.

298
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,617
Honey tea?

299
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:27,911
Plain water?

300
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,746
Iced coffee?

301
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,750
I doubt you drank on your own.

302
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,460
I did.

303
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,753
Why?

304
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,880
Because I don't think this is right.

305
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,094
What do you mean?

306
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,683
Only being with one person
for your entire life.

307
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,854
Like us.

308
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,149
This again?

309
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,695
Actually,

310
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,740
I'm seeing someone.

311
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,203
This isn't because
we've been together for so long.

312
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,292
It's because that someone else,

313
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,210
another woman,

314
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,380
captured my heart.

315
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,026
For how long?

316
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,861
For a while now.

317
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,529
Who is she?

318
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,991
I'd rather just talk about us.

319
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,201
Your student?

320
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,828
That would be ridiculous.

321
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,747
Is this situation not ridiculous, then?

322
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,333
I tried to let her go,

323
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:01,046
but I realized that it was impossible.

324
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,178
Please let me go.

325
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:10,847
And our kids?

326
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,016
Don't you care about them?

327
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,145
I can't help it.

328
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,856
Park Hae-ryun.
Are you really stooping this low?

329
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,026
You're a professor who lectures students.

330
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,904
But an affair on top of the betrayal?

331
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,990
How I feel is one thing,

332
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,121
but what about the life we built?

333
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,623
I deserve to be beaten to death.

334
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,668
-Do you want me to?
-I can'tâ€¦

335
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,713
I just can't live like this anymore.

336
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,633
Now I'm curious about

337
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,138
what kind of woman she is.

338
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:52,806
I'm sorry.

339
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:54,933
I have no excuse.

340
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:57,602
Don't you dare apologize
to sneak your way out of this.

341
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,568
You used my sore wrists as an excuse.

342
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,112
"I'm sick of the smell of your patches"?

343
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,031
Anyway,

344
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,619
let's just end our relationship.

345
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,122
So it's in a form of notification now?

346
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,208
Did you decide
without discussing it with me?

347
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,586
Does our encounter, dating,

348
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,880
and living through hardships for decades

349
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,383
mean nothing to you?

350
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,219
We're not the only ones
going through this.

351
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,265
It's common among married couples.

352
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,519
"Common"?

353
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,939
Hyang-gi and U-ram
may never want to see me again,

354
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,110
but I still can't help it.

355
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,623
Mom, we're hungry!

356
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,708
Are you asleep?

357
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,585
Midnight snacks, please!

358
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,962
Okay.

359
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,008
Justâ€¦

360
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,847
-Don't ruin his party today.
-So sweet

361
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,140
You can't carry a tune.

362
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,683
U-ram, you're next.

363
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,185
-After the snacks.
-You were hilarious.

364
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,188
Shouldn't you go to bed now?
Aren't you tired?

365
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,607
-Not at all.
-We couldn't be more awake.

366
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,692
Please don't jump around.

367
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,610
We won't.

368
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,527
-Okay.
-Okay.

369
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,490
This seems better though.

370
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:55,720
I'm out of my mind.
I was going to make cold spicy noodles.

371
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:00,850
I'll get you some medicine tomorrow.
You'll fall asleep in no time.

372
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,189
It's organic, so it's not addictive.

373
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,943
Don't worry about me. Got it.

374
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,113
Good night.

375
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,877
Ji-a and I are just as devastated.

376
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,671
You must be devastated as well.

377
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,550
Why is only one person
receiving the comforting?

378
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,927
You know how good she was to my father.

379
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,055
We only saw him once in a while,

380
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,267
so the level of shock is incomparable.

381
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:47,314
She could easily become
listless and depressed.

382
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,610
I'll take my comfort in you.

383
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,335
You're my organic sleeping pill.

384
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,216
Shouldn't I be your stimulant?

385
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,012
For your sake,

386
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,265
I desperately try my best to fall asleep.

387
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,226
I wouldn't say desperately.

388
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,903
Did she really provide
enough emergency care?

389
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,280
She used to be a nurse, remember?

390
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,824
The death was too sudden though,

391
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,243
even with his pre-existing
heart condition.

392
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,246
Spicy cold noodles.

393
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,956
That looks delicious!

394
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,458
Thank you.

395
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,085
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

396
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,002
No problem.

397
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,841
It's way better than my mom's.

398
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,511
Who finishes it first?

399
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,025
I'll agree that it's over for us.

400
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,028
One's heart?

401
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:19,823
Sure.

402
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,951
Many people fall out of love.

403
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:27,497
There aren't many couples
that stay in love until they grow old.

404
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,044
You hear these lines on dramas.

405
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,798
"How can you do this to me
after all I did for you?"

406
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,343
You can because you're human.

407
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,346
But it's also true

408
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,266
that you're worse than an animal.

409
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,269
I know I'm a terrible person.

410
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,228
Go.

411
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,813
You can go, but only physically.

412
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,568
On paper, we must remain married.

413
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,572
My heart can be crushed,

414
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,617
and it's okay if my marriage gets severed.

415
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,786
But I won't upset our kids.

416
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,123
Keep your affairs secret,

417
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,167
no matter how many you date.

418
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:13,960
Si-eun.

419
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,129
Don't say my name.

420
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,132
Don't call me by my name from now on.

421
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,138
Sleep out all you want.

422
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,891
I'll come up with excuses
to tell our kids.

423
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,853
We were two unrelated people
who started a family,

424
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,523
so you can betray me all you want.

425
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,360
But not our kids.

426
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,738
Even in death, they'll be our children.

427
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,491
That will never change.

428
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,119
It was our decision
to bring them into this world,

429
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,746
so they're our responsibility.

430
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,832
We didn't have them
only to break their hearts.

431
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,086
I don't know who this woman is,

432
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,714
but does she insist
you get a divorce and marry her?

433
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,425
She's not that kind of woman.

434
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,760
Good.

435
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:08,473
You're free to do whatever you want
as long as the kids don't find out.

436
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,728
All I ask is to keep being
the devoted father you've been.

437
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:18,107
I'm sure you know that fatherhood
doesn't end with paying their tuition.

438
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,860
You're a university professor after all.

439
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:25,031
When Hyang-gi and U-ram
begged us in tears last time,

440
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,951
I realized we should never get divorced.

441
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,829
I was aware of that,

442
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,039
but I guess that wasn't the case for you.

443
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:35,959
In my point of view,

444
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:40,713
my children are more precious
than you or myself.

445
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:45,927
Not ruining their lives
and saving them from pain is my priority.

446
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,429
You should feel the same.

447
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,308
Your priority isn't me or her.

448
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,562
Your children must be your priority.

449
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,610
Don't you want to see me perform?

450
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,612
Coming.

451
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,492
Get out.

452
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,453
Don't let it show
and enjoy his performance.

453
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,291
-Are you going to dance too?
-No.

454
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,334
-Are you going to dance too?
-They're here.

455
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,502
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

456
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,546
-Get ready.
-Here I go.

457
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,564
-Nice!
-That was a little groovy.

458
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,108
-Cool!
-Great.

459
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:43,985
The robot dance.

460
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,040
What's with the puppy?

461
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,175
Is it a gift?

462
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,467
Here you go.

463
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,600
Let's go to Sa-hyeon's after breakfast.

464
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,396
-What for?
-You saw how mean she was to our son.

465
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,273
He'll have to live with the guilt
for the rest of his life.

466
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,196
Sa-hyeon called me the other night.

467
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,323
She's getting scarier by the minute.

468
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,492
He's too scared to live with her now.

469
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,452
You saw how she is.

470
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,330
Do you want to kick her out of the house?

471
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,000
-Someone needs to persuade her.
-Who?

472
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,626
You, of course.

473
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,129
Say you'll be generous with the alimony.

474
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,214
She's not desperate for the money.

475
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,425
Yes, she is.

476
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,844
Her family's living abroad.

477
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,888
To buy an apartment in Gangnam,

478
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,850
she'll need to save up for several years.

479
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,185
Tell her she can take
their current apartment.

480
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:47,859
It will be easier for her to start over
if she's single again sooner,

481
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,485
when she's still young and pretty.

482
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:53,239
Everyone will be talking about it
since she's a celebrity.

483
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,408
She's not a top celebrity though.

484
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,495
Besides, the gossip will last
only three days.

485
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,248
People will move on
once another topic surfaces.

486
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,688
Don't you dare treat the kids
like you treated me.

487
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:31,736
If you hurt them
just so you can be happy with her,

488
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,156
I'll never forgive you.

489
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:40,161
Bring tears to their eyes
only when you're ready to shed blood.

490
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,747
And if you do,

491
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,792
I'll do anything to get revenge.

492
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,046
Tell me. What will you do?

493
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,550
Okay.

494
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,885
Don't you ever

495
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:00,181
make the kids ask,
"What's been wrong with you lately?"

496
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,849
Never.

497
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,316
Hyang-gi's home.

498
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,045
They must have had fun all night.

499
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,630
They were up until past midnight.

500
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,218
A Mi, strike your most confident pose.

501
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,345
Looking good. Yes, just like that.

502
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,139
Flash me a bigger smile.

503
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,640
You're doing great.

504
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,476
Yes, keep that smile
for a few more frames.

505
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:56,362
I'm erased for being me

506
00:35:57,113 --> 00:36:00,783
In this clean and clear world

507
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:07,790
I leave a dark stain

508
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,676
-He's taking a shower.
-I see.

509
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,012
You guys must have slept in
and woken up just now.

510
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,973
I woke up earlier. Did you have lunch?

511
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,393
Are you hungry?

512
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,188
Why do you think I'm not hungry?

513
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,733
You grabbed a late breakfast
and it's still early for lunch.

514
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,776
I'd like a fried egg.

515
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,361
Sure.

516
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,697
What was that?

517
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,408
"Sunâ€¦"

518
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:45,161
-The "sunnyâ€¦"
-"Sunny-side up"?

519
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,204
Yes, that's the one.

520
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,498
Okay.

521
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,336
Just say "half-cooked."

522
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,380
Stop correcting my words.

523
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,056
You don't look like
you're in your fifties.

524
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:08,226
I have no other comfortable black outfits.

525
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,812
You look good in everything
thanks to your slender figure.

526
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,856
We're going somewhere far today.

527
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,025
Where?

528
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,361
Soâ€¦

529
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,572
I've been thinking.

530
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,283
From his perspective

531
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,827
and from yours.

532
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,496
Father,

533
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,792
I'll let it go.
I won't make an issue of it anymore.

534
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,505
And I'll have a baby
as you've always wanted.

535
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,134
Just like you said, Mother,

536
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,221
I'll consider it as a passing storm.

537
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,017
It's the only way
I can cope with the pain.

538
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,603
You'll also need to try harder.

539
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,815
We're way past the point
where trying harder can solve anything.

540
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:59,443
If there's an issue, we solve it together.
That's my solution.

541
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,197
We said our vows in front of those people.

542
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,117
Must we let them
gossip about us over this?

543
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,078
What would they say?

544
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,249
They made time to come over
and congratulate us on our wedding.

545
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,127
Mother, Father,

546
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,464
everyone in my family is in Canada,

547
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,509
and I'm all alone in Korea.

548
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,721
You are my in-laws,

549
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,682
but I consider you my parents here.

550
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,061
That's how much I relied on you both.

551
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,232
Must I be kicked to the curb
because a random woman

552
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,360
got pregnant with your son's child?

553
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,406
What if I were your daughter

554
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,869
and not your daughter-in-law?

555
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,252
I'll comply with whatever you decide.

556
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,630
Should I do as he wants

557
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,759
and sign the divorce papers?

558
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,802
Of course not.

559
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:12,058
I've made up my mind to accept everything

560
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,268
and even try for a baby.

561
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,146
I won't take it back.

562
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,106
Good.

563
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,192
I'm proud of you.

564
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,699
Don't cry, darling.

565
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:32,787
Life always throws you curve balls.
Sometimes, it's worse than this.

566
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:35,956
You.

567
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:37,917
Break up with her.

568
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:46,050
-How?
-If you can't, we'll step in and meet her.

569
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,260
No, you can't.

570
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,345
Why not?

571
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:52,264
She's in the early stages,
so she shouldn't be stressed out.

572
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,350
We'll discuss the baby
when the time comes.

573
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:59,063
First, you go make it clear
that you're ending with her.

574
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,147
Dad.

575
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,984
-It's not that simple.
-This is your mess.

576
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,531
It's your mess.
Clean it up, whether good or bad.

577
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,200
Don't hurt Hye-ryung

578
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,661
anymore.

579
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,291
Whether you live a double or triple life,

580
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,294
it will only exhaust your body and soul.

581
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,255
You're punishing the baby for no reason.

582
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,507
You made the baby, not us.

583
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,718
You and the mom are responsible.

584
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,470
That's what I'm trying to do.

585
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,472
Take responsibility without ruining us.

586
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,352
-Answer the phone.
-Yes, Father.

587
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:50,531
-Mom, this is wrong.
-What else would we say? Think about us.

588
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,242
A man should never make
his devoted wife cry.

589
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:55,870
Hye-ryung's not that devoted to me.

590
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,913
She didn't even fix my meals.

591
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,716
We'll get going,

592
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,218
so have your lunch, I mean, brunch.

593
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:12,887
Let's go.

594
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,057
See you.

595
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,946
Go inside. You'll catch a cold.
You don't want a sore throat.

596
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,990
Go home safely.

597
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,201
Go inside.

598
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,328
The doors are closing.

599
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:09,485
You can never stop worrying
about your children.

600
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,632
-What's going on?
-Just drive.

601
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,847
-What was all that?
-We had no other choice.

602
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,688
Go straight,
and turn right at the alleyway.

603
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,065
There's a cafÃ©.

604
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,320
What would you like?

605
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:57,283
-Nothing.
-You need to order at least one drink.

606
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,035
I'll take a hot Americano,
and order him black tea.

607
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,745
Order some cake if you must.

608
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:05,416
It'd be a shame not to eat one
at a cafÃ©, right?

609
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,922
I didn't expect that from Hye-ryung.

610
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,258
Tell me about it.

611
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,261
That's what marriage is like.

612
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:20,139
The wedding ceremony is the best part.

613
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,018
They're already fighting
and giving us a headache.

614
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,894
It's only been three years.

615
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,940
-It's their honeymoon phase.
-It was over a long time ago.

616
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,901
How long does it last then?

617
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,237
Roughly

618
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:36,989
six months.

619
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,700
So you got sick of me after six months.

620
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,661
Do you hate the years we spent together?

621
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,956
That's just how life is.

622
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,834
Your words are always the problem.

623
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:52,004
Would it kill you
to tell white lies sometimes?

624
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:54,298
I can't tell you white lies. No way.

625
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:58,093
-Isn't that why you fell for me?
-Who says I fell for you?

626
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:02,139
I only agreed to date you
because you kept clinging to me.

627
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,224
"Clinging"?

628
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,353
Am I chewing gum? I didn't cling to you.

629
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:18,947
Just wait until we get older.
I'll pay you back in spades.

630
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,792
Your grandchild is growing as we speak.

631
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,212
It shouldn't have to suffer.
The adults should instead.

632
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:34,838
Hye-ryung doesn't have to either.

633
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,425
She's an adult,
so she can take care of herself.

634
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,387
It's just a moment of pain and agony.

635
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,846
After what you saw earlier?

636
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:47,017
The agony won't be brief.
Her life's on the line.

637
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,853
But the baby has
at least 80 years to live.

638
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,189
We've had enough fun in life, right?

639
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,525
So let's take a step back
for the baby's sake.

640
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,444
What can you do
when Hye-ryung's that determined?

641
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,988
You should have persuaded her,
not let her persuade you.

642
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,865
She was very persuasive.

643
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,827
Do you have the nerve to eat that cake?

644
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,870
For me, every day has beenâ€¦

645
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,373
Mom, please.

646
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:12,167
Begging us won't change anything.

647
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,461
We're just as upset as you.

648
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,506
You're a terrible son.

649
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,468
What if it's a boy?

650
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:26,682
A grandson.
How's that for fulfilling my duties?

651
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,142
Right?

652
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,986
What exactly does she want?

653
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,905
Nothing. She's even prepared
to raise the baby alone.

654
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,782
What does she do for a living?

655
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,409
Is she capable?

656
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,037
Hye-ryung's willing to have a baby now,

657
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:53,542
so it will be best
if she hands over the baby.

658
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,962
You may not think so now,
but it's hard to raise a stranger's child.

659
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,007
How is it a stranger's child?

660
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,634
It's her husband's child.

661
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,636
Anyway,

662
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:09,683
it's not easy to keep your temper
even in front of your biological children.

663
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,727
But she's the one I want to live with.

664
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,104
Get a grip on yourself.

665
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,814
That love won't last forever.

666
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,401
It seems you'll leave
many broken hearts in your wake.

667
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,946
Never, Mom. I like kindhearted women.

668
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,365
I know that for sure now.

669
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:29,745
Rather than someone who's pretty,
I want an affectionate woman

670
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:30,871
who caters to me.

671
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:34,833
People only show
their sweetest sides when dating.

672
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,252
-Do you still not know?
-She's right.

673
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,672
You'll be punished for this,
so break up with her.

674
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,384
Don't let tears fall
from Hye-ryung's eyes again.

675
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,053
My love for her is gone now.

676
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,388
Will she be happy with me?

677
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,474
Also,

678
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:54,394
she turns into a monster
when we're on our own.

679
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,687
She has 12 personalities.

680
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:59,274
Just imagine
she's having an affair with someone

681
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,110
and pregnant with his baby.

682
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:05,739
You'll want to skin her alive as well.

683
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:06,949
Exactly.

684
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,326
Why are you agreeing with him?

685
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,953
Think about it this way.

686
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,541
Let's say your mom and I manage
to convince her to divorce you.

687
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,960
Imagine how she'll feel.

688
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:21,922
Everyone online will talk
about your divorce for a while.

689
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,591
How will she feel?

690
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:29,429
She'll shed tears of blood
and resent us all.

691
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,765
It won't do you any good.

692
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,726
Your sweet life with your mistress

693
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,436
might turn into shambles.

694
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,773
A freak accident could
paralyze you from the neck down

695
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,317
or put you in a coma.

696
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,237
You never know what will happen.

697
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:49,866
He's right.
It will come right back at you.

698
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,287
Your kids won't stick around
to nurse you back to health.

699
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,455
Only your devoted wife will.

700
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,665
Who else?

701
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:59,084
If you don't stay grateful
for what you have now

702
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,004
and get greedier,

703
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:04,089
everything will be taken away.

704
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,968
What good will a beautiful woman do

705
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,345
if you're bedridden and disabled?

706
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:14,433
Hye-ryung's willing to forgive you,

707
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:18,478
so just be grateful

708
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,480
and beg her forgiveness.

709
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,150
This is your last chance to be forgiven.

710
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,945
We couldn't see it properly
having been persuaded by you.

711
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:32,826
We'll deal with the baby in due time.

712
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,955
You never go wrong
by listening to your parents.

713
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:41,251
Remember how we didn't approve
of Hye-ryung being a year older than you?

714
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,004
Look what happened.

715
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:47,549
Anyway, fate led you
to become husband and wife.

716
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,344
Don't go against it by swapping trains.

717
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,888
You'll pay for it. Come to your senses.

718
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,310
I'm terrified of her now.

719
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:01,813
It's all up to you now.
Be nice to her, and she'll forget.

720
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:05,067
That's right. They say women are BBs.

721
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,487
As in "birdbrains"?
If that's the case, men are IBs.

722
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,073
-IB?
-Insect brains.

723
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,538
Dad's grabbing dinner outside.

724
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,375
He says your phone's turned off.

725
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,670
Blue crabs?

726
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,339
Are they for crab stew or steamed crabs?

727
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:31,009
I prefer steamed crabs.

728
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,096
Your dad's eating out,
so let's have it next time.

729
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,972
But what about me?

730
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,352
I'll steam some.

731
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,231
My phone must have died.
Can you charge it?

732
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,290
Ji-a.

733
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,000
Have a seat.

734
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:12,759
How about you go for an early swim
with your dad in the mornings?

735
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,219
How early?

736
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,430
You'll need to get up at six.

737
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:20,851
I can't wake up that early.
Besides, I'm a good swimmer.

738
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,520
Swimming will give you a nice figure.

739
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,647
You have no idea.
Your buttocks will be toned.

740
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:31,153
Mine already are. They're good enough.

741
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:32,821
Next time.

742
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:36,450
Waking up at six is impossible.

743
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:40,328
Don't ask too much of your daughter.

744
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,585
Anyway, I truly admire Dad.

745
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:52,424
Did Grandma quit swimming
after Grandpa passed away?

746
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,552
Do you want me to keep him company?

747
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,512
It's good for you too.

748
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:04,519
Mom, I want to see Grandma Mo.

749
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:12,778
I feel bad for her, you know.

750
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,909
-Why's that?
-I justâ€¦

751
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:20,869
feel that way.

752
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:24,706
Her eyes were brimming
with tears that day.

753
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,962
You should have brought me here
when I was a kid.

754
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,967
You're right.
I just didn't know it was this good.

755
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,428
Besides, I was busy

756
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,889
with all the housework.

757
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:46,144
I had a great time here
when I came here back in university.

758
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:50,899
Pi-young must be upset
you're not taking a break on the weekends.

759
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:55,111
Hardly. She's very thoughtful
and considerate.

760
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,324
Is that why you married her?

761
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,036
I loved her.

762
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:09,376
Women like her are quite rare.

763
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,836
When I was young,

764
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:16,174
you were the only woman of my dreams.

765
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:42,659
Right.

766
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,454
We haven't eaten anything.
Aren't you hungry?

767
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,875
-Not really.
-Me neither.

768
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,548
The walk has definitely energized me.

769
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,051
Walking helps your ankles stay slim.

770
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,805
You're slender everywhere though.

771
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:09,603
I may not hold a candle to my dad,
but aren't I good enough?

772
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,355
I guess you are.

773
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,861
How about a piggyback ride?

774
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,907
Did Dad ever give you one?

775
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:25,994
No. he could hurt his back,

776
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,955
so it never crossed our minds.

777
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,290
Come on.

778
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:38,590
Let your son carry you.
I am technically your son, aren't I?

779
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,635
Save it. You're already

780
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,305
more than good enough.

781
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:58,234
I wonder if there's a place
that sells your favorite gelato.

782
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,329
It's good.

783
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:13,541
Everyone likes ice cream
regardless of age or gender.

784
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,418
I don't know anyone who doesn't.

785
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,755
We were able to buy happiness
for 4,500 won.

786
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,843
You finally perked up a little.

787
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,096
All right.

788
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,723
-Don't.
-Come on.

789
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:31,434
I'll take just one. Hold still.

790
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,354
All right. Look this way.

791
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,315
Over here. Nice.

792
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,277
You look so young.

793
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,447
Okay. One, twoâ€¦

794
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:51,496
I can't go in with you
since your dad will be back soon.

795
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:54,374
Call your grandma
and tell her to come down.

796
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:58,044
Her number's under "Mom," right?

797
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,284
Grandma!

798
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:44,674
My little puppy.

799
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:52,682
Our family photo?

800
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:56,436
I took one myself and had it developed.

801
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:01,107
Why didn't you call me sooner?
I would have prepared a feast.

802
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,697
Do we have milk?

803
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,199
No.

804
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:19,751
Iâ€¦

805
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,879
I need some time to think.

806
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,616
MANAGER KIM:
I MISS YOU

807
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:01,042
It's me. What did you do today?

808
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,588
I'll be busy for a while.

809
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,800
There's a lot to take care of
when someone passes away.

810
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:11,386
I need to comfort my family too.

811
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,097
I know.

812
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:18,560
Stay safe. I'll be in touch.

813
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,105
When should I pick you up tomorrow?

814
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:25,233
Don't know.
But Grandma said she'd take me home.

815
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,068
Don't bother her too much.

816
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,570
Don't worry.

817
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,196
Good night, my princess.

818
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,698
You too, Dad.

819
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:39,747
It will help you relax.

820
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:48,673
This is good.

821
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:50,300
-Is it Chianti?
-Yes.

822
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:53,178
We had steamed blue crabs for dinner.

823
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:54,220
What about you?

824
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,598
Pork cutlet and sausage skewers
at the rest area.

825
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,016
"The rest area"?

826
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,603
-We went to Chuncheon.
-Why?

827
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,354
You know, to get some air.

828
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,357
Can't I get some of that air too?

829
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:08,318
We'll go tomorrow.

830
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,779
Two days in a row?
I have a recording tomorrow.

831
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:14,699
Right. We'll most likely
get stuck in traffic anyway.

832
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:18,745
Why didn't you try Chuncheon food
like buckwheat noodles or spicy chicken?

833
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,457
Ms. Kim doesn't have
her appetite back yet.

834
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,460
Address her properly now.

835
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:27,629
It's inappropriate
for Ji-a and others to hear.

836
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,380
She doesn't seem to mind.

837
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:32,717
-She's never one to nag.
-Learn that from her.

838
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:52,820
Who sent you this?

839
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,865
It was taken from a nice angle.

840
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,494
I had someone tail you.

841
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:07,752
My high school friend saw you
when she was there with her sister.

842
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,420
Life must be boring for her.

843
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:13,007
Does she think I'm seeing an older woman?

844
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,843
She came to our wedding,
so she knows who she is.

845
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:19,264
But those who don't know her
might get the wrong idea.

846
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:22,016
Let them misunderstand.

847
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,061
She could be my sister or my aunt.

848
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:27,897
Having tea with an older woman
shouldn't mean anything.

849
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:31,568
Think about your patients.
Even my friend recognized you.

850
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,486
It would be better to play it safe.

851
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:37,073
Should I stop looking after my family
because of what others may think?

852
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:40,326
Besides, it's inevitable

853
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,037
that people misunderstand you
or even get jealous of you.

854
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,835
Once Ms. Kim is back
to her cheerful self again,

855
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,587
my heart will solely be yours.

856
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:53,840
I made a promise to my father.

857
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:56,968
What did he ask of you?

858
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:58,678
I think he had a hunch.

859
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:01,598
The day before he passed away,

860
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:04,392
he said at lunch after the weekly briefing

861
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:08,354
that he wanted me to look after her
after he was gone.

862
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,355
As always.

863
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:14,527
She's all alone now,
so how can I sever contact with her?

864
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,033
Why aren't you drinking?

865
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,797
I'd hate for this night to go to waste

866
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,967
only if we weren't mourning.

867
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:41,846
What if we weren't?

868
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,811
Holding back the urges will pay off.

869
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,073
What would you like to do tomorrow?

870
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,617
Take your pick.

871
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,787
Going to the movies together
would be nice.

872
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,247
-What about you?
-Me?

873
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:12,210
I have so many things
I wish to do with you.

874
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:16,589
-Like what?
-First, eating a hotel breakfast together.

875
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,759
I'm in! I love hotel breakfasts too.

876
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:24,514
Can you wake up early then,
at around seven?

877
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:25,932
Seven o'clock, no sweat.

878
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,018
The early bird catches the worm.

879
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,896
-Then go to sleep now.
-Got it.

880
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:40,113
When Mom was young,

881
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,199
did you sing her lullabies?

882
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,410
Of course.

883
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:46,744
Which ones?

884
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:51,165
The one I sang her the most
was "Baby on the Island."

885
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:54,585
-The one about oysters?
-Yes.

886
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,677
How many more times

887
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:06,139
will I be able to see my Ji-a?

888
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:30,079
Were you up all night
or did you wake up early?

889
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:33,916
I woke up early.
Where did Dad sleep last night?

890
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,170
He went to a friend's house-warming party.

891
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,298
He gets drunk more easily as he ages.

892
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:43,718
He falls asleep when drunk now.
He should really drink less.

893
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:53,603
Warm it up.
Cold milk is bad for your stomach.

894
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,916
Hello?

895
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:17,960
-Where are you, Dad?
-Why do you ask?

896
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,797
What time can you arrive at Banpo Park?

897
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,007
What's the matter?

898
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,843
Mom's cooking breakfast.

899
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:28,221
I'll see you there.

900
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,097
Okay.

901
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:31,641
Okay.

902
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,174
I thought it was Hyang-gi.

903
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:48,551
She didn't come home?

904
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,428
She went for a walk.

905
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:53,139
-You took me to Hanguk World.
-I remember.

906
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:56,809
I know we're still mourning for Dad,
but let's have fun for today.

907
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,811
My husband was seeing someone.

908
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,480
And Hyang-gi found out,
so she won't come home.

909
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,274
Thank you.

910
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:05,818
I had a great day with you today.

911
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:09,322
-You look great.
-Can we talk for a moment?

912
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:12,617
Not many old women have
a beautiful profile like you.

913
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,118
Do you want Hyang-gi to apologize?

914
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:16,787
Have I ever let you go hungry
or frittered my salary away?

915
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:19,624
-This is the only thing I did wrong.
-Do you really think so?

916
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,669
This is Sa Pi-young.
Hye-ryung coughed up blood.

917
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:24,712
Blood?

918
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:34,847
