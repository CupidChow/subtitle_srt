1
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,215
We have more than what it takes
to raise Bada,

2
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,175
EPISODE 3

3
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,010
but what about Sa-hyeon?

4
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,181
How will he manage?

5
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,517
Are you inconsiderate or just plain dumb?

6
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,270
Raising Bada isn't the issue.

7
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,231
To Sa-hyeon, Song Yuan was only a partner.

8
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,777
He's young and successful,

9
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,112
which means
he can easily fall in love again.

10
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,490
But Bada has been left without a mom.

11
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,743
His one and only mother.

12
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,204
He can never see her again.

13
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,541
I get that, but…

14
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,128
Although she can't be replaced,

15
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,547
Bada still has us.

16
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,510
Grandparents he can always rely on.

17
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:38,056
What you don't understand
is that men need their better halves.

18
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,976
Not just any partner,

19
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,771
but one who we can give our hearts to.

20
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,941
You know how deeply in love he was.

21
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,400
As time goes by--

22
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,528
Time won't fix things.

23
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,364
What if it were us?

24
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,159
She died without being able
to close her eyes.

25
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,245
But the living
must go on with their lives.

26
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,455
What good will that do

27
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,749
when one's heart is broken?

28
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,001
How could this have happened to us?

29
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,338
Did you have any ominous nightmares?

30
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,381
No.

31
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,550
Then why did you ask if we had any?

32
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,843
I don't know.

33
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,220
For some reason,

34
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,265
I had a bad feeling this time around.

35
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,226
Maybe my ancestors
picked the wrong spot to rest.

36
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,186
That's just a superstition.

37
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,896
It's not.

38
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,610
-By the way, did we have dinner today?
-No.

39
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,154
-Lunch?
-As if we had the time.

40
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,614
Then we haven't eaten
since dinner yesterday.

41
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,742
Is this a time to be eating?

42
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,828
How can you have an appetite?

43
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,496
That's not it.

44
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:49,419
The tension I was holding is now gone
and I just feel fatigued.

45
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,547
I'm exhausted.

46
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,507
I'd be worried if you weren't.

47
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,967
Don't you think

48
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,430
Hye-ryung would be
the best choice for him?

49
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:06,311
Better her than a stranger.
And he's a single man again.

50
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,229
About Sa-hyeon…

51
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,150
There's nothing that could worry her

52
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,029
or plant doubts in her head.

53
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,447
Are you kidding me?

54
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,533
You are clueless when it comes to women.

55
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,786
Why would she want
to get back together with Sa-hyeon?

56
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,039
Well, the situation has changed.

57
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,750
We were more than generous

58
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:32,754
and gave her everything she asked for.

59
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,089
She'd probably think
that karma did its job.

60
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,132
No way.

61
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:40,720
Bada's mom is the reason
she had to suffer.

62
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,388
But she died after giving birth.

63
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,767
She'd tell Sa-hyeon
"I told you so" if she could.

64
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,977
That's how people are.

65
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,522
She asked to be contacted
when the baby arrived.

66
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,524
I doubt she meant it.

67
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,026
Why bother coming just to say empty words?

68
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,695
She took everything
she thought she was entitled to

69
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,739
and let Sa-hyeon take all the blame.

70
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,993
Who is it this time?

71
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,293
It's Hye-ryung.

72
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,296
-What should I say?
-Just answer it.

73
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,299
What else can we say but the truth?

74
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,759
Hello?

75
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,429
-It's me, Mother.
-Hey.

76
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,723
COULD IT HAVE BEEN FATHER'S FUNERAL?

77
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,308
Is something wrong?

78
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,936
How's Father?

79
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,062
He's here next to me.

80
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,188
Are you ill?

81
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,607
You don't sound too good.

82
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,192
Why are you calling at this hour?

83
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,528
Is Sa-hyeon all right?

84
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,282
My friend saw him
at the funeral hall today,

85
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,075
but he isn't answering my calls.

86
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,247
Hello?

87
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,124
I'm here.

88
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,459
Could it be his brother?

89
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,254
How was his brother's wife's back surgery?

90
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,048
-Weren't there any complications?
-No.

91
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,591
Has there been a loss in the family?

92
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,844
You said that Sa-hyeon isn't picking up?

93
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,178
Yes.

94
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,180
Well, he's not in the right mind to.

95
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,060
-Why not?
-It's hard to say over the phone.

96
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,565
Hye-ryung.

97
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,151
Yes, Father.

98
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,987
What's going on?

99
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,282
Something bad happened to Bada's mother.

100
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,159
Something bad?

101
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,785
She's no longer with us.

102
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,664
This morning…

103
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,834
Right around dawn…

104
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,421
What is it? What happened?

105
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,466
After she gave birth…

106
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,302
Anyway, none of us are in our right minds.

107
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,555
-What about the baby?
-It's a son.

108
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,725
He's doing well for now.

109
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:53,936
He's a handsome one.

110
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,190
Anyway, that's what happened.

111
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,441
Which hospital?

112
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,159
I'm sure Hye-ryung
will stop by to see him.

113
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,038
I wonder how the baby's doing.

114
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,290
He won't know his mother's gone.

115
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:17,168
My heart breaks for him.

116
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,711
Of course.

117
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,381
People were right about
longevity being a curse.

118
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,300
But we need to stick around.

119
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,221
How else will we take care of Bada?

120
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,684
It's not like we'll sleep,
so let's go out.

121
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,229
We'll drop by to see Bada.

122
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,733
-I can't stop thinking about him.
-We can't see him whenever we want to.

123
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,236
There are fixed visiting hours.

124
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,154
But this is a special case.

125
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,325
His mother died,
so they'll let us see him.

126
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,869
Do you have a headache?

127
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,831
I liked how cheerful you were
and how you always smiled.

128
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,876
In elementary school,
teachers always described me

129
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,837
as cheery and bright.

130
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,297
I guess it's true

131
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,716
that you knew me back then.

132
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,218
Did you ever have long hair?

133
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,929
In fifth grade and in college,

134
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,432
your hair was always at that length.

135
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,809
-In college?
-You came to my school once.

136
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,478
-My gosh.
-I was talking to some club members

137
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,730
when one of the girls
called for a "Si-eun."

138
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,649
It turned out to be you.

139
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,484
You recognized me?

140
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,446
You looked the same, only taller.

141
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,699
After swapping a few words with you,

142
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,535
she came back
and lamented over your situation.

143
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,288
How she felt bad for you.

144
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:40,334
She told me about a sweet girl
from a widely respected family

145
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,462
who had been in a relationship

146
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,423
with a theater major
since her senior year of high school.

147
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,884
And she said that
her family was greatly against him.

148
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,305
Upon hearing that,
I felt a sense of bitterness.

149
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,515
It felt like a flame that had gone out.

150
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,268
Then I looked back,

151
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,313
but all I saw was your glowing beauty.

152
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,442
Here's how I ended up though.

153
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,445
Maybe I should have
listened to my parents.

154
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,655
Not everything they say is right.

155
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,825
But then we met again
at the broadcasting station.

156
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,338
When we did,

157
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,175
I thought we must be
deeply connected somehow.

158
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,303
But as if that mattered.

159
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,389
Did you ever catch my gaze in the hallway

160
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,058
when we crossed paths?

161
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,479
It would have given off
deep and mixed emotions.

162
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,279
Do you have any photos as a kid?

163
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,536
I'd like to see them.
They might jog my memory.

164
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,663
Even I haven't seen mine in a while.

165
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,706
You said I looked cold.

166
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,043
But there isn't
a cheery demeanor to you either.

167
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,755
Many bachelors
enjoy their lives to the fullest.

168
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,801
I bet you have been in love though.

169
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,386
A few came close,

170
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,806
but none fully captured my heart.

171
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,351
If the love isn't grand,

172
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,603
the relationship should
at least be comfortable.

173
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,855
But that was never the case.

174
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,403
Maybe you should open up more.

175
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,948
You seem like someone who doesn't want to.

176
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,077
Anyway, today's conversation
answered a lot of questions

177
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,204
I had about you.

178
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,497
Were you ever interested?

179
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,375
In you?

180
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:48,879
Well…

181
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,008
the other writers and producers are.

182
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,217
What about you?

183
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,679
You did catch my eye

184
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,723
among the other engineers.

185
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:03,269
You must be aware that you're a catch.

186
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,897
-Is that all?
-I was a married woman with two children.

187
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,358
You may have been married
with two children,

188
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,152
but you're still a woman.

189
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,905
Have you ever seen me in a romantic light?

190
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,491
You may not have recognized me,

191
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:21,746
but you could have felt
a subconscious pull.

192
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,831
It was never an option for me.

193
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,667
Maybe you can start
considering it from today.

194
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,087
Considering something like that
requires awareness and intention.

195
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,005
Exactly.

196
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,299
Are you saying you won't?

197
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,554
Thoughts become a reality
as they grow deeper.

198
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,265
I always thought about you

199
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,851
even when I was trying not to.

200
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,812
It was only for a few days,
but you were kind to me.

201
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,316
Then I saw you again
later on when you were in your prime.

202
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,862
Then we became co-workers
and ended up here.

203
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,450
-I guess so.
-What we have is special, right?

204
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,244
I should have dressed up more.

205
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,372
-You look great.
-I mean when I go to work.

206
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,956
You're not the flashy type.

207
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,083
You're humble too.

208
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:11,170
In other words,
some people may find me boring.

209
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,964
To me, you feel like home.

210
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,467
I met you in my teens, my twenties,

211
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,263
and again in my thirties.
Our first encounter was at 12.

212
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,682
It's been almost 40 years.

213
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,711
I heard the news.

214
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,174
Nothing I can say
could possibly comfort you.

215
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,178
-Where's the baby?
-In the nursery.

216
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,681
I got a glimpse of him.

217
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,600
Oh, dear.

218
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,981
Though the situation is different,
I endured through pain too.

219
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,566
So for the sake of your baby…

220
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,111
And your parents.
They didn't sound well over the phone.

221
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:19,947
Did my mother call?

222
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,075
A friend of mine saw you

223
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,494
at the funeral home.

224
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,206
Is there anything I can do for you?

225
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,421
Thank you for offering though.

226
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:41,719
VIP ROOM 2

227
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:51,395
REST IN PEACE

228
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,740
24 HOUR NURSERY

229
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,909
Goodness.

230
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:08,829
Sweetheart.

231
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,461
Generosity is rewarded

232
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,589
while sins are punished.

233
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,679
My mom was constantly depressed.

234
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,182
Do you remember the story
we ran on the show today?

235
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,892
My mom's situation was the same,

236
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,812
although my father
never suffered from any illness.

237
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,314
When did they divorce?

238
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,609
I rarely saw my father
after the age of ten.

239
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,111
After the divorce was finalized,

240
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,197
I saw him less than eight times in total.

241
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,740
It must have been painful.

242
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,575
Life wasn't fun.

243
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,619
My mom was my life,

244
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,413
but she barely cracked a smile.

245
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,500
What I mostly got from her were sighs.

246
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,544
Then she told me to attend an art class.

247
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,797
And this skinny girl

248
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,384
with a warm smile
would strike up conversations.

249
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:07,596
She looked at my drawings
and handed me chocolate to eat.

250
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,059
You were like a ray of sunshine
that lit up my world.

251
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,395
That's how it felt.

252
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:18,399
-It was a time when you were the purest.
-You're still just as kind.

253
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,652
My first boss was a woman.

254
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,529
And according to her,

255
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,282
enemies shouldn't be
forgiven and forgotten.

256
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,910
They should be carved into your DNA.

257
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,539
-Really?
-Yes.

258
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,625
Even enemies shouldn't be forgotten,

259
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,670
so how could I possibly forget about you?

260
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,507
Having you back in my life was a miracle,

261
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,010
but I couldn't tell you that I knew you.

262
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,178
You should have just told me who you were.

263
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:52,224
I thought it would
only make things awkward.

264
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,560
The awkwardness could have driven you away

265
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,104
to work at another station.

266
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,983
Then I wouldn't have
even gotten to see you.

267
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,404
Besides, you seemed to be happily married.

268
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,531
That's how everyone saw you.

269
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,241
That you had a good life
with a university professor.

270
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:13,245
I didn't want to unnecessarily
cause problems.

271
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,331
It's hard to know
what really goes on in people's lives.

272
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,709
Was he ever violent with you?

273
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,003
He was never like that.

274
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,963
He has a good personality.

275
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,965
It's just that

276
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,219
new things can drive us
to extremes sometimes.

277
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,056
-He couldn't shake off the temptation.
-I'm a man myself,

278
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,142
but I feel like men
can be foolish at times.

279
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,645
Are you sure

280
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:42,024
that you're over him completely?

281
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,611
I'm human too and it's not
like my affection didn't fade as well.

282
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,822
I'm home.

283
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,449
Right.

284
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,328
What are you up to?

285
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,622
I'm drinking a nightcap.

286
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,918
Let's have breakfast tomorrow
at Yeoksam Palace Hotel with the children.

287
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,632
They prefer sleeping in on the weekend
to hotel breakfast.

288
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,470
Doesn't the mom go jogging
while the children sleep in?

289
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,057
No, I usually cook breakfast.

290
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,977
I eat breakfast too, you know.
In fact, I love it.

291
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,899
HOW ABOUT A PICNIC INSTEAD?

292
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,861
BUT WHERE CAN WE EAT OUT IN THIS COLD?

293
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,364
THE CAR IS GOOD ENOUGH

294
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,533
I'LL BRING THE SALAD

295
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,577
ARE YOU GOING TO BUY IT?

296
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,745
BUSTED

297
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,755
I'M NOT KIDDING, YOU KNOW

298
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,923
BREAKFAST THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW THEN

299
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,717
ALL RIGHT

300
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,302
GOT IT

301
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,179
TURN IN BEFORE YOU SOBER UP

302
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,598
ALL RIGHT

303
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:44,772
CAN I TEXT YOU IN THE MORNING?

304
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,862
CAN I TEXT YOU IN THE MORNING?

305
00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:01,121
CAN I ALLOW MYSELF TO LOOK FORWARD TO IT?

306
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,249
OF COURSE

307
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,834
I'D LIKE THAT

308
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,456
You'll catch a cold if your neck is bare.

309
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,129
Put it on me.

310
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,111
That's warm.

311
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,739
Not only is my neck warm,
but my heart is too.

312
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,534
Stay in place just like that.

313
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,952
What are you going to do?

314
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,329
I'm going to disappear.

315
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:32,796
I haven't had such a good time in a while.

316
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,225
My hands are warm too.

317
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,395
Thank you.

318
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,775
How do I look right now,

319
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,611
standing here?

320
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,280
Like Daddy-Long-Legs.

321
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,825
I mean, an oppa.

322
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,276
-You said you'd come tomorrow.
-Water.

323
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,117
You're in no state to talk.

324
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,203
Go ahead. I'm fine.

325
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,752
Is Ji-a asleep?

326
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,255
-Of course, it's midnight.
-And the housekeeper?

327
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,966
She went back home
to celebrate her sister's birthday.

328
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,265
Why are you always so beautiful?

329
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,767
You're always pretty,

330
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,145
but you look beautiful today.

331
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,111
Ji-a, I'm--

332
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,537
Leave.

333
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,457
-No.
-I won't let you in anymore,

334
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,416
so don't even try.

335
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,626
With houses, new is better than old.

336
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,046
But that doesn't apply to people.

337
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,924
We share a past, don't we?

338
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,761
So don't be too harsh with me.

339
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,221
The present is important,

340
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,265
but the past is just as meaningful.

341
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,476
Have you forgotten
about our life together?

342
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:39,107
-Go on.
-I'd rather not.

343
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,860
Have you seen the movie Giant Candy?

344
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,616
There's a line in it that goes,
"I wish to go back."

345
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:51,203
Wait, it's "I want to go back."

346
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,121
That's how I feel.

347
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,251
I miss the days

348
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,504
when we were a happy family of three.

349
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,130
-I'm desperate.
-A Mi is waiting for you.

350
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,508
I'd do anything if there were a way.

351
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:08,345
This happened to us
when we greatly loved each other.

352
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:12,516
In that sense, how we approach this matter
could put an end to our sorrow.

353
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,478
I'm afraid I'm not up for it.
This ship has sailed.

354
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,190
-Would you date someone else?
-As if I have the time for that.

355
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,069
Why do you ask when it's over between us?

356
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,030
Maybe you wouldn't right now
since you're not looking to date,

357
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,282
but what if someone asks you out?

358
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:30,700
I'm tired.

359
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,619
Did you call for a driver?
Or did you take a cab here?

360
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,205
Don't worry too much about Ji-a.
This is nothing.

361
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,957
We can solve anything
if we put our mind to it.

362
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,458
Unless it's love, I mean.

363
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,336
With love, you can't control the outcome.

364
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:44,089
My dear wife, you abandoned me.

365
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,552
I hear Father possessed Ji-a

366
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,054
and said that Mother
is the reason he died.

367
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,057
Could it be foul play?

368
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,017
Foul play at the movies?

369
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,435
Well, it was dark.

370
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,814
You heard Ms. Kim.
He just wanted Ms. Kim to hate him.

371
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,023
-From what I hear--
-From A Mi?

372
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,025
Why are you two so chummy?

373
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,110
It's unnatural.

374
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,028
I'm sorry for not ripping her hair out.

375
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,114
You're always generous and understanding,

376
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,200
so why can't that be extended to me?

377
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,370
They say that you should
kill the enemy with kindness.

378
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,414
This is about Father.

379
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,542
I found it odd from the start.

380
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,544
A healthy man dying at the movies?

381
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,255
He had high blood pressure
and heart issues.

382
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:28,717
But he took medicine for that.
Many people live long lives while on meds.

383
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,303
We all live with one or two illnesses.

384
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,013
We each have our own destiny.

385
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,390
Even the healthy suddenly drop dead.

386
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,267
So you don't have any doubts?

387
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,560
What can I do about it?

388
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,979
Should I request a police investigation?

389
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,606
Even if we exhume the body…

390
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,825
Get up and leave.

391
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,623
Get ahold of yourself.

392
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,047
Dad, you're here.

393
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:10,800
Hey.

394
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,095
It's cold out here.
You should sleep inside.

395
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,473
Your mom's making me leave.
She's kicking me out.

396
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,852
Grandma will be worried.

397
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,938
-We can call her.
-Exactly.

398
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,774
Do you feel chilly by any chance?

399
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,068
No.

400
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,069
Good.

401
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,447
You can take the spare room.

402
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,741
Blanket?

403
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,284
You should take your suit off.

404
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,499
PI-YOUNG

405
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,592
PI-YOUNG

406
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,139
I brought you vegetable porridge.

407
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:02,852
She stayed up all night making it for you.

408
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,022
You can't greet guests
on an empty stomach.

409
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,191
Even well-eaten ghosts look better--

410
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,697
Didn't Hye-ryung stop by last night?

411
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,162
-When did you get home?
-Around three.

412
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,831
Then why are you up so early?

413
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,041
I'm less sleepy when I'm here.

414
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,210
Check into a hotel then.

415
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,425
Were you with Ga-bin last night?

416
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,636
No, the son of Choisin Daily's publisher
asked me out for a drink.

417
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,346
He's not a heavy drinker though.

418
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,640
It's to show off his girlfriend, Mi-ae.

419
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,060
-That Mi-ae?
-Yes.

420
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,604
Is that something to brag about?
What if his wife divorces him?

421
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:49,941
As if she'd let him go.

422
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,652
Women are known
never to turn their backs on good men.

423
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,612
And yet, the son of Seoil Group's CEO

424
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,614
was served divorce papers.

425
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,326
Women aren't how they used to be.

426
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,541
They say that hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

427
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,085
So you have to party while you can.

428
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,129
-Do you think you can settle down now?
-Yes.

429
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,758
Don't you change your mind then.

430
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,514
The husband of a close colleague of mine

431
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,350
left his family for his lover

432
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,685
only to be dumped by her.

433
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,395
You could have been like that too.

434
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,855
You're a guy too, aren't you?

435
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,399
The world is a big place
with more than enough women.

436
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,109
All individually charming.

437
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,236
People are the same as food, you know.

438
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,113
There is plenty for us to enjoy.

439
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,699
But eating uncontrollably
will damage your health.

440
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,577
Whether it's food or people,
you need to practice restraint.

441
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,080
You can't compare people to food.

442
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,540
Especially women.

443
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,378
It's about time you dated now.
I'd rather you speak from experience.

444
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,796
It's not like I haven't.

445
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,423
A fling doesn't really count.

446
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,718
One or two serious relationships
are all that you need in life.

447
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,306
It's yours. Who's calling you so early?

448
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,851
BOO HYE-RYUNG

449
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,107
-Hello?
-Mr. Seo.

450
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,776
-Yes?
-I'm sorry to call you so early.

451
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,529
I heard you live in Golden Park.

452
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:20,365
-That's right.
-Could you perhaps give me a house tour?

453
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,617
I desperately need to move.

454
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,411
-Why is that?
-I've been having sleep paralysis.

455
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,829
Sleep paralysis?

456
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,833
I haven't been able to sleep well
and chills run up and down my spine.

457
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,128
Last night was the worst, you know.

458
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,380
I barely managed to wake up.

459
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,549
Maybe it's in your head. Are you sure?

460
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,468
-Haven't you had sleep paralysis before?
-No.

461
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,973
You need to get on a waiting list
to see apartments these days.

462
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:48,268
I heard that the units at Golden Park
have great layouts.

463
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,686
Are you busy today?

464
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,647
Only in the afternoon. How about 11 a.m.?

465
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,275
Sounds good.
I'll look up the address myself.

466
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,818
-Sure.
-See you later then.

467
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:57,902
Got it.

468
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,533
Ji-a, wake up.

469
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,998
-Let's go swimming.
-All three of us like old times?

470
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,751
Just us two. We should let your dad sleep.

471
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,797
Wouldn't Dad be upset

472
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,592
to find us all gone when he wakes up?

473
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,551
He won't.

474
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,887
It's nice not to be disturbed.

475
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,602
-Where's my fried egg?
-Cook it yourself.

476
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:31,686
I don't know how.

477
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,564
Is there anything you can do

478
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,234
apart from working, working out,
and dating women?

479
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,490
-What exactly is sleep paralysis?
-Beats me.

480
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,992
Boo Hye-ryung must be
more fragile than she seems.

481
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:49,037
Divorce could have
affected her psychologically.

482
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,623
It can be devastating for women.

483
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,334
More so for celebrities.

484
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,044
Don't ever hurt Ga-bin again.

485
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,421
Of course not.

486
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:02,175
Lunch or dinner tomorrow?
Ga-bin will join us like old times.

487
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,092
For my birthday?

488
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,888
Don't mind me
and focus on your wedding plans.

489
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,474
Don't make it sound like
I'm going out of my way.

490
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,226
-I mean it.
-I have plans.

491
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,936
-Playing golf all day?
-No, not golf.

492
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,730
-Then who are you meeting on a weekend?
-You told me to date someone.

493
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,648
Really?

494
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:20,735
Truly?

495
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,112
-Yes.
-Who is it?

496
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,991
-Ga-bin isn't your first love.
-Of course not.

497
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,911
Who are you spending the day with?

498
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,956
-Is this a joke?
-I'll make introductions when it's time.

499
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,332
When exactly would that be?

500
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,918
In a month? Next week?

501
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,631
No way. Once Dad hears this--

502
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,007
Don't tell him.

503
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,769
My gosh.

504
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,192
Where's Ji-a?

505
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,487
I'm the only one here.

506
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,781
I got the door lock combination
from Pi-young.

507
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,742
She called you?

508
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,202
She texted.

509
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,459
We should go.

510
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,045
Your stomach is upset?

511
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,381
-Let's go have hangover soup.
-I have to be at the hospital.

512
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,133
Did a VIP patient check in?

513
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,052
Eating won't take more than an hour.

514
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:42,358
There isn't a restaurant
that serves better kimchi than ours.

515
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,320
Not many families make their own anymore.

516
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,114
A little extra work from the wife
brings joy to the family.

517
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,199
-Are you happy?
-Must you ask?

518
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,786
Our daughter should
learn the master's recipe.

519
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,914
-What's your secret ingredient?
-Love.

520
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,006
Mother.

521
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:49,801
What?

522
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,310
What is this?

523
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,729
-It's a shrine for Father.
-What do you mean?

524
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,482
I checked online
and referred to what I saw at a temple.

525
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,776
-Are you insane?
-Why do you say that?

526
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,862
We should honor him
and appease his spirit.

527
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:10,989
You saw Ji-a yesterday.

528
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,240
Without even asking me?

529
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,034
-You're only keeping the spirit here.
-Exactly.

530
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:19,247
Many families have rites
to honor their ancestors.

531
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,291
-It's common in Japan as well.
-I'm the lady of this house.

532
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,961
-I am Director Shin's wife.
-Which Director Shin?

533
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:28,881
-Him!
-But he never lived here.

534
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,383
This is Yu-sin's house.

535
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,803
-What right do you have?
-I'm your future daughter-in-law.

536
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:34,887
Keep dreaming.

537
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,223
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

538
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,934
but I'll eat my hat
if he actually marries you.

539
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,811
Look. He slept at Pi-young's yesterday.

540
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,272
It will only happen more often from here.

541
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,774
I'll give you my hat to eat when we marry.

542
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,609
Stop trying to have the last word!

543
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,695
Why do we have mouths then? It's to talk.

544
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,573
-You!
-You can burn incense and bow.

545
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,490
Clear this!

546
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,160
I'm heading out to find a suitable temple
for a soul-comforting ritual.

547
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,119
I'D RATHER EAT YOUR FOOD THAN A MONK'S

548
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,246
Even the 49-day memorial rite was useless.

549
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,790
-So a one-off ritual won't work.
-Clear this!

550
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,000
Just do as I say.

551
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,835
It'll only benefit you--

552
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,232
YOU DESERVE A REGULAR BEATING

553
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,490
Did you break your back?

554
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,576
Oh, no. Should I call an ambulance?

555
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,623
Father must be present.
He's refusing to go to the temple.

556
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,917
In other words,
he wants a home-cooked meal,

557
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,668
not one served by a monk.

558
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,589
I hear you, Father.

559
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,141
I should leave this house
and be done with it.

560
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,438
How are you feeling?

561
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,774
My muscles seem a little relaxed.

562
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,527
What's this?

563
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,737
I made a few side dishes.

564
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,240
All I need is kimchi though.

565
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,077
I should get myself a cutting board.

566
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,997
Don't you have one?
You want me to buy one for you?

567
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,291
It's fine. I can order one online.

568
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,918
How did you survive without one?

569
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,129
-I rarely cooked.
-What was that?

570
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:34,048
I said I rarely cooked. I usually ate out.

571
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,177
You've been living
such a comfortable life, I guess.

572
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,936
Fold your own clothes.

573
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,897
I haven't heard from Dad in a while.

574
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,399
His phone is off as well.

575
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,818
Just so you know,

576
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,488
all men get dumped
by their first girlfriends.

577
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,282
-Why?
-That's just how it is.

578
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,868
All my friends ended up
dumping their first boyfriends.

579
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,452
Don't be a loser when it happens.

580
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,495
Got it.

581
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,955
It won't be easy though.

582
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,875
Is Dad suffering then?
Is that why his phone is off?

583
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:12,044
He must feel like such a loser.
More so to us.

584
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,255
It's obvious.

585
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,840
U-ram.

586
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,968
What if Mom got herself a boyfriend?

587
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,262
Is Mom dating someone? That's absurd.

588
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,889
-How so?
-Because it's Mom.

589
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,391
Did it make sense for Dad?
He dated someone too.

590
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,310
Still. Just consider her age.

591
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,103
Age is irrelevant.

592
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,938
So can't older people remarry?

593
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,358
I'm not sure.
It doesn't matter with other people,

594
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,486
but I doubt any good will come of it.

595
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,071
For Mom or for you?

596
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,949
We can't be selfish.

597
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,410
We should wish for Mom's happiness.

598
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,828
That's our duty as her kids.

599
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:49,207
-What about hers as a mom?
-She devoted most of her life to us.

600
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,168
Actually, it was more like a sacrifice.

601
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,546
We're all grown up now. We aren't babies.

602
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,508
I'm still not an adult though.

603
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,260
Some adults

604
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,638
are even worse than dogs,

605
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,807
and there are children
who are mature and reliable.

606
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,059
Which one would you be?

607
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,936
Don't pressure me like that.

608
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:13,773
Do you believe that parents must sacrifice
their lives for their children?

609
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,234
Forever? Can't they wish to be happy?

610
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:17,693
I guess they can.

611
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,197
Is she off on a date then?

612
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,366
No, she took some side dishes to Dad.

613
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,201
I'd rather she not give a damn.

614
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,162
How can she not?

615
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,289
Dad never did.

616
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,832
He did until he left.

617
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,419
He walked out on his family
and chose to live a separate life.

618
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,129
If I were him, I wouldn't accept the food.

619
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,632
How can he even look at Mom?

620
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,511
You didn't tell the children
about me, did you?

621
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,263
-No.
-Well, don't.

622
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,098
Just make sure you don't slip up.

623
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,141
What?

624
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,145
Did you expect me to speak nicely?

625
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,773
-You can still call me by my name.
-Mine is off limits to you.

626
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,484
Am I worse than a stranger?

627
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,697
Worse than a stranger?
Are you seriously asking me that?

628
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,952
Why are you tearing up?
This isn't my fault, you know.

629
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,793
Thank you.

630
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:17,920
I'll enjoy the food.

631
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,638
Hello?

632
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,016
You have the wrong number.

633
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,938
If you decide to come by again,

634
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,233
-bring me some of our doenjang--
-Doenjang?

635
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,485
The store-bought ones
are too bland for my taste.

636
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,463
Doenjang, my ass.

637
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,804
I love the layout.

638
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,598
I see.

639
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,270
Let me at least put that in water.

640
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,439
Do you have a vase?

641
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,526
How long have you been living here?

642
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,861
I bought it before it was constructed.

643
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,280
But the prices have skyrocketed.

644
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,283
To move to a place like this,
that kind of price needs to be paid.

645
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,788
I love where the unit faces.

646
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,456
Doesn't your unit face south?

647
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,375
No, northwest, and it gets chilly.

648
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,502
Homes should face the south.

649
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,421
I urgently needed a place,

650
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,882
so I forgot to check minor details.

651
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,760
Some high-end apartments like this

652
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,763
are situated in better locations
than others.

653
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,736
I bet the night view is to die for.

654
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,825
Would you like to see it at night?
It creates a great mood.

655
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:16,080
Maybe that's the reason
behind your enchanting demeanor.

656
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,791
-My demeanor?
-A serene, classic scenery

657
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:22,086
calms you down
and draws out a romantic mood.

658
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,008
It'd be nice to listen to music,
have some wine,

659
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,760
and enjoy the scenery.

660
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,721
I'll have the wine prepared.
When would you like to come by?

661
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:54,910
In order to catch a tiger,
I must walk into its den.

662
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,757
Welcome.

663
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,469
It's what I could get at the last minute.

664
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,972
You shouldn't have. It wasn't necessary.

665
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,269
The sun fills the house completely.

666
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,813
-It faces the south.
-You probably need shades.

667
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,943
Is someone here?

668
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,904
Yes, my housekeeper.

669
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,244
Hello.

670
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,664
Goodness, hello.
You look even prettier in person.

671
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,124
Thank you.

672
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,713
Do you drink coffee?
We also have black tea and pu'er tea.

673
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,425
Pu'er tea takes longer to brew and drink.

674
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,426
Pu'er tea, please.

675
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,854
Couldn't he have been alone?

676
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,945
Where I live faces the northwest.

677
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,863
-It must be chilly then.
-Yes.

678
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,948
Please take a look around.

679
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,668
Is it a special day today?

680
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,336
It's no one's birthday.

681
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,921
GREEN ONIONS, SEAWEED

682
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,966
-Is it for Dad again?
-Of course not.

683
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,722
-What did he say?
-He's grateful.

684
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,182
How did you take it?

685
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,979
Don't tell me you forgive him now.

686
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,522
Hyang-gi.

687
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,440
Don't give him an opening.

688
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,359
What if he asks to be taken back?

689
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:53,070
Your dad has a stronger ego
than you realize.

690
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,780
What matters more is how you feel.

691
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,866
I'm human too, you know.

692
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,868
I'm not an emotionless statue.

693
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,245
We all adapt and change

694
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:04,039
depending on our situation
and who we're dealing with.

695
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,544
I have a zit on my back.
Can you pop it for me?

696
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:11,755
Let me see it. It could be an abscess.

697
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,722
Why don't I put the flowers in water?

698
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:20,931
I already did.

699
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,770
She learned how to arrange flowers.

700
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,902
-Does she come every day?
-Three to four times a week.

701
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,613
She picks the dates.

702
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,618
Anyway, the layout
is what you'd find abroad.

703
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,453
A Spanish designer's touch.

704
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,705
The night view must be splendid.

705
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,998
It is.

706
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,960
A view like that
would most likely make you sentimental.

707
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,503
Not really.

708
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:03,223
How great would it be
accompanied by some music and wine?

709
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:06,935
Thank you.

710
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,901
I should have brought some wine instead.

711
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:15,986
I have plenty.

712
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,697
What is it that you don't have?

713
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,658
A woman.

714
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,744
What is it that you don't have?

715
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,916
A furry pet.

716
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,544
Why isn't he saying what I'm expecting?

717
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:34,880
Cats rarely get lonely.

718
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,425
Although, I'd hate to see
good furniture ruined.

719
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:42,137
-What other complexes do you have in mind?
-I doubt I need to look any further.

720
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:45,432
I'll put mine on the market
and snatch up what's available.

721
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,102
I asked the maintenance office,
but there are no available units.

722
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,479
One was on the market
when I searched online.

723
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,981
That's an old posting.
The ninth floor, right?

724
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:56,318
Yes. Are you saying
it's not available anymore?

725
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,364
FATHER

726
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,992
FATHER

727
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:10,874
Hello?

728
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:16,004
Then I'll settle on moving in as his wife.

729
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,285
-Are you being called in?
-No.

730
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,748
NICE! RIGHT ON TIME

731
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,294
-How embarrassing.
-Haven't you eaten?

732
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,420
I'm afraid not.

733
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:03,343
A green Falex limited edition watch!

734
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,761
Is that a new watch?

735
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:05,804
It's one I had.

736
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:10,893
There's a nice bistro out front
which serves a good salad.

737
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,061
It's time for lunch anyway.

738
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,647
Let me treat you for the house tour.

739
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:16,940
Who buys doesn't matter.

740
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:18,984
Shall we?

741
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:24,156
I have a salon appointment.

742
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,617
Would you like to grab a bite
with my housekeeper?

743
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,163
Ma'am?

744
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:34,500
That's all right.
I'm a bit shy around strangers, you see.

745
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,168
You do?

746
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,047
Where did you park?
The first floor or the basement?

747
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,173
The basement.

748
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,762
-You didn't bring your jacket.
-It's in my car.

749
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:49,598
Which salon do you frequent?

750
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:52,267
I switched from Tree People in Cheongdam
to Damon.

751
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,228
The name rings a bell.

752
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,605
My stylist opened a salon
in Dongbinggo-dong.

753
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:59,399
I'll need to book another appointment
if I miss this one.

754
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,277
-Then it'll be pushed back a week.
-I see.

755
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,580
Did you get it from a department store
or pay a premium through a reseller?

756
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,208
That model isn't easy to get.

757
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,335
Why bother paying a premium for watches?

758
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:20,462
I got it abroad.

759
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,965
Directly from abroad.

760
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,394
-Have a good day then.
-Sure. Thank you for today.

761
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:36,395
My pleasure.

762
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,981
Please let me know right away
when a unit is available.

763
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,233
Asking your real estate agent
would be faster.

764
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,484
Right.

765
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,908
I guess it wasn't all for nothing.

766
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,463
Hey. Did Boo Hye-ryung come by?

767
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,675
She just left.
Did you ghost Father's call again?

768
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,135
Did he call you instead?

769
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,721
-He asked for you.
-So?

770
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,347
-I told him you left.
-Anything else?

771
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,766
-He asked how I was doing.
-Shouldn't you be asking him that?

772
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,686
He's on the verge of caving
just like you predicted.

773
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,688
Parents have a soft spot for their kids.

774
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,316
Sure. Enjoy your day.

775
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:27,696
We just need to ride it out.

776
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,032
It's what I should have done back then.

777
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,170
-She seems fine to me.
-I'm still uneasy though.

778
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,466
Ms. Sa, it's Mr. Seo's birthday tomorrow.

779
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,594
-Did he tell you?
-I have my ways of finding out.

780
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,597
Fruit makes you gain weight.

781
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,360
As you know,
Mr. Seo has done a lot for us.

782
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,944
I know that.

783
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,781
Even the brusque Mr. Seo will be touched.

784
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,532
What should I get him?

785
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,451
Oh, please. I'll get one for the team.

786
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,870
-Isn't that too much pressure?
-Hardly.

787
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:22,334
ONLY I SHOULD SHINE
SO HE CAN BE SWAYED MY WAY

788
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,257
This way, sir.

789
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,678
Thank you for today.

790
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:41,478
Knock before you enter.

791
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:52,447
No matter how I think about it,
I feel like Father's stopping me

792
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,532
from leaving.

793
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:56,743
How can you easily call him Father
when you've never even met the man?

794
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,954
Of course. If he were still around,

795
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:01,915
he would have adored me
as much as he adored Pi-young.

796
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:04,126
I've never seen anyone
as thick-skinned as you.

797
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:06,878
Thick-skinned or thin. Who cares?

798
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,589
If your back is better, you should go bow.

799
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:14,511
I don't get you, you know.
Weren't you deeply in love with him?

800
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:18,640
I wish for him to move on to the afterlife
only because I love him.

801
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,559
But he doesn't want to leave.

802
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,730
Your interpretation suggests
that he wishes to be by your side.

803
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,440
Shut it and leave.

804
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:29,192
If we don't appease the anger he harbors,

805
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,236
he might stay here forever.

806
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,948
When did you become a ghost whisperer?

807
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,199
My clear spirit must attract them.

808
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,994
Stop speaking in a way
that's disrespectful.

809
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:43,457
What do I expect from a bitch
who punches her mother-in-law?

810
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,458
A bitch?

811
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,169
You will burn in hell.

812
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,338
I should serve Father his meal.

813
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:57,679
The naive Ms. Lee
might ruin the surprise if we tell her.

814
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,601
-Are you serious about moving?
-Of course.

815
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,730
To catch a tiger,
I must crawl into its den.

816
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:11,735
Hye-ryung's made her move on Mr. Seo.

817
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:15,322
He's a man after all.
It's probably just a matter of time.

818
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,450
What a minx.

819
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,545
Hey, Hye-ryung.
Thank you for the cake. My kids love it.

820
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:34,257
Ms. Lee, do you have
dinner plans for tomorrow?

821
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,467
Dinner?

822
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:37,260
No, I don't.

823
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:41,348
Why? Is something up?

824
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,266
I'll tell you tomorrow.

825
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,352
Anyway, please join me
for dinner tomorrow.

826
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:48,647
Sure thing. What about Pi-young?

827
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,148
She has to take care of Ji-a.

828
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:53,443
It's just that I have something
to discreetly discuss with you.

829
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,904
Got it. What time?

830
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:58,615
I'll text you when and where tomorrow.

831
00:51:58,698 --> 00:51:59,866
Got it.

832
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,327
-Have a good day then.
-Sure.

833
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:11,253
Could she be seriously ill or worse?

834
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,299
How about this color scheme?

835
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,634
I quite like it.

836
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:21,137
Well, the groom-to-be
has a fair complexion.

837
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:24,766
I wouldn't recommend this
for someone with darker skin.

838
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,226
Go ahead and choose yours.

839
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:28,645
Are you busy today?

840
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,981
We have a long checklist to go through.

841
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:34,317
A marriage is a sacred event, isn't it?

842
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,869
MR. SEO

843
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,129
-Hello?
-It's Seo Ban.

844
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:55,881
I couldn't get to your text sooner.

845
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:57,966
Why not?

846
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:00,719
I see.

847
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:03,722
Care to do something nice
tomorrow evening?

848
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:04,890
Like what?

849
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,309
I'd like to invite you
to a fundraising event.

850
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,226
Not one too grand.

851
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,061
Where should I go?

852
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,855
-I'll tell you tomorrow.
-Sure.

853
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,481
Thank you.

854
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:15,567
Sure thing.

855
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,882
The chairman sent me
to collect Director Seo's belongings.

856
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,050
In his room.

857
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,345
-Does he know about this?
-Yes.

858
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,276
Hello.

859
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,780
Aren't you…

860
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,365
Yes, I'm a friend of Won's.

861
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,576
I came by since her phone was turned off.

862
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,619
Did she have the baby?

863
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:13,541
We should head up.

864
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:17,420
-Is it a boy or a girl?
-A boy.

865
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:20,131
My gosh. Congratulations!

866
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,425
-You must be thrilled.
-We are.

867
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,014
Is the baby healthy?

868
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,391
Yes.

869
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:31,893
-Who does he take after?
-We'll talk inside.

870
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:38,984
Something bad happened.

871
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,444
To Won?

872
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:48,952
How?

873
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:52,288
Is she still in the hospital then?

874
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,165
Sejin Hospital in Gangnam.

875
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,125
Which room?

876
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,962
-Aren't visitors allowed?
-She's in the morgue.

877
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,466
We can't believe it either.

878
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:09,764
Cheongdam Department Store.

879
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,643
Furniture options there are limited.
We should go to Nonhyeon-dong.

880
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,771
No, the department store.

881
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:19,482
You can pick the furniture out yourself.

882
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:27,407
They might ask to see you in a few days

883
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,035
and they hate badly dressed women.

884
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:35,957
-Is this all you have?
-There is more inside.

885
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,049
Is there a style they prefer?

886
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,300
Anything but avant-garde.

887
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,303
That one.

888
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:56,853
A MI

889
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,484
-Hey.
-Ga-bin.

890
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,152
What is it?

891
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,031
-What's going on?
-Won…

892
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,117
While in labor…

893
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,079
-After giving birth--
-She had the baby?

894
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,830
Something happened to her.

895
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:18,166
-What do you mean?
-She's in the morgue.

896
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,003
That's absurd.

897
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,591
What now?

898
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,260
The funeral ends tomorrow.

899
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:32,013
Sejin Hospital in Gangnam?

900
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,140
Yes, I'm on my way right now.

901
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,017
I'll meet you there.

902
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:37,977
Sure.

903
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:41,731
Is someone ill?

904
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,399
Her poor baby.

905
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:46,861
Please make sure it's on time.
It can't be a second late.

906
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:47,946
Sure thing.

907
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,241
Here's the coffee you ordered.

908
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:09,592
I wonder if it takes after Sa-hyeon.

909
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:14,514
I can't say I'm not curious,

910
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,808
but I can't risk
getting pulled into his life.

911
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,394
Sa-hyeon.

912
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:22,522
I bet you you were elated
when I agreed on our divorce.

913
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,859
I know you hid your true feelings from me.

914
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:36,494
The phone is turned off
and you will be directed to voicemail.

915
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,037
After the beep…

916
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:41,374
A Mi.

917
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:44,878
A Mi!

918
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,505
Did she go out without telling me?

919
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,716
Bugger.

920
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,178
Hey!

921
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,187
Bugger!

922
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,190
Fish Head!

923
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,443
A Mi!

924
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,071
You should be dead or else!

925
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,574
-A Mi…
-Are you sick?

926
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,326
You have no idea.

927
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:19,537
That annoying little bugger
will kill me before it's my time.

928
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:22,582
-What happened?
-Check the living room.

929
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:40,850
I'm famished, you know.

930
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,436
It's like she's telling me
to starve to death.

931
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,146
And she knows I can't move an inch.

932
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:49,692
Her phone's off.

933
00:58:58,243 --> 00:58:59,452
REST IN PEACE

934
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:34,654
Mom, Mr. Seo didn't know our unit number,

935
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:35,989
so I told him.

936
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,658
-Right now?
-He knows which building--

937
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,909
Is he coming over?

938
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:42,787
Mom, quick!

939
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:44,706
But what for?

940
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:47,041
It's not weird
for someone to visit, you know.

941
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,669
Ms. Sa and Hye-ryung come by all the time.

942
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,380
He must miss you.

943
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:03,141
Mom, come on out.

944
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,601
Is he here?

945
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,827
-How many are there?
-Get counting.

946
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,162
Who stopped by?

947
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:26,789
The delivery guy.

948
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:34,505
SEO BAN

949
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,886
No way. This is so nice of him.

950
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,346
Smell Hyang-gi.

951
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,723
As in the "scent."

952
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:50,480
The smell of roses
is spreading everywhere.

953
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,215
SI-EUN

954
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:26,724
MR. SEO

955
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,399
-Hello?
-What are your favorite flowers?

956
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:35,358
Roses.

957
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:38,111
You can't ask that after getting me roses.

958
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:41,030
Do you like them? I'll get you
a more proper gift next time.

959
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:42,949
All women love roses.

960
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,368
-Then I'm glad.
-Thanks.

961
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,453
I first thought about sending chocolate.

962
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,913
I'd take roses any day.

963
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:50,707
Chocolate is delicious and all,

964
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,668
but it's not exactly good for your health.

965
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,128
I frequently enjoy snacks.

966
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,796
-You shouldn't.
-No?

967
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,631
-No.
-Got it.

968
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,007
I'll throw out what I have.

969
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,259
Do you have a lot?

970
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:03,010
Hand it over, then.

971
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:05,763
You shouldn't throw out any kind of food.

972
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:09,308
I can give U-ram some every now and again.

973
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:12,270
Will breakfast really be served tomorrow?

974
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:14,939
Yes.

975
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:19,527
I'll invite you home some other time.
Properly, I mean.

976
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:20,820
Right.

977
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,365
When do you normally have breakfast?

978
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,409
Let me know when it's good for you.

979
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:28,286
You don't tend to sleep in, right?

980
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:30,371
-Right.
-Can you eat at 8 a.m.?

981
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:36,127
Text me when you get here.
I'll meet you outside.

982
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,731
-Ms. Sa Pi-young.
-Yes.

983
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:02,820
How can I help you?

984
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,159
Ban.

985
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,583
Please take a seat.

986
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:26,552
The housekeeper sent
a suit and shirt to the dry cleaner's.

987
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,179
-Leave it at Ban's.
-Sure.

988
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,373
-Where are we headed?
-Gangneung.

989
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:38,791
-You want to go there?
-Yes. Right now.

990
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:42,295
I bet you're just as baffled.
How could they hide it from us like that?

991
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:43,963
I was pretty taken aback too.

992
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,883
Si-eun will forgive me
if I sincerely apologize.

993
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,509
I'll talk to her once I get better.

994
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:51,178
You could even give
a healthy person a heart attack.

995
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:52,597
You look so frightening.

996
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,892
My manager will get there
by 5 p.m. and call you. Take her car.

997
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,059
I heard you're dating an old woman.

998
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,812
You should date someone
who would make him happy and proud.

999
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,732
Must I care about him
and try to please him?

1000
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:05,443
-Ms. Lee, Did I do the right thing?
-Of course.

1001
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:07,403
-The screams.
-The screams?

1002
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:09,280
Goodness. He's totally into me.

1003
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:10,907
-You should rest on a Sunday.
-The same goes for you.

1004
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:12,992
Is this some kind of charity
for underprivileged kids?

1005
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:14,869
I don't know the details either.

1006
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:17,371
We'll know once we get there.
I'm here as a guest too.

1007
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:25,838
