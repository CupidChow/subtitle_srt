EPISODE 5

2
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:11,422
It's good to see you. Do you remember me?

3
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,258
-Of course.
-Are you by yourself?

4
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,551
Yes.

5
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,928
-You too?
-Yes.

6
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,645
You're probably here for a swim.

7
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:26,938
I can skip it.

8
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,816
Well, my house is nearby.

9
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,277
-I see.
-Would you like to join me…

10
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,737
for a glass of wine?

11
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,824
I have some good wine
that would be a pity to have by myself.

12
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:38,825
I see.

13
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,453
You seem like the type
to enjoy strong liquor.

14
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,540
Wine is stronger
than people give it credit for.

15
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,960
God, Buddha, and Virgin Mary!

16
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,422
Thank you. Thank you so much!

17
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:07,020
Ms. Lee. How did you feel to see me
get ahead of myself?

18
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,688
It wasn't like that.

19
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,481
I only just found out myself.

20
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,441
Find what out?

21
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,028
Yesterday, Mr. Seo made things official.

22
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,779
You're my senior by many years.

23
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,907
Shouldn't you at least be frank?

24
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,284
You'll understand
once you hear the whole story.

25
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,202
She's right, Hye-ryung.

26
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,664
We all have our pride and dignity.

27
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,250
I was clear with my intentions
right from the start.

28
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,419
Even though I have one
of the strongest egos.

29
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,755
Is Mr. Seo the only one
with the feelings here?

30
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:37,800
You're telling me this is all one-sided,
while you have no interest in him?

31
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:44,182
You must have had a field day watching me
practically throw myself at him.

32
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,309
It's humiliating.

33
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:51,147
I thought of you and Ms. Sa as my sisters.

34
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,441
That's why I confided in you.

35
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,318
I didn't see this coming either.

36
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,404
How do you feel about him?
At least be honest about that.

37
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,781
Do you like him?

38
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,742
Do you not?

39
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,203
Is he just a colleague
you find comfortable?

40
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,916
-It's not as simple as that.
-You must know how you feel though.

41
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,962
Do you not feel the need to answer?

42
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,005
It was something unexpected.

43
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,800
Stop. All I want to know
is how you truly feel.

44
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,261
I showed you my cards
and Mr. Seo showed us his.

45
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,722
It's your turn now.

46
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,559
This happened unexpectedly,
so I'm sure there's a story behind it.

47
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:34,232
Did he suddenly come up to you
and confess his feelings for you?

48
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,651
A few days ago during the team dinner,

49
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,404
you and Pi-young had to leave early.

50
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,364
I waited but then left as well.

51
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,950
Later that night, he called me.

52
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,868
To ask why I paid for dinner.

53
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,161
You paid for dinner?

54
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,540
Yes, as a thank you
for all the times I was treated.

55
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,583
It wasn't all the time.

56
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,919
It was already quite late,

57
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:59,173
so he offered to say hi to my husband
if he was still up.

58
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,218
That's when I told him about my divorce.

59
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,847
Upon hearing that,
he said he'd come by my apartment complex.

60
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,098
He did?

61
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,309
Yes.

62
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,146
He told me we had met before.

63
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,400
It turns out that we went to
the same art academy in fifth grade.

64
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,693
And he remembered that?

65
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:22,488
Well, yes. It's not like
I have the most common name.

66
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:26,367
He also remembered me
because I was nice to him.

67
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,702
And you don't remember him?

68
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,705
I took a lot of classes when I was a kid.

69
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,291
Although this isn't something I remember,

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,668
after he enrolled in the academy,

71
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,171
I apparently quit in less than ten days.

72
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,256
I see.

73
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,302
Still, those few days were enough
for you to grow close

74
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,595
and become a couple?

75
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,013
I'll be honest with you.

76
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,100
One thing led to another,
and things ended up that way.

77
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,521
Romantic relationships are a mystery.

78
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,192
-I didn't expect it at all.
-Where do you stand?

79
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,152
Is he steering this whole ship?

80
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,862
Do you like him back?

81
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,032
I don't mind him.

82
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,909
Again with the vague answer.

83
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,746
Is it that hard for you
to say how you feel?

84
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,207
You don't mind him, is that it?

85
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,293
I want to compliment him
whenever I see him

86
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,961
and comfort him.

87
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:23,132
Getting to know him taught me
that he's quite humorous.

88
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,345
Who knows how this will end,

89
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,514
but our talks are interesting.

90
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,557
I may not remember our encounter,

91
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,685
but I guess I find comfort in it.

92
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,981
We had breakfast
for his birthday yesterday.

93
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,525
At a hotel?

94
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,361
No, in the park. I packed us some food.

95
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,446
Mr. Seo must have been touched.

96
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,908
Congratulations.

97
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,035
Thank you.

98
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,205
Going up.

99
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,471
You live in a fancy place.

100
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,449
-There aren't any slippers.
-The floor's clean.

101
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,502
Please have a seat.

102
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,061
It would be great
to live here together as a couple.

103
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,522
It's nice and tidy.

104
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,400
I'm going to sink my teeth into him.

105
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,277
I'd choose him over Yu-sin any day.

106
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,820
He hasn't been married before

107
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,989
and he's close to my age.

108
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,303
You poured me a lot.

109
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,781
As Ji-a puts it,
my heart is out of control.

110
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,837
God and Buddha,
are you finally answering my prayers?

111
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,153
Please!

112
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,534
Let's have Mr. Seo's sendoff party today.

113
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,496
It's not every day
that we're all free like this.

114
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,665
-You're right.
-You should give him a call.

115
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,166
Don't push it on him though.

116
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,129
Don't you have plans tonight?

117
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,505
I don't have to go.

118
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,765
Hello?

119
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,600
You sound like you were asleep.

120
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,852
Right.

121
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,479
Didn't you go for a swim?

122
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,356
I got back early.

123
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,819
Hye-ryung and Pi-young
want to throw you a sendoff party.

124
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,821
-I see.
-Can you make it?

125
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,823
-Of course.
-Got it.

126
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,117
Once we decide on a place,
I'll text you the address.

127
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:26,912
Sure.

128
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,457
Si-eun, you seem so at ease with him.

129
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,750
It's like you've been a couple for years.
Do the kids know?

130
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,546
Hyang-gi saw us
when he came by the complex.

131
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,634
I'll book us a table at Day Day.

132
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,518
You have a great figure.

133
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,354
-I bet you work out every day.
-Sure.

134
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,107
As a man myself, I must say I'm jealous.

135
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,621
-When did you visit an amusement park?
-Last year.

136
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,333
With Won and A Mi.

137
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,212
-Take us to Hankuk World.
-At this hour?

138
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,838
-Yes.
-Why?

139
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:21,217
-To clear my head.
-Are you in need of that?

140
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,596
I just want to go someplace
I haven't been before.

141
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,431
We'll head out, sir.

142
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,295
Is your back better?

143
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,798
Yes. Whatever.

144
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,514
Are you chilly?

145
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,394
-Dinner's ready.
-Okay.

146
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,854
I don't want any.

147
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,318
-Why not?
-I just don't feel like it.

148
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,534
Did you get to swim today?

149
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,785
Yes.

150
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,506
Why is she so out of it?

151
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,560
You came.

152
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,529
Ms. Lee told us that your first encounter
goes decades back.

153
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,197
You should have said something.

154
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,658
Keeping it bottled inside
would have killed me.

155
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,493
It's not easy to hide your feelings.

156
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,954
Seeing her again
was more than enough for me.

157
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,497
-Fifth grade, you say?
-Yes.

158
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,709
That would make Si-eun your first love.

159
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,963
-That's right.
-Gosh.

160
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,674
If only my first love sought me out.

161
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,807
Let's drink something strong today.

162
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,643
-Drink?
-Aren't you in the mood?

163
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,270
It won't be a proper sendoff
without drinks.

164
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,606
How about wine?

165
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:46,070
-Hye-ryung can choose.
-We never got to see you drunk as a skunk.

166
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,405
-Your alcohol list?
-At the back of the menu, sir.

167
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,502
-Let's ride that one.
-That one?

168
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,547
Sometimes, we should do
what we normally wouldn't.

169
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,840
This is how memories are made.

170
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,475
This is the scariest part.

171
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,103
Scream if you're scared.

172
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,656
My gosh!

173
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,579
My gosh!

174
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,213
Scream if you want to.

175
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,132
-I can't.
-Why not?

176
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,758
I don't know. I'm not in the mood.

177
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,688
Any prejudice we had about men…

178
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,274
They were prejudices, right?

179
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,985
Anyway, you changed my mind.

180
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,864
Because of what we've been through,

181
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:15,534
we believed that all men
were disloyal animals.

182
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,081
Ms. Sa, men change…

183
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,793
the minute they get married.

184
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,006
Mr. Seo, that could be you as well.

185
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,340
Is Hye-ryung right?

186
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,135
She's not, is she?

187
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,888
Exceptions exist, you know.

188
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,641
It all boils down
to their underlying character.

189
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,520
Take my ex-husband as an example.
I thought he was kind and diligent.

190
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,523
A good guy with a conscience,
who was also such a sweetheart.

191
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:50,277
But he drove a nail through my heart

192
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,613
and now he's shedding tears of blood.

193
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,492
Did his relationship also end?

194
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,828
No, but this talk is killing my mood,
so I'll tell you some other time.

195
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,291
Does your brother know about Ms. Lee?

196
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,375
Yes, he does.

197
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,046
-What did he say?
-They haven't met.

198
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,256
Which is why he has nothing to say.

199
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,217
He gives off a good impression.

200
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,678
He's a lot like you in a way,
but also quite different.

201
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,014
He's like Prince Charming.

202
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,809
Right?

203
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,686
Yes. How did you know that?

204
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,856
A wild guess.

205
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:32,236
All this time, we have never
been to a karaoke bar together.

206
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,280
-Let's go to one.
-She's right. We should.

207
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,032
There's one downstairs.

208
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,075
Can you carry a tune?

209
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,160
We're more interested in hearing you sing.

210
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,666
-What are you looking at her for?
-I can't sing.

211
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:46,959
Okay, fine.

212
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:51,505
Then prove just how bad you are.

213
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,465
Is that something I must prove in life?

214
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,468
-When the situation calls for it.
-The night's still too young.

215
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,770
Let's go by age. Mr. Seo, you're first.

216
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,772
You're the man of the hour.

217
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,524
Then please help preserve my image.

218
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,193
I really can't stand my own singing.

219
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,947
The eldest can't bail out on us.

220
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,032
-That's not the case.
-Let's not be pushy.

221
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,075
I'll go first.

222
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,459
"ONE MILLION ROSES"

223
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:36,842
A long time ago

224
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:42,472
When I entered this world on a star

225
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,228
-I heard a tiny voice
-My gosh!

226
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,855
Goodness.

227
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:54,234
Telling me to spread love

228
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,115
A flower that only blooms when in love

229
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:05,996
I was told to bloom a million flowers

230
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:11,960
Only when it's true love

231
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:18,008
Should the rose of love bloom

232
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:23,972
Without any hatred in my heart

233
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,811
Only when it's love, I give to the fullest

234
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:35,734
A million flowers will bloom

235
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:41,323
That's when I will be able to return
To the star I call home

236
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,329
Without any hatred in my heart

237
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:53,210
Only when it's love, I give to the fullest

238
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:59,174
A million flowers will bloom

239
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:05,013
That's when I will be able to return
To the star I call home

240
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,402
Hey, there.
So you're drawing an object to true size.

241
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,904
To do so, grab the pencil like this.

242
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,532
Use the tip of the pencil
and your finger as a guide

243
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,867
to measure the object's ratio.

244
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,955
Would you like some?

245
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,762
-Bye. See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

246
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,182
Guys, hurry up.

247
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:57,024
A million flowers will bloom

248
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,821
That's when I will be able to return
To the star I call home

249
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:09,077
What is true love?

250
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,078
Seriously?

251
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,247
What? No, wait!

252
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,792
Sa-hyeon.

253
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:20,547
Many people left me

254
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:26,386
What a sad world

255
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:32,559
After a long time has passed

256
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:38,565
I met someone who gave everything,
Even one's life

257
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:44,071
He appeared like a light

258
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:49,618
And I had that love fully in my heart

259
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:55,624
Without any hatred in my heart

260
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:01,338
Only when it's love, I give to the fullest

261
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:07,219
A million flowers will bloom

262
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:13,266
That's when I will be able to return
To the star I call home

263
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:19,439
Without any hatred in my heart

264
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:25,278
Only when it's love, I give to the fullest

265
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:31,118
A million flowers will bloom

266
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:36,665
That's when I will be able to return
to the star I call home

267
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,303
I'm busy until late
in the evening tomorrow.

268
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,441
Are you going to come up?

269
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,823
-Do you need to pee?
-No.

270
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,201
-Hasn't your father said anything?
-No.

271
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,246
How did your brother
spend his birthday yesterday?

272
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,581
We met up late last night.

273
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,211
Wash your hands.

274
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,510
What is it?

275
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,192
Punch me.

276
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,278
Slap me if you want.

277
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,572
What's with you today?
You're acting weird.

278
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,032
I can't marry you.

279
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,620
I could just go along with it,
but that would be wrong.

280
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,832
I won't ask for forgiveness.

281
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,753
-I'll burn in hell if that's my fate.
-Again?

282
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:09,299
You toyed with me yet again.

283
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,473
Why though? It was out of pity, wasn't it?

284
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,266
That's the only--

285
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,393
-I do love you.
-But?

286
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,938
It needs to be a more powerful emotion.

287
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,273
Love isn't enough.

288
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,151
What do you mean by love and this
powerful emotion you're talking about?

289
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:33,490
I'm an actress
who pours out emotions on stage.

290
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:41,331
But I don't get what you're saying.

291
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,583
I'm the problem here, but I can't help it.

292
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,335
If only I were like other people.

293
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,920
What gives you the right?

294
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,632
You are not God.

295
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,176
You're like the rest of us. A human being.

296
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,719
Just toss me aside.

297
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,429
Ending it this way--

298
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,351
Why me?

299
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,191
Wasn't the one time enough?

300
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:12,696
You always mess with me
whenever life gets boring.

301
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,781
Does being an orphan now

302
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,410
-make me an easier target?
-Even I can't understand myself.

303
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,246
-Has someone else caught your eye?
-Not my eye, but my ear.

304
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,290
-This isn't the time for jokes.
-I'm serious.

305
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,084
Get lost.

306
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,128
I'll make it up to you in any way I can.

307
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,091
Money doesn't buy you everything.

308
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,385
You bastard!

309
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,472
You coldhearted beast.

310
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:43,226
Why not just stab me in the heart instead?

311
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,902
I thought I had stronger willpower
than most people.

312
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,114
But I was mistaken.

313
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,951
Annoyingly enough, I always end up
letting my desires take over.

314
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,746
It sometimes makes me think
that I'm emotionally sick.

315
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,792
Maybe I am.

316
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,086
You might be heartbroken today,

317
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,757
but you will end up
thanking me in the long run.

318
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,396
Ga-bin, I love you.

319
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,442
It's because I love you
that I can't marry you in this state.

320
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,861
Even though you might think
this is all some ruse.

321
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,782
Thank you. I truly appreciate it.

322
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,078
Don't pretend that this hurts!

323
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,747
A desire I can't see or fully grasp…

324
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,166
sways me every time.

325
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,553
Get your driver up here.

326
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,138
Take it all and get lost!

327
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,943
Get lost!

328
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,328
Take it all with you!

329
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,210
You piece of garbage!

330
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,839
You cold-blooded scumbag!

331
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,346
What does Si-eun have that I don't?

332
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,932
He probably thinks he can't handle me.

333
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:17,524
CHURCH

334
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,360
Sir, could you pull over?

335
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,155
Did you see someone you know?

336
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,758
Do you go to church?
I didn't know you were religious.

337
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,093
No.

338
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,601
I just wanted to come in here.

339
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,232
We didn't drink too much today.

340
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,903
-I know.
-You're good at drawing and writing.

341
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,697
Singing must have run in the family too.

342
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,408
My maternal grandmother.

343
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:11,327
If her family had approved it,

344
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,830
she would have become
a master pansori singer.

345
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:17,584
My singing is nothing compared to hers.

346
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,169
I don't have any special talents.

347
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,172
That's hard to believe.

348
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:26,342
Do you know what I wished for
while blowing out the candles?

349
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,932
Can't you take me in?

350
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:38,479
Apart from being strong,
the only thing I have is my job.

351
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,944
Nothing about me is worth showing off.

352
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:49,407
My mind draws a blank
even when writing the simplest postcards

353
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,910
and I'm not an eloquent speaker.

354
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,331
All I have is my love. My love for you.

355
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,461
That love is what I desire right now.

356
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:05,131
All my life, I rarely desired anything.

357
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,051
But now, that has changed.

358
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:13,389
And it's a feeling I'm welcoming in awe.

359
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,937
If you're going to reject me,

360
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,314
do it later on.

361
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,944
Maybe after mulling it over for 50 years.

362
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,578
Can you take my hand?

363
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,581
I need to be calmed down.

364
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,390
I promise you this in God's presence.

365
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:59,310
My feelings for you
will not change until the day I die.

366
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,610
You're bringing me to tears.

367
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:11,364
I've been feeling my heart race lately.

368
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:17,036
All because I think of you
the minute I wake up every morning.

369
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:21,290
It's the same for me as well.

370
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,128
Really?

371
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,008
Can't the kids come to meet us?

372
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,052
There's no need to rush things.

373
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,178
There is.

374
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,682
We're 50 and it's a darn fine age.

375
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,395
Mama goes off

376
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:48,109
To the rocks by the sea

377
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:56,034
Looking for oysters to harvest

378
00:33:57,076 --> 00:34:00,121
The baby

379
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:05,376
Is all alone at home

380
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,336
-What?
-Why are you singing at this hour?

381
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,423
It's not just any song.
I'm practicing a lullaby.

382
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,302
-Is he asleep?
-Practice in your head.

383
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,846
I doubt it was easy for Sa-hyeon
to fall asleep.

384
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,014
Do you know how to sing lullabies?

385
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,517
-To raise a newborn--
-As if that matters right now.

386
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,687
Of course it does.
Nothing is more vital than sleep.

387
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,105
It helps develop sensitivity.

388
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,024
You should head home once day breaks.

389
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,777
Is that what Sa-hyeon wants?

390
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,278
-Just you.
-Why just me?

391
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,989
Because you wake up
whenever the baby fusses and cries.

392
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,866
I'm not exhausted at all.

393
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,660
His crying is music to my ears.

394
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,748
I'm fully prepared to be
the world's greatest grandpa-slash-nanny.

395
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,666
-It won't last.
-You wait and see.

396
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,712
Goodness. It'll wake up the baby.

397
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,756
-Who could it be?
-Maintenance maybe?

398
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,386
-It's Hye-ryung.
-Hye-ryung? Let her in!

399
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,518
It's me.

400
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,019
-Right.
-Come on in.

401
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,771
Where's Sa-hyeon?

402
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,483
-He's here.
-Sleeping, I assume.

403
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,737
Sorry. I'm coming from a team dinner.

404
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,115
Of course. We understand.

405
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:21,994
Where's the baby?

406
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,455
He fell asleep after having his milk.

407
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,249
All he does is eat and sleep.

408
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,668
-Can I see him?
-Later. When he wakes up.

409
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:29,877
Did you come to see him?

410
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,045
You must be devastated.

411
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,132
Even I feel bad about what happened,

412
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,551
so I can only imagine.

413
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,719
And his late mother?

414
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,474
I mean, did you bury her?

415
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,812
We did. By her parents.

416
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,398
You'll probably visit her grave
whenever you miss her.

417
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,525
-Is that what you want to know?
-No.

418
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:59,031
I feel bad for the poor baby…

419
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,951
and I'm also curious.

420
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,454
Won't you let me see him, Mother?

421
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,749
You sweet thing.

422
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,129
-Do you know how to feed him?
-Of course.

423
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,547
I'd like to feed him.

424
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,923
He needs to be awake first.

425
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:20,261
But when he wakes up,
he wails at the top of his lungs.

426
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,516
Gosh, I'm thirsty.

427
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,311
-Water or juice?
-I'll get it myself.

428
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,533
Can I come again some other time?

429
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,578
-Does the baby need anything?
-It's fine.

430
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,371
Of course.

431
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,916
-Baby formula.
-Right. What else?

432
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,167
-Diapers.
-Got it.

433
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,962
I'll come here again tomorrow
when I'm sober.

434
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,591
Will you make me dinner?

435
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,884
Of course.

436
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,803
Father, you're always the best.

437
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,140
Should I come back tomorrow or not?

438
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,767
-You should.
-He's against it.

439
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,060
I doubt it.

440
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,979
He's still emotionally wounded
to have an opinion.

441
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,940
-Your manager must be waiting.
-Right.

442
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,942
-Then get going.
-Sure.

443
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,653
That's right. Be careful.

444
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:25,826
You know how they say
that one's future isn't written.

445
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,078
It's true.

446
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,706
-Please don't see me out.
-Sure.

447
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,042
-Get home safely.
-Yes, Father.

448
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:41,259
Coming by at this hour
is her way of being considerate.

449
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,677
There's no need to frown.

450
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,556
Gosh, the little one's awake.

451
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,704
If the kids say they don't like me,
let me meet them.

452
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,123
I have a feeling they already like you.

453
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,416
I'd love to go up with you.

454
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,420
Going up.

455
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,445
Going up.

456
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,731
Hye-ryung is the way to go.

457
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,609
Don't you agree?
It's not like he'll stay single forever.

458
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,445
By the looks of it, he just might.

459
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,156
Don't curse him.
Men can't live by themselves.

460
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,076
-Men these days can.
-That I'll never accept.

461
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:15,955
Don't get ahead of yourself
when it's not even an option.

462
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,958
Didn't you see the way
she looked at Jeong-bin?

463
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,210
There isn't a woman
who doesn't adore children.

464
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,337
We're wired to be mothers.

465
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,713
Exactly.

466
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:29,927
We only need her motherly instinct
to be linked to Jeong-bin.

467
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,972
They can get back together
and have another baby.

468
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,307
What if she plays favorites
after having hers?

469
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:38,894
A change in one's situation
can alter one's perspective.

470
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,813
We'll cross that bridge when it's time.

471
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:45,651
For now, our priority is to make sure that
our youngest doesn't stay single forever.

472
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,903
As if Sa-hyeon would be interested.

473
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,738
He fell out of love with her.

474
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,575
But Hye-ryung had a right
to react that way.

475
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,285
We were offended by her too,

476
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,662
so it's hard to find fault
with what people feel.

477
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,081
What she did was far worse.

478
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,542
Don't you ruin my positive thinking.

479
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:12,928
MR. SEO: I JUST GOT BACK HOME

480
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,269
I just got back home.

481
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,064
Wash up and turn in, then.

482
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,027
Sure thing. Good night.

483
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:37,953
Hey, Ban.

484
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,206
-Are you out?
-No, I'm home.

485
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,666
We should have breakfast tomorrow
at Yeoksam Hotel.

486
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,919
-Just us two?
-Of course just us two.

487
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,004
-Sure.
-You sound depressed.

488
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,173
I'm not. I was just about to sleep.

489
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,675
The bride and the groom
will walk down the aisle.

490
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:55,596
Please applaud as they walk down.

491
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,972
-What's going on?
-Goodness.

492
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,475
Can you believe it?

493
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,644
-Goodness.
-Have you seen such a thing before?

494
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,235
Are you there?

495
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,909
Song Yuan? Jeong-bin's mom?

496
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,750
I can't do this.

497
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,546
I don't think I can live without you.

498
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,882
We should have at least had
our wedding first.

499
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,477
-Am I that pretty?
-Of course.

500
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,188
-Am I the apple of your eye?
-You're no fruit.

501
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,192
If only I could see
my pretty daughter every day again.

502
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:16,070
Ask Mom. She smiles more these days
and is doing better.

503
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,864
You never know.
She rarely listens to me these days.

504
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,366
Maybe I should ask her for you.

505
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,242
I don't know. I doubt it'll be easy.

506
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,828
It's not just me
who benefits from you two.

507
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:25,871
I'm here for you as well.

508
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,255
Why is there only one sweet roll?

509
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:36,757
I'm good.

510
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,732
Mom, I need emotional stability.

511
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,527
-Let's move back home.
-This is home for us.

512
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,987
A family should live together
under the same roof.

513
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,198
Don't you remember what I told you before?

514
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:04,159
This brings me back to the time
when I was dating your father,

515
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:07,079
and we don't nag each other
about the little things anymore.

516
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:10,541
-The pros outweigh the cons.
-But Dad wants to live with us.

517
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,087
Please?

518
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,132
I'll think about it.

519
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,009
-Would you like some tea or coffee?
-Sure.

520
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:29,017
Your mood suggests
you have good news to share.

521
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:32,020
You're right. I'm going to get married.

522
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,815
With that woman?

523
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:35,899
Yes.

524
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,236
Just how old is she?
Don't tell me she's older than you.

525
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,529
-We're the same age.
-Really?

526
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:41,697
Yes.

527
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,616
So she's a divorcée.
No kids though, right?

528
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,412
Actually, her eldest daughter's in college

529
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,289
and her son's starting sixth grade.

530
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:53,625
Just like the name U-ram suggests,
he's adorable and mature.

531
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,127
The chairman will be enraged.

532
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:56,837
She's going to be
his eldest daughter-in-law.

533
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,881
What he thinks means nothing to me.

534
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:02,301
You never even batted an eye
at the unmarried, beautiful, and wealthy.

535
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,595
-Fate works in its own way.
-This seems ill-fated.

536
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,097
I'd like to get married
at least a week before you.

537
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,227
Ga-bin and I ended things last night.

538
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:13,937
What did you do wrong?

539
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,943
Was it you who ended things again?

540
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:21,695
-Yes.
-Why?

541
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:23,572
-I couldn't be sure.
-Nonsense!

542
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,532
-You'll burn in hell.
-Then, so be it.

543
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,700
You'll regret it.

544
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,453
Aren't you hungry?

545
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,831
-How can you eat right now?
-I'm here, aren't I?

546
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:42,007
Breakfast is ready.

547
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,388
-Are you off somewhere?
-To a friend's in Singapore.

548
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,766
That's sudden.
Have you booked your flight?

549
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,518
-Of course.
-You should have told me.

550
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:56,355
-Then I would have called the driver.
-What for? I already called a cab.

551
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,774
-Unbelievable.
-How long will you stay there?

552
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,420
Mr. Seo.

553
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,381
-Are you here for breakfast?
-Yes.

554
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,426
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

555
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,054
He's my brother.
I heard you two have already met.

556
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,306
My gosh.
I didn't know you were his brother.

557
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,975
-Are you here alone?
-Yes.

558
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,977
-You should join us.
-Maybe I should.

559
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,773
Was that necessary?

560
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:42,568
-Is it uncomfortable?
-Worry about Ga-bin, will you?

561
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:46,029
She's tough and relentless at times.
Besides, she's not new to this.

562
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,824
-You're so like him.
-Father, you mean.

563
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,621
-Doesn't this place serve good breakfast?
-It does.

564
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,585
I wouldn't be against it if it were her.

565
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,628
Don't judge a book by its cover.

566
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,549
Those who are flashy on the outside
are often humble on the inside.

567
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:08,051
She's exactly as she looks.

568
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,637
Is that so?
How did she get on your bad side?

569
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,229
-What is it?
-A friend passed away.

570
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,023
-From an illness?
-I don't think he was sick.

571
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:22,816
Finish up before you go.

572
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:24,234
Tell her why I left.

573
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,870
He was texted that his friend passed away.

574
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,664
Goodness. Funerals seem to be
going around these days.

575
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:40,751
You can say that again.

576
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,253
Why didn't you say anything? If you had--

577
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,921
-Would you like some coffee?
-Yes.

578
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,095
If I had, then what?

579
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,181
I would have been friendlier toward you.

580
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,223
You were.

581
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,643
-Will you be having more?
-Sure.

582
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,688
Do you perhaps know about…

583
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,400
-It's nothing.
-About my brother?

584
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,402
Yes, his girlfriend.

585
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:08,528
I heard about her,

586
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:12,532
but I'd rather not talk about it
in my brother's absence.

587
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:13,825
I see.

588
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,881
I'd throw myself at him
if only my eggs were more productive.

589
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:31,093
You seem better.

590
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:35,972
I am, thanks to all the help I received.

591
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,808
-People are all we have left.
-Right.

592
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,771
I met the producer
at the golf club the other day.

593
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,356
She seemed honest and direct.

594
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,983
-She is.
-Ban asked if her family came

595
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,403
-and she mentioned her divorce.
-My gosh. Did she?

596
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,988
Judging by her boldness,
I guess she wasn't at fault.

597
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,824
Her situation is the same as mine.

598
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,492
Her former husband is a doctor,
and he had an affair.

599
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,161
As a man, can you understand?

600
00:49:58,745 --> 00:49:59,913
Yes.

601
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,168
Well, your brother said he couldn't.

602
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,920
I guess brothers aren't always alike.

603
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:08,839
Even twins have different personalities.

604
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,133
My friend's an identical twin, you see.

605
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:15,804
Anyway, there's no guy
like Mr. Seo these days.

606
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:16,930
I agree and I'm a guy myself.

607
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:22,352
I can't believe I lost out on a catch.

608
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,020
-Hold on.
-What is it?

609
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:27,232
What if someone recognizes us
having breakfast together?

610
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,234
My gosh. You're right.

611
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,236
-I'll get going then.
-But you're not done.

612
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,488
I've had enough.
I usually eat light anyway.

613
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,033
-Take care, then.
-See you around.

614
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,583
The way he looks from behind
isn't just handsome.

615
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,420
It's a work of art.

616
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:53,675
Hello.

617
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:55,844
Right.

618
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,638
-Boo's LMM.
-Sorry?

619
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,849
-Love, Memories, and Music.
-Oh, that.

620
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:02,559
We just call it "Boom".

621
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,770
The songs you play
are based too much on your own taste.

622
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:06,646
Is that so?

623
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,820
It could be difficult
for the average listener.

624
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:14,780
I see.

625
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:18,033
Also, you're close
with the music critic Eun-sae, right?

626
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:22,454
Why else would you invite him
as a guest with every new show you launch?

627
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:25,207
-That isn't the case.
-As if.

628
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,503
A MI

629
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,087
-Hi, Pi-young.
-Hey.

630
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:34,257
Do you have time for coffee today?
About 20 minutes will do.

631
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,135
-After the show.
-Dongchimi left for Singapore.

632
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,386
I heard she has a friend there.

633
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,263
I'll tell you more in person later.

634
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:56,613
Why has your phone been turned off?

635
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:58,573
-Oh, that.
-Did you catch a cold?

636
00:51:58,657 --> 00:51:59,699
Yes.

637
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,993
You don't have to give me pocket money.

638
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,496
I was worried about you, that's all.

639
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,834
Can you buy me a snack?

640
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:10,919
Sure.

641
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,894
-I'm good.
-But you love red bean buns.

642
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,105
I'm full at the moment. I'll eat at home.

643
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:31,439
Are you hurt?

644
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:33,650
Can't you take off your mask?

645
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:41,950
I can't hear well.

646
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,120
Dad, please.

647
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:49,124
It's nothing.

648
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,426
The cold air did a number on me.

649
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,804
I'm treating it
with acupuncture and medicine.

650
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,139
It'll get better soon.

651
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,647
Why are you crying?

652
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:16,318
This is why you should
keep your face warm when sleeping.

653
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,405
It's no different than a cold.

654
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:23,450
Now, dig in. You'll only upset me.

655
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,501
Does Mom know?

656
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:37,005
Yes. We went to
the oriental medicine clinic together.

657
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:40,467
-Sorry?
-We went to the clinic together.

658
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,678
-Would you like a beverage?
-Even tea has calories.

659
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,098
According to the housekeeper,

660
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:50,602
Dongchimi bowed sincerely
before the shrine when I was out.

661
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:54,064
She stayed on her knees for ages,
praying in tears.

662
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:57,025
-In tears?
-Yes. Aren't they to ask for forgiveness?

663
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,110
She must feel guilty about something.

664
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:02,113
That's why she escaped to Singapore.

665
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,699
She came back from the pool yesterday

666
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,952
and spent the day totally out of it.

667
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,036
Totally.

668
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:11,456
-Shouldn't I do the ritual myself?
-It won't help.

669
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:14,042
So you'll keep on serving meals
for his rite?

670
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,544
I only did it to see Dongchimi's reaction.

671
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,755
She was on edge as expected.

672
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:21,675
Discontinuing the ritual
might set Ji-a off again.

673
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,552
Appeasing his soul
would be a permanent solution.

674
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,222
How though?
We can't be sure he's even angry.

675
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:30,016
What if Mother's right
about him wanting to make her move on?

676
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,227
If that's the case,
we don't need to worry.

677
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:36,356
The recent events made Dongchimi
flee the country.

678
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,359
If Ji-a acts out again,

679
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,861
we can take her to a monk
who specializes in exorcism.

680
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:45,991
But all things point to Dongchimi
doing something to hurt him.

681
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,242
If only you had seen it.

682
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:49,661
Yu-sin was there and he believes Mother.

683
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:51,663
You know how guys brush these things off.

684
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,290
What could she have done to Father?

685
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:59,212
I don't know.
All I want is for Ji-a to be okay.

686
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:00,880
Don't you worry.

687
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,092
See you tomorrow.

688
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:06,261
Sure.

689
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,230
Why were you staring at her?
Don't you recognize her?

690
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:18,648
Of course I do.

691
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,151
How can I not
after that fuss of an interview?

692
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,986
-She was wailing.
-Are you a hater?

693
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,239
I'll tell you about it later.

694
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:27,991
Anyway, I have groceries to pick up.

695
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,243
There isn't any food at home.

696
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:32,787
Are you satisfied?

697
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:35,790
With this life, I mean.

698
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:40,712
Yes, but I do feel guilty about
what I did to you.

699
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,672
I'll be good to you forever.

700
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,966
Don't bother.

701
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:08,239
You reap what you sow.

702
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,701
Get off at Mapo and let me drive.

703
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:12,786
Yes, sir.

704
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,758
-Yes?
-Is this Producer Sa Pi-young?

705
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,261
-Yes?
-I'm Seo Dong-ma,

706
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,972
Seo Ban's brother
who you ran into at the golf club.

707
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,475
Oh, right. Hello.

708
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:36,976
Are you still at work?

709
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,354
-I'm just getting off.
-I see.

710
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,732
I had something to say,
so I came to your station.

711
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:44,150
Is that so?

712
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,694
-Where are you right now?
-The parking lot.

713
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,155
-On the ground level?
-Yes.

714
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,116
I just exited the building.

715
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:54,035
-I'll head over to you.
-Sure.

716
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:15,640
-Where's your car?
-It wouldn't start this morning,

717
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:16,808
so I took a cab.

718
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,560
Then, could I give you a ride?

719
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,562
That's all right. I'm sure you're busy.

720
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,230
I cleared my schedule for this.

721
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:24,941
All the nearby cafes
will be filled with colleagues.

722
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,109
Let's head out for now.

723
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:48,923
I take it that
you don't live with Mr. Seo.

724
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,759
No. I still live at home.

725
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,470
You'll only encounter hardship
once you leave the nest.

726
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,930
Songrium Apartment, please.
It'll show on the GPS.

727
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,600
If you don't have plans,
can I take you to dinner?

728
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:01,853
-I don't have plans, but--
-Then we'll talk over dinner.

729
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,439
Sure.

730
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,946
It's probably about Si-eun.

731
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,365
Mr. Seo's road to marriage
will be a bumpy ride.

732
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,497
May I take this? It's related to work.

733
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,041
-Sure.
-It could last a while.

734
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:26,461
It's fine. I'll be your silent driver.

735
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:31,674
Hello?

736
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:34,010
What happened to your friend?

737
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,553
It was a heart attack.

738
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,013
But he's still so young.

739
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:40,016
-He should have kicked his drinking habit.
-Oh, dear.

740
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:42,810
You'll probably stop by again
since he was a close friend.

741
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:45,188
-Yes.
-All right.

742
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:46,564
What are you up to?

743
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,609
-I'm making dinner.
-What's on the menu?

744
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,695
Vietnamese spring rolls.
The kids enjoy them.

745
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,323
I never took a liking to that dish.

746
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:57,450
You'll change your mind
once you taste mine.

747
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,993
They're different
from the ones at restaurants.

748
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,246
-Is that so?
-They're healthy as well.

749
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,664
When will I get to eat them?

750
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:03,581
Come over, then.

751
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,500
I might just do that.

752
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:11,089
I'll ring the doorbell.
Thanks to U-ram, I know which unit.

753
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:12,924
Maybe later. You'll get your fill.

754
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:15,510
Have you told them? Your children, I mean.

755
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:17,053
Not yet.

756
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:18,304
There's no need to drag it out.

757
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:19,889
All right.

758
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,308
Sure. Have a good night.

759
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,227
Got it.

760
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:27,897
There was a lot of traffic in Gangnam.

761
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:43,705
Where should we dine?
Would they have a table?

762
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:54,048
Have you been here before?

763
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,216
No.

764
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,844
I rarely find myself
coming to hotels north of the river.

765
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:02,307
Sir, you came.

766
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:04,809
I didn't make reservations.

767
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:06,728
We have a room. It's been a while, sir.

768
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:07,729
Right.

769
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,572
Your meal will be served right away.

770
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:20,533
-Has the menu changed?
-Yes, but just the entrée.

771
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,250
What a view.

772
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:32,295
You must be hungry.

773
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:36,215
-A little.
-Where did you go for lunch?

774
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,300
The cafeteria.

775
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:38,968
I had a meal there with Ban before.

776
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,012
-It's not tasty, is it?
-No.

777
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:43,890
That's why I often bring a packed lunch.
Like salads.

778
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:46,017
I see.

779
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,062
Is this regarding something
that Mr. Seo shouldn't hear?

780
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:52,148
First things first.
You have your car keys, right?

781
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,442
-Yes.
-If you hand them over,

782
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,819
I'll have someone get your car fixed.

783
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,614
-It's all right.
-I'm headed to the airport tomorrow.

784
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:01,783
Will you be taking the cab to work again?

785
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:02,992
Is it a vacation?

786
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,662
Oh, a business trip.

787
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:06,788
How rude of me.

788
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,295
Something came up
at our office in Germany.

789
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:18,007
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SEO DONG-MA

790
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,051
You deal in AI technology.

791
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:22,553
That's right. Did Ban tell you?

792
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:26,057
Of course not. Don't you know him?
He always keeps to himself.

793
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:28,601
That must run in the family.

794
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,187
Refined emotions and expressions.

795
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:33,815
Was that part of your upbringing?

796
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:36,693
Or maybe it just runs in your genes.

797
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:40,154
Ban and I are different, but also alike.

798
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:48,246
How about a glass of wine?

799
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:54,460
Sure.

800
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,672
My bowels will be thanking me tomorrow.

801
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:05,138
Kids, eat while you listen.

802
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,100
Go ahead.

803
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:10,268
You see,

804
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:13,438
Mr. Seo and I are seeing each other.

805
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,650
It turns out we once took the same class.

806
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,278
At an art academy.

807
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:22,572
Go ahead.

808
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,744
-You see--
-Is it about Mr. Seo?

809
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:29,162
I doubt it.

810
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:33,124
I saw Dad today.

811
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:36,169
Where? Did he call you?

812
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:39,130
In the neighborhood.

813
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:42,341
He has Bell's palsy.

814
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:46,429
It hurt to see him like that
and it's unsettling.

815
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:48,598
Dad's mouth is paralyzed?

816
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,817
-A bottle, right?
-Yes, sir.

817
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:03,404
We can't possibly finish it.

818
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:05,114
Good wine can always be taken home.

819
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:10,578
I need to take this. It's from Germany.

820
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,038
Sure.

821
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:16,709
Hello?

822
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:24,008
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SEO DONG-MA

823
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:26,594
Mr. Seo's the eldest son of a wealthy CEO.

824
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,513
No wonder.

825
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,350
I heard about her from Ban,

826
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:36,229
but I was hoping to know
more about Ms. Lee.

827
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,898
We're good friends.

828
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,943
-And she has many great qualities.
-As in?

829
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:44,570
Her personality for starters.
She's humble inside and out.

830
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:45,947
Ban's never been married.

831
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:48,866
He probably wants me
to talk her out of it.

832
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:56,833
Is cold water all right?

833
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,377
It's a little chilly.

834
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,421
-Can we have warm water?
-Sure.

835
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,090
-Just for one?
-Yes.

836
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:24,402
Should I cut to the chase
or begin at the top?

837
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:26,654
The former, please.

838
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,537
Then here it goes.

839
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:38,541
I'd like to marry
the woman in front of me.

840
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,543
That's you, Ms. Sa.

841
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:29,592
Ms. Sa, if I…

842
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:33,012
You'd pass out
if I pulled down my pants and peed.

843
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:33,971
You're mischievous.

844
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:35,306
-Can I stop by?
-Come.

845
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:38,225
I'd like to see the woman I cherish
while I still can.

846
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,769
-If I could…
-If you could?

847
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:40,937
Promise you won't hit me.

848
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,939
I don't want us to part ways like this.
I'll book a room.

849
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:45,149
I bet on Jeong-bin's first birthday,

850
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:48,235
Hye-ryung will be greeting
the guests. I have a hunch.

851
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:51,072
Your hunches have never been right.

852
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,073
He has a heart.

853
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:53,157
Let's go there for our honeymoon.

854
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:56,661
Is that so? I'm suddenly starting
to develop feelings for you as well.

855
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:58,496
Let's get married.

856
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,960
I think that van has been following us.

857
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:05,711
I have a favor to ask.

858
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,005
Your wish is my command.

859
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:10,967
-You should hurry.
-Will you give me a hug?

860
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:12,843
Or should I give you one instead?

861
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:17,890
