1
00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:00,060
As long as her man loves her,
a woman will never age.

2
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,270
Is that what your parents taught you?

3
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,731
To seduce a married man
and become a homewrecker?

4
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,900
You can't live
with someone you don't love.

5
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,694
Once the love is gone,
you stick together through your bond.

6
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,362
What do you think about getting a divorce?

7
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,199
If you want to be loved, be lovable.

8
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,035
Why are you back? Go back. You know me.

9
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,162
What should I do to make up with you?

10
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,581
I had a conception dream last night.

11
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,833
I'm serious. I'll tell you later.

12
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,836
Jump in.
Let's see how much you've improved.

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,964
Si-eun. Will you let me leave?

14
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,759
-Leave where?
-Leave you.

15
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:33,760
What?

16
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:37,305
Pi-young thinks
her dad died because of me.

17
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:41,100
Who are you to tell my husband
about our family? You have no right.

18
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:44,103
Just like you took Dad from me,
she'll be taken from you too.

19
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,522
You have me, darling.

20
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,025
Cry whenever you want to.
But only in my arms.

21
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:52,195
Dong-mi, are you sure you won't resent me
for living a long life?

22
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,696
You really want to end this?

23
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,406
I'll tell the kids myself.

24
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,992
-Then convince me.
-I hate the smell of your patches.

25
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,495
Smelling them even in bed

26
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:04,207
reminds me of
what an incompetent husband I am.

27
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,461
Your dad and I decided to live apart
for a while.

28
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,047
You're not getting a divorce, are you?
You are?

29
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,470
Explain. A woman?

30
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,430
Are you cheating?

31
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,141
Is everything she told us true?

32
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,434
-Yes.
-You're dead meat.

33
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,354
Do you love her? Tell me the truth.

34
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,439
Stop talking nonsense!

35
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,901
You're so stylish.

36
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,028
Dongmi, here you go.

37
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,532
Dong-mi. You're so pretty. You really are.

38
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,702
Are you Kim Dong-mi by any chance?

39
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,124
-You dyed your hair, right?
-I got him a wig.

40
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,417
I knew it.

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,544
Did you two use to date?

42
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,254
Does menopause pester you, too?

43
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,797
Mind your language.

44
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,550
By the way,
I saw Mr. Seo at your in-law's golf club.

45
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,635
He seemed like a different person.

46
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,470
So you want a divorce.
But on one condition.

47
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,431
I want to see her in person.

48
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,599
My name's Nam Ga-bin.

49
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,267
-I'm A Mi.
-I'm Song Won.

50
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,645
Mom. I almost got doused
with water last night.

51
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,189
I can't believe you.
How can you eat right now?

52
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,234
Sa Pi-young is the producer,
and Mr. Seo is the engineer.

53
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,196
You're the reason
I made a mistake on-air and got an earful!

54
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,157
Why is that my fault?

55
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,992
If I end up dying before she does,

56
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,494
I want you to take good care of her.

57
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,163
As if I'd allow you to leave so soon.

58
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,123
-She's pregnant.
-Hye-ryung?

59
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,708
-No.
-Then who?

60
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,169
I need your help.
It's for your future grandchild.

61
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,884
I'll

62
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,013
make you laugh tomorrow.

63
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:47,477
I don't have to call you by your name
if I don't laugh, right?

64
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,194
-Hello, Ms. Kim.
-Your father collapsed.

65
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,946
Perform CPR right now.

66
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,615
Father.

67
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,951
How am I supposed to live now?

68
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,122
-You startled me.
-I give up.

69
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,499
Let's have a baby.

70
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,793
I'm sorry. She's pregnant.

71
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:12,877
She's pregnant?

72
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,504
She says she's not hungry.

73
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,799
Lean on me from now on.
Though I'm not as good as Dad.

74
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,385
He is cheating on you.

75
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,136
Others can't possibly know
about other couples.

76
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,596
You saw me. Why didn't you wait?

77
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,266
-How was Mother today?
-Without me, she'd starve.

78
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,143
Cutting back on food for a few days
might be better for her.

79
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,145
I'm seeing someone.

80
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,439
-Si-eun.
-Don't say my name.

81
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,234
And I'll have a baby
as you've always wanted.

82
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,403
Did she really provide
enough emergency care?

83
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,154
She used to be a nurse, remember?

84
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:43,741
If you hurt them, I'll never forgive you.

85
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,077
I'll do anything to get revenge.

86
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,121
Where did you spend the night?

87
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,124
-At a friend's house.
-Female or male?

88
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,835
-Remember taking me to Hanguk World?
-I remember.

89
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,505
I know we're still mourning for Dad,
but let's have fun for today.

90
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,756
Thank you.

91
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,509
I had a great day with Ji-a today.

92
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,677
This is Sa Pi-young.

93
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,929
-Hye-ryung coughed up blood.
-Blood?

94
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,390
I saw my dad, who I respected and loved,

95
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,185
getting in a car with some other woman
with my own eyes.

96
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,522
Mom got that car for you
on your birthday with the money

97
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,941
she saved up
while she worked her butt off!

98
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,944
I finally know how it feels
to be heartbroken.

99
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,488
I'll end it.
She's not begging to get married,

100
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,781
so I just need to cut her off.

101
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,949
Take us to the woman.

102
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,076
-Where is she?
-Dad!

103
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,788
I married your father because I wanted

104
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,540
to take care of you myself.

105
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,294
While talking about drugs
and gambling last time,

106
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,671
you told us never to go down
the wrong path.

107
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,257
Then did you think
having an affair was right?

108
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,134
Let's be honest.

109
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:46,262
You should also get the chance
to meet other men.

110
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,306
Shut up. Don't you dare pretend
to care for me.

111
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,849
But we could part ways better.

112
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,310
By wishing each other good luck?
By praying for each other?

113
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,228
Was what Hyang-gi did not enough?

114
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:58,691
Dad, a male wolf
grows old with only one female wolf.

115
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,486
Shouldn't a person be better than a wolf?

116
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:05,406
That's right.
I'm sorry for being lesser than a wolf.

117
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,784
Happy now?

118
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,827
Ask anyone on the streets

119
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,624
if it's possible for a man
to love one woman forever.

120
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,334
It's not like I'm Jesus Christ.

121
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,170
I'm no Buddha either!

122
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,422
-I'm going to Jeju Island.
-Is it for a family event?

123
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,924
-Come with me.
-We should go.

124
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,217
What time is his flight?

125
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,303
He'll board soon. It's the 3 p.m. flight.

126
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,140
I barely slept last night
due to the excitement.

127
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,266
EPISODE 9

128
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,977
Mi, do you eat sea urchin noodles?

129
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,271
Why not? It's really good.

130
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,441
I did some research,
and black pig seems famous.

131
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,027
There's a place I go
that grills pork on briquettes.

132
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,863
I love barley shindari.

133
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:46,989
It's so good.

134
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,368
Is the food called barley shindari?

135
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,619
Yes.

136
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,583
Our plane's boarding.

137
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,715
Your ticket's been confirmed.

138
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,635
It's been confirmed.

139
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,221
You may board.

140
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,306
Your ticket's been confirmed.

141
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,271
Dear passengers

142
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,190
-who are taking the 3 p.m. flight
-Here are our seats.

143
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,943
to Jeju International Airport,
welcome aboard.

144
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,653
It will take

145
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:29,323
-Hello, may I help you find your seat?
-one hour to Jeju International Airport.

146
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,075
-Thank you.
-For a safe flight,

147
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:35,663
please switch all electronic devices,
including smartphones, to airplane mode.

148
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,623
I checked the weather in Jeju,
and it's nice.

149
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,125
We're in luck.

150
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,253
When a friend of mine wants
to go on a trip, it always rains.

151
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,567
Hello.

152
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,362
-Are you going to Jeju Island?
-Yes.

153
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,157
They're my friends.

154
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,451
He's my doctor.

155
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,455
-Hello.
-Hello.

156
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,432
10 MONTHS AGO
LAX

157
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,728
-Would you like something to drink?
-Grapefruit juice, please.

158
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,494
Ji-a, get up.

159
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,125
-Is Dad coming home today?
-Yes.

160
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,710
He'll buy me gifts, right?

161
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,921
What gifts? He's only gone for five days.

162
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,593
You want me to wear that?

163
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,264
-It's too princess-like.
-Not at all.

164
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,516
You won't be able to wear them
when you grow up.

165
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,398
Get up.

166
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,568
-What's the menu today?
-Muesli.

167
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,653
I haven't had any Korean food
since Dad left.

168
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,738
Muesli is healthy for you.

169
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,865
-Low-calorie too.
-I prefer rice.

170
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,535
Enjoy that for dinner.
I'll make you braised short ribs.

171
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,078
I'm good.

172
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,663
-You're skipping dinner?
-Yes.

173
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,415
-What about breakfast?
-That too.

174
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,042
-Let me know if you change your mind.
-Okay.

175
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,627
I'd like some steak.

176
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,379
And for breakfast?

177
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,006
-An omelet, please.
-Okay.

178
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,966
May I have some wine later?

179
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,426
Sure.

180
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,344
-Me too.
-Okay.

181
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,852
Were any of you diagnosed with diabetes?

182
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,606
Many people fail to notice

183
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:10,693
how your blood sugar level
skyrockets after a meal.

184
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,196
Two hours after a good breakfast,

185
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,449
it will read about 155 mg/dL.

186
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,743
This is just
an impaired glucose tolerance,

187
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,454
not diabetes, so many people are relieved.

188
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:26,250
If you consume carbohydrates such as rice,
bread, noodles, rice cakes,

189
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,586
or even orange juice or fruit,

190
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,546
the highest blood sugar level

191
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,841
about 30 minutes to an hour later
before insulin kicks in

192
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,635
is 200 mg/dL or more for most people.

193
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,931
Your blood vessels usually suffer damage
at around 200,

194
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,600
but it depends on your health.

195
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,811
At worst, your blood vessels could
be damaged at 140 mg/dL.

196
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,148
If this continues every meal
for a long time,

197
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,192
your heart blood vessels could be damaged.

198
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,194
That would lead to myocardial infarction.

199
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,530
You may think it's a heart disease,

200
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,824
but it's a complication of diabetes.

201
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,161
-Gosh, that's frightening.
-Really.

202
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,746
I had no idea.

203
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,465
Maybe we should've tagged along
with Yu-sin to the US.

204
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,677
It's only for five days.
You'd be too jet-lagged.

205
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,055
I'd be fine though.

206
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,059
That's the problem with the States.
It's too far away.

207
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,895
Would you like
some homemade kalguksu for lunch?

208
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,939
-Will you make it yourself?
-Yes.

209
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,273
I'd love that.

210
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,819
-What about kaljebi?
-"Kaljebi"?

211
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,321
It's a mixture of sujebi and kalguksu.

212
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,743
-I'm here.
-Hello.

213
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,703
-We don't have flour, do we?
-No.

214
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,289
Can you go to the mart and buy some?

215
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,283
It's hot, so be careful.

216
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,537
I'd like one too.

217
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,296
This is nice.

218
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,508
It's been ages since we slept so well.

219
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:21,842
I know.

220
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,553
What if you get bombarded with work
in a month or two?

221
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,973
People are willing to do anything
when they're desperate.

222
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,141
Gwan-hui would never do that.

223
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,353
You two may be close,
but he is the president of a law firm now.

224
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,189
He'll value the earnings
more than your friendship.

225
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,360
He probably hired you
because he needed you in that sense.

226
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,780
I'll broaden my experience
and my connections

227
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,114
to set up my own law firm.

228
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,075
Come here.

229
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,955
-What?
-Don't you feel fat?

230
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,706
What will you do with this?

231
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,877
-I look good enough.
-You should wear less than size 30.

232
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,046
How could I? I'm not a model.

233
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,965
You have time to exercise now.

234
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,218
I have no time for that.
I hurry home after work.

235
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:07,638
And? Do I wait for you at home?
Are you that lazy?

236
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,641
Come on. Let me rest for once.

237
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:15,187
Ever since elementary school…
No. Since kindergarten.

238
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,605
I've always been busy.

239
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,608
I don't mind you resting,
but it's easy to gain weight.

240
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,902
My husband shouldn't look like
a middle-aged man.

241
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,112
Take care of yourself.

242
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,032
You're the only one who needs to do that.

243
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,618
I'm no celebrity or model.

244
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,038
The clients don't want a lawyer
who looks like a pretty boy.

245
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,166
What do you mean?
You'll look sharp and intelligent

246
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,252
I'm not saying I'm going to become fat.

247
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,088
But a lawyer should have a big build
and look reliable.

248
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,675
You can look like that
after you set up your law firm.

249
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:48,554
All the successful lawyers
on American shows are slim and muscular.

250
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,181
They're actors. That's not the case
in real life.

251
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,642
Anyway, I don't want a husband
who has a big belly.

252
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,687
It's not just me. Most women don't.

253
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,565
If you don't start now,

254
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:03,110
you'll have to work out
three to four times harder in the future.

255
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:06,530
Can't we just live
like an average married couple?

256
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,741
Let's have a lovey-dovey marriage life.

257
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,576
Why do you think I got married?

258
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,745
To live like that,

259
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,121
our software matters,

260
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,790
but so does our hardware.

261
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,210
Would you like it
if I had a fat waist and flabby arms?

262
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,670
Would you want to hug me?

263
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,007
Yes, I would. I'd love you
even if you were a chubby pig.

264
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,802
I know you'll hate it if I get fat.

265
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,931
I won't. You think I married you
for your looks, woman?

266
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,975
"Woman"? Mind your words.

267
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,020
Don't give me that attitude.
I'm older than you.

268
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,315
You want to be the grown-up here
just because you're a year older?

269
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,984
Would you like me
to be rude to you as well?

270
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,154
Address me with respect,
and I'll do the same.

271
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,282
"Ma'am."

272
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,746
-"Ma'am."
-That's ticklish. Stop it.

273
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,206
Call me with respect.

274
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,749
"Sir."

275
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,001
-Properly!
-"Sa-hyeon."

276
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,381
We shouldn't change our honorifics.

277
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,510
-If you don't register at a gym, I will.
-Let's do it together.

278
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,346
Playing the drums is a serious workout.
Look at my arms.

279
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,809
Get up and take a walk
or ride the bicycle.

280
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,769
I'm going back to sleep.

281
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,355
I could sleep for days on end.

282
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,307
Oh, no!

283
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,938
Goodness!

284
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,071
I'm sorry. I made you trip over, didn't I?

285
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:12,865
Are you hurt?

286
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,495
You scraped your knee.

287
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,295
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

288
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,802
She tripped over my leg.

289
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,431
Do you have any band-aids and ointment?

290
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,557
Yes.

291
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,310
You should sit back down.

292
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,863
-I was trying to be careful.
-I'm sorry.

293
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,240
I feel terrible.

294
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,534
Don't be. It was just bad timing.

295
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,911
How's your back?

296
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,624
You could have sprained it.

297
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,209
I think I'm okay.

298
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,881
-Let me do it for you.
-I scraped my knee a bit.

299
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,718
It must be sore.

300
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,105
-Thank you.
-Is there anything else you need?

301
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,482
-How about a cup of water?
-No, I'm okay.

302
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,987
Would you like to switch seats?

303
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,533
-There are no empty seats.
-It's okay.

304
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,605
Hye-ryung.

305
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,652
Honey.

306
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,562
Thank you for writing for us.

307
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,523
I'm the one who should thank you.

308
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,276
Let me know
if my script is hard to read out loud.

309
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,069
Don't be absurd.

310
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,697
Doesn't it just roll off the tongue?

311
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,203
Do you like the title?

312
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,205
Totally. Thank you so much.

313
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:07,623
It wasn't easy.

314
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,500
I know. There are so many radio programs,

315
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,962
and I couldn't think
of any good title for our program.

316
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,798
Treat her to a proper meal.

317
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,717
Of course. Be my guest.

318
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,344
You don't need to.

319
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,810
-Are you bruised anywhere?
-I'm okay.

320
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,355
-Did I surprise you?
-Yes.

321
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,690
You could have gotten badly injured.

322
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,319
We have five hours left.

323
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,530
Is that lavatory spacious?

324
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,949
The one up further is.

325
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:56,171
SEOCHO-DONG GYM

326
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,640
-A hot pot bulgogi.
-Okay.

327
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,904
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

328
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,801
Excuse me.

329
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,637
-Do you work out?
-I do.

330
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,931
Where do you work out?
You're in great shape.

331
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,182
At River Park Fitness.

332
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,768
You need to find a good trainer.

333
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,146
You might get hurt
if you learn from a rookie trainer.

334
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,566
Could you introduce me to a good trainer?

335
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,456
-Can I get a gin tonic?
-Sure.

336
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,502
Are you okay?

337
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,881
-Are you sure you're not injured?
-Yes.

338
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,759
You're wide awake because of me, right?

339
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,843
I've slept enough.

340
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,763
Besides, I need to stay awake
to avoid jet lag.

341
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,528
Are you a gyopo?

342
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,947
How did you know?

343
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,407
I just got that feeling.

344
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,576
-Is Korea very cold now?
-Yes, a bit.

345
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,204
Do you get cold easily?

346
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,288
Yes. I live in LA.

347
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,749
-Since when?
-Since I was four.

348
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:59,086
But you're fluent in Korean.
Your pronunciation is accurate.

349
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,337
Because I'm Korean.

350
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,383
My parents made me
speak in Korean at home.

351
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,885
Do you visit Korea often?

352
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,637
This is my second trip.

353
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,098
My maternal grandmother passed away,

354
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,308
so I have no relatives there.

355
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,607
How many countries have you visited?

356
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,484
A bit over ten?

357
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,111
Which was your most favorite?

358
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:25,654
Provence.

359
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,283
Provence is nice.

360
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,037
A few years back,
I got on a train in Switzerland.

361
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,831
The seats were facing each other.

362
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:40,627
A teenage boy took out an apple
and started eating it.

363
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,089
He ate it without making a sound.

364
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,425
Watching him eat made me tense.

365
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:48,969
Why?

366
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,137
He was careful

367
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,140
not to make a sound.

368
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,726
Honestly, isn't it okay to make a sound
when you chew on an apple?

369
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,686
How do you do that?

370
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,605
Is your saliva acidic?

371
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,399
It's just a habit I've developed
ever since I was young.

372
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,944
Isn't it stressful?

373
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,153
Not at all.

374
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,990
It's actually more difficult for me
to chew loudly.

375
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,492
Don't mind me.

376
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,470
Is Trainer Kang Jun here?
Someone recommended him to me.

377
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:41,057
-He's in session.
-Push your bottom back more as you sit.

378
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,101
That's it. Lower.

379
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,187
Go down lower.

380
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,107
Good. Then exhale as you go up.

381
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,526
That's good. You're doing well.

382
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:58,992
Lower your bottom more.

383
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,378
Be careful. It's hot.

384
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,962
I'll skip breakfast.

385
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,632
-No yogurt or fruit either?
-No.

386
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,596
-Are you not feeling well?
-I have an upset stomach.

387
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,515
Do you feel cold and stuffy?

388
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:04,974
I do.

389
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,018
Pills won't help for acute indigestion.

390
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,187
It's best to vomit.

391
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,898
It's not that bad.

392
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,115
Give me your hand.

393
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:24,035
I'll give you first aid.
You'll be okay in no time.

394
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,006
Your hand is icy cold.

395
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,469
This is going to hurt.

396
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,353
Right hand.

397
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,904
Maybe it was the apple.

398
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,907
You stressed yourself out
by trying to eat it quietly.

399
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,496
All done. You'll feel okay soon.

400
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,123
Your hands will feel warm again.

401
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,461
Keep massaging them.

402
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,633
This is fascinating. Are you a doctor?

403
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,803
-An oriental doctor?
-I'm a psychiatrist.

404
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,890
A psychiatrist?

405
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,728
Thank you. It was really painful.

406
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,647
-After stuffing myself…
-What do you mean?

407
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,442
-Didn't you think of me that way?
-No.

408
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:41,446
-At the LA airport lounge.
-It's normal to eat that much.

409
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,114
I ate more than you did.

410
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,657
I just wanted to sleep.

411
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,076
May I ask which hospital you work at?

412
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,621
-I'll treat you to a meal.
-That's okay.

413
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,415
I'll give you my business card
once we land.

414
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,417
You can speak casually to me.

415
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,920
My dad said it's also rude to just listen

416
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:00,340
when someone older than you
is speaking formally to you.

417
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,135
-You're much older than me.
-By how many years?

418
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,640
Are you 36? 35?

419
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:12,143
What's our age gap if I'm 36?

420
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,729
Eight years. I'm 28.

421
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,608
I thought you were a student.
You look much younger than your age.

422
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,486
-You get that a lot, don't you?
-Yes, I guess so.

423
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,615
Why are you visiting Korea?

424
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,534
You should tell me your age too.

425
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,202
You got it right.

426
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,538
Really?

427
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,082
-Did you think I was older?
-Not at all.

428
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,293
I am much older than you.
We're 16 years apart.

429
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,881
That's unbelievable.

430
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,425
You look much younger than your age.

431
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,427
Are you married?

432
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,514
It's rude to ask that.

433
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,141
Not if you ask a fellow Korean.

434
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,394
Yes, I'm married.

435
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,106
But my wife doesn't let me wear the ring

436
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,232
when I go abroad by myself.

437
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,233
Why not?

438
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:03,695
I once left my ring in the hotel bathroom
when I was in Italy.

439
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,240
You lost your wedding ring?

440
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,450
I got a new one with the same design.

441
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,578
She must've been disappointed.

442
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:24,883
Ladies and gentlemen, we will be landing
shortly at Incheon International airport.

443
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,843
-Is anyone picking you up?
-Please fasten…

444
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,095
-Yes.
-…your seatbelts.

445
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:30,638
Thank you.

446
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,311
Did you enjoy your flight?

447
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,605
-Yes, thanks to you.
-It was comfortable.

448
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,523
I hope to see you again.

449
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,566
Thank you.

450
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,447
Won't you be cold?

451
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,699
I have outerwear in my car.

452
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,576
Did you not bring one?

453
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,662
I did,
but I'll be getting in a car anyway.

454
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,629
Do you have a lot of luggage?

455
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,047
Two suitcases.

456
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,132
Right.

457
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,219
I'm Shin Yu-sin.

458
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,639
I'm A Mi.

459
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,518
-That's your real name, right?
-It is.

460
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:22,148
If you ever have trouble sleeping
or struggle mentally,

461
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,067
come see me anytime.

462
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,568
I won't charge you.

463
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,861
Really?

464
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,030
The cafeteria food is good too.

465
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,949
Can I just go there to eat?

466
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,200
Of course.

467
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,751
What's wrong?

468
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,879
The person who was going to pick me up
just found out

469
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,381
that his father passed away.

470
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,675
-So he can't come?
-No.

471
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,179
Do you know where you'll be staying?

472
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,473
Yes, I got the address.

473
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,102
If you want, I could drop you off.

474
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,728
I parked my car here.

475
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,566
If you feel uncomfortable,
I'll take you to a cab.

476
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,319
Just to be safe,
I'll write down the license plate number.

477
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,865
It's not that I'm uncomfortable,
but you should hurry home.

478
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,076
Let me see the address.

479
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,246
It's near Gangnam Station.

480
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,332
Then we're heading the same way.

481
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:36,848
If it wasn't for me,
you'd already been on your way home.

482
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,683
It will only take an extra 20 minutes.

483
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,019
Get in.

484
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,104
It's cold. Go on.

485
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,664
It will get warm soon.

486
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,879
-Aren't you tired?
-No, Doctor.

487
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,882
-I'll address you that way.
-Or just call me by my name.

488
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,093
In the States, they even call
their parents that way.

489
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,512
-I don't think that's right, though.
-No.

490
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,931
You can listen to some music.

491
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,101
I'll drive safely.
I've been driving for 25 years now.

492
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,352
Any accidents?

493
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,231
-Really?
-Yes. Aren't I lucky?

494
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,941
I've been lucky as well.

495
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,360
You shouldn't drive in Seoul.
It's dangerous.

496
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,113
-How long will you be here?
-I'm not sure.

497
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,907
It could only be a few days.

498
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,747
Take a nap.
I don't think you slept on the plane.

499
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,500
-Right?
-I couldn't.

500
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,753
A short nap will be very refreshing.

501
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,213
It's okay.

502
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,298
I want to appreciate the view.

503
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,009
Can't you do that tomorrow?

504
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,346
Are you uncomfortable?

505
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,890
Then I would've parted ways back there.

506
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:04,060
We chatted for hours on the plane.
Why would I be uncomfortable?

507
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,023
You should eat first.

508
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,651
Can you hang in there
for about 40 to 50 minutes?

509
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:12,777
Of course.

510
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,529
Aren't you hungry?

511
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,572
I had an apple and a glass of gin tonic.

512
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,450
-That's enough?
-To be honest, I'm hungry too.

513
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,787
I suddenly felt famished
after getting off the plane.

514
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,580
I found a good restaurant.

515
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,458
I know all the good restaurants.

516
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,461
Gangnam will be crowded,
so we should eat beforehand.

517
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:35,007
I tend to get irritable
on an empty stomach.

518
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,759
I should watch out.

519
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,891
Happy birthday.

520
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,061
I thought we'd do this over dinner.

521
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,481
We can't do this at a restaurant.
You'd feel embarrassed.

522
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,608
U-ram, sing for us.

523
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:55,570
Happy birthday to you

524
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,990
Happy birthday to you

525
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:02,368
Happy birthday, dear Dad

526
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:05,454
Happy birthday to you

527
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,378
What did you wish for?

528
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,715
For us to stay happy like this
for a long time.

529
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:18,634
You are such a simple person.

530
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,512
The simplest wishes are the most valuable
and the hardest.

531
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,930
That's true.

532
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,893
Let's just have a taste.
We'll have this for dessert later.

533
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,477
-I want a lot.
-You'll get fat.

534
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,563
-What's it to you?
-Let me.

535
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,444
I want this year's birthday
to be a bit different.

536
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,403
In what way?

537
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:41,574
Instead of us giving you gifts,
why don't you give us one?

538
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,829
-Me?
-Yes. I want to receive one.

539
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,209
-What?
-Is that a bitter smile?

540
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,461
What do you want for a gift?

541
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,756
I know. She wants your love. Right?

542
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,633
Love is a given in a family.

543
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,718
Cosmetics? A purse?

544
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,094
I want your car.

545
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,266
My car? You're kidding, right?

546
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,601
It's for your health.

547
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,687
Besides, I need a car as well.

548
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,149
You barely walk. You don't walk often.

549
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,444
I walk a lot around the campus.
And I try to use the stairs too.

550
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,154
Use public transportation.

551
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,741
It'll also save you time.
It's killing two birds with one stone.

552
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,993
-Are you sure this is for me?
-Of course.

553
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,955
It only takes 40 minutes by subway.

554
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,874
You could read while commuting.

555
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,210
All right.

556
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,420
Does this mean you'll be drinking
more often?

557
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,797
Of course.

558
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,343
Hand over your car keys today.
I'll drive you to the restaurant.

559
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,429
Anything you say.

560
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,599
-What else?
-Nothing.

561
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,859
-Valet parking?
-Yes, please.

562
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,861
Is Italian food okay?

563
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:04,323
Yes, but isn't there a dress code here?

564
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,701
You're fine.

565
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,161
Course A has the most food.

566
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,372
-Can you finish it?
-Yes.

567
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,917
-Two Course A's, please.
-And your drinks?

568
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,503
Have a glass of wine to unwind.

569
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,422
You're not drinking, right?

570
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,923
I have to drive.

571
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,258
Then water will do.

572
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,802
Me too.

573
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,263
-I'll go wash my hands.
-Okay.

574
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,900
-Let me hang that for you.
-Thank you.

575
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,371
MY LOVE:
DID YOU ARRIVE?

576
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,341
MY LOVE

577
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,217
Hello?

578
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,428
Are you on your way?

579
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,723
Sorry. I ran into a friend
from middle school back in the plane.

580
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,518
-So?
-It'd be a hassle to make time later on.

581
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:15,895
I'll have dinner with him.

582
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,024
But I cooked dried yellow corvina
and braised short ribs, your favorite.

583
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:23,319
I'll have it tomorrow. Leave some for me.

584
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:24,653
Okay.

585
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,199
-Don't drink tonight.
-Of course not. I'm driving.

586
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,410
Bye. I miss you.

587
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,537
You and your words.

588
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,456
Okay.

589
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,459
I miss you too.

590
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,422
Ji-a.

591
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,299
Okay. Don't worry.

592
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,511
Where is the funeral taking place?

593
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,847
Okay. Goodbye.

594
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:57,561
Mr. Ko asked if I had arrived
at the apartment.

595
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,772
It'll be hectic there today.

596
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,357
It's best to visit tomorrow.

597
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,360
-I was told not to come.
-I understand.

598
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:16,372
Isn't your wife waiting
to have dinner with you?

599
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:19,750
Most wives these days
prefer their husbands to eat out.

600
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,752
What? Why?

601
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:25,005
Because they wouldn't have to worry
about making food for them.

602
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,008
I'm kidding.

603
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,094
She's at a gathering today.

604
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,183
Are we having Chinese food?

605
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,227
-No.
-A barbecue?

606
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,688
Meat is always good.

607
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,398
You love all kinds of food.

608
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,734
You love pizza, jjajangmyeon,
hamburgers, and spaghetti.

609
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,445
You're right.

610
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:53,534
You can go on foot.
Hyang-gi, sit next to me.

611
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:02,626
It's too far to go by foot.
What's gotten into you today?

612
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,838
I'll walk with you, Dad.

613
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,840
It's my birthday today, remember?

614
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,312
What is this?

615
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,112
A gift.

616
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:31,655
Seriously?

617
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,035
Get in.

618
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,167
What is this?

619
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,336
It's so nice.

620
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,133
The engine sounds different.

621
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,635
What do you know?

622
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:56,889
You deserve to drive a good car.
You're the head of your department.

623
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,016
Didn't you want this car?

624
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,310
Wasn't this too much for you?

625
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,774
Awesome. It's so wide back here.

626
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,652
Mom, it sure feels different.

627
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:12,154
Dad, you're not trembling, are you?

628
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,040
The meat melts in my mouth.

629
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,584
No wonder they rave
about Korean beef on TV.

630
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:26,794
It's indeed different.

631
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,382
-Do you believe in blood types?
-Not really.

632
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:34,385
Many Americans don't even know
their blood types.

633
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,886
That's true.

634
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,346
I'm blood type O.

635
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,390
-Not blood type A?
-No.

636
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,100
In penitentiaries,

637
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:44,478
inmates with blood type O are
mostly violent offenders

638
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,230
because they're hot-tempered.

639
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,107
I'm not like that.

640
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,776
Blood type B's tend to commit fraud.

641
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:54,196
You'll never find blood type A's or AB's.

642
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:55,990
They're all at mental hospitals.

643
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,327
You think I should be
in a mental hospital?

644
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,745
It was just a joke.

645
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,330
What's your blood type?

646
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,457
What do you think?

647
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,001
You must not be blood type B.

648
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,461
-Blood type A?
-You're right.

649
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:13,173
Instead of being admitted to a hospital,
I chose to get a job there.

650
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,760
I can sympathize with my patients.

651
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,723
Your turn, Ms. A.

652
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,434
Why don't you call me by my first name?

653
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:24,476
For whose sake?

654
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,353
Mine.

655
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,065
But we just met.

656
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,484
Do you know what I mean?

657
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,738
"We've just met"?

658
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,448
Yes.

659
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,284
We don't call someone
we just met by their name.

660
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,162
Do you have any siblings?

661
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,247
Two younger brothers.
What about you, Doctor?

662
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,627
You don't need to address me like that.
You're not my patient.

663
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:53,589
In Korean dramas, the way they address
each other is so complicated.

664
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,341
That's because we value manners.

665
00:43:58,552 --> 00:43:59,970
I grew up alone.

666
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,849
I had an older brother,
but he passed away when I was seven.

667
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,521
Growing up,

668
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:13,067
I envied my friends who had many siblings,
especially younger sisters.

669
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,569
You're like me.

670
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,698
I've wanted an older brother or sister.

671
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:23,661
I can't be your sister,
but would you like me to be your brother?

672
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:25,829
Sure.

673
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,791
We should celebrate today with some wine.

674
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,507
What kind of house wine do you have?

675
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,261
Let's drop the honorifics from now on.

676
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,837
I need to teach my princess
how to swim soon.

677
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,213
When?

678
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,757
When it gets warmer.

679
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,305
Let's learn how to swim together.

680
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,182
-Lucky you.
-Okay.

681
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,184
Yeon-ju.

682
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:11,768
Aren't you hungry?

683
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,856
-Do you want something to eat?
-Yes.

684
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,275
Okay. Let's go.

685
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,960
-Cheers.
-How have you been?

686
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,381
The wine tastes good today.

687
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,007
It's nice here.

688
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,051
-Isn't it?
-It's pretty nice.

689
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,723
-I'm glad we came.
-Hye-ryung, I thought you were hungry.

690
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,643
The wine tastes good today.

691
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,146
She's watching what she eats.

692
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,565
What do you want?

693
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,400
Let's meet like this sometimes.

694
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,318
-It's fun.
-Sure.

695
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:50,075
Seoul is so beautiful.

696
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:54,037
Well, during the day…
I wouldn't say it looks dreary,

697
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,831
but it looks a bit cold.

698
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,173
We're not in a hurry.
You can take your time.

699
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,800
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

700
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,431
Which way is Building 107?

701
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:21,393
This is our first time here too.
But I'm sure there's a sign.

702
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,105
We're here.

703
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,149
Is this it?

704
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,112
-Is this Building 107?
-Yes.

705
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,447
How much is it?

706
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,618
-I forgot to exchange my bills.
-You can pay me later.

707
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,954
Wait.

708
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:45,709
Put this on.

709
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,961
You'll catch a cold if it's chilly.

710
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,130
What about you?

711
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,506
I don't get cold easily

712
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,008
Put it on.

713
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,094
Take your time.

714
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,263
-Can you open the trunk?
-Sure.

715
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,865
-I'll be back soon.
-Okay.

716
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,117
I can carry one of them.

717
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:21,286
-Do you know the passcode?
-Yes.

718
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,959
Door opening.

719
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,055
-What is it?
-I thought we were talking casually.

720
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:46,686
-It suits you.
-It's really warm and light.

721
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,897
Then keep it. It's my gift.

722
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,917
It's nicer than I thought.

723
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:11,711
Someone should've been here
to welcome you.

724
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:15,090
You came all the way from LA
only to enter the empty house alone.

725
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,967
But I'm not alone.

726
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,719
Had you not tripped over me,
you would've been.

727
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,848
And he let me stay here for free.

728
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:26,017
Didn't you say your father helped him out
when he studied abroad?

729
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,520
This isn't free.
He's repaying the kindness.

730
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:31,523
And in that case,
he should've been more considerate.

731
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,902
Will you be okay on your own?

732
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:40,323
What if I say no? Will you stay with me?

733
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,158
Come with me. We have two empty rooms.

734
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,787
Don't worry about me, and go home.
The driver is waiting.

735
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:47,497
Right.

736
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,083
It's chilly. You can have it.
Or give it back next time.

737
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:57,173
The room temperature was 24°C,
so I'll set it at 27°C.

738
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,508
Okay.

739
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:02,345
You can unpack now.
Right. Sit down for a minute.

740
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:06,892
Things to remember.

741
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,895
Don't open the door for anyone from now.

742
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,107
Even if the building manager comes,
chain the door before you open it.

743
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,902
-Is the owner Mr. Ko?
-Yes.

744
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,154
Don't let him inside the house either.

745
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,906
Always lock the door.

746
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:24,492
Do you understand? You need to be careful.

747
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:27,787
Women who are on their own
need to be careful, wherever they go.

748
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:31,124
-Okay.
-And don't go clubbing.

749
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,293
Do you like to dance?

750
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,003
No, not really.

751
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:36,963
I'll get going, then.

752
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,051
Keep that on until it gets warmer.

753
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,641
Don't come out.
Call me if anything happens.

754
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,685
-You have my business card, right?
-Don't you want my number?

755
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,812
Send me a text once you're done unpacking.

756
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:05,784
Okay. Thank you so much for today.

757
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:07,619
And thanks for the delicious dinner.

758
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:09,454
Yu-sin.

759
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:15,752
Text me.

760
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,041
He was literally crawling around.

761
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,959
Hey, he's here.

762
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,045
Have a glass.

763
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,463
-Let's drink.
-Sure.

764
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:44,215
-He's so handsome.
-Right?

765
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,551
He looks a bit old, but…

766
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:47,635
Did you drive here?

767
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,638
No, I took a cab.
Are you calling for a chauffeur?

768
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:51,765
No, my husband.

769
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,809
-We should have another bottle.
-We should.

770
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,312
-Hye-ryung.
-Yes?

771
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:59,230
Are you guys still lovey-dovey?

772
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,774
Isn't it obvious?

773
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:02,901
Does he listen to you?

774
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:06,446
Don't men who are a couple of years
younger tend to talk back?

775
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,530
He's not like that.

776
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,700
Have you ever shown him
your true self? No, right?

777
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:14,496
-What true self?
-You're terrifying when you get mad.

778
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,670
Come pick me up.

779
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:26,591
I met up with Do-hui and Seo-yun.
I had a few drinks.

780
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:28,134
We're at Crystal Bar.

781
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,890
It's like I'm living with a queen,
not a wife.

782
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:48,571
What were you praying for so earnestly?

783
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:50,740
Don't mind me.

784
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,326
Why shouldn't I care? I'm your sister.

785
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:56,412
I prayed that I'll be able to meet
someone like Mom.

786
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,373
A loving wife like her.

787
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:08,424
Lord, I pray that I'll meet a man
who is giving and considerate.

788
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:15,431
Women feel the same way.
What do you think?

789
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:18,059
-About what?
-Imagine you're a woman.

790
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:21,646
Would you like a man who always receives
or one that always gives?

791
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:25,275
-One that always gives.
-So?

792
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:30,447
You should be successful
and treat the love of your life well.

793
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,908
Women will leave their men
if they're stingy. They won't love them.

794
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,785
-Do you know why?
-I do.

795
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,663
Because they prefer money to the man.
They're superficial.

796
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:44,419
If a man is being stingy,

797
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,588
that means he doesn't love her.

798
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:48,673
You'd give anything for love.

799
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,967
Look at Mom and Dad.

800
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:55,305
If a man is sincere and devoted,
his wife will love him dearly.

801
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,767
Let's say there are two men.

802
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:01,311
One is very rich.

803
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,980
The other is kind but poor.

804
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:06,316
Mom didn't marry Dad
because he was wealthy.

805
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,818
She fell in love with his heart.

806
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,613
During his second year of university,
he wanted to treat her

807
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,491
to a fancy hotel dinner for her birthday.

808
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:17,160
So he worked at a construction site
for ten days.

809
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,537
-Really?
-Yes.

810
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,247
Her family was rich.

811
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:25,376
But all he could bought her was
cheap noodles, tteokbokki, and gimbap.

812
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,545
His heart broke
as he watched her eat that.

813
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:32,884
She still can't forget the taste
of the spaghetti and the steak.

814
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:38,431
Imagine working at a construction site
during the summer.

815
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,849
It'd be exhausting.

816
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,727
Just standing under the sun
is scorching hot.

817
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,481
That's what true love is.

818
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:48,274
Will you be able to do that?

819
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,235
I'm not sure to be honest.

820
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:53,446
Then you won't be able to meet
someone like Mom. Dream on.

821
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,991
I should treat them well.

822
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:59,869
But you shouldn't be good
to every girl out there.

823
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,204
You're not a fool.

824
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:06,167
Only do so to the girl
you believe deserves your love.

825
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:11,381
Do you think you can devote yourself
like Mom does?

826
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,800
Of course. I learned from the best.

827
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:19,222
But do you think someone that great
would like you?

828
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,641
I'm a queen, you know?

829
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,643
That's your opinion. Or a delusion.

830
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,603
Just wait and see.

831
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,025
She'll come to her senses sooner or later.

832
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:35,363
-Dad!
-Hey.

833
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,450
I've missed you, Ji-a.

834
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,327
Me too.

835
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,165
Why are you home so late
when you just had dinner?

836
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,542
It's not that late.

837
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,628
And I had a glass of wine. Just one glass.

838
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,715
-Iced tea?
-No.

839
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:57,677
I have to do the laundry.

840
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,305
It can wait. It's been five days.

841
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:02,932
No, it's been six days since we last met.

842
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,267
Take those off.

843
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,357
-Looking for your gift?
-Yes.

844
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,569
I'm sorry, but I didn't buy one this time.

845
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:16,029
-Liar.
-I'm serious.

846
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,831
He really didn't buy anything for you.

847
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,335
Dad.

848
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,006
He didn't get me anything either.

849
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:37,175
Ji-a was so excited.

850
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:39,177
You disappointed her this time.

851
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:44,849
What did you want?

852
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:46,643
-Anything.
-Be more specific.

853
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:49,896
A gift is a gift.
There's no need to be specific.

854
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:53,441
I thought about it,
and there was nothing you didn't have.

855
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,194
You have plenty of clothes and dolls.

856
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:58,154
I'm too old for dolls.

857
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,364
You have many pens too.

858
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,908
Didn't you even bother
to buy me some chocolate?

859
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,368
Yes.

860
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:09,707
What? How could you hit me?

861
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,044
Sit down, Ji-a.

862
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:23,137
You should only buy things
that you really need.

863
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,514
That's true.

864
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:28,893
Look at how clean and tidy our house is.

865
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:32,397
Your mom and I only buy things
that we really need.

866
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,733
If I ever buy you gifts,
I guess you won't like them

867
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:36,943
if you don't need them.

868
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,696
I've bought you so many gifts until now

869
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,948
for your birthday and when I went abroad.

870
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,951
You feel happy when you receive them,
but that's it.

871
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,911
Most of them are stored somewhere.

872
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:51,082
You outgrow your clothes quickly.
They won't last long.

873
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:53,835
Isn't it a waste to buy things
that you won't even use?

874
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:55,294
That's true.

875
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:58,464
They say those who stop the scolding…

876
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,382
I mean,

877
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:03,302
those who stop the fight
are worse than those who scold you.

878
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,805
Why are you getting mad at me?

879
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:09,308
Why am I getting blamed for this?
Are you mad at me?

880
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:12,770
You often see on TV how kids in Africa
suffer from poverty.

881
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:16,816
Compared to them,
you're living a life of luxury.

882
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,277
Do we not have chocolate at home?

883
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,194
We do,

884
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:22,864
but it feels different
when you buy it for me.

885
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,950
Anyway, I would like you

886
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:29,662
to only buy things that you need
from now on.

887
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:33,666
Think at least three times
whether you really need them or not.

888
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:38,337
If you start buying things
just for the sake of it,

889
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,465
not only will you be wasting your money,

890
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,550
but it will also overwhelm you.

891
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,094
Do you understand?

892
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:48,931
You don't?

893
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:55,229
What a good girl.

894
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:58,566
You should go shower.

895
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:00,485
Besides, Korean things are the best.

896
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,653
There wasn't anything to buy.

897
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:06,532
Dad, in that case,
could you give me some money?

898
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,953
-Money?
-Yes. As a gift.

899
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,256
My face is so red.

900
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:27,094
Why do I need to pee so often these days?

901
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,685
I need to take this.

902
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,646
I need to go to the restroom.

903
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:50,451
Hello.

904
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:53,287
That took a while.

905
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:57,250
-You recognized me earlier, didn't you?
-I did.

906
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:00,169
We'll be working together now.

907
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,087
Right.

908
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:04,882
You could've said hi first, couldn't you?

909
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:08,678
-Do you want an iced coffee?
-Your name was…

910
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:13,266
What was it again? I'm sorry.

911
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,894
-It's Seo Ban.
-Right. Seo Ban.

912
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:20,815
-I'm the executive manager.
-Yes, sir. Mr. Seo.

913
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:26,529
We should say hi to each other
from now on.

914
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,531
-Sure.
-Look.

915
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,283
Mr. Seo.

916
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:35,830
How about elaborating when you talk?

917
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,042
I'm not trying to give you advice.

918
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:42,169
But…

919
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,173
you don't seem approachable.

920
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:50,511
-I'm sorry for not greeting--
-If you are, tell me the reason.

921
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:53,055
-Maybe next time.
-When I'm sober?

922
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:57,476
I told you. You should elaborate more.

923
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,270
I'm not that considerate.

924
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,856
You're not that considerate?

925
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:07,653
I wonder why you're not that considerate.

926
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:11,574
I'd like a glass of that.

927
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:13,242
I think you've had enough.

928
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,369
Do you know him?

929
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:21,083
-Who are you?
-Hello.

930
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,586
You are so handsome.

931
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,882
You know that, don't you?

932
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:29,884
I said I want a glass of that.

933
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:36,474
This wench's totally hammered today.

934
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:39,018
Mr. Seo.

935
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:40,519
Yes?

936
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:43,272
Tell me the reason.

937
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:47,109
Shouldn't you keep an eye
on your bags and clothes?

938
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:53,407
Hi, honey.

939
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:55,701
This is my husband.

940
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,788
He's the engineer and executive manager.

941
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:01,415
Hello.

942
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,377
Hello. She came with her friends.

943
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:07,672
I see.

944
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:09,715
-Pay the bill.
-Okay.

945
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,134
Wait. We did pay.

946
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,053
-Ban.
-Hey.

947
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:18,307
-See you.
-Okay. I'll invite you over some time.

948
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:20,309
Let's go.

949
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:26,691
Mr. Seo, you're so cold.

950
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,317
Come on.

951
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:34,407
Isn't that Boo Hye-ryung?

952
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:36,617
The chauffeur's here.

953
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:39,036
She looks much better in person.

954
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,788
Wasn't it hilarious?

955
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:43,124
-Did you see how she made a mistake?
-Yes.

956
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:48,963
-Where should we go next?
-Next?

957
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:51,173
-It was so funny.
-Wasn't it nice here?

958
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:35,468
Who sat next to you?

959
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,219
Who sat next to you on the plane?

960
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:40,181
I love the car, but I know it wasn't
easy for you to save up the money.

961
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:42,475
-It wasn't that hard.
-I'll do better.

962
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,852
Dongmi's leg is swollen!

963
01:07:44,935 --> 01:07:46,812
You care about a dog's legs
more than my fingers?

964
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,022
But they're not swollen.

965
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:49,982
You know what they say
about never sharing recipes.

966
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,485
Exhale as you stand up. Exhale.

967
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:56,155
-Look forward, please.
-Is your jacket in your car?

968
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,531
You didn't bring it home.

969
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,076
I gave it to that friend.

970
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,536
-Isn't that expensive?
-Hello.

971
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,704
Hello.

972
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:06,791
I have a favor.

973
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:08,209
Will you grant it?

974
01:08:13,714 --> 01:08:18,719
