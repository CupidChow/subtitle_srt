00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:00,018
EPISODE 3

2
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:00,935
Explain.

3
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,276
INPUT PATTERN

4
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,570
NONHYEON-DONG

5
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,741
NONHYEON-DONG

6
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,130
No, wait.

7
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,299
Damn it!

8
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,519
Who is it?

9
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,270
A woman?

10
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,029
Are you cheating?

11
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,083
Call her.

12
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,626
Let's talk inside.

13
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,693
I'm seeing someone.

14
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,946
-I'm sorry.
-If you kill someone,

15
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,698
will an apology cut it?

16
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,076
I'm asking you since you're a lawyer.

17
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,204
Would apologizing after a murder
make one innocent?

18
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,792
You had an affair?

19
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,129
Was there anything physical?

20
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:52,964
Did you sleep with her?

21
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,613
Who is she?
Does she live in Nonhyeon-dong?

22
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,658
Tell me everything in detail
like a lawyer does!

23
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,286
What if I tell you?

24
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,165
That won't make you feel any better.

25
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,666
Since when?

26
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,544
-It doesn't matter.
-Doesn't it?

27
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,963
Then what does matter? Tell me!

28
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,301
-You won't forgive me anyway.
-Of course not.

29
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,969
So what?

30
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,056
Bring her here
or let me talk to her on the phone.

31
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,766
Answer me!

32
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,976
Let me think about it.

33
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,856
Think about what?
Is this the time for that?

34
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,025
Were you even thinking
when you were cheating?

35
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,027
This is adultery, isn't it?

36
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,906
Were you being rational
when you were committing adultery?

37
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,534
You're not even begging forgiveness.

38
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,078
Are you even human?

39
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,045
Hold on.

40
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,506
Let me stop this bleeding.

41
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,018
DEAR HUSBAND

42
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,405
Where are you?

43
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,336
Don't people say that you look better
in person?

44
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,296
-Do I?
-Yes.

45
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,800
Do you have any upcoming performances?
I want to watch one.

46
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:43,968
I'm preparing for one.

47
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,970
By the way, my name's Nam Ga-bin.

48
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,139
I'm A Mi. That's my real name.

49
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,600
I'm Song Won.

50
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,609
How about a late lunch
slash early dinner tomorrow?

51
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,902
So we won't gain weight.

52
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,572
I'd love that.

53
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,826
Im Young-woong is amazing.

54
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,995
He's a hero.

55
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,455
Dong-mi.

56
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,374
You're so pretty. You really are.

57
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,087
Honey.

58
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,089
Honey!

59
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,100
Get up.

60
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,143
Why did you wake me up?

61
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,021
I think you love Dongmi more than me.

62
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,523
You even dreamed about her.

63
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,068
I did?

64
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,986
Are you tired from our Busan trip?

65
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,989
-You've aged.
-I just ate too much.

66
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,533
Did you call Sa-hyeon?

67
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,327
He came because he missed my food.

68
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,080
How do you know?
Do you read people's minds now?

69
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,916
Do you want to make a bet?
He must have no food left at home.

70
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,709
What are you talking about?

71
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,629
Last time I checked,
his fridge was full of food.

72
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,798
I filled it up.

73
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,967
But what's the use? They don't eat it.

74
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,594
Call him and ask him why he came by.

75
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,766
I think our eldest son's here.

76
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,061
It's me.

77
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,020
Hye-ryung?

78
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,523
Come in.

79
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,196
What brings you here at this hour?

80
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,240
Is Sa-hyeon in the bathroom?

81
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,992
No, it's just me.

82
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,037
Is something wrong?

83
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,291
Sa-hyeon stopped by this afternoon.

84
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,417
Did you two fight?

85
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,878
-Would you like tea or fruit?
-Water, please.

86
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,504
What about dinner?

87
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,132
Sa-hyeon is seeing a woman.

88
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,179
-A woman?
-He's cheating on me.

89
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,931
Is Sa-hyeon cheating?

90
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,017
-Yes.
-Are you sure?

91
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,436
He acknowledged it.

92
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,731
I just found out.

93
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,818
-Who is it?
-He won't tell.

94
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,780
That little…

95
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,783
He's just refusing to tell me anything.

96
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,578
-Tell him to come right now.
-You should be the one to call.

97
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,621
Call him then.

98
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,500
DEAR HUSBAND

99
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,839
-Where are you?
-It's me.

100
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,759
-Hello, Mom.
-Come here this instant.

101
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,469
Is Dad there too?

102
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,721
I have my reasons.

103
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,681
-Hide all the golf clubs--
-Come here!

104
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,187
Okay.

105
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,901
Did you not suspect him?

106
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,569
No.

107
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,322
You should calm down first.

108
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,033
Things like this could happen
in a marriage.

109
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,536
But Sa-hyeon of all people?
I just can't believe it.

110
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,497
You're right.
I know I gave birth to him, but…

111
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,668
He's just not the type.

112
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,462
And he calls himself a man…

113
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,132
Maybe he got drunk at a bar
and got carried away.

114
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,177
-Right, honey?
-What do you mean?

115
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,931
Did I ever get carried away
and make such a mistake?

116
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,517
Watch what you say.
She might get the wrong idea.

117
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,235
Hey, hide this somewhere.

118
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,153
If he asks you, say you can't find it.

119
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,363
Yes, ma'am.

120
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,073
In the storage.

121
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:47,545
Mom, there's this one menace in our class.

122
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,423
They refused to listen
to the teacher's warnings,

123
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,050
so the teacher told them to read a book
during breaktime.

124
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,595
-Your homeroom teacher did?
-Yes.

125
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,597
And surprisingly, that menace

126
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,600
started reading a book quietly.

127
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,437
So I went over and said,
"What are you doing, buddy?"

128
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,522
They were reading a comic book.

129
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,734
-He's a boy, right?
-Yes.

130
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,737
You usually call him buddy?

131
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,823
No, I just didn't want to tell you
his real name.

132
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,242
Goodness.
Because it's not about a good thing?

133
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,244
Yes.

134
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,496
Look at how thoughtful she is.

135
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,957
It wouldn't have mattered
to tell us his name.

136
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,876
We wouldn't know him anyway.

137
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,547
You're right. You're such an angel.
A wise one at that.

138
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,257
You respected his privacy.

139
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,388
You're drinking alone?

140
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,349
I couldn't sleep.

141
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,601
It's probably due to lack of exercise.

142
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,729
Tell Yu-sin to come join us
for golfing tomorrow.

143
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,608
MS. KIM

144
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,943
Your mom's calling.

145
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,737
You pick it up.

146
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,741
Hello, Mother.

147
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,244
-Is Yu-sin taking a shower?
-Yes.

148
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,954
Are you guys free tomorrow?

149
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,958
Your father-in-law wants to go golfing.
It's been a while.

150
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,552
He has no respect for me

151
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,721
because I have no family here.

152
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,057
Don't be ridiculous.

153
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,853
Don't call your parents and worry them.
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

154
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:29,814
Your mascara is running.

155
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,651
How could it be nothing serious?

156
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,152
Don't cry.

157
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,946
If you go to work with swollen eyes--

158
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,073
It's just a recording on the weekends.

159
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,659
You're also our daughter.

160
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,662
We've been married
for less than three years.

161
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,539
How could he?

162
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,165
This could be better

163
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,502
than him getting into an accident.

164
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:55,005
People get into random accidents
and get hurt or die.

165
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,258
My heart has been ripped into pieces.

166
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,428
Was he ever
in a serious relationship before?

167
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,515
-No, he was busy studying.
-He was.

168
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,599
A fellow law student.

169
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,437
Her father had a big herbal market
at Gyeongdong Market.

170
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,688
Her mother…

171
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,818
Is she married?

172
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,028
We don't know.

173
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,781
That was ages ago.

174
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,491
How long did it last?

175
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,410
Less than a year.

176
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,538
It must be some girl from a bar.

177
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,624
If not, why would Sa-hyeon cheat
on such a beautiful, well-known--

178
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,710
Her number was saved as "Nonhyeon-dong."

179
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,754
Exactly. That just means
they're not that close--

180
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,600
Dongmi, we'll play later.

181
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,068
What's going on?

182
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,988
Is everything she told us true?

183
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,658
-Yes.
-You're dead meat.

184
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,496
Honey! Let's hear him out first!

185
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,497
Sit down.

186
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,710
They say one bad apple spoils the bunch.

187
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,504
Who's she? How did you meet her?

188
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,381
-That doesn't matter.
-Then what does?

189
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:23,594
You're still wet behind the ears.
You should've been busy focusing on work.

190
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,513
You know I'm hardworking.

191
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,349
Is she your ex? From your law school?

192
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,934
-No.
-Then who?

193
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,727
Does that matter?

194
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,270
Here you go again.

195
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:39,944
Calm down.

196
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,655
They say being rational is the solution
to all troubles.

197
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,574
-You should be levelheaded--
-Are you repenting?

198
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,034
I know it wasn't right.

199
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,161
Look at him squirming his way out.

200
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,413
He's not acknowledging he's at fault.

201
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,665
It's because of his job.

202
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,708
What does that have to do with this?

203
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,585
It's just what he does as a lawyer.

204
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,756
I didn't do anything wrong,
but you're bashing me in front of her.

205
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,259
As the chairman of the club,
you're good at golfing.

206
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,555
And he answers back like this
because he's a lawyer.

207
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,348
It's instinctive.

208
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,142
Tell her you're sorry
and that it won't happen again.

209
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,270
Demand a written promise.

210
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,981
How will I trust him?
He completely deceived me.

211
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,693
Tell me. Have I ever caused trouble
with something like this?

212
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,113
-Have I ever broken your mom's heart?
-No.

213
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,324
Then how could a lawyer do such a thing?

214
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,994
I had no idea this was his true face.

215
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,620
Does she know you're married?

216
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,581
Yes.

217
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,459
Of course she knows. He's wearing a ring.

218
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,086
He could've taken it off.

219
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,883
-Let me see her photo.
-I don't have the phone.

220
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,844
Sa-hyeon, is this who you really are?

221
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,637
You'd stoop so low?

222
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,139
What will you do about this?

223
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,684
You must know her number.
Bring her here this instant!

224
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,313
Is she pretty? Prettier than her?

225
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,356
Does that even matter right now?

226
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,650
He must've fallen for her looks.

227
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,277
No.

228
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,781
She approached you,
knowing you were a lawyer

229
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,619
and the son of a country club owner.
Am I right?

230
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,870
-No.
-Then?

231
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,288
It doesn't matter.

232
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,582
Then what matters?

233
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,127
What will you do?
Let's put an end to this tonight!

234
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,879
Ask her for forgiveness now.

235
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,802
You can't forgive me, right?

236
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,140
I know I was wrong.

237
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:34,850
I'll do as you say.

238
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,811
What do you mean?

239
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,813
You'll get a divorce if I say so?

240
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,148
Yes.

241
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,197
Honey! Please!

242
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,823
You're not from a broken family.

243
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,284
We won't allow that.

244
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,454
How dare you utter such a thing
in front of us?

245
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,040
Let's do it.

246
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,919
He just feels terrible
and doesn't know what to do.

247
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,338
Ask her for forgiveness. Now!

248
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,882
Man up and acknowledge your mistakes.

249
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,268
I'm sorry.

250
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,937
You're just sorry?

251
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,483
I'm sorry for worrying you.

252
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,277
Is this why you came by this afternoon?

253
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,737
Yes.

254
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,366
He wanted to tell the truth
and take care of this situation.

255
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,243
There are many ways to do that,

256
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,620
and I know what she's like.

257
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,000
Can you forgive me?

258
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,293
-Imagine being in my shoes.
-Exactly.

259
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,422
-So what do you want to do?
-He's kneeling.

260
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,965
He values actions above words.

261
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,591
I also think

262
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,512
our trust has been broken.
We can't go back.

263
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,390
It's all up to you.
You just need to put an end to it.

264
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,808
Let me talk to him.

265
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,689
What's her name?

266
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,404
Do you love her?

267
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,452
Tell me the truth.

268
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,621
Is it love?

269
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,585
Stop talking nonsense!

270
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,380
Ma'am!

271
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,634
This. The club. My golf club!

272
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,804
-I don't know where it is.
-Front door!

273
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:36,764
Yes, sir.

274
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,727
Are you out of your mind?

275
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,688
We're done talking then.

276
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,026
Hye-ryung, sit back down.

277
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,989
Cornering him won't fix anything.

278
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,786
Didn't you marry Hye-ryung
because you couldn't live without her?

279
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,956
Being naive, you're taking
your fleeting emotions too seriously.

280
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,502
How long has it been
for you to call it love?

281
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,922
A man can only love once.

282
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,509
You told me that before, didn't you?

283
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,304
Whether it's love or not,
ask her for forgiveness and end it today.

284
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,308
Tell him you'll do so.

285
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,354
I'm sorry, Dad.

286
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,898
-You won't end it?
-No.

287
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,234
You bastard!

288
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,574
No, Hye-ryung! Go stop her!

289
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,993
Give me your key. I'll send Mr. Kim.

290
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,545
You better take care of this!

291
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,603
Dongmi, sorry. See you next time.

292
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,171
This is why I told him…

293
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,383
to reconsider marrying her.

294
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,680
I'm sure he's fallen for a younger girl.

295
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,558
He finally realized it's difficult

296
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,436
to live with an older, spoiled woman.

297
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,563
Hye-ryung has quite an ego.

298
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,857
She won't let this pass.

299
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,409
Are you even human?

300
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,995
How long has it been?

301
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,663
Answer me.

302
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,623
This is between us.

303
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,083
Was I talking about someone else?

304
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,711
You're the one who deceived me,
not someone else.

305
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,213
I'm driving right now.

306
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,551
Stop the car.

307
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,013
-Stop it.
-And then?

308
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,514
I'm going to take a cab.

309
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,141
We're almost there.

310
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,018
No, we're not.

311
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,665
-She's asleep.
-Okay.

312
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,752
-Isn't this refreshing?
-Yes.

313
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,338
Let's do this often. Ji-a likes it.

314
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,507
We should while we still can.

315
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,677
Once she's in middle school,
she'll hate it and be busy studying.

316
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,639
I doubt she'd be like that.

317
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,684
You shouldn't expect anything
from your child.

318
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,144
They won't grow up
exactly the way you want them to.

319
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,771
Not every child is like that.

320
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,030
This is good.

321
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,075
The ambiance is definitely important
when having wine.

322
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:25,993
Not for me.

323
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,329
It's about who I'm with.

324
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,124
It'd taste bad if I was by myself.

325
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,878
I'm going to enjoy my wine tonight.

326
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,799
Don't drink too much.
We have to check out early.

327
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,594
Will you be okay? You could've said no
if you're too tired.

328
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:45,762
Tired?

329
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,432
Golfing will rejuvenate me.

330
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,977
I know Ji-a's our child,
but I'm so proud of her.

331
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,438
It's not like we'd tell someone else.

332
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,565
I would've mentioned his name
to my family.

333
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,444
How could a 12-year-old think
about respecting her friend's privacy?

334
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:04,197
You're right.
She's better than some adults.

335
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,826
There are many who blabber
without thinking these days,

336
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,786
who can't act their age.

337
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,165
She takes after someone.

338
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,126
And it's obviously her wise mom.

339
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,755
She has your character.

340
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,007
You're a very thoughtful man.

341
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,970
You're right. I have good genes,

342
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,555
and you taught her well.

343
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:32,017
Thanks to you, I can focus on my hospital
with no concerns.

344
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,979
You're a wonderful father and husband.

345
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,355
You're excellent.

346
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,526
They say compliments can even make
a whale dance.

347
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,530
But you're the only woman
who makes my spirit dance.

348
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,165
Come here.

349
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,543
Forget it.

350
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,795
Come on.

351
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,723
You should send her a text.

352
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,683
And say what?

353
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:17,145
Tell her to trust us and calm down.

354
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,106
That's easier said than done.

355
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,817
She never saw this coming.

356
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,070
And "dead meat"? You sounded so ignorant.

357
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,114
How dare you say that?

358
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,783
Imagine what Hye-ryung must've thought

359
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,452
when she heard her father-in-law say that.

360
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,163
My face got so red when I heard it.

361
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,416
Those were hot flushes
due to your menopause, not me.

362
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,961
Some professor said on TV

363
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:45,298
that refinement comes from one's words,
not one's clothing.

364
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,593
I'll pack some clothes for now.

365
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,472
Once the papers are submitted,
I'll take all my belongings.

366
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,308
You must already have a place to stay.

367
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:59,020
Hyo-seong said I could stay
at his other studio apartment.

368
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,984
Everything else will be the same.

369
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,028
My paycheck will be wired to you as usual.

370
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,029
Do you think they've departed?

371
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,699
Of course. They're always the first
to arrive.

372
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:59,539
If I didn't have to golf today,
I would've visited them

373
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,249
to see how they're doing.

374
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,211
They probably argued all night.

375
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:05,921
You know how Hye-ryung is.

376
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,923
She probably bashed him all night.

377
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,759
What if she keeps him awake
and torments him for days?

378
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,345
-He deserves it.
-I hope she didn't hit him.

379
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,097
She's pretty,

380
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,516
but she can be quite cold-hearted.

381
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,189
LAWYER PAN SA-HYEON

382
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,024
Why would Hye-ryung's husband call me?

383
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,654
Hello?

384
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,821
Hello.

385
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,532
I'm not sure if you remember me,

386
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,660
but I'm Lawyer Pan Sa-hyeon.

387
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,745
I gave you advice
regarding your friend last year.

388
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,248
Of course, I do. Hello.

389
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,416
I'm sorry for calling you so early.

390
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,627
It's okay. I'm outside anyway.

391
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,630
Did Hye-ryung call you by any chance?

392
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,714
No.

393
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,051
Did something happen?

394
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,636
Well, yes.

395
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:59,182
We had a fight last night. I woke up,
and she's not here. And her phone's off.

396
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,393
Oh, my.

397
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,144
Do you know where she could be?

398
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,230
Let me think.

399
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,941
Okay.

400
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,194
It's nothing serious, right?

401
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,868
-Pi-young.
-Yes?

402
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,912
Promise me you won't disappear on me

403
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,831
even if I upset you.

404
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,457
Who knows?

405
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,251
During lunchtime,

406
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,379
the nursing director gave us men
some advice.

407
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,132
She said we should reconcile
on the same day.

408
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,759
We should make up before going to bed.

409
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,803
We did that most of the time.

410
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,328
-Did Director Joo arrive?
-Yes, he did.

411
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,227
Come in.

412
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,950
PARK HAE-RYUN

413
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,539
Are you Mr. Park Hae-gang's brother?

414
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,001
Yes. He's my older brother.

415
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:55,799
We were in the same club.
We were different majors though.

416
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,093
I see.

417
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,765
You guys look like twins.
You look so alike.

418
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:07,185
We are. He was born 15 minutes early.

419
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,315
What's he up to these days?
We lost touch after graduating.

420
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:15,777
He died.

421
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:20,949
When?

422
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,867
When he was 32 years old.

423
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,538
How?

424
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,498
It was an accident.

425
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,847
-Is this new?
-Yes.

426
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,975
Does it look too young?

427
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,687
All golf clothes are like that.

428
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,356
You're so stylish.

429
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,234
You look like
you're in your 30s from behind.

430
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:11,332
Since we're the same age,
let's speak casually.

431
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,917
Sure.

432
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,297
You seem pretty healthy.

433
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:21,217
It's just that I've gotten older.

434
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:25,263
So I thought I should get
some restoratives like my friends.

435
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,391
Is your stamina getting worse?

436
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,811
Not really, but I just thought
it'd be nice to take some.

437
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,613
KOREAN MEDICINE DOCTOR CERTIFICATE

438
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,160
Do you live around here?

439
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,204
You too?

440
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,997
No, I live in Pyeongchang-dong.

441
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,373
That's a nice neighborhood.

442
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,918
Your wife is beautiful.

443
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,753
One son?

444
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,923
Yes. We got married a bit late.

445
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,674
Bring your wife next time.

446
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,344
I'll give her some good restoratives
as well.

447
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,764
She doesn't like to take them.

448
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,829
That was a good one.

449
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,649
I'm getting a bit hungry.

450
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,776
Please go to the restaurant.

451
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,152
Okay.

452
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,198
She was amazing. She's a good golfer.

453
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,661
Do you spend all day practicing?

454
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,622
You're right. I practice every day.

455
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,917
-She's definitely improved.
-Stop it.

456
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,545
I'm just trying not to be
an inconvenience.

457
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,757
Lucky you.
You can golf every day for free.

458
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,260
-She's not too interested in golfing.
-What?

459
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,220
Then what interests you?

460
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,931
Household chores, of course. Right?

461
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,309
No. It's nagging you.

462
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:38,688
All husbands may seem like
they're in charge,

463
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:42,817
but in fact, they're being controlled
by their wives.

464
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,612
That's not true. He's…

465
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,572
-All right.
-Here.

466
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,869
-I love the view.
-Yes, it is.

467
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,926
Do you know them?

468
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,969
-Don't you think it's beautiful?
-Yes.

469
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:19,812
Excuse me.

470
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,357
Are you…

471
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,279
Kim Dong-mi by any chance?

472
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,197
Dong-mi?

473
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,407
Yes.

474
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,041
May I ask who you are?

475
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,385
Who are you?

476
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:54,555
Did you use to live in Jinui-myeon,
Yeongi-gun?

477
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:56,891
Yes.

478
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,063
Are you Mr. Kim Su-gil's only child?

479
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:06,943
Yes.

480
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,406
I'm the son of the chicken farm owner.

481
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:19,247
-Goodness. Are you Pan--
-Mun-ho.

482
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,165
Oh, dear.

483
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,876
-Goodness.
-You haven't changed.

484
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,171
Not one bit.

485
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,340
He's a hometown friend.

486
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,301
Goodness, it's nice to meet you.

487
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,178
Hello, I'm Pan Mun-ho.

488
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,305
He's the owner of this country club.

489
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,517
I see. I'm sorry, but I didn't bring
my business card.

490
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,103
This is my son and his wife.

491
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:45,023
-Hello.
-It's nice to meet you.

492
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,613
She's my wife.

493
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,324
-Hello.
-Hello.

494
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,952
Where are my suitcases?

495
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,456
In Hyang-gi's room.

496
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,167
No. In the closet on the veranda.

497
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,191
Dad.

498
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,862
-Yes?
-I want to talk with you.

499
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,076
Are you packing your bags?

500
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,871
Yes.

501
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:47,001
When Mom told us about you,
U-ram and I were shook up.

502
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,255
I'm sorry.

503
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,467
I just don't get it.

504
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,887
I tried thinking in your shoes.

505
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,723
I know

506
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,643
this is between you and Mom.

507
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,479
But it's still not right

508
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,065
for any of us.

509
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:14,612
Many people live to 80 or 90 nowadays.

510
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:18,533
You guys are just 50 years old
and have been married for 20 years.

511
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,285
You may have known each other
for 30 years,

512
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,123
but U-ram is only 12, and I'm 20.

513
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,251
We still need our parents.

514
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,420
We need both you and Mom.

515
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:33,714
We'll be emotionally stable that way.

516
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,550
Nothing will change.

517
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,261
I will fulfill my duties.

518
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,389
I'll support you financially
until you get married.

519
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,808
I'll just be living elsewhere.

520
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,935
I heard you want to be
officially divorced.

521
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,438
Do you think you can buy a family?

522
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,317
No, you can't.

523
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,281
Even if we go broke and have to starve…

524
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,409
Even if you lose your job
and can't make any money,

525
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,037
we won't turn our backs on you.

526
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,539
We can eat gruel.

527
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,250
U-ram and I just need our parents.

528
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,630
I did disappoint you once.

529
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,633
When you were against it,

530
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:21,053
I chose to major in drama and theater arts
then backed out.

531
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:26,058
Once I get into another college,
I'll work part-time and chip in.

532
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,227
I won't disappoint you again.

533
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,480
So please do the same for us.

534
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,400
I'm not actually disappointed.

535
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,654
I'm hurt and heartbroken.

536
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,658
Imagine how Mom must feel.

537
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:50,082
Yesterday, I went out with U-ram
and bought him his favorite gelato.

538
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,919
But he couldn't enjoy it.

539
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,839
He asked how we could live

540
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,507
without you.

541
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,470
When U-ram was born,

542
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,473
Mom had a really tough time giving birth.

543
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,310
Remember how happy you were
as you held him?

544
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,272
He's your precious son.

545
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,858
He's your adorable, youngest son.

546
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,611
You shouldn't break his heart.

547
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,488
After all, you're his dad.

548
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,743
Please.

549
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:30,831
Please put off this decision
until U-ram becomes my age.

550
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,422
If you still want a divorce then,
we won't stop you.

551
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,300
We'll willingly let you go.

552
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,720
I will take care of Mom
until the day she dies,

553
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,933
so you can leave with no worries then.

554
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:57,942
She's right.

555
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,069
I feel the same way.

556
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,281
I beg you.

557
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,201
Every time we play catch,

558
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,203
I feel so happy.

559
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,998
Cycling, skating, and skiing.

560
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,125
You taught me all of them.

561
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:19,338
Mom and Hyang-gi are also precious to me,

562
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,008
but I've never thought

563
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,885
about not having you in my life.

564
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,431
The mere thought of it scares me,
and I hate it.

565
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,602
I told you I want to get married one day.

566
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,273
What if our family becomes a flaw
when I do?

567
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,775
Then what'll happen to U-ram and me?

568
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:47,783
If I'd known this would happen
before I was born and had a choice,

569
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,746
then I wouldn't have been born to you two.

570
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,666
You gave birth to us
because you wanted to.

571
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,585
I believe you and Mom's duties

572
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:01,589
as our parents come before

573
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,549
your individual happiness.

574
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,927
I agree.

575
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:12,975
Please keep

576
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:17,438
the promise you made in front of everyone…

577
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,484
on your wedding day.

578
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,905
I'm begging you as your daughter.

579
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,515
Thank you, Lord,

580
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,435
that Hyang-gi and U-ram are--

581
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,436
Mom.

582
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,188
Yes?

583
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,827
Here. We bought this for you.

584
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,914
What is it? What did you buy?

585
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:21,043
Open it. Hurry up.

586
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,818
You can exchange it if you don't like it.

587
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:49,530
U-ram wanted to get you
something pretty to wear.

588
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,657
He's a better child than me.

589
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,661
Let's get out of here
so she can try it on.

590
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,022
What do you learn at the English academy?

591
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,235
Does it fit you well?

592
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:29,737
Yes.

593
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:34,700
You look amazing.

594
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,415
How much did it cost?
I'll give you the money.

595
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,417
It wasn't that expensive.

596
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,376
It's a gift.

597
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,589
Don't just keep it in the closet.
Wear it often, okay?

598
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,967
Okay. Thank you, guys.

599
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,969
We're the ones who are always grateful.

600
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,971
You've taken such good care of us.

601
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,731
-Hey.
-Over here.

602
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,067
-Come on over.
-You're here early.

603
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,737
-Am I late?
-Of course not. We just arrived early.

604
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,739
I'll come earlier from now on.

605
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,367
We've already ordered.

606
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:09,169
Dong-mi. You're so pretty. You really are.

607
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,939
That was close.
You hit it a bit too strong.

608
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,567
Did you two use to date?

609
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,361
With Mun-ho?

610
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,615
I was in elementary school back then.

611
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:38,824
Then why so happy?

612
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:39,950
Me?

613
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,077
No, him.

614
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,164
Because he met someone from hometown.

615
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,168
-Goodness.
-Nice putting.

616
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,129
He's doing well today. How amazing.

617
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,130
Thank you.

618
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,049
Yes, sir. Yes.

619
00:43:56,925 --> 00:44:00,596
Our chairman would like to treat you
to a meal at the clubhouse

620
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:01,889
when you're done.

621
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,184
Burrata salad, beef carpaccio,

622
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:08,103
calamari, rib-eye steak,
and an eggs Benedict.

623
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,021
Correct.

624
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,193
Have you seen After Wedding?

625
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,820
-Yes.
-Wasn't it fun?

626
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,823
Don't you think it's even more dramatic
than Korean dramas?

627
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,659
Just more elegantly disguised.

628
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,827
You're right. It's easy to see

629
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,538
mothers-in-law getting slapped
in American dramas.

630
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,956
Yes, it's so shocking.

631
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,251
When will you be done with work?

632
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:47,476
I even called Ms. Sa.

633
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,854
-I was worried.
-About me?

634
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,151
So you want a divorce.

635
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,239
-Given the situation--
-That's just an excuse.

636
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,618
You're dying to get a divorce.

637
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:07,955
I'll divorce you, but on one condition.

638
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,998
I want to see her in person.

639
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,917
Then I'll sign the papers right away.

640
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:16,046
I have no regrets,
but I must see for myself.

641
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,215
When will you bring her?

642
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,970
I won't grab her hair, so don't worry.

643
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,515
-Anything but that.
-No.

644
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,692
-They'll be here soon.
-Yes, sir.

645
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,488
Was she your first love?

646
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,992
Kim Dong-mi?

647
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:50,789
You just couldn't forget about her,
so you even named our dog after her.

648
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,041
-That's just a coincidence.
-A coincidence?

649
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,085
That's a load of nonsense.

650
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:57,087
They're going to hear you.

651
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,424
Hearts were coming out of your eyes.

652
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,884
Stop talking nonsense.

653
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,343
When's my birthday then?

654
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,971
Tell me. When is it?

655
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,514
Does that even matter?

656
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,976
This is exactly like father, like son.

657
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,478
I didn't cheat on you.

658
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,188
This is an emotional affair.

659
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,191
Stop nagging me and call them again.

660
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,445
Hye-ryung came home.

661
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:22,905
Just like that?

662
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,457
Over here.

663
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,507
I thought you already had lunch.

664
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,218
Just a bit. I didn't eat much.

665
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,930
How well did you do today?

666
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,933
I approached him after learning
he was the only son

667
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,392
of Sin Central Medical Center.

668
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,853
He was popular among girls,

669
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,980
so it wasn't easy.

670
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,360
Anyway, he asked me to marry him.
Then once we set our wedding date,

671
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,570
I was worried.

672
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,074
I never learned
how to be a daughter-in-law

673
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,826
or a wife for that matter..

674
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,623
My high school friend's mom taught
future brides how to cook.

675
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:18,043
I told her everything
and asked for her help.

676
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:21,380
My pride was hurt, and I was embarrassed.

677
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:25,175
But I didn't want my in-laws
to find fault with me.

678
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,595
I wanted a family of my own
and to live happily.

679
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,723
I'm grateful to my in-laws.

680
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,768
Their son was a great catch,

681
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,772
and many influential families
offered their daughters.

682
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,108
But they accepted me.

683
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,277
You were blessed.

684
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,988
A blessing should happen on its own.

685
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,532
He should've fallen for me

686
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:50,867
without me trying
to secretly win his heart.

687
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,375
I learned that one's life pans out

688
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:02,713
differently depending
on one's effort and patience.

689
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,133
I also understand what they mean
when they say

690
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,051
heaven helps those who make an effort.

691
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,388
I strived to do my best.

692
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,933
My husband told me several times
to quit work

693
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,686
and just focus on raising Ji-a.

694
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,689
But I refused.

695
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,067
I wanted to be the best at everything.

696
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:27,404
Even with a helper, I have my own tasks
and sometimes it's too much.

697
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,656
I don't want to become too lax,

698
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,035
so I go out and observe
well-dressed women.

699
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,997
Because I don't want to look like
a mere housewife.

700
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:39,750
I don't want him to lose interest.

701
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,879
It's tiresome and exhausting,
but I dress up every day.

702
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:48,175
And my husband's content
and treats me well.

703
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,260
More than anyone else.

704
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:54,765
Thank you for having
such a happy marriage life.

705
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,602
You're much better than me.

706
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:01,396
A small part of me wants you
to be just as happy.

707
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,522
But…

708
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,817
if I see you look happy with Ji-a,

709
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,988
it'll remind me of Dad
who should be there as well.

710
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:13,241
That's why I'm not ready for this yet.

711
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:17,829
So wait.

712
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:24,586
I'm terminally ill.

713
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,714
I may not be here

714
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,801
by the time you look for me.

715
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,096
I probably won't be.

716
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,654
How's the food?

717
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,656
It's good.

718
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,449
It's the best fish I've ever had.

719
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,410
I put a lot of thought into it.

720
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,621
I even brought in a chef
from Myeongdong Hotel.

721
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,123
No wonder.

722
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:03,375
You look so young for your age.

723
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,585
I'm flattered.

724
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,170
You dyed your hair, right?

725
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,588
No, I didn't.

726
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,633
Goodness. Then how do you look so--

727
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,386
-Actually, she--
-Every time he dyed his hair,

728
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,346
his scalp would become irritated.

729
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,557
So I got him a wig.

730
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,227
I see. It fits you perfectly.

731
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,187
I knew it.

732
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:28,734
It's not good
to look old these days, right?

733
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,611
Right. Many people live to 100 nowadays.

734
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:37,284
By the way, how did you two meet?

735
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:44,249
Then how did you meet Mun-ho, ma'am?

736
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,378
How should I address you?

737
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,256
You're older than me, right?

738
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,216
Yes, you're young.

739
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,843
Good for you.

740
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:56,052
Speak casually.

741
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,015
-Actually, I lost--
-We met at his hospital.

742
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,684
It was my first workplace.

743
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,646
It was his second marriage but my first.

744
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,983
So you seduced him and became his wife.

745
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:15,155
His late wife was such a good person.

746
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,324
But she passed away too soon.

747
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:20,619
I see.

748
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:27,667
Our director here is

749
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:30,378
a respectable hospital director.

750
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,964
But I respect him as a husband too.

751
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:36,843
And I love him.

752
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,186
Thank you.

753
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,361
She just won't stop calling me that.

754
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,947
I'm no longer a director, you know?

755
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,366
You're still a director nonetheless.

756
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,117
Just an honorary one.

757
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,578
Would you like a bit more?

758
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,372
Sure.

759
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,873
Let me.

760
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,052
You're going to sleep well today.

761
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,516
When I have trouble sleeping,
she even sings me a lullaby.

762
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,061
-Really?
-Yes.

763
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:31,523
You two look great together.

764
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:32,732
Don't you think so?

765
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,737
It feels great whenever I see

766
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,866
old couples who still love each other
even more than young ones.

767
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,702
-At times, it's even beautiful.
-Goodness.

768
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,745
Thank you for saying that.

769
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,007
-Try this.
-Okay.

770
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,425
It's soft beef tenderloin.

771
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,145
You too.

772
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:12,480
Put that down.

773
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,658
Your eldest son…

774
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:26,620
He runs a large driving range
and manages this place too.

775
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:28,663
I see.

776
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,624
My youngest son is a lawyer.

777
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:31,958
His wife

778
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:35,086
used to be an announcer.
Now, she's on a music program.

779
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,254
It's a radio show.

780
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,591
Is your daughter-in-law Boo Hye-ryung?

781
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:40,842
Yes.

782
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:42,886
-Goodness.
-She's our DJ.

783
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:45,055
I even spoke with her husband
on my way here.

784
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:48,224
-Goodness.
-She's a producer.

785
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,101
Is that so?

786
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:51,978
What a coincidence.

787
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,107
It is a small world indeed.

788
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:02,072
Maybe she didn't want to brag
about her rich in-laws.

789
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:05,700
She probably didn't want people
to ask her a favor.

790
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,037
-Still--
-What if people at work find it out?

791
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,498
Everyone plays golf nowadays, you know?

792
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,369
Excuse me.

793
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,914
Could you wrap this up for me?

794
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,710
Did he go somewhere?

795
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,086
He must be in Nonhyeon-dong.

796
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,589
Should I order something for you?

797
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,175
I'm not hungry. I had two lunches.

798
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:06,428
Sa Pi-young, is it?

799
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,681
Yes, she's the producer of our program.

800
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:12,308
Her family visited our golf club today.

801
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,771
Going down.

802
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:29,492
You need a baby.

803
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,245
If you had one,
he wouldn't have wanted a divorce.

804
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:34,330
He may cheat but never divorce you.

805
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:37,333
I've seen many couples with kids break up.

806
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,294
They're different.

807
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:41,796
Sa-hyeon grew up in a harmonious family.

808
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,507
He knows better than to let his kid

809
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,468
grow up without a father.

810
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,304
Have a serious talk with him.

811
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,599
Tell him you're willing to have one.

812
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,059
Don't just bash him.

813
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,019
I've made up my mind.

814
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:58,480
They say a couple's bond
can become strong overnight.

815
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:01,191
You've been married
for almost three years now.

816
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:04,110
He wants a divorce. She must be…

817
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,822
I bet he fell for someone younger.

818
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,743
That's what his dad said too.

819
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:16,790
You should be more rational
at times like this.

820
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,792
I am being rational right now.

821
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:19,834
If I wasn't…

822
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,712
You didn't hit him, right?

823
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:29,969
No matter how much you hate him,
you shouldn't use violence.

824
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:34,432
Look at the big picture
and determine what the best decision is.

825
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:37,811
-Something this trivial--
-How could you say it's trivial?

826
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:43,191
Don't let that wench get her way.

827
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:47,695
Sa-hyeon has good character,
is handsome, and has a good job--

828
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,697
After everything he's done to me?

829
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,493
Look at her talking back
to every single thing I say.

830
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,328
I'm her mother-in-law.

831
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,123
Sa-hyeon must've been tormented by her.

832
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:02,710
He's just naive.
If not, he would've never gotten caught.

833
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,296
He deceived me by using
two separate phones.

834
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,632
Would you have even imagined that?

835
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:11,594
In any case, getting a divorce
won't do you any good.

836
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:15,390
You'll have a tough life
living as a divorcée.

837
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:18,601
And do you think you'll ever find
another man like him?

838
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,228
Never.

839
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,813
You'll be a divorcée.

840
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:24,482
You may be a pretty, hotshot DJ,

841
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:28,278
but would a competent and wealthy
young man fall for you?

842
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:31,614
Wealthy men in their 50s look for women
who are 20 or 30 years younger.

843
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:35,368
I'm sick of this marriage life.

844
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,912
Besides,
whether it be single or divorced men,

845
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,206
all of them have dirty pasts.

846
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,084
They've all dated several people
in the past.

847
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:45,044
But no one makes an issue of it.

848
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:49,007
Think of it like that.
Everything depends on how you look at it.

849
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:52,510
You'll be dating other divorcés anyway.

850
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:56,431
They say those you've known
for a long time are good people for you.

851
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:59,142
I know you're furious,

852
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,561
but turn a blind eye this once.

853
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,314
Patience is a virtue.

854
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:05,773
Okay?

855
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:11,446
How about this?

856
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,407
Don't say anything,
and let him be for now.

857
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:18,244
We'll teach him a lesson
and make sure he repents.

858
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,496
Just trust us.

859
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,918
You should understand
as you're older than him.

860
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:31,049
Boys will always be boys.

861
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,092
You'll understand that as you get older.

862
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,511
They always cause problems.

863
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:41,434
It's best to get it over with.
We'll make sure he never does it again.

864
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:45,647
I still want to see who that wench is.

865
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,858
What for? That won't do you any good.

866
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:53,321
And once the dust settles,

867
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:54,614
you should have a baby.

868
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:58,493
Your elders know best.

869
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,704
Children are like bridges between you
and your husband.

870
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,486
Let me take a photo of your family.

871
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,098
I know you hate me,

872
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:06,019
but please give these gifts to her.

873
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:09,689
She doesn't need to know
that they're from me.

874
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,318
Ji-a.

875
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,487
I thought about it

876
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,282
and realized that I lacked a lot.

877
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,660
I made sure you had clean clothes,

878
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:25,121
tasty food,

879
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,499
and continued working
even though it was difficult.

880
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,793
I was certain that I was a perfect wife.

881
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:36,007
But those are the only things
I've done for you.

882
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:42,639
I pretty much neglected you,
saying that I was busy

883
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,391
or exhausted.

884
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,520
Cooking food isn't everything.

885
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:53,608
And anyone can do household chores
if we pay them.

886
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,779
I would've felt lonely as well
had I been in your shoes.

887
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,366
Every time you looked at me,
I always looked tired.

888
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,164
I just lived my life.

889
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,709
I didn't bother to bond with you
as a married couple.

890
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:15,838
I'm just as guilty.

891
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:19,384
I'm sorry.

892
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:23,721
We once invited a couples counselor
on our program.

893
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:27,350
They said wives are the ones who create

894
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:29,227
the ambiance at home.

895
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:32,522
We should try hard

896
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:35,233
for the sake of our kids.

897
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:40,947
Tell me what you wish for
or how you want me to change.

898
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:43,282
I stopped using pain-relief patches.

899
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:47,245
But your wrists will hurt more.
I didn't mean it.

900
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,248
I was just angry at myself.

901
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:52,125
If I had a well-paying job,

902
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:55,795
you wouldn't have to work so hard
or need those patches.

903
01:01:56,921 --> 01:02:00,633
You would be getting dolled up
like the other wives.

904
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,510
I don't care about that.

905
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:07,098
I'm happy as long as our family
is healthy, harmonious,

906
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:09,100
and our kids are successful.

907
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:15,815
From now on, I'll become
more self-aware and try harder.

908
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:18,985
You must be tired. Go to sleep.

909
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:30,455
You are…

910
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,667
a great woman.

911
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:42,712
Sa Pi-young is the producer,
and Mr. Seo is the engineer.

912
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:43,963
I can't believe you.

913
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,132
-How can you eat right now?
-He and his sister persuaded him

914
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,467
-to change his mind.
-Really?

915
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,303
If I end up dying before she does,

916
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,889
I want you to take good care of her.

917
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,473
As if I'd let you die so soon.

918
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:55,892
She's pregnant.

919
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,184
-Hye-ryung is?
-No.

920
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:58,519
Then who?

921
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,229
That punk-ass brat.

922
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,899
However devoted,
a daughter-in-law is not blood-related…

923
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:05,568
Are you happy to live
as we were designed to?

924
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:07,904
Yes, I'm happy.

925
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:11,240
Dad, I need your help.
It's for your future grandchild.

926
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:15,578
-Goodness.
-I need to ask for forgiveness.

927
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:16,537
For what?

928
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:18,748
Can you first promise not to get angry?

929
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:39,852
