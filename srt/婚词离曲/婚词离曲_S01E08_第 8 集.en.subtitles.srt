1
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,310
Ask anyone on the streets

2
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,106
if it's possible for a man
to love one woman forever.

3
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,526
It's not like I'm Jesus Christ.
I'm no Buddha either!

4
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,903
I hear you.

5
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,530
I hear you loud and clear.

6
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,616
Must you let your children
see you this way?

7
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,159
I'm just that desperate.

8
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,037
No one knows

9
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,248
what I've been through all this time.

10
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,420
Coming to this decision
wasn't easy for me.

11
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,423
Don't cry, Dad.

12
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,634
Even I'm trying hard not to cry.

13
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,302
Watch me and remember.

14
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,514
This is who I really am.

15
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,643
Because I was the man of the house,

16
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,688
I couldn't express my agony.

17
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,607
Because I was a father

18
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,193
and because I was a husband,

19
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,988
I endured everything
that was thrown at me.

20
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,115
Endured what?

21
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,075
It was like living in a minefield.

22
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,578
I was tempted on countless occasions.

23
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,458
I managed to fend them all off,
but not this time around.

24
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,212
I had hopes and dreams too, you know.

25
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:14,384
I wanted to travel around the country
on a motorcycle

26
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,805
and go to a meditation retreat in India.

27
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,809
With just a camera in hand,

28
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:27,021
I wanted to let my feet
take me wherever they wanted.

29
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,024
Golf isn't a luxurious hobby anymore now,

30
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,653
but even that was out of the question
because I couldn't afford it.

31
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,782
I'm 50 now.

32
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,703
All I'm asking is for you to set me free
and let me meet my partner.

33
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,456
I'll continue to say my piece then.

34
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,794
Dessert shops and cake houses
fill the streets these days.

35
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,964
I often head inside
to have a look and satisfy my craving.

36
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,967
But no matter how much I want them,
I never steal any.

37
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,804
Most people don't consider
stealing diamond rings just to own them.

38
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,390
I understand how another woman
can catch your eye.

39
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,684
It's the same as women
wanting a designer purse.

40
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,562
But falling for her
never should've been an option.

41
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,107
It's easier said than done.

42
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,611
I tried to forget about her and move on,

43
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,406
but my affection for her grew.

44
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,658
Shouldn't the affection for us
be stronger?

45
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,161
-Right.
-Dad.

46
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,412
A male wolf

47
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,790
grows old with only one female wolf.

48
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,292
Shouldn't a person

49
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,503
be better than a wolf?

50
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,713
That's right.

51
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,134
I'm sorry for being lesser than a wolf.

52
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,721
-Happy now?
-I no longer resent you.

53
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,765
Get a divorce as you want.

54
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,274
Will you be gone

55
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,860
when we wake up tomorrow?

56
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,040
Won!

57
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,586
This is so much fun!

58
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,547
The sun is so warm today.

59
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:20,176
At the amusement park earlier,

60
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,806
I saw your husband and your mother-in-law.

61
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,519
But they could easily be mistaken

62
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,897
as a couple on a date
in the eyes of others.

63
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,649
They appeared too close.

64
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:38,611
Of course, they are,
since they first met when he was little.

65
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,697
I get that,

66
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,491
but it wasn't a pretty sight.

67
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,035
They seemed too close

68
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,038
and I felt an odd vibe.

69
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,374
What are you trying to say?

70
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,626
Anything can happen
between a man and a woman.

71
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,255
You may don't know yet,
but weird things happen in life.

72
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,464
How were they exactly?

73
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:02,719
Anyway, they seemed too close
and were having a good time.

74
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,887
It just didn't seem right

75
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,057
when it's been less than a month
since his father passed away.

76
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,353
Father must've felt
that his moment was near

77
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,064
because he told Yu-sin
to take good care of her.

78
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,317
He couldn't possibly disobey that.

79
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,487
He's worried she might get depressed.

80
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,741
From what I heard,
Father and Mother were very much in love.

81
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,120
I'm curious as to how you got better.

82
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:32,206
All mothers would probably agree to this.

83
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,752
When children finally
go to sleep at night,

84
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,379
you're allowed some time of your own.

85
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,555
I always wake up
after three to four hours.

86
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:52,143
It's not because
I've had enough sleep though.

87
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,563
After about four hours, I wake up

88
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,775
feeling stifled and suffocated.

89
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,777
MESSAGES
MS. KIM

90
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,570
Watching TV will only keep you awake.

91
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,573
Right, the day went by quickly today.

92
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,491
I'm glad.

93
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,433
Hye-ryung has an ulcer, right?

94
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,852
I'm not sure.
I'm going to text her tomorrow.

95
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,270
Didn't you visit her earlier?

96
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,606
No, I met with my mother.

97
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,359
Did you give her an earful again?

98
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,279
No, I think she's considering
selling the land she owns.

99
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,031
She asked about a potential buyer.

100
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,408
-Where?
-In Pyeongchang.

101
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,701
Should I ask around?

102
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,954
"I WANT TO KNOW" BY LEE SUN-HEE

103
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,486
Let's go. I'll treat you to a snack.

104
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,457
Hi.

105
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,209
Can you go home
and bring a scarf for me to wear?

106
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,062
I'll end it.

107
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,774
She's not begging to get married,

108
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,318
so I just need to cut her off.

109
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,824
That means it was you who held on to her.

110
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,495
Why do you like her so much?

111
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,623
Because she has your child?

112
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,377
What else do you need?

113
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,053
I haven't been here at night,
but it's not bad.

114
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,430
I like how it's not crowded.

115
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,015
It's even better than I expected.

116
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,185
A Mi, do you take after your mother?

117
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,312
-Yes.
-She must be stunning then.

118
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,566
I'd like to invite you
to my house next week.

119
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,734
I'm going to Jeju Island that week.

120
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,486
What about the week after that?

121
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,446
Is it for a family event?

122
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,449
I was invited to my brother's
15th wedding anniversary,

123
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,826
and we haven't met in ages.

124
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,537
Why not join me?

125
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,205
Have you been to Jeju?

126
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,126
When my grandmother passed away,
I stayed there for two nights with my mom.

127
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,004
A two-night trip isn't enough.

128
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,630
I still had a great time.

129
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,216
You need at least a week
to enjoy Jeju at its best.

130
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,595
Come with me if you're not too busy.

131
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,431
The house is large enough
to accommodate all of us.

132
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,559
-We should go.
-Let's stay at a hotel, though.

133
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,020
I have a membership
and can get a room at half price.

134
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,368
Is something on your mind?

135
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,622
No, not really.

136
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,169
Can you buy me a new purse?

137
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,880
Get one yourself.
Why must I buy it for you myself?

138
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,382
I'd like to have one
my husband bought for me.

139
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,594
-Do you want me to die early?
-What does it have to do with that?

140
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:40,890
They say not being your usual self
means you're close to dying.

141
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,224
Don't make me do that.

142
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,478
That's only true
when you do it on your own accord.

143
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,982
Besides, being good to your wife
will grant you good luck and longevity.

144
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,568
Husbands who aren't good
to their kind wives

145
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,945
tend to live short lives.

146
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,238
I guess.

147
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,659
Sun-gil, my friend from elementary school,

148
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,828
moved on from woman to woman

149
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,330
just to die last year.

150
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,626
-He didn't even get to see his son marry.
-See what I mean?

151
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:14,173
So how much are you willing to spend?
Buy me a decent one.

152
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,676
There are several levels of brands.

153
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,552
Fine.

154
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,058
Are you that thrilled over a purse?

155
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:28,229
Women never wish for grand gestures.
It's the little things that count.

156
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,857
I was joking though.

157
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,152
We should buy one for Hye-ryung

158
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,196
and hand it over with some cash.

159
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,032
I know she said she'd get over it,

160
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,785
but it still must be eating her up inside.

161
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,539
We should at least comfort her.

162
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:52,336
Her voice couldn't have
sounded colder yesterday.

163
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,590
The listeners may not have noticed,
but I did.

164
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,175
Tell me about it.

165
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,303
-Dad!
-Yes?

166
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,224
I need some extra cash.

167
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,475
For what?

168
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,978
To treat my friends to some snacks.

169
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,521
Breakfast is ready.

170
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,525
-Ji-a, why are you here?
-No reason.

171
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,777
As if that's ever the case. Money?

172
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,072
You spend too much for your age.

173
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,949
It's to buy snacks for friends.

174
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,493
She's no vending machine.
They should take turns.

175
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,288
It's better to give than to receive.

176
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,290
Let me see.

177
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,085
Whatever.

178
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,087
It's too much.

179
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,595
I'd like some too.

180
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,432
Here. Take the whole wallet.

181
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,362
A HAPPY CITY THAT CITIZENS BUILD TOGETHER

182
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,922
APPLICATION FOR DIVORCE

183
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,632
APPLICATION FOR DIVORCE AND CUSTODY

184
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,352
How's Ms. Boo doing?

185
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,563
I'm going to visit her later.
I hear it's an acute duodenal ulcer.

186
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,190
Send my regards to her.

187
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,609
Sure. Would you like to come with me?

188
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,527
No.

189
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,695
Mr. Seo.

190
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,281
Is that a yes or a no?

191
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,533
It's a no.

192
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,076
Shouldn't you visit her?

193
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,828
-Why?
-Because she's your colleague.

194
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,830
My presence won't help her recover anyway.

195
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,332
Mr. Seo.

196
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,252
What's your blood type?

197
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,546
Is it type B, perhaps?

198
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,130
No.

199
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,727
This will suit Dong-mi perfectly.

200
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,105
That one, please.

201
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,324
-What do you think?
-Isn't it too simple for Hye-ryung?

202
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,701
This one's for me.

203
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,328
-But we're buying Hye-ryung's.
-I'm a woman too.

204
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,206
What does your gender
have to do with this?

205
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,708
Can't you just buy me one too?

206
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,086
Why not? How much is it?

207
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,631
Why do you ask?
That's indecent. Just buy it.

208
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,133
Don't people ask?

209
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,343
No, not when it's a gift.

210
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,137
Who cares if I look indecent?

211
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,515
It's natural to know
how much you're spending.

212
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:55,269
I guess you got what you wanted
thanks to your daughter-in-law.

213
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,355
You used her to get one yourself,
didn't you?

214
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,108
That's right. I used my daughter-in-law.

215
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,945
Must the chairman of Signal Country
be this stingy?

216
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,698
I didn't mean it.

217
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,618
Give her a call.

218
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,829
-You don't have to walk me out.
-It's okay.

219
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,209
I'll get going then.

220
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,340
I'll review the case and give you a call.

221
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,674
Sure.

222
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,386
Hey, Mom.

223
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,348
Hye-ryung's show must be over by now,
but her phone's still off.

224
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,644
Is she hosting a shopping channel today?

225
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,062
No.

226
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,565
She's in the hospital.

227
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,775
In the hospital?

228
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:44,902
Why?

229
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,113
Tell me what's going on.

230
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,240
I made a promise to Hye-ryung.

231
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,701
You don't have to worry.

232
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,704
Sure.

233
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,793
I knew this would happen.

234
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,629
I just knew it.

235
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,508
-Sangam Hospital, please.
-Yes, ma'am.

236
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,259
Hold on.

237
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,678
Turn the car around.

238
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,762
Why?

239
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,515
-Head to Sa-hyeon's office.
-Yes, sir.

240
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,016
To Sa-hyeon?

241
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,061
We need to do what we can

242
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,355
to put Hye-ryung at ease.

243
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,482
He promised to end it with her.

244
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,526
-That's not easy.
-So what's your plan?

245
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,828
Once Sa-hyeon gets in, lock the door.

246
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,829
Yes, sir.

247
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,503
-Hey, Dad.
-Are you with a client?

248
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,548
-Not right now.
-Then meet me downstairs.

249
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,634
-Are you here?
-Yes.

250
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,219
Got it.

251
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,019
What are you going to do?

252
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,148
Here he comes.

253
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,738
Hop in.

254
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,162
-There's a coffee shop around the corner.
-Yes, sir.

255
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,254
Why did you lock the door?

256
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,089
Take us to the woman.

257
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:31,925
Where is she?

258
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,094
-Dad!
-Tell him the address.

259
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,265
Nonhyeon-dong, right?
Which apartment building?

260
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,727
Dad, don't do this.
I'm still on the clock.

261
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,687
You were just as mean to Hye-ryung.

262
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,857
We need to make sure
that she has nothing to worry about.

263
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,943
How can Hye-ryung possibly
believe your words anymore?

264
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,361
So?

265
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,198
We'll meet the woman,
close the deal, get her promise,

266
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,033
and tell Hye-ryung.

267
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,618
But she did nothing wrong.

268
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,787
She got involved with you.

269
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,038
Now, spill.

270
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,416
You know what I'm like.

271
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,920
I'll have us drive around all night
until I meet her.

272
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,424
Are you willing to put
another woman in the hospital?

273
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,677
She's pregnant.
What if something happens to the baby?

274
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,642
How can you not have faith in your son?
It's driving me crazy as is.

275
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,268
Because you have to break up?

276
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,603
Yes!

277
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,233
How dare you raise your voice
at your parents?

278
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,277
After what you did?

279
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,284
If not the best scenario,
we go for the second-best.

280
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,121
How you feel doesn't mean matter
in this situation.

281
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,081
Ending it with her is your only option.

282
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,000
Turn the car around.

283
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,710
-To his office?
-Yes.

284
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,172
Just think about what made
Hye-ryung cough up blood.

285
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,007
If Hye-ryung were my daughter,

286
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,261
I would've snapped
my son-in-law's legs in half

287
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,180
or broken all his ribs.

288
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,520
A consultation with you

289
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,564
eases my mind for days.

290
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,984
-Have a good day.
-You too.

291
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,037
YU-SIN

292
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,375
-Hello?
-What are you up to?

293
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,920
Just doing some household chores
to get my mind off things.

294
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,006
Aren't you with your patients?

295
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,382
I found a moment to call.

296
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:39,887
Watching the nurses eat gimbap earlier
reminded me of those you make.

297
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,597
I'll make some for you.

298
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,765
Can I have some for dinner today?

299
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,143
Let's go grocery shopping.

300
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,477
Yes, ma'am.

301
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,363
-Hello.
-Hello.

302
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,747
Please stay in bed.

303
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,335
Something to drink…

304
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,796
We're good.

305
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,216
Okay.

306
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,471
Please have a seat.

307
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,476
We had no idea this had happened.

308
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,189
I called to deliver the purse
we bought for you, but your phone was off.

309
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,733
Sa-hyeon told us you were here.

310
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,860
You didn't have to visit me twice.

311
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,947
-How are you?
-I'm better now.

312
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,323
Please have a seat, Father.

313
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,659
You should open this later.

314
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,288
What did the doctor say?

315
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,250
I should be hospitalized for a week,

316
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,877
but I'm considering
hosting the show tomorrow.

317
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,089
-Are you sure you can do it?
-Yes.

318
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,049
We have no excuse.

319
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,842
Sa-hyeon

320
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,719
promised us before we came here.

321
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,640
He swears he'll end it with that woman.

322
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,016
Anyway,

323
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,769
relax and don't worry about it.

324
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,146
Thinking about her won't do you any good.

325
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,984
-Yes, Mother.
-Do they have you on a strict diet?

326
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,235
Yes.

327
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,529
Wouldn't a caregiver
be better than your manager?

328
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,281
It's better to keep her nearby.

329
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,492
I'll meet with your doctor
and ask for special care.

330
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:32,082
-Let's see who your doctor is.
-That's not necessary.

331
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,584
I'm already in good hands.

332
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,950
CASHIER'S CHECK
100,000 WON

333
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,213
Don't blanch them for too long.
They shouldn't be mushy.

334
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,298
Yes, ma'am.

335
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,594
GET WELL SOON
FROM SA PI-YOUNG

336
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,682
Mr. Seo's more observant than I thought.

337
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,393
During the show, he said you looked pale.

338
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:35,645
Did he?

339
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:39,191
Yes, that's when I also noticed
how pale you were.

340
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,151
Do your in-laws know?

341
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,820
They came by and dropped that off.

342
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,743
They won't bug you
to get pregnant anymore.

343
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,203
That was the cause, right?

344
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,621
That's not the only reason.

345
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,955
The comments too?

346
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,960
They're just jealous, that's all.
Don't be bothered by them.

347
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,504
I'm not.

348
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,092
Has Si-eun come by?

349
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,176
Not yet.

350
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,886
Any texts?

351
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,055
You know how busy she is.

352
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,433
Please understand.
Her situation isn't so good these days.

353
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,896
You'll probably find out anyway, so…

354
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,565
You were right.

355
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,361
Professor Park has been having an affair.

356
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,490
-Did she check his phone?
-No, he told her himself.

357
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,409
He demanded
the termination of their marriage.

358
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,079
-Goodness.
-He's shameless, isn't he?

359
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,039
-Who could the woman be?
-Who knows?

360
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,543
He won't tell her
to protect the woman he's seeing.

361
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,629
Si-eun must be a mess right now.

362
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,758
She chose her husband
over her wealthy family

363
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,927
and spent her life providing for him.

364
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,387
-Really?
-Yes.

365
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,473
That's how he became a professor,

366
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,392
so how would she feel

367
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,811
to be betrayed after decades?

368
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,313
Why not end it sooner
while she was younger?

369
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,482
What should she do? She's 50.

370
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,733
Poor Ms. Lee.

371
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,988
-U-ram's the same age as Ji-a, right?
-Yes.

372
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,865
Men just can't be trusted.

373
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,491
It depends on the man.

374
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,827
Some are highly devoted to their wives,
you know.

375
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,830
That's why women need to try
harder as well.

376
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,749
Marriage isn't the final stop
of a relationship.

377
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,255
Will your husband be here after work?

378
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,298
Yes.

379
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:30,051
I can't text Si-eun knowing her situation.

380
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,845
I know.

381
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:37,142
By the way, don't women seem
less attractive after childbirth?

382
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,144
That all depends on how well you recover.

383
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,771
Our relationship got better
after I had Ji-a.

384
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:42,939
Really?

385
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,566
Yes.

386
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,153
Besides, you have no idea
how men adore their children.

387
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,822
That's not her case either.

388
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,035
Anyway, Si-eun should've cared more.

389
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,913
She gave up on looking more presentable

390
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:01,416
and exhausted her life
on her career and household chores.

391
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,004
Have you ever

392
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,840
gone grocery shopping for us?

393
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,592
You never have.

394
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:14,137
She has prepared countless meals for you

395
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,056
her entire life.

396
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,140
And yet,

397
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,810
you've never done the same for her.

398
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,482
I saw my dad, whom I respected and loved,

399
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,944
getting in a car with some other woman
with my own eyes.

400
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:33,531
Mom got that car for you on your birthday
with the money she saved up

401
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,867
while she worked her butt off!

402
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,353
Vietnamese spring rolls?

403
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,604
That's right.

404
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,192
Be careful, U-ram. The water's hot.

405
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,362
I guess it has its perks.

406
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,780
What peaks?

407
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,074
Dad doesn't like Vietnamese spring rolls.

408
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,159
He only likes Korean meals.

409
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,787
-Is that why we're having this?
-Yes.

410
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,247
Let's eat.

411
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,249
The water needs to cool first.

412
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:28,128
From now on, the three of us
will have a good life together.

413
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:29,546
Got it.

414
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,881
It all depends on how you look at it.

415
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:36,720
This is better than
your dad dying in a car accident

416
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,557
or passing away from an incurable disease.

417
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,561
You can still see him whenever you want.

418
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,981
I doubt I'll ever want to see him.

419
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:52,152
That's not true.
No matter what, he's still your father.

420
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,946
Without him,
you wouldn't exist in this world.

421
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:59,117
Do you know the saying,
"Better live a coward than a dead hero"?

422
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,120
Is there such a phrase?
I've never heard it before.

423
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,247
It's an old proverb.

424
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,458
Our ancestors were never wrong.

425
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:12,297
Think of all the things
we get to enjoy and experience in life.

426
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,842
We can do anything if we try hard enough.

427
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,386
Don't you agree?

428
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,722
Sure.

429
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:25,101
I wish the two of you will be virtuous.

430
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,438
Don't stay angry or be petty

431
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,107
just because someone hurt you.

432
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,986
Be forgiving and generous,
even though it's not easy.

433
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,696
Okay.

434
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:42,410
This is where
my journey with your father ends.

435
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,539
I've accepted it, and now I'm at peace.

436
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,334
I truly am.

437
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,296
Be nice to your dad when you see him.

438
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,714
And don't ignore his texts.

439
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,758
I don't think I can for a while.

440
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,220
I know. Take your time.

441
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,097
You should meet someone better.

442
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,014
A boyfriend?

443
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,100
That's also an option,

444
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:08,103
but I'd like you to meet
someone younger and more competent

445
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,521
and get married again.

446
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,315
-Do you honestly mean that?
-Yes.

447
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,109
Thank you for saying that,

448
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,444
but one shouldn't be too greedy.

449
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:20,198
I remember what you told us last time
about knowing yourself.

450
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,744
"Know your place, stay within the limits,

451
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,830
and live a peaceful life
within the limits."

452
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,625
Do you think
that Dad is aware of his place?

453
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,335
Who knows?

454
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,422
It's not up to us to judge.

455
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,466
Let's eat.

456
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,813
Gimbap should be eaten with your hands.

457
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,235
That's what I wanted.

458
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,987
You'll choke on it.

459
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,864
Have some soup.

460
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,706
Pi-young's a good cook too,
but her gimbap doesn't compare to yours.

461
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,710
-Aren't you going to eat?
-I ate the end parts as I made them.

462
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,920
What? But the ends are my favorite.

463
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:20,133
I was going to pack some for you,
but they're not as tasty the next day.

464
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,552
And Pi-young won't eat at night
to watch her weight.

465
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,388
A high school friend of mine

466
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,349
still talks about your gimbap
with fermented kimchi.

467
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,478
-After all those years?
-Yes.

468
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,481
When it comes to food,
people have strong memories.

469
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,650
I guess you're right.
I miss my mother's food too

470
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,569
until this day.

471
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,239
Bring him over sometime.

472
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,909
A few rolls of gimbap
aren't that hard to make.

473
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,660
Once the mourning period is over.

474
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,292
-I'll get going, ma'am.
-Okay. Good night.

475
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,044
Should I peel that?

476
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,296
No. Head home before the traffic piles up.

477
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,839
Yes, ma'am.

478
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,594
The day we first met at the hospital,

479
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:08,473
you took me to the store
and bought me ice cream.

480
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,183
-Do you remember?
-Yes.

481
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,894
It was the best ice cream ever.

482
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,188
I'm sure you grew up eating fancier food.

483
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,524
Who bought it for me must've meant more.

484
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,449
-Good evening.
-You too.

485
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,244
-Is my husband home?
-Yes.

486
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,165
If I'm being completely honest,

487
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,417
I married your father

488
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:40,171
because I wanted
to take care of you myself.

489
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,511
Is that so?

490
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,096
Yes.

491
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,515
If it weren't for you, I…

492
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,935
Food should be enjoyed together.

493
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,778
Your housekeeper let me in.

494
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,489
You should have called.

495
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,324
We could've come together.

496
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:12,203
The abalones at the supermarket
reminded me of Mother.

497
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,081
I'm glad you're here.

498
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:18,501
I made gimbap
since Yu-sin wanted it for dinner

499
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,254
and was debating whether to pack you some.

500
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,257
These are huge.

501
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,967
Take half the box home.

502
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:26,968
Sure.

503
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,974
You only have one mango.

504
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,351
I can just ask the housekeeper
to get some.

505
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,896
This shouldn't be your concern.

506
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:38,980
Did you have dinner?

507
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,317
-No.
-Then have a seat.

508
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,068
I'll bring chopsticks and a plate.

509
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:48,031
Join us. Food is always better
when you share it.

510
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,996
It's so good.

511
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,457
You couldn't recreate this.

512
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,920
Your fermented kimchi sure is special.

513
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,421
It's nothing big.

514
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,673
I just use good perilla oil.

515
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,886
-Where's Ji-a?
-At her friend's BP.

516
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,638
"Birthday party"?

517
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,975
The soup is good and refreshing, too.

518
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,855
I heard you went
to the amusement park yesterday.

519
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,609
It changed so much over the years.

520
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:27,028
Things change so fast in Korea,
don't they?

521
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:32,408
I bet you did something special
to the rice too.

522
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,871
It doesn't taste of vinegar.

523
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,831
What's your secret?

524
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,541
There are some secrets

525
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,627
you can't even share
to your daughter-in-law.

526
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,509
It must've been hard work.
Making gimbap isn't easy.

527
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,427
Cooking

528
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,640
helps me take my mind off things.

529
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,768
You probably loathe him at the moment,

530
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,354
but think of it
as being nice to your enemy.

531
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,690
You can give him hell later in old age.

532
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:07,610
Let it go for now
and don't nag him about it anymore.

533
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,279
Cornering someone never ends well.

534
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,699
Even a worm treads when you step on it.

535
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,617
Don't make him take her side.

536
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,954
-Let it go for now.
-She's right.

537
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,248
I gave him an earful,

538
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,542
and I got his promise.

539
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,303
How are you feeling?

540
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:35,722
So-so.

541
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,516
FROM SA PI-YOUNG

542
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,894
-Did you have a visitor?
-Ms. Sa and your parents.

543
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,983
-Where's your manager?
-At the cafeteria downstairs.

544
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,193
Tell her to go home. I'll stay here.

545
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,279
-That's not necessary.
-I'll stay the night.

546
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,698
Your mom will worry
if you don't get proper sleep.

547
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,116
It's fine.

548
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,618
Then go bring a change of clothes.

549
00:33:58,995 --> 00:33:59,829
What else?

550
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:02,957
You need a new scarf.

551
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,501
Take that home with you.

552
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,254
Your parents bought it for me.

553
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,548
I'll get it exchanged
if you don't like it.

554
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,341
It's fine.

555
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,977
Your old watch broke,
so I bought a new set.

556
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,705
Will you put this on me?

557
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,922
From now on,
we'll only wear matching items.

558
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,758
Grandma, can't you sleep?

559
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,556
Maybe I'm too excited to have you over.

560
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,141
Should I sing you a lullaby?

561
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:44,600
Sure.

562
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:51,440
When the mother goes to the seashore

563
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:57,405
To harvest oysters

564
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:04,871
Her baby stays home alone

565
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:11,961
Looking after the house

566
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:18,926
Upon the lullaby

567
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:24,348
Hummed by the sea

568
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:30,855
The baby lays its head

569
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:37,111
And gently drifts off

570
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,611
Refreshing. I feel like I'm flying
every time I put this on.

571
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,657
I bet I'm the only man in the world
who gets this kind of royal treatment.

572
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:29,247
Ji-a said that U-ram's parents
are getting a divorce. Is that true?

573
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,957
I won't know until Si-eun tells me.

574
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,556
What's with the suitcase?

575
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,517
Take it with you to work tomorrow.

576
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,271
I don't have a business trip.

577
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,856
I asked Mother to stay with us,
but she refused.

578
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,360
And you won't be at ease
unless you visit her every day,

579
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,820
so…

580
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,248
I don't care
if it takes months or even a year.

581
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,960
I told you last time.
My dad made a request.

582
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,921
I'm just saying that
it's exhausting to go back and forth.

583
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,095
Ji-a won't find it weird either.

584
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,739
We should talk.

585
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,449
Why?

586
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,080
-Don't get the wrong idea.
-I don't.

587
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,709
She's been your mother
for nearly 30 years now.

588
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,295
Why would I get the wrong idea

589
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,756
when she's your sweet stepmom?

590
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,258
You two are even sweeter
than a real mother and son.

591
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,426
What do you mean?

592
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:09,013
How many sons feed their mothers gimbap
with their hands?

593
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:12,725
Young children might,
but not even daughters do so.

594
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,019
Shin Yu-sin who happily fed her

595
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:17,396
and Kim Dong-mi who ate it happily
are all alike.

596
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,522
"Kim Dong-mi"?

597
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,608
Am I not allowed to say her name?

598
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,924
Hearing how you put it

599
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:48,719
made me realize
that you had the right to be angry.

600
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,098
Don't bother trying to make me understand.

601
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,892
I'm aware of how much
you care about each other.

602
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,310
I'm not complaining.

603
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,605
Don't waste time and
exhaust yourself driving back and forth.

604
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,982
Just live together for a while,

605
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,151
comforting each other.

606
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,028
I'm sorry.

607
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,781
I haven't been considerate, have I?

608
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,246
I haven't been in my right mind.

609
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,249
My father's sudden death

610
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,252
left a lot to deal with.

611
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,546
A lot of things,
including the inheritance.

612
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:26,090
-But she's your priority?
-She might get depressed.

613
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,467
That's why you should go.
End of discussion.

614
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,639
You two were exceptionally close
even when Father was alive.

615
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,057
How?

616
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,102
She was like my sister.

617
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,271
She's the only one who had my back.

618
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,730
Always live in gratitude then.

619
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,524
There's no need to be snarky.

620
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,485
Is that how I sound? I mean what I say.

621
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,029
Darling,

622
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,115
give me a month.

623
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,616
Okay.

624
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,453
But don't do that in front of my eyes.

625
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,704
Just move in with her.

626
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,448
Dongmi.

627
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:46,295
What on earth did you do that?
You startled Dongmi.

628
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:49,256
Why did you wake up
in the middle of the night, tearing up?

629
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,382
Can't you go to sleep?

630
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,135
Unbelievable.

631
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,680
-Pick that up.
-What are you doing every night?

632
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,558
Do you miss the original Dong-mi
that much?

633
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,310
I can't believe this.

634
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:04,897
I was out here worrying about the kids!

635
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,315
"The kids"?

636
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,567
-Can't I listen to music?
-It depends on the song.

637
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,944
I love Lee Sun-hee's songs.

638
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,196
Since when did you like her songs?

639
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,615
Your favorites are
Kim Chu-ja and Teresa Teng.

640
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,118
Has meeting Dong-mi again
made you miss her more?

641
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,329
Do the lyrics deeply touch your heart?

642
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,374
Don't you dare do this again!

643
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,419
What if I do?

644
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,131
Then we'll go our separate ways.

645
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,759
What if we do? It won't be my loss.

646
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,011
You should watch what you say.

647
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,226
I let it go nine times already.

648
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,229
Test me again if you're curious
and see what happens.

649
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,818
Who else would Sa-hyeon take after?

650
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,696
I never had any illegitimate children.

651
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:05,332
This is the life
of all married men in Korea.

652
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,710
Dongmi.

653
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,004
What about the wives?

654
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:22,808
Are you asleep?

655
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,819
As you know,
I rarely talk about my late mother.

656
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,779
If I talk about my childhood,

657
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:40,826
I'm afraid I might speak ill
of the woman who gave birth to me.

658
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,787
Digging up painful memories
isn't ideal anyway.

659
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,875
So I always avoided the topic
when you asked,

660
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,085
saying I hardly remember her.

661
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,630
Mom only doted on my big brother.

662
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:56,634
Dad was busy with the hospital expansion
and his patients,

663
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,719
so he paid no attention to me.

664
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,972
There's one thing I still can't forget.

665
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,683
One of my mom's close friends

666
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,603
owned a pear orchard in Taereung.

667
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:12,191
We were invited over for a barbecue party,

668
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:16,153
but as always,
she only took my big brother with her.

669
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,698
I really wanted to go with them.

670
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,578
After they came back home,

671
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,915
my brother bragged about how they ate

672
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,542
grilled beef ribs in an orchard

673
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:34,505
with pear blossoms fluttering like snow.

674
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,384
That night, I cried myself to sleep.

675
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,763
That's how she was.

676
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:46,100
It's not like I did anything wrong,

677
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,227
but when she looked at me,

678
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:51,605
she always looked emotionless and cold.

679
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,440
But she'd look at my brother

680
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,443
with nothing but love in her eyes.

681
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,154
-Maybe it was all in your head.
-No.

682
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,824
You know what they say

683
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:05,369
about children knowing
if they're loved or not.

684
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,454
Was there a reason?

685
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,039
A reason?

686
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,878
I once heard her
talking to my grandmother.

687
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,965
They were talking about parental love,

688
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:21,635
and she said she didn't love
her kids equally

689
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:23,637
even though she gave birth
to both of them.

690
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,348
She said

691
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,352
she just had no affection for me.

692
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,064
Imagine how hurt I must've been
at that age.

693
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,567
As you can see, I'm still not over it.

694
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,821
And now I'm telling my wife on her.

695
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,284
My mom

696
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,120
broke my heart many times

697
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:51,415
and only took my brother with her
even when she passed away.

698
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,585
Maybe that was my luck though.

699
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:59,506
If she had loved me just as much,
I would've gone to the beach too.

700
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,176
Although

701
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,928
there's still a chance
I would have survived.

702
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,598
Thanks to Dong-mi,

703
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,517
who doted on me
as if I were her little brother…

704
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:16,565
If not for her,
I would have spiraled out of control.

705
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,610
Then I would've never met you.

706
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:25,866
Sometimes, I wondered
if she'd been my mom in my past life.

707
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,911
That's how I feel about her.

708
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,288
A lot has changed since then.

709
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,748
You're not a seven-year-old.

710
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,417
The way I feel about her remains the same.

711
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:40,547
That's why I was never
against my dad marrying her

712
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,257
after my mother's passing.

713
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,760
In fact, I was thrilled.

714
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:49,014
I was relieved to have her
as my stepmother, not some stranger.

715
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:52,768
Apart from briefly hanging out
with bullies in middle school,

716
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,686
I didn't cause trouble.

717
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,982
Ms. Kim cared for me
in the best way possible.

718
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:04,655
As a result, I was able
to become an ordinary father

719
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,240
and a loving husband.

720
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,868
Regarding our marriage…

721
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:14,706
My father initially wanted me
to marry the daughter of his friend,

722
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,917
but Ms. Kim took my side.

723
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,003
She argued that I should marry
the woman I love.

724
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,718
I want you to understand.

725
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,595
It won't last long.

726
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,099
Just like how she helped me

727
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,268
get through the rough times as a kid,

728
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,187
I feel like it's my turn to help her.

729
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,248
If this was me with my young stepfather,

730
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,417
would you like it?

731
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,712
What if I looked
after my widowed stepfather,

732
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,213
neglecting you and Ji-a?

733
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,842
and practically went on a date
with him every day?

734
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,345
Being grateful is one thing,

735
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,931
but now my friends are sending me photos

736
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,017
which can be very misleading.

737
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,186
You may not care, but I do.

738
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,732
So go stay with her
until you feel at ease.

739
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,953
Just bear with me for a month.

740
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:39,041
After that, I won't do anything
that gets on your nerves.

741
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:42,294
Not even for a month?

742
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,339
-What about swimming?
-I'll quit.

743
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,507
I'll just go to another hotel.

744
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,636
But I should look after her
for at least a month.

745
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:54,348
We'll then invite her over for meals
once in a while

746
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,599
and call to check on her.

747
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,856
By the way,

748
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,360
don't make my heart sink.

749
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,696
Do you want me to have
a bad heart like my dad did?

750
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,282
Do you?

751
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,533
Whatever.

752
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,041
How dare you turn away from me?

753
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:29,966
Ji-a takes after you
in terms of her temper, doesn't she?

754
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,263
I'm sorry.

755
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,058
I should've considered your feelings,

756
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,353
but I put my gratitude
towards Ms. Kim first.

757
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:47,275
Are you saying you owe Ms. Kim a favor,
but owe me nothing?

758
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,861
Don't be ridiculous.

759
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,824
I'll keep my distance bit by bit.

760
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,326
She should learn how to manage on her own.

761
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:00,122
-On one condition.
-What is it?

762
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:02,290
If your intentions are innocent--

763
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,710
Of course, they're innocent.

764
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:05,919
What do you take me for?

765
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:08,880
Anyway,
if you're really worried about her,

766
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,632
set her up with someone decent.

767
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:19,683
Has that not crossed your mind?
Are you against it?

768
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:20,892
Of course not.

769
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,186
Sounds like a good idea.

770
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,938
You mentioned someone before.

771
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,649
He's not the right age for her.

772
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,527
Anyway, I'll keep searching.

773
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:50,899
Mr. Seo's more observant than I thought.

774
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:53,777
During the show, he said you looked pale.

775
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,030
Could it be that
Mr. Seo is interested in me as well?

776
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,877
Did you sleep well?

777
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,128
I guess.

778
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,339
Let me check your temperature first.

779
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,925
I'll be stepping out later
to host my radio show.

780
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,719
Does your doctor know?

781
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:21,638
Yes, I let him know.

782
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,515
You shouldn't walk around alone though.

783
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:24,975
My manager will be with me.

784
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,228
Are you sure about this?

785
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:31,982
-I'll cancel the 5 p.m. meeting for you.
-Sure.

786
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:33,900
Also…

787
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:43,243
"The feelings of loving and yearning
find those who are in love,

788
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,954
but heartbreak and pain are also entailed.

789
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:49,165
Be aware that love brings you worries

790
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,459
and navigate your life alone
like a rhinoceros."

791
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:55,046
Today, I bring you a quote
from a Buddhist scripture

792
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,091
as I begin Boo Hye-ryung's
Love, Memories, and Music.

793
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:07,851
I'm sure some of you
currently live with those you love,

794
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:12,230
while others live alone
just as Buddha tells you to.

795
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,940
Just like wild plants

796
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:17,193
that face several rainstorms in life,

797
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,778
we face hardships.

798
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:26,328
At times like that,
you'll truly appreciate a comforting hand.

799
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,581
If you find yourself all alone,

800
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:33,001
it might be wise to become
that comforting hand for yourself,

801
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:36,755
because you are the only person

802
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:39,215
who can truly look after you.

803
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:44,596
Today, look into your heart
and see if you're feeling down.

804
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,848
If you're feeling hurt and exhausted,

805
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:51,811
give yourself the warmest words of comfort
that exist in this world.

806
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,981
"It's all right. Hang in there."

807
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,652
Music will be of some help as well.

808
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:02,656
A romantic piano piece
will kick off today's show.

809
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:07,118
With a melody that reminds us
of a gentle breeze on a summer evening,

810
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:10,288
we'll begin
Boo Hye-ryung's Love, Memories, and Music.

811
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,001
Mom.

812
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:17,480
The song sounded sweet in the movie,
but it sounds sad today.

813
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,775
I should try and lift myself
back on my feet

814
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,820
from a dark basement
to a rooftop full of sunshine.

815
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:28,408
Is it just me, or does the DJ
sound depressed today?

816
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,915
Why are you so downcast today?

817
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:37,792
All of you.

818
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,672
Hye-ryung isn't feeling well.

819
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,844
So your dad left the house for good?

820
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:49,429
Yes.

821
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:54,392
I won't be going to the academies
starting next month.

822
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,352
Did your mom tell you to?

823
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,813
No, this is my decision.

824
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:03,359
I don't want to go back to the hospital.
I can hardly read there.

825
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,778
I'll stop by later.

826
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:08,656
Are you busy today, Ms. Lee?
Are you going straight home?

827
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,534
I need to drop by the bank,
so I'll stop by later.

828
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,746
Do you have time for some tea?

829
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:17,415
-I have a favor to ask.
-Sure.

830
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:20,043
Just the two of you?
Is it something we shouldn't hear?

831
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:23,630
How about we all stop
by the hospital later?

832
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,758
-I'd love that.
-Do we have to?

833
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:28,843
Yes.

834
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,096
-I'll meet you downstairs.
-Sure.

835
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:38,603
First floor.

836
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:42,482
Does he not care or is he just selfish?

837
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,318
-Both, I guess.
-I like how frank he is.

838
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:47,612
Men who talk too much are exhausting.

839
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,781
Isn't talkative better than quiet?

840
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:52,200
You must like the talkative type.

841
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:54,452
My dad is just like Mr. Seo,

842
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,329
and he's really boring.

843
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:03,294
-What would you like?
-An Americano.

844
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,922
-No, let me.
-Two Americanos, please.

845
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,674
I should pay. it's my treat.

846
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,300
-Hot?
-Yes.

847
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,813
Do you know any decent guy
who's currently single?

848
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:22,939
A lot.

849
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:24,941
It's about my mother-in-law.

850
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,234
She's having a rough time.

851
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,236
But that's more than understandable.

852
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,905
Do you want to set her up with someone?

853
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:31,823
Yes.

854
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,908
I think she might get depressed.

855
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:38,288
She turns 59 next year in Korean age.

856
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:42,083
-Older or younger?
-A younger guy would be better.

857
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,501
But that would be impossible.

858
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,295
Why would it be impossible?

859
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:48,590
I saw her at the funeral.
I think she looks younger than her age.

860
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:51,384
Did you check with her, though?
Is this what she wants?

861
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:53,511
Not yet.

862
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,306
Then ask her first.
There are plenty of candidates.

863
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,309
Someone around 61 or 62 would be nice.

864
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:02,020
But if it were you,

865
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:04,022
would you consider dating another man

866
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,732
only months after becoming a widow?

867
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:09,319
-Your in-laws were very much in love.
-You know how it is.

868
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:12,238
Men meet a new woman too
when they try to move on.

869
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:15,450
Not all men are like that,
just like how not all women are the same.

870
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,036
You mean yourself?

871
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,832
If your mother-in-law's okay with it,
I'll find a good match for her.

872
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:29,380
MESSAGES

873
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,768
-Are there any painkillers?
-Do you have a headache?

874
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,603
Yes.

875
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:51,361
That's odd. You rarely get headaches.

876
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,784
-What?
-Your first love is single again.

877
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:58,826
No wonder.

878
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:02,121
I'm upset and annoyed as it is.

879
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:08,962
Do you really want to keep nagging me
when our son's marriage

880
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,338
is on the rocks?

881
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,799
I'm stating the truth, not nagging you.

882
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,175
Jun-jae!

883
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,635
We don't even know

884
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,470
where our grandchild is growing.

885
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,597
Where else but in its mom's womb?

886
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:20,765
Unbelievable.

887
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:24,269
That sarcasm. Don't you get sick of it?

888
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:29,983
Compared to the man who endured
decades of years living with me,

889
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,944
this is nothing.

890
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:37,865
I'll never forget the look on your face
when you met Kim Dong-mi at the golf club.

891
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:41,077
Wouldn't you be happy
to run into a childhood friend?

892
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,664
You've never looked at me that way
even though I gave you two sons

893
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:47,250
and lived with your parents for ten years.

894
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:50,253
You're not my childhood friend, woman.

895
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:53,840
Who's more important to you?
Your childhood friend or your wife?

896
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,967
This isn't about who's more important.

897
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,677
Did you call for me, ma'am?

898
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,430
Can I get some lukewarm water
for my pills?

899
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:01,347
Yes, ma'am.

900
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:08,146
It's important to me. Very important.

901
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:14,569
Why did you sign the divorce papers?
What are you, a saint?

902
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,863
It's not always good to be one.

903
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,574
Hyang-gi insisted.

904
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:21,659
You should give
that much damage to his life.

905
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:24,954
It's not that easy. Even Hyang-gi gave up.

906
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,999
Think it over. Don't do him any favors.

907
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:29,584
But he begged.

908
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,628
Professor Park begged?

909
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:35,923
I'm more at ease now
both physically and mentally.

910
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:38,051
For one, there's less laundry to do.

911
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,678
Men require constant care.

912
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:43,598
You should at least get back at the woman
before you split up.

913
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:44,724
Aren't you curious?

914
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:47,685
What good will it do?
It won't change anything.

915
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:51,022
I'm sure you're devastated, but the kids…

916
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:54,317
It hurts more to see them
pretending to be okay.

917
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,195
I don't understand you at all.

918
01:00:57,278 --> 01:01:00,573
I wouldn't sign the papers
until I got enough revenge.

919
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,951
Should I go grab her hair
just like they do on soap operas?

920
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,496
You can find her if you hire a PI.

921
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,581
That doesn't always work in your favor.

922
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:12,502
They ask the husbands for money instead
and make it look like there's no affair.

923
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:15,546
What? Honor among thieves, is it?

924
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,340
They take money from both sides.

925
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,681
I guess Mr. Seo is not coming.

926
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,392
I'm not sure if he won't or can't, though.

927
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:30,687
Come in.

928
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,067
You really came.

929
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:38,569
You told me to come.

930
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:41,155
You wanted to come though, right?

931
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,200
-Have a seat.
-I'm good.

932
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,744
I'm ruining the good mood.

933
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,831
-So you're leaving?
-I'll leave you to it.

934
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,668
Take care then.

935
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,962
Aren't you going to take a seat?

936
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:58,464
-See you tomorrow.
-Sure.

937
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,716
Thank you for coming.

938
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:09,100
At least he knew where to get a good cake.

939
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:12,562
-I'll put it in the fridge.
-Please have some.

940
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:13,938
You can't have any.

941
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:16,315
Just the two of you.
I'll enjoy it with my eyes.

942
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,901
One bite won't kill me.

943
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,702
He knows what women like.

944
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:29,454
I'm sure he's a player.

945
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:32,206
It's okay as long as he doesn't
break women's hearts.

946
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,543
A player breaks hearts but never his own.

947
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,550
Why did Yu-sin head for Jeju Island?

948
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,137
His teacher from high school
lives there now,

949
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,055
and he's fallen ill recently.

950
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,267
Is it Mr. Lee Gang-jae?

951
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,394
I think so.

952
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,565
He adored Yu-sin dearly.

953
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:02,695
Why must people fall ill before they die?

954
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,740
What time is his flight?

955
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:09,243
He'll board soon. It's the 3 p.m. flight.

956
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:13,164
-He'll probably spend the night there.
-Right.

957
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:22,256
That's good--

958
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:24,884
Sa-hyeon?

959
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:26,719
Hi, Ung.

960
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,057
What's with the serious face?
What's bothering you?

961
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,517
Nothing.

962
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,605
Is it work-related?

963
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:40,358
I barely slept last night
due to the excitement.

964
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:44,195
Mi, do you eat sea urchin noodles?

965
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:46,364
Why not? It's really good.

966
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:48,783
I did some research,
and black pig seems famous.

967
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,245
There's a place I go
that grills pork on briquettes.

968
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,497
I love barley shindari.

969
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,207
It's so good.

970
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:00,253
-Is the food called barley shindari?
-Yes.

971
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:06,801
Our plane's boarding.

Your ticket's been confirmed.

976
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:27,488

979
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,871
It will take…

980
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:38,541
-Hello, may I help you find your seat?
-…one hour to Jeju International Airport.

981
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:40,293
