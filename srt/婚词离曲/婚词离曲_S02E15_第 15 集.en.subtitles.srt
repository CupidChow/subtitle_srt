1
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,186
What's wrong?

2
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,023
Do you know him?

3
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,500
EPISODE 15

4
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,502
Hey, Pi-young.

5
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,505
-Hello.
-Hello.

6
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,423
You saw him at the funeral.

7
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,592
He's our engineer. You know him, right?

8
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,551
I do.

9
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,971
Would you like one?

10
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:40,141
Sure. Thank you.

11
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,726
Where are your seats?

12
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,978
Royal 24 and 25.

13
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,732
-Enjoy.
-You too.

14
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,486
Goodbye.

15
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,705
You can understand
why he fell for her, right?

16
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,582
She's young and cheerful.

17
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,875
She seems nice.

18
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,087
What's your favorite type of gem?

19
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,881
Diamonds, of course.

20
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,093
Doesn't the name sound sophisticated?

21
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,261
They're elegant.

22
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:21,141
I don't get excited when I look at
or hear the names

23
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,767
of sapphires, emeralds, or rubies.

24
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,478
I do match them to my outfit,

25
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,897
but they should match
the color of my outfit.

26
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,566
Most women like diamonds.

27
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,235
But my mother loved pearls the most.

28
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,780
She liked the subtle glow they gave off.

29
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,116
Not all men

30
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,494
fall for young, pretty women.

31
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:46,207
I still have her jewelry
since I don't have anyone to give them to.

32
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,335
But I rarely look at them
because my heart breaks when I see them.

33
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,967
I know how that feels very well.

34
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,513
-I shouldn't have brought it up.
-No, it's fine. Gosh, I'm embarrassed.

35
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,183
Don't be.

36
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,937
You carry around a handkerchief
when most women carry tissues.

37
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,939
Tissues get dusty.

38
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,153
-Where's your seat?
-All the good ones were taken.

39
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,447
-I'm in S11.
-I'm in S10.

40
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,076
-Goodness. You're in row S as well?
-Yes.

41
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:33,212
That man is handsome and alluring.

42
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,547
Alluring how?

43
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,217
He's middle-aged,
but he doesn't look old at all.

44
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,470
He has great style.

45
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,931
He doesn't seem like he's married.

46
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,058
Is he a divorcÃ©?

47
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,205
I wasn't trying to keep you in the dark.

48
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,625
I knew you didn't want me meeting him.

49
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,502
So you did keep me in the dark.

50
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,172
You only met U-ram in secret.

51
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,716
Imagine how Hyang-gi must feel.

52
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,135
I know we're divorced but--

53
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,429
How could I ask her to meet me?

54
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,848
Although I do miss her dearly.

55
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,143
-Do you?
-Of course. She's my daughter.

56
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,436
The eldest child at that.

57
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,481
It's like having a best friend and a kid.

58
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,817
You may have a great time
with your best friend,

59
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,360
but your kids always come first.

60
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,779
What about a best friend and a lover?

61
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,490
No parent would choose
their friend over their kid.

62
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:45,410
It's absurd that you'd make
such a comparison after what you did.

63
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,913
Maybe it's because of your profession,

64
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:52,125
but you know how to twist
your words to your advantage.

65
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,673
Did you have a discreet wedding
for our kids' sake?

66
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,008
No.

67
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,345
She lost both of her parents recently.

68
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,766
Where's your car?

69
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,143
I took a cab here.

70
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,395
I rarely drive to musicals.

71
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,522
Then would you like me to drop you off?

72
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,399
Would that be okay?

73
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,571
Her mother was driving.

74
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,531
They both passed away at once?

75
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,327
Yet, she's performing?

76
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,162
She doesn't have a choice.

77
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,164
Thankfully, today was
her last performance.

78
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,711
How was it compared to the movie?

79
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,255
I liked the movie better.

80
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:43,468
Movies tend to be more rich in detail.

81
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,304
The original UK cast
will be coming next year.

82
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,014
Let me know right away.

83
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,433
Those tickets tend
to get sold out instantly.

84
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,851
I can get the tickets.

85
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:58,191
Whenever you're driving us
back home after a night out,

86
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,817
it makes me glad I've married you.

87
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,152
Not me.

88
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,946
Are you tired? Should I drive?

89
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,866
I'm overjoyed, not glad.

90
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,123
Why did you pinch me
instead of showing me love?

91
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,250
This is how I express love. I'm perverted.

92
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,252
Be more perverted.

93
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,337
I love it.

94
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,805
Hey.

95
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:43,903
No wonder she asked
for a divorce so nonchalantly.

96
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,696
I finally get it.

97
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:50,243
She's seeing that Mr. Seo guy.
I don't know since when though.

98
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,245
Don't assume things.

99
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,581
If they're not dating,
why would they watch a musical together?

100
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,209
Yu-sin, don't try to deny the obvious.

101
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,919
They're colleagues.

102
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,754
It makes sense.

103
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:06,551
Women never go to musicals
with a guy they're not interested in.

104
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,345
They look good together.

105
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,351
Do you watch musicals often?

106
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,689
I should know
a variety of songs and musicians.

107
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,983
I used to go more often.

108
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,193
I hope I'm not making you uncomfortable.

109
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,987
Of course not. We're colleagues.

110
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,282
It's so clean in here.

111
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,659
You're quite tidy, aren't you?

112
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,579
-Is that a compliment?
-Of course.

113
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,501
Ms. Nam sure is an actress.

114
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,463
She completely transformed
into someone else onstage.

115
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,923
When we met her,

116
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,342
she was a cheerful and feminine woman.

117
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,473
What kind of person
do you think she is in real life?

118
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,351
Wasn't she great in the scenes
that were sad tonight?

119
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,854
-It was realistic.
-I agree.

120
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:03,274
But she was acting.
I'm talking about her in real life.

121
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,902
You don't like to gossip, do you?

122
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,154
Because I wouldn't want them
to gossip about me.

123
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,365
There's not much
to gossip about you anyway.

124
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,783
Are you saying I'm boring?

125
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,620
You talked about gems earlier,

126
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,205
so let me tell you about stones.

127
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,248
Let's say you found a stone somewhere.

128
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,961
You tell your friend that you found
a nice stone to put in your garden.

129
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,256
Then they'll ask you
what the stone looks like.

130
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,718
If the shape reminds you of something,

131
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,678
you could tell your friend so.

132
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,515
But if it's nothing special,
there's not much you can say.

133
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:40,186
I agree. I admit that I lack color.

134
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:44,065
Being too colorful may be
an inconvenience. It's not a bad trait.

135
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,858
How about your husband?

136
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,944
Can't you tell as a fellow man?

137
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,320
He looks manly.

138
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,531
Well, you don't look girly.

139
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,908
I'm sure he's popular with women.

140
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,494
He's perfect in every aspect.

141
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,914
He even cheated
in the most perfect way possible.

142
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:01,791
What do you mean?

143
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,919
He had me completely fooled.

144
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,841
Make a right at the next
intersection. It's faster that way.

145
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,431
Goodness. Did you not have dinner yet?

146
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,016
I did. A sandwich.

147
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,060
That's not enough for your build.

148
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,312
I could eat again.

149
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,523
How about some gimbap?

150
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,109
There's a restaurant
nearby that only opens at night.

151
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,528
-That's a pop-up bar.
-They sell drinks too.

152
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,574
What would you like?

153
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,616
MENU
TTEOKBOKKI, GIMBAP

154
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,743
Gimbap will do.

155
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,746
How about some udon or tteokbokki as well?

156
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,164
Up to you.

157
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,344
HELP YOURSELF TO PICKLED RADISH AND WATER

158
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,566
Do you want some peanuts?

159
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,651
No.

160
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,835
They must have fought.

161
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,758
Let me. It doesn't suit you.

162
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,637
That doesn't matter.

163
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,934
You rarely eat at these places, right?

164
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,228
-Yes.
-Do you not like it?

165
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,190
-It's tasty.
-Kids these days say "die for" often.

166
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,610
-Do you have a dish you'd die for?
-I do.

167
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,195
Should I ask or not?

168
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,197
-What the dish is?
-Yes.

169
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,658
Wheat pancakes.

170
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,329
Wheat pancakes?
You mean grilled wheat pancakes?

171
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,873
Yes. My mother used to make them.

172
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,333
How did she make them?

173
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,588
I'm not sure, but they were tasty.

174
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,840
I tried making some myself

175
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,843
because I missed her
and her wheat pancakes.

176
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,553
But they tasted nowhere like hers.

177
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:24,058
-They wouldn't even cook properly.
-Were there chives or zucchini slices?

178
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,102
No. It was just wheat.

179
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,147
And they were tastier
when I ate with my hands.

180
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,276
They were as thin as paper but glutinous.

181
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,821
Since they were thin,
I'd tear them apart or roll them.

182
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,658
Then I'd dip them
in soy sauce and vinegar.

183
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,577
They were extremely scrumptious.

184
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,970
And you? What dish would you die for?

185
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,597
Fried tofu and uni
that I had while on a trip.

186
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,769
I can guess the country.

187
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,781
Are you eating something?

188
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,077
Yes. I'm just eating
some wheat pancakes I ruined.

189
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,039
It's 1 a.m.

190
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,957
I was going to go to bed,

191
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,751
but I suddenly craved them.

192
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,962
Go back to bed.
Did you wake up to go to the bathroom?

193
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,339
Yes.

194
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,342
They don't look ruined.

195
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,471
They're too thick.
They need to be very thin.

196
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,697
Hello?

197
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,074
Have you left yet?

198
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,952
I'm going to leave in ten minutes.

199
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,037
I should have gone with you.

200
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,706
It's okay. I understand that you can't go.

201
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,583
Call me when you get there.

202
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,168
I'll be up and waiting.

203
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,046
I'm in front of your place.

204
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,091
-Why?
-I'll take you to the airport.

205
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,887
-Hello?
-What for? Just leave.

206
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:07,972
Come down.

207
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,673
-Did you have an after-party yesterday?
-I didn't go.

208
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,092
My brother went to see you,

209
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:48,178
but he left because there were
too many fans by the door.

210
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,599
Get some sleep. I'll leave you alone.

211
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,405
Hey. Give Bada a bath.

212
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,573
Yes, sir.

213
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,117
I've packed the food.

214
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,912
-Okay. Make sure you lock the doors.
-I will.

215
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,206
Please pack
Bada's kibbles as well as her bowls.

216
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,333
Yes, sir.

217
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,295
-You're bringing Bada too?
-Yes.

218
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,088
Song Yuan isn't going to like that.

219
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,590
She said I could on the phone.

220
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,425
Of course, she'd say yes.

221
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,844
How could she say no
to her future father-in-law?

222
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,765
Put some trust
in our housekeeper. She'll treat her well.

223
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,184
It's not that I don't trust her.

224
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,313
Bada can act cute and comfort Sa-hyeon.

225
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,940
And Song Yuan likes dogs too.

226
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,861
I don't ever want to see Hye-ryung again.

227
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,198
How could she end it like this?

228
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,700
How could she be okay with this?

229
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,911
She had planned this ahead of time

230
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,913
and yet she dared to smile.

231
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,248
On top of that, she even thanked us.

232
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,209
Of course, she's okay.

233
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,794
Nonetheless,

234
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,296
they say the righteous will always win.

235
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,133
No more dark eyeliners for me.
Give me a natural look.

236
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,969
-From now on?
-Yes.

237
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,440
Shouldn't you be at work?

238
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,196
Do you want something to drink?

239
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,322
Sit down.

240
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,078
I need to go to work.

241
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,623
What?

242
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,043
-What is it?
-So that was it?

243
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,004
-What do you mean?
-Your engineer.

244
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,507
What are you getting at?
Can't I watch a musical with a colleague?

245
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,593
We're well over the age
of going on heart-fluttering dates.

246
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,929
You already had feelings for him.

247
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,017
That's why you were
adamant about divorcing me.

248
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,394
Don't try to blame me for this.

249
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,271
I saw it with my own eyes.

250
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,481
Did we embrace or show affection?

251
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,193
That's rich coming from you who walked
arm in arm with his young mistress.

252
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,528
You sent her to my place.

253
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,031
You were looking for
a way to live with her.

254
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:16,201
I gave you permission like you wanted.
Is that a problem? Stop acting.

255
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,661
I know you won't admit it.

256
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,662
Admit what?

257
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,957
You already had feelings for him.
You bonded with him.

258
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,417
Isn't that normal?

259
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,794
You bond with some and not with others.

260
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,048
Then there are those who seek
other bonds despite having one already.

261
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,050
-Like you.
-Me?

262
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,219
It's over for us anyway.
Why try to pick a fight?

263
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,015
-What a great chance you have.
-You were upset about being betrayed,

264
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,767
but you played me for a fool.

265
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,769
How in the world did I betray you?

266
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,855
Both of you
already had feelings for each other.

267
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:48,650
No wonder you openly dated him
as soon as the papers were filed.

268
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:53,363
-And yet you blamed me for everything.
-I did? Did I curse or hit you?

269
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,324
Did I force you to admit to the affair?

270
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,909
You had feelings for that punk.

271
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,746
Just admit it already.
Don't bother hiding anything.

272
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,581
Don't you dare call him that.

273
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:06,335
I found it odd when you blushed
and hid from him at the pool.

274
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,295
It felt odd.

275
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,506
-We ran into each other.
-Like I'd believe that?

276
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,382
That's your choice.

277
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,343
Do you think everyone's like you?

278
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,345
You're suspecting us for nothing.

279
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,597
-You left together.
-You know I don't drive

280
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,973
when I go out alone.

281
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,350
He asked me where my carâ¦

282
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,977
Wait. This is ridiculous.

283
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,855
Why must I explain
myself to you when we're divorced?

284
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,524
-I've done nothing wrong.
-You haven't?

285
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,359
-That's right.
-I'll take care of Ji-a from now on.

286
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,944
That's ridiculous.

287
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,028
You'll remarry.

288
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,240
What's it to you? What about you then?

289
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,826
A Mi is kind. She'll be a good mother.

290
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,870
Is she better than her own mother?

291
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,832
Did she seduce a married man
because she was so kind-hearted?

292
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,083
How dare you?

293
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,585
-Whatever.
-Don't you dare bring this up again.

294
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,838
I won't allow her
to be raised by a stepdad.

295
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,714
-What about you?
-There's Ms. Kim.

296
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,425
Her grandmother
will tend to her at all times,

297
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,928
unlike her mom who'll be out all the time.

298
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,180
She's not even a blood relative.

299
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,766
I heard you told A Mi
that Ms. Kim was your first love.

300
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,185
No wonder you never called her Mother.

301
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,604
You were always
so sweet and called her Ms. Kim.

302
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:12,526
I hope you live happily ever after
with your old first love and young lover.

303
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,028
-Is that all you got?
-Look who's talking.

304
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:16,780
Leave.

305
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,472
Do you know what went
through my mind on my way here?

306
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,474
No, and I'm not interested.

307
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,230
Will you date him?

308
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,649
-Seo Ban.
-Must I answer that?

309
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,068
-Why not?
-Who knows what the future holds?

310
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,822
I had no idea
that you cheated behind my back.

311
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,157
Enough of that!

312
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,451
Then should I use a more
refined word and call it an affair?

313
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,038
I can't guarantee anything
about the future.

314
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,497
Then what about right now?

315
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,042
How do you feel about him?

316
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,924
-He's different from most men.
-How so?

317
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,760
He always respects women
and never hits on them.

318
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,386
-That's not easy.
-How do you know?

319
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,096
I've watched him for many years.

320
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,473
You watched him?

321
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,143
So? You trust him?

322
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,103
Yes, as a colleague and an individual.

323
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,146
You do have feelings.

324
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,774
You're right. I think he's a good man.

325
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,652
He has many merits and few flaws.

326
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,405
He's ten years older than me
and he acts his age.

327
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,078
Are youâ¦

328
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,373
Does he know you're divorced?

329
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:50,916
He does.

330
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,168
Will you date him if he asks?

331
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,171
I'll have to think about it.

332
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,298
You didn't even bother to deny it.

333
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,510
What must I acknowledge or deny?

334
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,805
Is this why you were
so adamant about the divorce?

335
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:08,225
So that you could neglect Ji-a
and hang out late at night with a man?

336
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,728
"Neglect"? We have
a housekeeper who lives with us.

337
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,730
She's getting a checkup at the hospital.

338
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:17,276
Is leaving Ji-a with her and hanging out
with a man something to brag about?

339
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,069
Like we never did that.

340
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,237
Watch your tone.

341
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,823
How can I show you respect
when you don't deserve it?

342
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,870
I've become a terrible dad.

343
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,872
She'll find out sooner or later.

344
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,711
So can you please stay by her side?

345
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,963
How would she feel to know

346
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,841
that I'm remarried
and that you're hanging out with some man?

347
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,968
If I was in her shoes,

348
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,512
I'd think
"Adults are doing whatever they please.

349
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,390
I don't care about anything
anymore. I'm going to rebel."

350
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,018
I beg you.

351
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,188
Let's not hurt our daughter
solely by pursuing our happiness.

352
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,442
Daughters, as well as sons,

353
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,320
rely more on their moms than their dads.

354
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,988
Many of my patients are like that.

355
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,906
And Ji-a is no exception.

356
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,660
Okay? I beg you.

357
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,787
I gave A Mi a cup of coffee yesterday.

358
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,956
Would I have bought three
had it been a date?

359
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,167
We just ran into each other.

360
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,794
He assumed I was with Si-eun,

361
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,130
so I said she went to
the bathroom as a joke.

362
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,174
He believed me and bought three cups.

363
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,763
I'm sorry.

364
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,890
I was mistaken.

365
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,274
How did you end up
sitting next to each other?

366
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,109
There weren't any vacant seats either.

367
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,323
I was surprised as well.

368
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,283
Another coincidence?

369
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,327
Yes. For a minute,

370
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,830
I did wonder if it was fate.

371
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,176
We had some late-night snacks nearby.

372
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,929
His stomach rumbled on our way home,

373
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:12,432
so I asked him if he wanted
some gimbap and tteokbokki.

374
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,895
I paid for it since he came
all the way here. Anything else?

375
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,093
Travel safely.

376
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,344
Don't forget to call me.

377
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,895
Stay strong.

378
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,336
You didn't even get to see her?

379
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,716
No. I didn't know she had so many fans.

380
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,384
She'll be in pain for a long time.

381
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,636
Or maybe forever.

382
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,265
Isn't it such a pity
that they passed before she got married?

383
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,641
What now?

384
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,603
This won't affect her marriage, will it?

385
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,979
It won't.

386
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,650
Will she not make it to your baby shower?

387
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:50,030
No. She loves babies,

388
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,781
so it may actually comfort her.

389
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,583
This sofa is
so comfortable. Where did you get it?

390
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,336
My father-in-law bought it for me.

391
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:07,547
He said it was important to have
a comfy sofa when raising a baby.

392
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:11,092
It's so cozy like the beds at a hotel.
It must have been expensive.

393
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,011
It's actually not that expensive.

394
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:13,929
Can I lie down?

395
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,559
They must be here.

396
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,270
Are you expecting someone?

397
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,901
My parents-in-law.

398
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:30,612
They're staying with me
in case I have the baby early.

399
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,032
Gosh. You should have told me.

400
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,952
It's okay.
They're very laid-back and wonderful.

401
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:41,122
You should
meet them once before my wedding.

402
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,751
-No traffic jam?
-No.

403
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,881
She's a close friend of mine.

404
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,508
Hello.

405
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,550
Hello.

406
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:56,972
Hi, Dongmi.

407
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,641
She changed her name to Bada.

408
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:04,521
Hold on. There are two Badas here.

409
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,273
That's not right.

410
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:09,693
A human and a dog named Bada.
No, make that a baby and a dog.

411
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,861
She's also our child.

412
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,029
How cute.

413
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,325
-Do you like dogs?
-Of course.

414
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,576
Bada, let's go pee.

415
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,579
Sit down.

416
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,750
I'm glad I got this sofa.

417
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,794
I agree. I love it.

418
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,462
Thank you.

419
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,842
Where in the States are you from? LA?

420
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:34,843
Yes.

421
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,553
You should come by often.

422
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,138
I will.

423
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,309
There are three of us who hang out often,

424
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,227
and she's excited to see the baby too.

425
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,647
This place finally feels like home.

426
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,775
A home should be filled with people.

427
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:54,946
Having you two here
makes me feel so reassured.

428
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,156
The same goes for us.

429
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,243
How about we have lunch outside?

430
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,703
How about a buffet?

431
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,623
What about Bada?

432
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,250
Mr. Kim can look after her.

433
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,253
He's right. He can eat once we come back.

434
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,797
I'll drive. I'll be careful.

435
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:16,343
Your friend is wonderful just like you.

436
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,678
Invite your other friend too.

437
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,680
It's too sudden.

438
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,600
Only if she lives nearby.

439
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,019
As long as she lives in Gangnam.

440
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,646
She's probably on her flight to Spain.

441
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,940
Do you mean she's flying right now?

442
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,905
This is our first story.

443
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,825
"I met a man and
we were in love for ten years.

444
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,911
We dated for three years

445
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,080
and have been married for seven.

446
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,998
But we're about to get a divorce.

447
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,626
I thought husbands who cheat
only existed in TV shows,

448
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,628
but it happened to me.

449
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,967
My trust in him was so strong

450
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:02,222
that I didn't even check
his phone like any other wife would do.

451
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,892
But he asked me for a divorce

452
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,479
and told me
he fell in love with someone else.

453
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,191
The moment I heard that,

454
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,902
my mind went blank.

455
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,075
My heart sank,

456
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,495
and I couldn't breathe.

457
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:35,130
Writing about it nowâ¦

458
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,260
brings back all the pain I felt back then.

459
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,725
Why me?

460
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:51,062
I wanted to live
a happy life with my husband.

461
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,273
And I did.

462
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,484
But I guess I was mistaken.

463
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,821
'Did I trust him too much?

464
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,031
What did I lack?'

465
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:05,702
I blamed myself and resented him as well.

466
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,037
I can barely sleep these days.

467
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,915
I need to let him go.

468
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,876
I have no choice.

469
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,420
Then what about me?

470
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,173
How will I overcome this?

471
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,384
Honestly, I don't know."

472
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,849
Lady Luck must favor you.

473
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,227
Had I been in your shoes,
things wouldn't have turned out this way.

474
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,937
It's all thanks to you guys.

475
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,939
-Then buy us a drink.
-I will.

476
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,529
Isn't Yu-sin 16 years older than you?

477
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,364
Yes.

478
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,618
My late husband was
19 years older than me.

479
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,829
All men can't help
but look old once they turn 60.

480
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,333
When Yu-sin turns 60, you'll be 44.

481
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:57,462
Women nowadays in their forties
still look very young.

482
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,714
-Imagine that.
-What do you mean?

483
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,926
Imagine how old he'll look then.

484
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,385
I won't let that happen.

485
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,597
What about me?
I took great care of my late husband.

486
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,349
We went swimming every day.

487
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,768
You saw photos
of him with white hair, right?

488
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:14,646
I think Yu-sin
would look even better with white hair.

489
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,314
Forget about the hair.

490
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:19,150
Their personality changes as well.

491
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,487
They nag a lot
and get all riled up for no reason.

492
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,155
Even my husband changed.

493
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,949
You're talking about men in general.

494
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,452
Yu-sin is a doctor.
A psychiatrist at that.

495
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,164
It depends. Age doesn't have
anything to do with your character.

496
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,708
This isn't working.

497
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,877
I just can't get through to her.

498
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,214
As men age,

499
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:44,717
they're more attracted
to younger women. Take Yu-sin for example.

500
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,052
The same goes for women.

501
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,513
You'll be attracted to young, healthy men.

502
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,014
But by then, it'll be too late.

503
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,309
I won't regret it. Did you?

504
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,270
I'm just saying.

505
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,313
Yu-sin told me

506
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:00,483
that you were a very devoted wife.

507
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,695
-You truly loved him.
-I did.

508
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,114
I'll strive to be like you.

509
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,908
-Have you farted in front of him?
-Have you?

510
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,370
When an adult
asks you something, just answer.

511
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,998
-Don't answer with a question. It's rude.
-Okay.

512
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,542
So have you farted in front of him or not?

513
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,043
Of course not.

514
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,508
-Hello.
-Hey.

515
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,885
How were you today?

516
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,011
Good.

517
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,762
Even with them around?

518
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:31,848
I love it.

519
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:40,106
-Who did you drink with?
-Don't tell me you drank alone.

520
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,608
Hang in there.

521
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,693
They say every cloud has a silver lining.

522
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,863
My colleagues wanted me
to buy them a drink, so I did.

523
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,408
Why would they ask you
to do such a thing when things are rough?

524
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,036
Hey, Dongmi.

525
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,206
-It's Bada.
-Dad, let's call her Dongmi here.

526
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,541
Until Bada is born.

527
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,918
All right.

528
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,878
The dog's name doesn't matter.

529
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,922
Dongmi.

530
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,176
I hope you get along with Bada.

531
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,224
Thank you.

532
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,314
It's nice.

533
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,652
-Honey water?
-It's lemonade.

534
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,284
Mom, Dad, Song Yuan,

535
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,537
and our baby, Bada.

536
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:42,794
A blessing in disguise does exist.

537
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,255
I've been bombarded with cases.

538
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,256
Really?

539
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,051
People are funny.

540
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,555
Hye-ryung made me out to be a cheater

541
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,642
who also got the long end of the stick.

542
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,686
And people

543
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,564
have been asking me
to take their divorce suits.

544
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,693
-It's hectic.
-Are you serious?

545
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,570
Yes. That's why they wanted me
to buy them a drink.

546
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,114
I had no other choice.

547
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,699
It sure was a blessing.

548
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,200
Exactly.

549
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,244
I'm happy for you.

550
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,707
Thank you, Lord, Buddha, and Mother Mary.

551
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,712
I think Song Yuan and our child
brought us so many blessings.

552
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:26,713
I agree.

553
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:30,383
It's all thanks to you two. It's karma.

554
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,385
Did you hear that?

555
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,389
I am sincerely grateful that I'm your son.

556
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,808
And also for having met her.

557
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,063
Lord, thank you.

558
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,609
See? The righteous will always win.

559
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,695
You must have been worried.

560
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,448
-You can relax now.
-Okay.

561
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:57,035
-They're not firing you, right?
-Of course not.

562
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,829
Our president is on cloud nine.

563
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,331
He's actually worried I might quit.

564
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:10,715
I don't feel a single ounce of guilt
toward Hye-ryung.

565
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,136
I neither regret nor resent her.

566
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,014
Good. Just forget about her.

567
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,558
Is there anything you want?

568
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,436
Didn't you say you wanted a sports car?

569
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,021
I'll gladly buy you one.

570
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,774
And I'll gladly refuse.
I appreciate it, though.

571
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,569
-Why?
-I didn't mean it.

572
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,197
Just wait until you become a dad yourself.

573
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,241
Having a child
brings you enough happiness.

574
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,619
You don't desire anything from them.

575
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,079
I agree.

576
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,498
Sincerity over materialistic things.

577
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,375
There's no more sincerity left in me.

578
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,547
-I've given it all.
-You have no more left?

579
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,258
That's right. All I got is this body.

580
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,594
I should also have a drink to celebrate.

581
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,263
Yes, you should have a drink. And you too.

582
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,183
Andâ¦ You can have some next time.

583
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,894
Would you like some wine?

584
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,438
How about Kaoliang liquor?

585
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:18,241
I'm sorry.
I let my emotions get out of hand.

586
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,411
Isn't it about time we had a team dinner?

587
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,789
You're right. When are you free?

588
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,749
This time, it's on me.

589
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,751
Let me know the date.

590
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,562
Over here, Dad.

591
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,284
Dr. Shin, aren't you going to go home?

592
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,321
-Thank you. Please wait.
-Okay.

593
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,245
Would you like to order?

594
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,722
Could you get me
the earliest flight to Madrid?

595
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:05,640
Yes, sir.

596
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,945
Dad, I need to go to Spain for a few days.

597
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:23,449
I hope you'll stay strong
and regain your cheerful spirit.

598
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:26,077
-You have us, the dream team.
-Do you mean as colleagues?

599
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,788
Or as friends?

600
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:32,124
I think both. Or is it just me?

601
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,209
I agree.

602
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,294
Here.

603
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,757
Hye-ryung isn't the only one
who needs solace.

604
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,008
I'm a divorcÃ©e as well.

605
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,236
Hey, Ban.

606
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,531
Can you recommend a nice restaurant?

607
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,033
Who are you eating with? How old are they?

608
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,577
I want to comfort some ladies.
They're my colleagues.

609
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,121
I see. I'll send you a text.

610
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,414
Are you at the airport?

611
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,208
I am. I'll explain once I come back.

612
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,293
Okay.

613
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,715
Lee Yeon-hui is getting married.

614
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,591
She sent me her wedding invite.

615
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,969
-With who?
-With that married man?

616
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,513
No. Her first love from university.

617
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,307
I knew it.

618
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,935
I knew his wife
wouldn't divorce him. Why would she?

619
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,689
We're pretty much saints.
What does the guy do for a living?

620
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:40,443
I didn't ask. His character
matters more than his merits.

621
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,821
Ms. Lee, will you say
the same thing when Hyang-gi gets married?

622
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:47,825
You're right.
My ex-husband had great character.

623
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:51,078
I guess everyone changes.

624
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,997
-But not us.
-Of course not.

625
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,623
We're not the type to change.

626
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,752
Women are actually more loyal.

627
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,128
I agree.

628
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,547
By the way, "Savana"?

629
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,217
That restaurant must be popular
to have a two-week waiting list.

630
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,553
It's a hotel restaurant that just opened.

631
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,430
The chef was abroad for a long time

632
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,140
and the food there is delicious.

633
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:14,852
Mr. Seo seems to frequent high-end places.

634
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,438
That evening after we finish eating,

635
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,066
could you guys
make up excuses and leave first?

636
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,236
I'll be honest.

637
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,364
I have a thing for Mr. Seo.

638
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,745
-Are you serious?
-I am.

639
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,663
But he's much older.

640
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,999
-What's the age gap?
-Seventeen years.

641
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,585
I've realized that
young men aren't that great.

642
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:40,711
They're self-centered.

643
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:45,841
Are you sure about this?
We know he's not that friendly with women.

644
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,761
They say men change
depending on how women treat them.

645
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,721
I know I shouldn't say this,

646
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,182
but I'm going to give it a try.

647
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:58,604
My mom once told me
that silver-tongued men

648
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,898
would act the same way toward other women.

649
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,150
My ex-husband was a great example of that.

650
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:07,113
I think men like him
would be more decent in many ways.

651
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,072
Is that it?

652
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:11,700
He's also dandy and well-mannered.

653
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,869
I understand.

654
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,663
You will help me, right?

655
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:20,543
Of course.

656
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,130
It's going to be
entertaining to watch them.

657
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,464
Don't let him find out.

658
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,966
Of course not.

659
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:30,261
I doubt it'll be easy
since he's been a bachelor for so long.

660
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:34,265
Perhaps, he might be glad that you did.

661
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:37,643
You're more than enough for him.

662
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,981
If things seem to go well, do help me.

663
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:45,151
Sit next to him that day.
Let's see if you guys look good together.

664
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,319
Maybe they'll look
surprisingly good together.

665
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,574
Right.

666
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,703
Use this.

667
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,124
Apply it here.

668
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,544
Take good care of yourself
if you want to maintain your beauty.

669
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,796
-It's too late for me.
-That's not true.

670
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,341
I should give this to Hyang-gi
so she can use it from now on.

671
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:13,137
I agree. We're always
on our phones these days,

672
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,847
so it's never too early.

673
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,062
Like this.

674
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,660
So you're going to beat me to it?

675
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,793
Were you taken aback as well?

676
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:49,465
Yes. That must be why
she started wearing less makeup.

677
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,967
Mr. Seo is on the conservative side.

678
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,344
That must be why.

679
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,888
She sure is smart.

680
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,014
And so are you.

681
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,433
Maybe with my studies
and taking care of the house,

682
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,018
but not with men.

683
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:04,980
She may be smart,
but she lost her husband too.

684
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,566
We're all the same.

685
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,779
I have some gelato.

686
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,032
They'll want some too.

687
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,076
You're much stricter than I am.

688
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,702
I'm too soft-hearted.

689
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,455
You need to help them
build healthy eating habits.

690
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,542
You're right. That's what
a good parent should do.

691
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:29,004
Do you think Hye-ryung was acting

692
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,048
-while reading the story today?
-No way.

693
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:34,843
How could she be saddened by that story
when she's already considering remarriage?

694
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,303
Hye-ryung's a professional.

695
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:40,766
She never choked when she read
even more heartbreaking stories.

696
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,814
I must be right. She wanted to look
helpless and weak in front of him.

697
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,066
As she had planned,

698
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:51,944
he did propose a get-together
as a way to comfort her.

699
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,029
That's actually convincing.

700
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:59,118
She sure is different from us.
She's very clever.

701
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,412
We're no match for her.

702
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:05,124
-She's young.
-Not at all. You're born with that talent.

703
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,625
Don't call it that.

704
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,669
Do you think she's his type?

705
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,462
He's also a man.

706
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,048
Why would he refuse a young, pretty woman?

707
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,634
-She probably grew on him.
-Grew on him?

708
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,137
They've been
working together for over a year now.

709
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,223
They're bound to grow on each other.

710
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,933
They say many drops make a flood.

711
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,394
Then that means
we must have grown on him as well.

712
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,522
-Thank you for the meal.
-Me too.

713
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,651
Since you had an early dinner,

714
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,028
how about we go for a swim?

715
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,071
What's gotten into you?

716
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,240
I just want to swim with you.

717
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,325
Sounds good.

718
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:43,454
I should start swimming

719
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,205
every morning or evening.

720
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,166
I should take care of myself.

721
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,250
I agree.

722
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,086
Wouldn't evening be better?

723
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,088
You're too busy in the morning.

724
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,633
Okay. I should also
hire a personal trainer.

725
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:59,136
My homeroom teacher
once took off her outerwear.

726
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,929
-This area.
-The upper arms?

727
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:02,973
They were so saggy.

728
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,434
I'll strive to prevent that
from happening.

729
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,187
Please. I don't want you to age.

730
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,772
Me neither.

731
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:13,233
I hope you'll be healthy
and slim as an adult as well.

732
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:17,571
You'll never gain fat on your back
since you eat so little.

733
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,781
I do?

734
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:23,035
It's been so long since I last
saw you laugh out loud like this.

735
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,079
Do you like it?

736
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:26,914
I'll try harder.

737
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,582
Don't force yourself.

738
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,627
Dad said it's never healthy
to force yourself to do anything.

739
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,003
Sounds like him.

740
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,130
Ji-a.

741
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:41,303
I don't think it'll be bad
to continue living apart from your dad.

742
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,847
-Why not?
-We still live close by.

743
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,892
Back in the day, men lived in one house,

744
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,061
while women lived in another.

745
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:52,022
You're right.
I saw that in historical dramas.

746
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,524
But Dad wouldn't like it.

747
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:57,236
He has nothing to worry about
since Grandma will take care of him.

748
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,488
One perk is that it feels like

749
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,241
we're dating.

750
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:08,539
We miss each other even more,
so our bond has become stronger.

751
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,874
-We're not always around each other.
-I guess.

752
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:14,169
It's much better this way.
He doesn't hear me nagging anymore.

753
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,296
He's probably loving it.

754
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,008
He can fart whenever he wants
without hiding it from me.

755
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,388
Where are you going?

756
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,307
-Swimming.
-I haven't swum in a while.

757
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,350
Take me with you.

758
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,695
-Where are you going?
-To meet a friend.

759
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,363
What about dinner?

760
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,489
I'll probably eat out.

761
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,251
Hi, Ji-a.

762
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,962
-Hi, who did you come with?
-My mom.

763
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,881
I see. Have fun.

764
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,632
-Okay.
-Bye.

765
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,678
Oh, Mr. Seo.

766
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:06,388
Greet him properly.

767
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,599
-Hello.
-Long time no see.

768
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,851
-Aren't you in sixth grade now?
-Yes.

769
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,353
-Did you just arrive?
-I did.

770
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:17,024
-I'm embarrassed to run into you here.
-What does that make everyone else?

771
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,777
-Can you swim well?
-I can.

772
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,821
Warm up first and wet your body.

773
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,248
Ma'am, have this.

774
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,838
Do you have trouble walking these days?

775
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,133
I'm fine.

776
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,969
You should start taking care of yourself.

777
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,932
-I'm still healthy.
-That's what you think.

778
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,350
I know my body the best.

779
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,143
You walked down the stairs sideways

780
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,729
when they were inspecting
the elevator yesterday.

781
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:58,774
What's it to you
how I walk down the stairs?

782
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,652
You walked like that
because your knees were hurting.

783
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:06,740
That's why most grandmothers
walk down the stairs sideways.

784
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:12,037
She got them for you, so just take them.

785
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,377
Let's eat.

786
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,966
-"Let's eat"?
-Your dinner's ready.

787
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,931
Don't be concerned about my health

788
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,308
or give me any supplements.

789
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,519
-Why not?
-Must I answer that?

790
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,980
You're emphasizing that
I've aged in front of Yu-sin.

791
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,816
That's not true. I did so because--

792
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:41,775
Enough.

793
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,949
-What is it?
-Mother.

794
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,118
This isn't about your pride.

795
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,912
You should take care of yourself
while you're still healthy.

796
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,247
Your bones are very important.

797
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,749
You better shut your trap
before I pour cold soup over you.

798
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,878
How could you say such a thing?

799
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:07,593
Eat.

800
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:12,973
Didn't you hear me?

801
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,891
They're my eyes.
I'll do what I like with them.

802
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,144
-Why youâ¦
-You're going to pour cold soup over me?

803
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,690
And you pretend to be so elegant
in front of other people.

804
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:22,983
Are you not done talking?

805
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,277
People deserve respect.

806
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,529
If you're older than me, behave like one.

807
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:30,490
"Behave"? Are you trying to teach me?

808
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,869
They say you can learn something
even from a toddler.

809
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,162
You better shut it.

810
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,080
I won't.

811
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,027
JI-A DOESN'T KNOW THAT WE'RE DIVORCED

812
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,028
Okay.

813
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,847
Aren't you hungry?

814
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,433
The lasagna I had
has already been digested.

815
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,664
I'll be home late starting tomorrow.

816
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,333
-Due to work?
-Yes.

817
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:29,795
Don't worry. Husbands should be
working and providing for the family.

818
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,588
-Mom.
-Yes?

819
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,465
Is this happiness?

820
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:37,260
Of course, it is.
Gangnam is growing on me too.

821
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,221
I never liked it here.

822
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,139
Should we move here?

823
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:46,019
I need to watch what I say.
He's like a little kid.

824
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,981
They say men never grow up.

825
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,692
-Song Yuan.
-Yes?

826
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,695
Don't you forget what I just said.
Men never grow up.

827
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:57,572
I won't.

828
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:03,995
Goodness. Check out
the noggins on those dogs.

829
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,581
They're huge.

830
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,501
Dad, you can just call them "heads".

831
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,586
Rumi.

832
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:13,672
Leo.

833
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,715
Leo, wait.

834
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,926
-What breed are they?
-They're Bichon Frises.

835
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:21,263
They have a unique hairstyle.

836
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,640
You groomed them well. It's pretty.

837
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,100
Are they female?

838
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:27,936
They're mother and son.
She's the mom, and he's her son.

839
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,774
-Is yours a mixed breed?
-We adopted her.

840
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,860
She's pretty much family.

841
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,528
Of course.

842
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,864
Is she your daughter-in-law or daughter?

843
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,157
Daughter. He's our son-in-law.

844
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,702
What a beautiful family.

845
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,537
Isn't my mother-in-law beautiful?

846
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,497
She sure is.

847
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,543
-Goodbye.
-All right.

848
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,128
Let's go.

849
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,881
Leo. You're so happy.

850
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:59,092
Mr. Pan, sir. Aren't you feeling hot?

851
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:00,552
Care to buy me a beer?

852
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,762
Should we have chicken and beer?

853
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,056
Anything from our son-in-law

854
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,683
if he's treating us.

855
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,935
There's a pop-up bar nearby.

856
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,969
-Sirloin or tenderloin?
-I like both, but we only have tenderloin.

857
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,638
We don't eat fatty meat.

858
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,682
You should have sirloin.
You prefer that, right?

859
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:50,352
-Four servings of tenderloin.
-You don't eat much.

860
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,270
-Three will do.
-Okay.

861
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,731
When did Ji-a start swimming?

862
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:58,777
Mr. Seo, you can ask me directly.

863
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,570
I started when I was four,

864
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,739
but I'm not too fond of water.

865
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,159
I was forced to take
survival swimming lessons in second grade.

866
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,620
-Good for you.
-What about you?

867
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:10,747
I'm like you.

868
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,874
My father was busy with work,

869
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:16,002
so I barely have any recollection
of swimming with my parents.

870
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,128
A coach taught me.

871
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:23,468
You look much younger with a hat on.

872
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:24,928
You look like a big brother.

873
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,973
U-ram talks about you from time to time.

874
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,266
He wants to play baseball with you.

875
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,519
Then we can. I don't see why not.

876
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:35,271
I prefer watching over playing,

877
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,232
-so please invite me.
-Okay.

878
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,443
Is there a sport
we could all play together?

879
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,653
There are many.

880
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,393
-For your mom.
-Thank you.

881
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,105
Thank you.

882
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,787
How many seats do you need?

883
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,141
Sleep tight, dear Bada.

884
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:55,435
Don't kick your mom while she's sleeping.

885
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,644
You'll startle her.

886
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:01,608
Sleep comfortably.

887
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,778
This is comfortable.
I sleep better this way.

888
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,493
It's not uncomfortable, right?

889
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:13,870
What did you say?

890
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:15,622
It isn't, right?

891
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:20,460
-Will you hit me for speaking casually?
-Try it and find out.

892
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,212
Honey.

893
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,005
What is it?

894
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,591
I can't be any happier.

895
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,386
This is too good to be true.

896
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,935
Your parents will be here with me,

897
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:40,146
so don't worry about coming home late.

898
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:45,276
They must be happy to live with you.

899
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,822
I can tell by my dad's voice
and expression.

900
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:52,909
Our lucky charm.

901
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:54,744
My dear husband.

902
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:58,373
-Say that again.
-My husband.

903
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,375
That'll be my nickname from now on.

904
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,377
No way.

905
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:05,755
But you just called me that.
I like it very much.

906
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,048
Only when it's us two.

907
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:12,220
Are you not going to touch my hair today?

908
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,980
Our Father, who art in heaven,

909
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:24,566
hallowed be thy name.

910
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,734
Thy kingdom come,

911
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:30,280
thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

912
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:37,495
You've blessed me
with this lovely woman when I was lonely.

913
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:44,794
You even gave us Bada.
I am endlessly grateful.

914
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:48,047
I promise you that I'll do my best

915
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,925
to maintain this happiness.

916
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:52,469
Amen.

917
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:04,063
This morning, I gave her some supplements.

918
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:07,442
She wasn't happy about that.

919
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,278
She told me not to pretend like I cared

920
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,614
and to never give her such things again.

921
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:15,992
So I told her to let go of her pride

922
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:20,872
because she should take care
of herself while she's still healthy.

923
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:25,126
But she glared at me
and told me to shut up.

924
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,130
I was taken aback so I looked at her.

925
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,342
She told me not to.

926
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:38,056
I asked her if she hated me that much.

927
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:43,102
They say you should kill
your enemy with kindness.

928
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,023
I told her that I was trying my best.

929
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:50,401
I asked her to give me a chance.

930
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,155
But she told me to shut my trap.

931
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,034
I started crying,

932
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,828
so I told her

933
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:05,959
that I'm also
a precious daughter to my parents.

934
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:09,921
I told her she was being too harsh on me.

935
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:13,299
Then she screamed, "Enough!"

936
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:15,718
And then,

937
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:19,722
she threw the cold soup at me.

938
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,018
Where is she?

939
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,311
I don't know.

940
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:29,816
Maybe she went to her house,
thinking you'd be mad at her.

941
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:32,193
After that,

942
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:36,489
she charged at me
and grabbed me by my hair.

943
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:41,869
I barely got away.

944
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,722
She's nuts.

945
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,892
-My molar is loose.
-Your molar?

946
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,894
How could she
put her hands on the elderly?

947
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,689
-How dare you?
-I never did.

948
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,528
-You brought that scary thing in here.
-I'm scared of you.

949
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,656
You are?

950
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,200
I'm afraid of what
you'll do to me next time around.

951
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:23,703
Look at my wrists.

952
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,957
-You didn't let go of my hair.
-When?

953
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,376
Should I show you
the lump of hair you ripped out?

954
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,713
I grabbed your wrists
because I had no other choice.

955
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:37,634
Gosh. Look at you being two-faced.

956
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:40,386
How could you hit
your future mother-in-law?

957
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,721
This should be on the news.

958
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:45,850
I've never read about a mother-in-law
as heinous as you.

959
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,395
When you were madâ¦

960
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:55,568
I never saw someone look so livid.

961
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,365
Here's the proof.

962
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:02,241
She's completely unscathed.

963
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,870
Hey! Don't you dare lie!

964
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:08,790
Yu-sinâ¦

965
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,084
My molar was loose.

966
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,003
The ER didn't have a dentist.

967
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:17,215
I went to my friend's,
whose husband was a dentist.

968
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:20,426
Thankfully, he won't need to pull it out.
I need to go back tomorrow.

969
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,055
I'm going to sue you.

970
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:25,515
This is quite severe.

971
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:27,642
Are you sure
you didn't do that to yourself?

972
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:29,769
You did, didn't you?

973
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:32,397
If not, could I have lost it for a moment?

974
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:37,777
You grabbed my hair,
and I grabbed your wrists.

975
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,861
I told you to let go.

976
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,114
Right.

977
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,492
You pulled on my hair,

978
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,829
and I hit your face with my head.

979
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,208
We need to install a security camera.

980
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:55,795
Just go home. Stop bickering.

981
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,965
You should go home too.

982
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,383
I never told you to come.

983
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,885
Why do you always have to fight?

984
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,438
You conniving snake.

985
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,064
Look who's talking.

986
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:19,193
Yu-sin.

987
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:52,769
LATE NAM JIN-SEUNG

988
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:55,646
LATE LIM HYE-SUK

989
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:21,547
Yu-sin will become penniless in no time.

990
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,300
She's going to suck him dry
then abandon him.

991
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:27,887
I've never seen anyone
so two-faced before.

992
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,348
THAT'S RICH COMING FROM YOU

993
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:32,475
He won't listen to me anymore.

994
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:35,019
He's head over heels for her.

995
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,730
I can't tell him what to do.

996
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,900
You need to step up
or things will get worse.

997
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,902
She's terrifying.

998
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:45,905
-Why should I?
-Ji-a should receive her inheritance.

999
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,865
-Will you let A Mi get it?
-It's immature.

1000
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,659
Money is important, you know?

1001
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,829
Look at these bruises. And this.

1002
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:54,664
She really hit you?

1003
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:56,332
Do you think I'm making this up?

1004
01:03:57,208 --> 01:04:00,378
It's been a week, but there's still
a yellow bruise on my cheek.

1005
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:03,714
I ought to sue her.

1006
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:05,967
-You should.
-Think of Yu-sin.

1007
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,803
She's boxing so she can hurt me,
not to lose weight.

1008
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:12,014
If I were you,
I'd ignore them and go back home.

1009
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:15,560
That's what he said. You don't know
the gravity of the situation.

1010
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,728
I also don't have a say in this.

1011
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,647
I forced him to sign the divorce papers.

1012
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:22,066
I can't change my tune like that.

1013
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:25,570
Then must we let
that young brat get her way?

1014
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:27,321
That's life.

1015
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:29,532
It doesn't always go as you wish.

1016
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:33,286
She became a Buddha after the divorce.

1017
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:34,996
She may as well reach nirvana soon.

1018
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:52,054

1022
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,775
Let me know when you go on air.

1023
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:05,943
Yes, sir.

1024
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:07,945
I'm happy for you.

1025
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:23,461
The phone is turned off. Your call will be
directed to voicemail after the beep.

1026
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:36,057
Where are we going?

1027
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:37,642
To the villa in Cheongpyeong.

1028
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:39,352
I want to go home.

1029
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,687
You'll have to unpack.

1030
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:45,149
Given your personality,
you'll clean the house too.

1031
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:48,069
-You'll get sick.
-I'm sure he cleaned.

1032
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,197
Professor Park?

1033
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:00,039
Thank you

1034
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,125
for coming all the way to Spain

1035
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,837
and sending my parents off.

1036
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:12,218
I'm truly grateful
for what you did for me.

1037
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:15,721
All the bad memoriesâ¦

1038
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:19,433
No, they weren't bad.

1039
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:22,687
I'm over

1040
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:26,232
what we went through in the past,
so you don't have to feel sorry.

1041
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:27,984
I never felt that way.

1042
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:29,068
I'm just saying.

1043
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:33,030
REST AREA

1044
01:06:58,472 --> 01:06:59,306
Let's get married.

1045
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,898
Marry me.

1046
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,477
What you feel for him isn't love then.

1047
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,938
Is breaking up with someone
you love a pastime for you?

1048
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:50,191
Cunning bitch.

1049
01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:52,109
-She must be sick.
-Yes, a little.

1050
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:53,861
Did she pass out?

1051
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:55,446
-Don't wake her.
-I won't.

1052
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:57,656
I'm craving some ice-cold beer.

1053
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,116
-She's having contractions!
-Contractions?

1054
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,368
Did Nam Ga-bin give birth?

1055
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:20,721
Son, let's go golfing.

1056
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:32,024
