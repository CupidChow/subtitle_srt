1
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,465
Is she? Is she not?

2
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,717
Is she or is she not?

3
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,848
She is.

4
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,024
What's so funny?

5
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,525
It's nothing.

6
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,362
What is?

7
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:17,368
I was thinking about that time
I had soju at a funeral.

8
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,246
I'll tell you some other time.

9
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,290
This is odd though.

10
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,877
Why is he coming over
when you're not married yet?

11
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,881
Could he be here already?

12
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,678
It's Dad and AM.

13
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,561
Dad.

14
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,606
-Hey.
-Hi, Ji-a. Where is she?

15
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,941
In the kitchen.

16
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,111
My father-in-law will be here soon.

17
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,991
-I'll go and change.
-Okay.

18
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,869
-I'm not leaving.
-Mother, you're not well.

19
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,913
Don't be ridiculous.

20
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,374
Guests will be here soon, so leave.

21
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,418
Why? Is he coming over for breakfast?

22
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,004
The last thing I want is a commotion.
Leave.

23
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,714
-Mother--
-There's no time for this.

24
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,258
-Leave without her.
-Go.

25
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,718
It's not like I can't be here.

26
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,517
Don't let her be alone

27
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,269
and call me once your guests leave.

28
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,272
Hurry with the steamed eggs.

29
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,217
Is that her future father-in-law?

30
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,763
No way. And is that her fiancé?

31
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,934
Pi-young still has it, doesn't she?

32
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,118
-Welcome.
-I know this is inappropriate.

33
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:25,038
-But I still came.
-It's fine. Please come in.

34
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,930
This is Ji-a.

35
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,514
Hello, sir.

36
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,184
Hi.

37
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,816
It wasn't because he didn't like it.

38
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,486
The bathroom's that way.

39
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,531
She's my former mother-in-law.

40
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,491
Welcome.

41
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,618
She stopped by this morning.

42
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,330
-Please forgive the intrusion.
-As if that's the case.

43
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,587
No way!

44
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,302
Hey, Danchu.

45
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,432
She's not Ji-a's biological grandmother.
Her grandfather had remarried.

46
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,187
Please have a seat.

47
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,901
You should eat with us.

48
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,404
I'm afraid I'm still full
from last night's dinner.

49
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,989
I ate a lot, you see.

50
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,035
Have a seat. The fish is ready to eat.

51
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,162
-Ji-a, did you wash your hands?
-Yes.

52
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,506
There's not much to eat.

53
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,133
My father likes kimchi stew.

54
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,702
It's not yellow croaker
but real barley dried yellow corvina.

55
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,245
Right. Thank you.

56
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,748
No, don't get up.

57
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,875
-The green tea--
-Let me get it.

58
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,589
Should I cut up some cabbage kimchi?

59
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,176
No, this is good. I didn't expect you
to have dongchimi.

60
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,427
Did you make it yourself?

61
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,889
I always receive some from
my housekeeper's family in Cheongju.

62
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,640
Of course, I pay for the ingredients.

63
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,392
It's perfect.

64
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,979
Did you make this kimchi stew in advance

65
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,315
knowing I'd come by?

66
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:58,900
No.

67
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,152
He favors kimchi stew
that's been cooked for hours.

68
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,322
There are ways to achieve that effect.

69
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,409
Please have some dried laver.
I roasted it myself with perilla oil.

70
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,328
Right.

71
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,794
-Savory, isn't it?
-It is.

72
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,676
I see this isn't meat.

73
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,803
Do you like meat?

74
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,847
Why don't I stir-fry
some marinated bulgogi?

75
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,724
It's all right. This is more than enough.

76
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,643
They're mackerel pike fish cakes.

77
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,938
Really? I didn't know
mackerel pike could taste like this.

78
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,482
It's one of Pi-young's signature dishes.

79
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,984
It exceeds expectations, doesn't it?

80
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,737
-I haven't had it as jeon before.
-Fish cakes.

81
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,031
Well, I guess they're the same.

82
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,201
Actually, they're not.
She had to mince the fish in this case.

83
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,163
Grandma, you seem chipper today.

84
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,708
That's because I didn't expect
to greet important guests during my visit.

85
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,252
Please enjoy.

86
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,671
And have some yellow corvina
with rice in green tea.

87
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,756
Sure.

88
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,930
I haven't had an appetite these days
but all these dishes are great.

89
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,057
-Do they suit your palate?
-They do.

90
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,354
I've had a few meals
with roasted sweet potatoes and ice cream.

91
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,314
-That sounds delicious.
-It was.

92
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,323
-How is it?
-It's cooked perfectly.

93
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,825
There's no funky odor either.

94
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:34,245
-That's right.
-Those that do aren't the real deal.

95
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,667
You sure are handsome though.
I bet you get that a lot.

96
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,712
-Back in my prime--
-You're still--

97
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,839
Mother, please let him eat.

98
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,258
Right.

99
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,261
There's plenty. There's nurungji too.

100
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,013
Right.

101
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,692
You sent Danchu over for my sake,

102
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:09,238
but I'm sure you missed it.
It's why I came over.

103
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,365
Danchu must have been fussy.

104
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,367
Hardly. It slept well by my side.

105
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,578
Goodness. Did you let it sleep with you?

106
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,080
Yes. I'm right, aren't I?

107
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,791
I made do with the photos I took.

108
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,045
I'm grateful for your kindness
toward an old man you have never met.

109
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,427
But that's somewhat of an excuse.

110
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,473
I just didn't feel like sitting across
from only Dong-ma today.

111
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,183
Should I get plastic surgery?

112
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,976
You're always welcome.

113
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,896
You can start having breakfast here
if you'd like.

114
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,856
I'd be inconveniencing you.

115
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,609
Not at all.
We always eat breakfast anyway.

116
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,569
Only additional cutlery is required.

117
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,613
-Of course.
-She means what she says.

118
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,115
-Don't you already take her side.
-Got it.

119
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,369
You can call me Grandpa.

120
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,247
I'd prefer that
over U-ram's Grandpa Chairman.

121
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,415
Sure thing.

122
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,169
He sure is handsome for an old man.

123
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,672
He's charismatic too.

124
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,848
Dr. Shin. You're gone, right?

125
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,855
You're not?

126
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,362
We'll get going then.

127
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:34,282
-Thank you for looking after him.
-It's nothing at all.

128
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,784
-Will you be late?
-I don't have plans, but who knows.

129
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,079
His boss lives alone now, you see.

130
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:43,040
Right. He sent his children abroad.

131
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,792
Yes, and his wife went with them.

132
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,255
He requests they have dinner together
whenever Sa-hyeon's free.

133
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,465
Men hate walking into an empty home.

134
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,469
Father, should I pick up
some grilled eel on my way home?

135
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,679
No, I'm good.

136
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,974
-Do so if you want.
-Sure thing.

137
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,727
-Drive safely.
-Sure.

138
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,650
I called upon the spirits, you see.

139
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,862
When? What for?

140
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,616
This morning, with cotton swabs.

141
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,118
Cotton swabs?

142
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,371
The spirits talk to them.

143
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,916
According to them, Hye-ryung is possessed.

144
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,297
I hear you're starting middle school.
Buy what you need.

145
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,469
Thank you.

146
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,012
I enjoyed breakfast.

147
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,264
Gosh. If only I had prepared more.

148
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:44,143
It's the quality that matters,
not the quantity.

149
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,186
Are you leaving?

150
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,980
Yes, thank you for the hearty breakfast.

151
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,070
Call in advance next time
for a more proper meal.

152
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,871
We interrupted your sleep
when you need it before school starts.

153
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,546
You can stay here.

154
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,384
Have a good day then.

155
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,219
-Sure.
-Until next time.

156
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,595
Sure thing.

157
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,227
-Don't see us off.
-You didn't even have coffee.

158
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,104
I'll have some at the office.

159
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,647
I'll text you.

160
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,529
If only she were about ten years younger.

161
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,449
-I told you to call, not come over.
-I heard you bad-mouthed me.

162
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,451
Why would we?

163
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,331
Mother heard you talking in the room.

164
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,166
Mother's not herself right now.

165
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,168
Don't avoid my question.

166
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,587
She was gone when we woke up
and her phone was off.

167
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,798
She had a bad dream about Ji-a.

168
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,299
Yesterday…

169
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,177
We'll talk over the phone.

170
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,514
It doesn't feel right
leaving her alone with Ji-a.

171
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,015
You should have asked why.

172
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,977
I did, but she wouldn't tell me.

173
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,646
She just begged me not to hit her.

174
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,233
Didn't she seem weird to you today?

175
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,026
I guess she was a little off.

176
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,028
She was more talkative than usual.

177
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,449
I brushed it off as her being excited
about having guests over.

178
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,368
-You know she's flirty.
-What do you mean she's flirty?

179
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,455
Are you on speakerphone?

180
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,876
We'll talk later, Pi-young.

181
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,419
Sure.

182
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,733
Hello?

183
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,569
-What is Ji-a up to?
-She's washing her hair.

184
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,778
What about you?

185
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,697
Me? I'm on the phone.

186
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,034
Where did you go without telling me?

187
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,328
-I'll be home any minute.
-Sure.

188
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,038
-Did you perhaps…
-Yes?

189
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,248
Did you perhaps leave to avoid me?

190
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,542
Of course not. I'll be right home.

191
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,843
"Our Father in heaven,

192
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,554
hallowed be thy name,

193
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,057
thy kingdom come,

194
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:32,770
thy will be done on earth
as it is in the universe."

195
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,152
Is she dolling up? At her age?

196
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,321
Trying to use her looks
just like her mother.

197
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,782
Before we married,

198
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,576
I called upon the spirits
after our blind date.

199
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,037
They told me you'd become my wife.

200
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:54,375
Although they talked to me
through matches back then.

201
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,918
Why did you do that?

202
00:13:56,001 --> 00:14:00,172
You were so pretty
that I wanted you as my wife.

203
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,719
If this is true,
it won't be good for Jeong-bin.

204
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,013
I heard that spirits suck your energy dry.

205
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,265
How about this?

206
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:13,269
We'll call her by Song Yuan one day.

207
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,479
If she responds--

208
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,647
What if she doesn't?

209
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,025
She will think
we're still hung up on Song Yuan.

210
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,529
How can we ever forget her? Never.

211
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,447
If we're wrong about this,

212
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,534
Hye-ryung will hold a grudge against us.

213
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,456
-Who are you calling?
-A friend's younger brother.

214
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,627
He became a monk
instead of studying for the state exam.

215
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,798
He may know another monk
who's an expert in this field.

216
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,467
CALLS

217
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,640
How about a checkup?
It's time you received one.

218
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,933
But I'm perfectly healthy.

219
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,978
Knowing that on paper will be reassuring.

220
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,187
No. It scares me.

221
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,523
I won't order an endoscopy,
so don't worry.

222
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,276
-Then what?
-Blood test, urine test,

223
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,694
and an ultrasound maybe.

224
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,738
You'll be pampered in the VIP ward.

225
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,701
Who put you up to this?

226
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,413
-I've just tagged along.
-Don't worry about me and leave.

227
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,002
How can I not when I'm worried?

228
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,379
Who would worry about you if not me?

229
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,298
You're the lady of the house.

230
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,385
-The lady?
-Of course you are.

231
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,304
He's right, you know.

232
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,308
All right. So all in one day?

233
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,560
Some tests require fasting,
so it will take two days.

234
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,354
I need to care for Ji-a today.

235
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,980
I'll be home today,

236
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,983
so get your checkup done
when Yu-sin requests it.

237
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,985
-Should I?
-Yes.

238
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,196
Your good health brings us joy, Mother.

239
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,073
You minx.

240
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,952
-Where's my jacket?
-In that room.

241
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:59,458
I want to know you

242
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:03,587
All to myself

243
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,005
Ji-a.

244
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,428
Grandma's leaving.

245
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:17,351
I want to have you

246
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,647
Don't go to any of your classes
and stay home with your mom.

247
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,023
I had a nasty dream.

248
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,900
Sure.

249
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,949
But I should be around to protect Ji-a.

250
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,540
He's such a catch.

251
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,210
To have found a bachelor
like that to marry.

252
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,045
What a sight for sore eyes.

253
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:51,176
You must have saved the world
in your past life.

254
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,603
Who is it from?

255
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,022
Ms. Nam Ga-bin.

256
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,662
Hello.

257
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:23,000
I heard from acquaintances
about the good news in your life.

258
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,586
Please know that I'm truly happy for you.

259
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,171
This is a token of that joy.

260
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:45,230
Why is there no news
about Nam Ga-bin's marriage?

261
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,754
My gosh!

262
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,840
-That hurts.
-I'm sorry, ma'am.

263
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,343
Are you sure you went to nursing school?

264
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,148
We'll have a detailed diagnosis tomorrow,

265
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,525
but she has gastritis

266
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,986
and shows signs of
what we've been worried about.

267
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,197
My goodness.

268
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,241
But she has always had a strong mind.

269
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,078
Other than Father's passing,
she's had no troubles.

270
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,371
She lived luxuriously

271
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,751
and had a good relationship
with the stepson she raised.

272
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,462
She must have suffered
some kind of emotional trauma.

273
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,507
It could be the aftermath
of what we've been suspecting all along.

274
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,134
At the movies, I mean.

275
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,430
-I got it.
-I hope you believe me now.

276
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,849
That Yu-sin bad-mouthed you.

277
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,518
Our argument yesterday was heated.

278
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:08,480
She sounded so sure of it.
She convinced me.

279
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,399
The situation fit, that's all.

280
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,694
Yu-sin's home.

281
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:15,863
Right.

282
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,872
How's Grandma?

283
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,752
With age, your mood tends to swing.

284
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,308
INCOMING CALL
JI-A'S GRANDMOTHER

285
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,646
Hello?

286
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,273
Mr. Hae-ryun, it's me.

287
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,734
-Yes, hello.
-That's how you greet me?

288
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,236
But we agreed to be friends.
What were you up to?

289
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,906
I was about to turn in early.
Are you outside?

290
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,491
No. Technically, I'm not home.

291
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,827
-Come visit me at the hospital.
-Have you been admitted?

292
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,954
-Yes.
-Are you not well?

293
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,623
Maybe I'm terminally ill.

294
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,958
Don't be ridiculous.

295
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,251
Will you come by?

296
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,338
-Sin Central Medical Center?
-I was only kidding.

297
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,381
I was just wondering how you were.

298
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,591
I'll stop by.

299
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,180
-Are you tired?
-I am.

300
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,556
Then you should turn in.

301
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,600
Are they running tests in the morning?

302
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,976
Yes, an MRI scan.

303
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,938
-What exactly do you have?
-It's only a regular checkup.

304
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:35,400
It's been two years since my last one,
so Dr. Shin insisted.

305
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,945
Will you be at the last rite
the day after tomorrow?

306
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,575
You should.

307
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:48,288
-Right.
-Can I place the furniture as I please?

308
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,124
Of course. That's up to
the lady of the house.

309
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:55,712
Did you know that your father
had breakfast at Ji-a's today?

310
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,005
Really?

311
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,759
Is there a chance
he'll surprise us by visiting tomorrow?

312
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,637
If he does, you should come by as well.

313
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,846
I'll call you.

314
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,892
Right. You must be upset
about not getting a honeymoon.

315
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,645
We're postponing it, that's all.

316
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,605
Going as a group is more fun anyway.

317
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,316
If the wedding went as planned,

318
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,403
we would have gone to Europe
with the kids.

319
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,280
A year will fly by.

320
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:25,701
I'll say that you're here
to assess the feng shui of the house.

321
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,869
Don't let her catch onto what we're doing.

322
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,414
Welcome.

323
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,335
-It was a long ride, wasn't it?
-Not really.

324
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,878
The temple's in Pyeongtaek.

325
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,214
I see. Please have a seat.

326
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,846
He's here to assess the feng shui.

327
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,265
This is our daughter-in-law.

328
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,525
Why would you ask me that?
Are you questioning my mental health?

329
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,193
-Of course not.
-As if.

330
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,820
-With menopause and--
-Is that why you had me admitted?

331
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:02,988
It's to check emotional balance.

332
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,781
As you know, this is routine.

333
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,909
You're sneakily trying
to check my mental status!

334
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,955
There's a saying that a primer
near a school sings the sparrow.

335
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,166
I was married to a doctor for decades!

336
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,546
And I used to be a nurse myself.
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

337
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,263
-You think we're all the same.
-I'll take you home later.

338
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,932
No. I hate the smell of hospitals.

339
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:41,109
What do you think?
Should we move the furniture around?

340
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,112
The couch is in a decent place.
It doesn't block the flow.

341
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,489
I see.

342
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,158
I've listened to your show a few times.

343
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,202
Thank you.

344
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,370
-And today's show?
-It's pre-recorded.

345
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,333
Will the energy here bring us good luck?

346
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,793
I'll have to check the study
and the master bedroom.

347
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,919
Sure.

348
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,798
She is possessed.

349
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,591
-Really?
-Yes.

350
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,134
So what's next?

351
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,511
Hold a rite of exorcism.

352
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,722
Will that drive the spirit out of her?

353
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,016
Some spirits tend to
viciously cling to their hosts,

354
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,351
but this one isn't malicious.

355
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,602
I see.

356
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,981
If there's no real issue,

357
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,068
would it be okay to turn a blind eye?

358
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:26,613
Nothing good will come of that.
It could bring them bad luck.

359
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,198
Bad luck?

360
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,908
That's how this normally ends.

361
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:34,162
Besides, the spirit must find
her own way now.

362
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,833
She can't stay among the living
when her path here has ended.

363
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,795
There's a chance
she could be reincarnated.

364
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,465
Defying the natural order
always leads to problems.

365
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,219
The spirit is the baby's mother.

366
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,847
-To peel her away--
-That may be the case now.

367
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,516
But you know that people change.

368
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,600
Spirits do as well.

369
00:23:56,893 --> 00:24:00,188
Gradually, the dead
will try to take control of the living.

370
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,900
When mistreated, it can retaliate.

371
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,156
Please let me know
when you make up your mind.

372
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,409
The head monk asked me
to be of service to you.

373
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,796
-That room, please.
-Right.

374
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,844
-Please drink this.
-Sure, once we're done.

375
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,808
To the room, please.

376
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,602
Which brand is this couch from?

377
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,397
I bet it's not domestic.

378
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,357
Domestic products are better these days.

379
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,777
Goodness. Is this from a domestic brand?

380
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,368
It's big and comfortable.

381
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,954
I could even sleep on this.

382
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:58,955
Right.

383
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,918
Ms. Sa is looking for you downstairs.

384
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,127
Sure.

385
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,725
The place actually gives off
a newlywed vibe.

386
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:25,023
Now they're barging into this house
to take everything.

387
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,824
Isn't it comfortable?

388
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,869
How can we not take action now?

389
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,413
Can spirits really take over the living?

390
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,332
According to him, they can even hurt you.

391
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,917
But she's no stranger to us.

392
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,794
But she's also a spirit.

393
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,296
Song Yuan would never do that.

394
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,298
Still, she's Jeong-bin's mother

395
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,510
and it's just that
she couldn't leave him behind.

396
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,011
He says spirits are the same.

397
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:58,181
They change just like people do.

398
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,642
They don't have a brain, you see.

399
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:04,145
Driving her away seems vicious on our end.

400
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,440
And what about Sa-hyeon?

401
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,109
He only just found stability.

402
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,279
Could she be aware
of what we're discussing?

403
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,996
-He should be up by now.
-Let him sleep.

404
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,000
Is that monk
really an expert in the field?

405
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,420
Yes. Someone introduced him to us.

406
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,047
Many hacks pretend
to be experts these days.

407
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,924
Not him though.

408
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,635
He's a proper monk.

409
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,144
Is it Ban?

410
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,104
No, Ms. Sa.

411
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,814
Here you go.

412
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,234
I'm sorry I can't make it.

413
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:55,071
It's too bad that I won't get
to see you in your wedding dress.

414
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,782
-Send me the photos.
-Got it.

415
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,453
I'm so nervous for you.

416
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,621
Gosh. I'm just an old bride.

417
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:05,790
Nonsense.

418
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:09,878
You haven't looked this good in years.
Aren't I right?

419
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,255
Absolutely. You've never looked better.

420
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,841
Money and time were well spent then.

421
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,885
Every bride-to-be gets a few facials.

422
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,011
It's hardly a lot.

423
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,138
I got you sleepwear.

424
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:23,183
Hyang-gi already got me one.
This wasn't necessary.

425
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,935
You can't live
on just one set of sleepwear.

426
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,312
She's right.

427
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,359
Look how silky it is!

428
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,029
You spent too much.

429
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,198
When it's just pajamas?

430
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,532
I went ahead without you.

431
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,284
Sure.

432
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,869
Drinking on an empty stomach
has made me drunk.

433
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,583
I hear your mother received a checkup.

434
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,460
Is she all right?

435
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,800
Is she sick?

436
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,260
You know the saying,

437
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,721
"Even a blacksmith's ax can get rusty."

438
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,932
As you know, I treat the mentally ill.

439
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,934
-Of course.
-Well…

440
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,273
Her mind isn't what it used to be.

441
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:14,859
Is that so?

442
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,362
I couldn't tell.

443
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,073
She's in the early stages,
so her episodes come and go.

444
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:22,575
So what now? Will she be admitted?

445
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,827
She'll take medication.

446
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,578
It's nothing severe yet.

447
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,622
I know it's wrong to say this,

448
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:31,000
but it seems like you dodged a bullet.

449
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,962
Someone has to look after her now.

450
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,089
Will it be A Mi?

451
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,175
What a rough family to marry into.

452
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,177
I'm sure they'll fix whatever's wrong.

453
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,389
Just keep this to yourself though.

454
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,390
Of course.

455
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,851
Have fun on your wedding day.

456
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,895
I'll be wishing you the best
with all my heart.

457
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,857
I'm glad I get to attend yours.

458
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,900
You'll attend the pyebaek
as my sister-in-law.

459
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,446
Mr. Seo…

460
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,616
Gosh, I should treat him
and call him like my brother-in-law now.

461
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,619
-Honorifics are so confusing.
-Tell me about it.

462
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,746
In some ways,

463
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,915
it's better to call people by their names
like they do in the West.

464
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,667
After the divorce

465
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,502
and signing the papers,

466
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,589
it's been hell for me.

467
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,174
Same here.

468
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,552
And now I'm about to lose my child.
How is this fair?

469
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,679
It isn't.

470
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:28,641
By the way, who is Ji-a's mother marrying?

471
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,852
-It's ludicrous.
-Why?

472
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,189
Ms. Lee will be Pi-young's sister-in-law.

473
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,608
Sister-in-law? In what way?

474
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,984
In the literal sense.

475
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:41,446
Ms. Lee is marrying the older brother
and Pi-young's marrying the younger.

476
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,326
They're marrying into the same family.

477
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,577
Really?

478
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,330
Yes, and both haven't been married before.

479
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,291
They're the sons
of SF Electronics' chairman.

480
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,710
They also own Min General Hospital.

481
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,671
They must be insane.
Are they in their right minds?

482
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,673
They need a psych evaluation.

483
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,008
I don't get it either.

484
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,719
There are a ton of young women out there.

485
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,971
What makes them so desperate?

486
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,264
If I'm being honest,

487
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,810
not all young women are charming
and have a bright future ahead of them.

488
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,561
They must have fallen for their charms.

489
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,271
Ms. Sa, I get.

490
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:20,026
But I really believed that Si-eun
was done for as a woman.

491
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,864
So when is Ms. Sa's wedding?

492
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,783
Si-eun's is tomorrow.

493
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:31,913
This is driving me nuts. I'm seeing red.

494
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,586
It's the same for me.

495
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,839
I may need some prescription pills.

496
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,341
I always wake up at one or two at night.

497
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,134
Sleep doesn't come easily afterward.

498
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:49,305
The man Pi-young's marrying
is not only young but also good-looking.

499
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,432
-How old is he?
-He turned 37.

500
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,477
-So he's younger?
-By five years.

501
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,062
She hit the jackpot, didn't she?

502
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,940
The same goes for Ms. Lee.

503
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,693
Both brothers are tall and handsome.

504
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,194
And us?

505
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,446
I feel like a loser.

506
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:10,201
We're hardly losers.
It's just that they're out of their minds.

507
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,041
Hey.

508
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,918
-Are you up?
-Just now.

509
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,921
How do you feel?
I hear it'll be sunny later.

510
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,340
-I'm happy.
-But you don't sound happy.

511
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,800
I am on the inside.

512
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,262
How is Father doing?

513
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,391
He's good. Isn't an overnight trip
too short though?

514
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:34,851
Stay for at least two nights.

515
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,438
I should do as she says.

516
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,564
So you choose to be obedient?

517
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,691
Let me ask you first. What about you?

518
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,571
-See you at the wedding.
-Sure.

519
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,994
-What's that?
-Champagne.

520
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,123
Would you like a glass
to calm down your nerves?

521
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,251
This is awesome.

522
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,421
Sit a little closer.

523
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,510
Isn't your mom beautiful?
She's normally just pretty.

524
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,304
-Gosh.
-Absolutely.

525
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,933
Mr. Seo… You look good too, Stepdad.

526
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,977
Son, it should be just "Dad."

527
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,604
Got it.

528
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,856
Why won't Pi-young be at the wedding?

529
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,901
She says you're not supposed to attend
someone else's wedding before your own.

530
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,027
Why?

531
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,528
I guess it's a thing.

532
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,613
But she's family.

533
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,783
She'll be Ban's sister-in-law in a week.

534
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,452
There's no need to push
when it's said to be a bad sign.

535
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:38,456
Please take your seats
and set your phones on vibrate

536
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:41,542
so that the wedding isn't interrupted.

537
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,420
The bride and groom will enter together.

538
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:47,840
Please give them a warm round of applause.

539
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,425
Please welcome the groom and the bride.

540
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,523
I'LL BRING THE SCENT TO YOUR MARRIAGE

541
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,858
IT'S ALL RIGHT, IT'S JUST MARRIAGE

542
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:26,749
Over here.

543
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,245
An old hag for a bride
must sure be a sight.

544
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,376
-That's right.
-My gosh.

545
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,086
What do you mean?

546
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,716
The monk said that being possessed
could bring her bad luck.

547
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,094
Didn't Hye-ryung's show
see a drop in ratings?

548
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,972
That's due to the producer
and writer being switched.

549
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:26,350
Not all shows
see that kind of drop though.

550
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,936
She hasn't been working as much either.

551
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,397
She says she's been turning down jobs,

552
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,067
but my guess is that
she hasn't been receiving many offers.

553
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,445
-Don't you agree?
-Maybe that's true.

554
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,617
MS. SA PI-YOUNG

555
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,208
BOO HYE-RYUNG

556
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,504
They both look incredible.

557
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,225
Ji-a.

558
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:11,854
At the ski resort,
I acknowledged that I was at fault.

559
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,233
Never did I imagine this outcome for us.

560
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:19,153
Your mom also loved someone else
so she'll soon marry--

561
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,613
Wait.

562
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:22,657
Are you saying we're the same?

563
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,993
I fell for another man

564
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,704
like you did with A Mi?

565
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,250
That's not true at all.
Should I dive into details for her?

566
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,962
-I was already divorced while you--
-All right.

567
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,631
I was wrong to say that.

568
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:43,094
It wasn't my intention,
but I see how you could think that way.

569
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,429
I'm sorry.

570
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,474
Go ahead and get married.

571
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,520
I'd be lying if I congratulated you

572
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,230
but I'm not against it.

573
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:02,780
Ji-a, you're my one and only daughter.

574
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,241
You know how much I love you.

575
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,662
Come live with me.
Please don't abandon me.

576
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,040
We didn't abandon you.

577
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,875
Technically, you abandoned us.

578
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,544
Did I ask for a divorce?

579
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,172
Never. I tried hard
to keep this family together.

580
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,385
It was like having a new friend
or something like that.

581
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,387
You're too young for me to explain--

582
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,805
When Mom first told me,

583
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,016
it didn't seem real.

584
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,894
But then I saw you at the bookstore,

585
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:36,814
you were…

586
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:41,944
I saw you with a woman who wasn't my mom.

587
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:45,156
Think about how I would have felt.

588
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,659
What I only saw on TV…

589
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,078
became a reality for us.

590
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,665
"How could you do this to us?"

591
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,127
"So Mom was telling the truth."

592
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,213
"It must have been hard for her."

593
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,468
That's what ran through my mind

594
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:07,970
and it broke my heart.

595
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:15,728
Unexpected things happen in life.

596
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:18,022
I'm not making excuses.
but that's how life is.

597
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,649
Mom and I
have finally found stability again.

598
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,318
You live your own life.

599
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,697
AM… That's how I refer to A Mi.

600
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,283
-You'll marry her someday.
-I won't if you're against it.

601
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,246
Why didn't you ask me
when you decided to date her?

602
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,666
You should have asked me
if you could date another woman.

603
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,174
Things can't go back to how they were.

604
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,134
That's not what I'm suggesting.

605
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,678
You know…

606
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,182
Blood ties are sacred.

607
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,517
It can never be severed.

608
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,812
Can't you forgive me this one time?

609
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:58,896
Only if Mom does.

610
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,899
But it's too late and it seems impossible.

611
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,317
Her wedding is next week.

612
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,236
He's only 23 years older than you.

613
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,030
-Can you call him Dad?
-Why can't I?

614
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,162
How so? Would you mean it?

615
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,372
I don't know.

616
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,583
I guess I'm not ready yet.

617
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,295
But won't it be the same as having

618
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,672
divorced parents overnight?

619
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,759
I've naturally grown to be fond of him.

620
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:33,013
And living together
will bring us closer as a family.

621
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,480
Do our 13 years together
mean nothing to you?

622
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,442
If you keep saying that,
I'll have no choice but to ask you back.

623
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,695
Didn't you care about
the years we spent as a family?

624
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,240
Let's drop it.

625
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,992
I'm going to live with Mom.

626
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:55,953
She's who I need.

627
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:03,878
Mom couldn't even talk for a while
because she was so shocked.

628
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,050
You're right.

629
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,265
And I know it's too late to regret,

630
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,352
but I still can't bring myself
to give up on you.

631
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,354
-I can't live without you.
-You'll manage.

632
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,981
A Mi's not family.

633
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,775
I only did as you insisted.

634
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,612
Never did I give up on our daughter.

635
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,073
-God knows that.
-I hate to say this in front of her,

636
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,575
but didn't you think that

637
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,828
when you were seeing her behind our backs?

638
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,455
We found stability again

639
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,041
and so will you.

640
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,377
I'll hardly get to see my own child,

641
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,463
but she'll be living with a stranger

642
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,382
calling him Dad.

643
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,512
Let's not blame each other anymore.

644
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,933
Mom and I are done resenting you as well.

645
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,229
Don't cry in front of your child.

646
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,781
My heart feels like it's going to explode.

647
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,578
I'll say one more thing.

648
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:25,167
Do you know
how embarrassed I was at the bookstore?

649
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,586
This whole time,

650
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,506
I bragged to U-ram about
having the best dad in the world,

651
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:35,553
but then I saw you with a younger woman
who wasn't Mom.

652
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,597
That image?

653
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,475
I won't ever be able to forget it

654
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,520
no matter how much I try.

655
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,527
I'm sorry.

656
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,297
You don't understand at all.

657
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,049
I do.

658
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,094
It's why I'm truly sorry.

659
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,566
You have taught me

660
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:34,570
that being greedy
could make you lose everything.

661
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,741
If you hadn't dated AM,

662
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,203
we would still be a happy family.

663
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:11,565
I won't text or call either of you today.

664
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,817
Hyang-gi's in charge.

665
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,402
Don't worry.

666
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,662
We're out of boxes.

667
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,246
Just pack what you need for now.

668
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,208
-But I need everything.
-We'll pick this up after dinner.

669
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,751
What are we having?

670
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:33,837
Is it Mom?

671
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,172
She said she wouldn't call.

672
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,841
-It's an unknown number.
-Pick it up.

673
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,301
You pick it up.

674
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,305
Hello?

675
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,516
-Why are you answering?
-Who is this?

676
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,227
-Your Uncle Dong-ma.
-Oh, hi.

677
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,978
-And your sister?
-She's packing.

678
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,897
The housekeepers will help tomorrow.

679
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,315
I sent a car just now.

680
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,526
Just bring your pajamas and come.

681
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,487
-Sure.
-We'll wait to have dinner with you.

682
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,655
Got it.

683
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:01,949
I heard what he said.

684
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,576
Are we moving in before Mom?

685
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:09,581
Make dinner for the children
and plenty of it.

686
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,041
-Yes, sir.
-Meat dishes, please.

687
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,000
Yes, sir.

688
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:17,381
The siblings must be as lonely as we are.

689
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,593
Hasn't your brother called?

690
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,054
It's not like he went abroad.

691
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,044
Aren't you hungry?

692
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,714
We didn't eat properly today.

693
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,265
How about room service?

694
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,224
Sounds good.

695
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,272
-Aren't you going to change?
-Give me.

696
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,690
-Give you what?
-My clothes.

697
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,275
Didn't you bring any?

698
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:21,695
-Didn't you say you were packing for me?
-Just your pajamas.

699
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:23,572
I thought you meant my clothes too.

700
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:24,990
Oh, dear.

701
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,369
I'll make do with the robe.

702
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:31,997
Change after you wash.

703
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,041
Sure.

704
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,375
Not right now though.

705
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,793
Why not?

706
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,420
Hold on.

707
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:57,272
Here.

708
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,195
Actually, I don't wear boxers.

709
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,988
I should have asked first.

710
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,824
-Just this once, then.
-I'm kidding.

711
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,661
Is this all I should be wearing?

712
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,246
Oh, right.

713
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,251
I wonder what the kids are up to.

714
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,044
They're fine by themselves.

715
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,295
Should we ask them here?

716
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:28,095
-Are you serious?
-Why leave a room unoccupied?

717
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,514
You're being ridiculous.

718
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:31,682
I'm serious though.

719
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,977
You have taught me to be frugal.

720
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,480
Can't I be the center of your world today?

721
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,693
What is it?

722
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:43,694
We forgot something.

723
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,028
Did you drop something?

724
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,155
Come on. We're going back out.

725
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,954
-The first night tradition.
-That?

726
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:55,998
Where's the key?

727
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,669
Come on.

728
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,796
You'll haul me in?

729
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,549
You're not some parcel. I'll carry you.

730
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,843
I'm heavy, you know.

731
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,804
-You think I can't carry you?
-But it's embarrassing.

732
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:16,143
It's only a formality.
Besides, we're already in the room.

733
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,606
I must not be thinking clearly.

734
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,739
Hyang-gi, come on. The elevator's here.

735
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,835
Park Hae-ryun, you pathetic loser.

736
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,296
You imbecile.

737
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,798
They have a place for you in Hell.

738
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,508
Damn it.

739
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,720
You colossal idiot.

740
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,181
Damn it!

741
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,185
Gosh.

742
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,153
Jeong-bin.

743
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:11,406
What should we do with your mother?

744
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:16,203
I know it's better to turn a blind eye
for your sake, but still…

745
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,253
There's more meat on the way.

746
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,172
-Right.
-I bet you were hungry.

747
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,548
Yes, a little.

748
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,676
A growing body needs plenty of nutrients.

749
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,262
Watching you two eat
has brought back my appetite.

750
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:37,557
Hyang-gi, does the food
not suit your palate?

751
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,518
They do, but I just love seaweed soup.

752
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,353
Boiled octopus is good for you.

753
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,771
Right.

754
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:45,315
Seeing your mother
must have made you happy today.

755
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:48,068
-It did.
-Stepdad looked incredible as well.

756
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,570
My sons take after me.

757
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,781
-I agree.
-Who do you take after?

758
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,449
My grandfather from my mom's side.

759
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,034
He must have been well-built.

760
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,703
He was actually average,

761
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:00,330
but I hear we looked the same
back when I was slimmer.

762
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,666
Mother, here's your supplement.

763
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:05,752
MULTIVITAMIN

764
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:12,384
I washed my hands.

765
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:13,468
Help yourself.

766
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,471
It's only a supplement.

767
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:20,934
Someone else's?

768
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,144
It's not someone else's.

769
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:25,272
Then why was the bottle already unsealed?

770
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:30,068
-I opened it in the room and--
-Who knows if it's poison?

771
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:40,454
XANAX

772
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,541
Who are you taking for a fool?

773
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,086
You'll never outsmart me.

774
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:53,216
Don't you try to fool me. I'll kill you!

775
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:56,845
Hasn't your mother called?

776
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,555
She hasn't.

777
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,891
She said she wouldn't be calling today.

778
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:04,144
So Hyang-gi wants to be an interpreter.

779
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,353
What about you, U-ram?

780
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:07,230
I thought about being an engineer,

781
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,357
but I now just want
to earn a lot of money.

782
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,525
And do what?

783
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,903
I'll buy a yacht before I buy a house.

784
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:15,030
Yachts, vacation homes, and mistresses

785
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,740
only give you headaches.

786
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:17,949
Why is that?

787
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,869
It costs a lot
to have them docked, you see.

788
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,704
You'll be spending money like crazy.

789
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,333
We have vacation homes,
but we barely visit them.

790
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,262
INCOMING CALL
A MI

791
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,101
Congratulations.

792
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:46,937
Can you congratulate me too?

793
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,815
You looked dashing today.

794
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,526
I was overwhelmed with joy.

795
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:56,696
Feeling good and being happy
are so different.

796
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,449
I learned that today.

797
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,963
Thank you for being my bride.

798
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,214
Same here.

799
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,806
I wonder what this delicious cheese is.

800
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:24,891
It smells like truffles.

801
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,107
-It's probably French.
-How do you know?

802
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:35,026
I think it's the kind
I enjoy from time to time.

803
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,321
Have you been drinking alone at night
with cheese as a snack?

804
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:42,033
Maybe it was because I missed you so much.

805
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:45,328
-Do you think I'm joking?
-Yes.

806
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:47,914
This is nice.

807
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,208
Aren't you happy?

808
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:53,420
Can't you tell by looking at me?

809
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:56,131
I'm also at peace.

810
00:52:56,756 --> 00:53:00,010
Shouldn't you fancy your husband
more than the overall mood?

811
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,177
It's the same thing.

812
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:05,432
Should I get wasted
or just a little tipsy?

813
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:07,601
Tipsy will suffice.

814
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:11,521
Haven't we both led average lives?

815
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:15,358
Morally, we never deviated from the norm.

816
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,862
Husband, are you already dreaming
of going wild?

817
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,572
With my wife, of course.

818
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:23,074
-Isn't it allowed?
-Well…

819
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,495
Our marriage alone seems like a big leap.

820
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:30,373
A big leap that seems right
in every single way.

821
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,750
Time will tell.

822
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:36,171
What do you need?

823
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,090
A cotton swab. My ears tickle.

824
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,676
There's an ear pick
in the master bathroom.

825
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,677
Bring it over.

826
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,603
I rarely use one
since I could scratch myself.

827
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:54,230
Besides, it's not satisfying.

828
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,733
I never took you for a scaredy-cat.

829
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,152
Let me see.

830
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,700
I see a lot of earwax. Come here.

831
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,661
-You'll do it for me?
-Yes.

832
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:08,787
My head's heavy.

833
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:15,001
My thighs are still quite muscular.

834
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,091
This feels nice.

835
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:22,175
Satisfying, isn't it?

836
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,302
Yes.

837
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,721
Don't you see a grooming specialist?

838
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,974
I don't. Why?

839
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,059
Don't they remove your earwax for you?

840
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,979
I'm not fond
of physical touch from others.

841
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:35,981
Should I stop?

842
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:40,402
You're not just anyone.
Touch me all you want.

843
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,825
What is it?

844
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,868
I'm dozing off.

845
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:50,578
Go to sleep then.

846
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,584
I can't.

847
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,420
Why not?

848
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:02,048
-I shouldn't.
-Some shut-eye will do you good.

849
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,591
It'll re-energize you.

850
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,260
Come back down.

851
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,391
Close your eyes.

852
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:23,111
Has farting ever put you in a predicament?

853
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,196
-That's disgusting.
-Not really.

854
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:29,075
And it's not disgusting.
It's like yawning in a way.

855
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:29,993
What about you?

856
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:32,662
My homeroom teacher in fourth grade

857
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:36,458
farted while passing my seat in class.

858
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,169
She was like, "Goodness."

859
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,838
It's hard to control what's involuntary.

860
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:44,049
What if your future husband farts?

861
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,133
I doubt I'd like it.

862
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,844
Your brother should refrain from farting.

863
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,679
It's different for family.

864
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,432
Text him and warn him.

865
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:55,602
But it's really hard to keep it in.

866
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,437
-Are you fighting the urge right now?
-Yes.

867
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:01,441
Then go ahead.

868
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,611
That'd be rude of me.

869
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,154
-Go to the bathroom.
-I'll hold it.

870
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:08,239
Nothing good will come out of that.

871
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:12,994
Lotus leaf tea or mulberry leaf tea, sir?

872
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,668
My gosh. I'm so sorry. Oh, no!

873
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,059
Open the window.

874
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,146
What did she have for dinner?

875
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:42,565
Hyang-gi.

876
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:46,319
Go and ask for mulberry leaf tea.

877
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,952
Did they go to bed?

878
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,120
Yes.

879
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:41,749
No news is good news, right?

880
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,168
Don't worry.

881
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,295
This isn't me worrying.

882
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:47,839
If you think about it,

883
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,425
she got her wedding…

884
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:57,056
and has been able
to hold Jeong-bin enough.

885
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,143
I guess she can leave now.

886
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:03,021
A better life could await her.

887
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,737
She can be reborn as Jeong-bin's sibling.

888
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,322
How?

889
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,241
When Hye-ryung has a deformed uterus?

890
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,076
It doesn't mean she's infertile.

891
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,329
Only that her chances are slim.

892
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,582
Prayers can be answered,
so you never know.

893
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,960
I doubt it.

894
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,798
Thinking too much has me hungry again.

895
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,051
It sure consumes your energy.

896
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,594
A proper meal or ramyeon?

897
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:35,803
Tteok.

898
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,264
That's what I'm suddenly craving.

899
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:42,477
Sirutteok, jeolpyeon,
injeolmi, or ssukgaetteok?

900
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,938
Do we have some of
the black sesame tteok left?

901
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,147
It's all gone.

902
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:49,025
When? Did you finish them?

903
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,581
Don't you have hands?

904
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,918
He's been exhausted lately, you see.

905
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:09,379
What a luxury.

906
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:11,631
It'll be my turn tomorrow.

907
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,802
Aren't you two peckish?
Your father wants some tteok.

908
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,512
-I'm good.
-Same here.

909
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,688
INCOMING CALL
DONG-MA

1 UNREAD MESSAGE
DONG-MA

911
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:34,881
Sorry. I dialed the wrong number.

01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,940
DONG-MA

913
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,111
INCOMING CALL
GA-BIN

914
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:08,164
Hello?

915
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:10,249
-I was curious.
-About what?

916
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,584
When is the wedding?

917
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:16,214
Don't worry.

918
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:18,925
I'm fine now.
I could even sing for you there.

919
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:21,094
How's your health?

920
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:24,889
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

921
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:26,182
I'm glad.

922
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,476
-Are you home?
-Yes.

923
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:32,355
Isn't it good manners
to answer a question?

924
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:33,898
The wedding's soon.

925
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,403
Don't stay up too late.

926
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:40,571
-Are you happy?
-Yes.

927
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,116
-Good for you.
-Right.

928
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,477
INCOMING CALL

929
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,025
Hello?

930
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,696
Is this Nam Ga-bin?

931
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:24,031
-Yes.
-This is Chairman Seo's assistant.

932
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:26,909
I once escorted you in my car. Hello.

933
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,245
Yes, hello.

934
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,998
The chairman has asked you
to lunch tomorrow.

935
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,425
Hey.

936
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:48,639
Have a seat.

937
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:56,314
I take it that
you have a new show in the fall.

938
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:58,983
That's right.

939
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,320
Welcome, Mr. Seo.

940
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:05,031
-It's been a while.
-Yes, sir.

941
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:08,075
-Bring what's best.
-Yes, sir.

942
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,995
I'll have what he's having.

943
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:14,540
How about a light drink first?
Champagne, maybe?

944
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:23,341
Did you cook red bean juk?

945
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:24,675
-Yes.
-Why?

946
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,385
No reason. I just wanted some.

947
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,895
Has it gone cold? I can heat it up.

948
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:44,987
What a waste.

949
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:49,450
As if I wouldn't know.

950
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:50,535
Know what?

951
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:52,328
You want me to die from eating this.

952
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:54,205
You'd die from eating red bean juk?

953
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:57,500
Does that mean I'm going to die too?

954
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,934
That's how I killed my husband, you see.

955
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:23,693
Feeding him red bean juk, mung bean juk,
bean juk, pine nut juk,

956
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,947
abalone juk, vegetable juk,
chicken juk, beef juk, and tarakjuk.

957
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:33,202
He stood no chance.

958
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:37,748
For every meal of every day,
I fed him carbs until he was full.

959
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:40,877
And it wasn't just juk.

960
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:44,547
Manila clam kalguksu,
naengmyeon, janchiguksu,

961
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:46,465
kimchi guksu, bean guksu,

962
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:48,968
buckwheat guksu, geonjinguksu, bibimguksu,

963
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:51,053
sonkalguksu, and kaljebi day by day.

964
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:55,433
Elevation in blood sugar level
and blood pressure.

965
01:04:56,934 --> 01:05:00,062
With these two hands,
I busily cooked for him.

966
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:03,983
I mean made the noodles myself.

967
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,987
How could they not have been tasty?

968
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:10,364
He couldn't help himself.

969
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,622
Kim Dong-mi, you worked so hard.

970
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,587
You know how they say
that hard work pays off.

971
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,716
Thanks to me,
he enjoyed his meals every day

972
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:31,218
and left without suffering.

973
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:34,472
All he did was clutch his chest once

974
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:38,017
as he said goodbye.

975
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,187
Sayonara. Farewell.

976
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:46,567
Is that how Yu-sin's father passed away?

977
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:51,948
Grill me some meat.

978
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,408
Meat!

979
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:56,827
Tenderloin, not sirloin.

980
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:58,663
I'll know, so don't you dare fool me.

981
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:01,374
Tenderloin is slightly split on one end.

982
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:10,883
A woman as wise and intelligent as I am?

983
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:16,138
I'm one of a kind in this world.

984
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:19,433
A Mi.

985
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:20,893
Yes, Mother?

986
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:34,448
There's a lot of traffic today.

987
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:36,784
Good thing we're early.

988
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,955
-No cheese, right?
-I had it taken out.

989
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:44,750
The ratings dropped again.

990
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,336
The show's better off canceled.

991
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,380
The show really needs Ms. Sa back.

992
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:51,507
-And Ms. Lee.
-Exactly.

993
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:55,386
Isn't Ms. Sa getting married
this Saturday?

994
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:56,470
She is.

995
01:07:58,115 --> 01:08:00,493
-If I had to pick one of you…
-Are you telling me to leave?

996
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:01,660
You're just like Pi-young.

997
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:04,455
They have a long journey ahead.

998
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:06,082
-Let me ask you again.
-What about you?

999
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,959
Did your mom get married?

1000
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:11,879
We have a driver who drops me off
at school since it's far away.

1001
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:13,339
-It's been a while.
-Hi.

1002
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:14,673
You seem to have lost weight.

1003
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:18,552
-Ex-husbands are a pain.
-Is he throwing a fit?

1004
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:21,013
-What is it? But that was all settled.
-Even if it means the death of me…

1005
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,182
You weren't happy
that I was a musical actress.

1006
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:25,309
What kind of a daughter-in-law is she?

1007
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:34,777
-How do I look?
-Dong-ma was always annoying.

1008
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,738
And he's even more so today.
What a handsome groom he is.

1009
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:48,040
