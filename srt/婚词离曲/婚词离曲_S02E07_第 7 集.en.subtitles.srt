1
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,351
-Those people you ride horses with.
-Yes?

2
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,354
-What do you guys talk about?
-Just life.

3
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,857
Men these days are chattier than women.

4
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,567
It's the same at work.

5
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,195
Don't wives badmouth their husbands?

6
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:14,407
Some do, while others brag about them.

7
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,326
-And you?
-Of courseâ€¦

8
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,536
I stay quiet.

9
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,707
-I must lack a lot as a husband.
-That's not true.

10
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,043
It's an eyesore to hear someone brag.

11
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,087
They don't really like it.

12
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,798
I brag about you all the time.

13
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,301
About what?

14
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:36,387
Everything. For example,
you give me warm food every morning.

15
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,515
-That's a given.
-It's not.

16
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,268
Most of them skip breakfast. They envy me.

17
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,479
Both my colleagues and friends.

18
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,482
How do they not know the importance
of their husbands' health?

19
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:51,027
They were speechless when I told them
you keep my underwear in the fridge.

20
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,822
You deserve to be treated that way.

21
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:54,739
Same goes for you.

22
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,743
I want to treat you like a queen,
but I'm so busy with work.

23
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,372
You're doing more than enough.
I know you're giving it your all.

24
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,958
We really think the world of each other,
don't we?

25
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,002
Had we looked
into our marital compatibility beforehand,

26
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,630
they may have told us
that we were meant to be.

27
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,382
-Right.
-Should we look into it?

28
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,634
I don't know
any decent fortune-tellers, though.

29
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,053
Has he been lying to me all this time?

30
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,305
I'm counting on you. You're so pretty.

31
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,150
Hold on.

32
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,740
Hello? I'm horseback riding.

33
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,578
Right now? Okay.

34
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,875
I have a meeting.
Director Yoo Min-jae wants to see me.

35
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,169
Go on, then. Call me when you're done.

36
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,128
Okay.

37
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,633
Sir, could you take my horse?
I have to go.

38
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,926
-Sure.
-Thank you.

39
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:42,115
Your dad is such
a warmhearted person, Bada.

40
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,995
I miss him dearly,

41
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,372
but I should stay strong.

42
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,208
Right?

43
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,597
WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH HER?

44
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,933
Grandma, Mom's phone is turned off.

45
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,561
Why did you call her?

46
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,271
I wanted to ask when she'd be home.

47
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,188
MY PUPPY

48
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,357
She might come home with your dad.

49
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,359
Then should I call him?

50
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,778
He's still horseback riding.

51
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,947
You might startle the horse.

52
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,117
I guess it's true
that those who are big-eyed are skittish.

53
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,161
Do you get easily frightened too?

54
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,996
Yes.

55
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:36,252
I SEE THAT YOU'RE
LYING THROUGH YOUR TEETH, BITCH

56
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,008
What brings you here?

57
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,930
I wanted to surprise you.

58
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,016
Why? Are you not happy to see me?

59
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,851
Of course, I am.

60
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,771
Have something to drink at the lounge.
I'll get changed.

61
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,248
There's a nice chicken restaurant nearby.

62
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,042
I'm not craving chicken today.

63
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,919
But if you want, then sure.

64
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,421
Then again, it takes a while
to prepare the chicken.

65
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,381
Have some tea since you worked out.

66
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,550
No. I'll just have some water.

67
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:45,196
Is Dr. Cho not here today?

68
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,198
No.

69
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:54,247
Actually, I came here
because I heard something ridiculous

70
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,998
-from Si-eun.
-What?

71
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,167
Professor Park came here once

72
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,920
-and saw you.
-And?

73
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,466
He saw you and a young woman
riding horses together.

74
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,725
I don't know any young women here.

75
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,901
When I first started horseback riding
in Yongin,

76
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,779
there was this teenage girl.

77
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,990
We ran into each other again
not too long ago.

78
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,533
It was her.

79
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,619
-How old is she?
-She's a young lady now.

80
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,330
I couldn't recognize her, but she did.

81
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,673
He should've said hi
or kept his mouth shut.

82
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,759
How could he suspect me
of something like that?

83
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,805
Does he think all men are like him?

84
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,849
He judged you by his own standard.

85
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,018
I can no longer ride horses in peace now.

86
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,479
You even came here to check.

87
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,314
I was perplexed.

88
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,066
I wanted to see for myself
if it was true or not.

89
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,193
I understand.

90
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,906
By the way, do you not trust me?

91
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:14,160
Of course, I do. But at that time,
I didn't know what to do.

92
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,496
I was befuddled.

93
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,248
I do say hi to the ladies

94
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,584
since we know each other.

95
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,254
I'm sorry. I must've been out of my mind.

96
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,884
Call a chauffeur for your car
and take mine.

97
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:33,554
What for? I can drive mine.

98
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,313
Did you catch a cold?

99
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,857
It must be because of the sweating.

100
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,401
Let me warm myself up at a sauna.

101
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,403
I'll have something warm to eat too.

102
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,738
Okay.

103
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,742
Hello.

104
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:57,995
Hello.

105
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,166
-Are you his wife?
-Yes.

106
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,129
-Are you Dr. Cho?
-Yes.

107
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,299
-I've heard a lot about you.
-Me too.

108
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,427
He brags about you all the time.

109
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,312
-See you next time.
-Goodbye.

110
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,149
Hello, Mr. Lee.

111
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,819
Yes.

112
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,529
I see.

113
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,157
Okay.

114
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,119
All right.

115
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,413
Sure.

116
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,332
Don't worry about it.

117
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,224
I must've been out of my mind.

118
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,226
How could I suspect him of all people?

119
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,937
Does he envy our family
after ruining his own?

120
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:09,483
No wonder he ruthlessly abandoned
his wife.

121
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,361
You can never know one's true colors
for sure.

122
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,157
Thank you for the meal.

123
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,618
It was fun.

124
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,417
Goodbye.

125
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,294
Goodbye.

126
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,117
That's it?

127
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,621
I can't offer to treat him
to another meal.

128
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,503
Is he playing hard to get?

129
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,341
Why did he offer a wine
and pay for my drinks

130
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,760
if he was uninterested?

131
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,977
-Did you see the muffler in the study?
-Why?

132
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,355
-Where is it?
-I threw it away.

133
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,275
Actually, I put it in the recycling bin.

134
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,945
-When?
-I can't remember that.

135
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,154
You didn't even ask.

136
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,282
You said it was cheap.
You'd keep wearing it.

137
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,618
-So what?
-It makes you look shabby.

138
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,162
You should live up to your profession.

139
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,165
Why do you obsess over that cheap muffler?

140
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,917
I bought it so I could wear it.

141
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,420
-Are you sure it's not from her?
-It's not.

142
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,008
-I doubt you'd admit to that.
-That's enough.

143
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,764
It's mine to begin with.

144
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,934
Would you feel happy if I threw away
your cosmetics

145
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,563
because I didn't like them?
You should've asked me for permission.

146
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,107
You can never fool me.

147
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,068
Did she really not give that to you?

148
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,280
Can you swear on your parents?

149
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,699
I'm doing my best to feign ignorance.

150
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,159
Don't provoke me.

151
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,184
I'll pick up that car by 10 p.m.

152
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,352
Okay. Thank you, sir.

153
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,775
What was the director like?

154
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,402
He seemed nice.

155
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,281
But I'll only know for sure
once we begin filming.

156
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,243
They say we're given
three opportunities in life.

157
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,662
I think this is your moment.

158
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,665
You're getting offers from everywhere.

159
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:15,503
Aren't cakes supposed to be
for happy occasions?

160
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,879
You like cakes.

161
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,633
Keep it in the freezer and have some
when you have no appetite.

162
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,885
Can you spend the night?

163
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:28,432
Just for tonight.
We've never spent the night together.

164
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,226
Let's wake up in the same bed

165
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,978
and have some coffee.

166
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,689
This is the end for us.

167
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,776
You never know what the future holds.

168
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:42,571
Let's not think that this is the end.

169
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,991
Don't give me false hope.

170
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,039
You can leave then.

171
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,084
What's the point of staying
for another hour?

172
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,303
Have you ever considered

173
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,266
giving up everything just for me?

174
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,017
Numerous times.

175
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,352
But you could never do it?

176
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,022
I didn't knowâ€¦

177
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,359
you'd get rid of me this easily.

178
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,027
Don't put it that way.

179
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,322
Don't make it sound like
I'm abandoning you.

180
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,658
-You know that's not it.
-I don't know.

181
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,703
I really don't.

182
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,329
To be honest,

183
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,832
I'm not sure if I can end it with you.

184
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,126
That's why I said that we never know.

185
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:41,505
I could leave you today
and rush over here again tomorrow.

186
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,008
I just want us to at least try.

187
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,259
This isn't for me.

188
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,512
You're finally making it.
They say with the good comes the bad.

189
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,640
If people get wind of us,

190
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,185
you won't even get to achieve your dream.

191
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,354
I'm terrified of that.

192
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,900
I don't want that to happen.

193
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,318
What if I'm okay with it?

194
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,405
Sure, I love this job.

195
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,865
I want to get better at it.

196
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,618
Howeverâ€¦

197
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,914
success can't be my goal in life.

198
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,791
I don't know about you,
but that's how I feel.

199
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,001
I choose love over work.

200
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,338
And you're my only love.

201
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,716
How will I endure this?

202
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,010
I can't.

203
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,972
I can barely breathe right now.

204
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,899
When my father passed away,

205
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,986
I realized that everything was
indeed in vain.

206
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,240
"No matter how strong love is,

207
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,619
it's helpless in the face of death.

208
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,582
Nothing matters when you die."

209
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,963
I'll keep that in mind
to help me stay strong.

210
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,556
When spring comes,
the trees grow new leaves.

211
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,936
Their color, shape, and smell
may be the same.

212
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,731
But they're not the same leaves
from last year.

213
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,651
Let's leave it up to time.

214
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,862
You'll find someone better in no time.

215
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,161
Or I could get divorced later
and come back to you.

216
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,541
Nothing is guaranteed in life.

217
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,712
For now, focus on work.

218
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,508
Let's just think that we're taking
a short break.

219
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,718
Do you love me?

220
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,680
If I didn't, would I have gone
out of my way to see you?

221
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,725
You know how busy I am.

222
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,816
Going down.

223
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,840
FIRST FLOOR, WHITE CAR

224
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,683
Stay here. I'll bring the plates.

225
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,816
I thought of getting flowers
but chose a pot instead.

226
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,235
Flowers wither quickly.

227
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,031
If we still love each other
after two yearsâ€¦

228
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,701
If you still want me then,
I'll come to you.

229
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,122
Until then, I hope you'll be happy
and healthy.

230
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,083
On my way here,

231
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,086
I wished the car was me.

232
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,298
Just like how you found comfort
in my arms,

233
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:20,302
I hope this car will give you comfort
and happiness.

234
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,305
I'll always be praying for you.

235
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,848
We may be physically apart,

236
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:30,187
but don't forget that we'll always
be together in our hearts.

237
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,774
I love you. I truly do.

238
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,010
Go back inside.

239
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,637
Where's the chauffeur?

240
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,765
-There he is.
-Bye.

241
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,517
-Bye.
-Thanks.

242
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,893
Sure.

243
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,187
Over there.

244
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,350
Doors are opening.

245
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,808
-I was about to call you.
-Did you just get home?

246
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,393
Did you get this massage chair?

247
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,604
I sent it when the housekeeper
was still there.

248
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,647
-What for?
-I have one at home.

249
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,483
It's nice.

250
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,818
-Thanks.
-You know, I shouldn't.

251
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,362
-What do you mean?
-I think our roles have changed.

252
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,239
Shouldn't love trickle down?

253
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,408
But I'm always taking care of you.

254
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,244
There's nothing wrong with that.

255
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,580
As long as it's not obsessive.

256
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,795
-Is Ji-a asleep?
-Yes.

257
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,298
Baked sweet potatoes?

258
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,633
Yes.

259
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,635
You're still awake?

260
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:10,097
Yes. I didn't do much today,
so I'm not tired at all.

261
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,016
Oh, please. You worked so hard today.

262
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,729
I always feel energetic in this house.
It must be the location.

263
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:18,814
Have some.

264
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,905
It's rare to spot
baked sweet potato vendors nowadays.

265
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:32,035
I agree. The streets would be teeming
with them back in the day.

266
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,537
But not anymore.

267
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,664
They're sold in supermarkets these days.

268
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,751
Why did you buy so many?
One bag would have been enough.

269
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,795
-He's generous.
-One was for your mother.

270
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,466
I went over there but came back
in case she was sleeping.

271
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,552
Goodness.
You didn't even ring the doorbell?

272
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,348
No wonder you were late today.

273
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,521
It's tasty.

274
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,944
Those baked in firewood
indeed taste different.

275
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,613
It's tastier because he bought it.

276
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,740
Would you like some dongchimi?

277
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,997
That doesn't go well with sweet potatoes.
You should eat this by itself.

278
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,876
She's right. I feel bad for enjoying this
without our daughter.

279
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,545
-We can give some to her tomorrow.
-Okay.

280
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,340
Isn't this happiness?

281
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,259
Of course. You make us happy.

282
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:33,013
Gosh, I could even dance right now.

283
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,599
-We should be the ones dancing.
-I agree.

284
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:40,187
We should thank you
for taking great care of us.

285
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,898
Don't just talk the talk.
Show us your moves.

286
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,108
-Go on.
-What if Ji-a wakes up?

287
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:48,570
Show that you mean it.
Don't use her as your excuse.

288
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,197
Ji-a is a deep sleeper.

289
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,532
-That's true.
-What do you mean?

290
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,577
Or how about you dance?

291
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,006
Which one suits you better?

292
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,008
How about this color? Or this?

293
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,012
Let me see the skirt too.

294
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,473
That's pretty.

295
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,273
What do you want to be?

296
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,360
An interpreter.

297
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:37,030
I promise to give you a world tour
once I succeed.

298
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,240
Gosh, you've already done so much for me.

299
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,533
Does Dad know?

300
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,995
You should send him a text just in case.

301
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,164
He knows.

302
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,768
I heard you got in. Congratulations.

303
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:16,194
This isn't much,
but I opened an account in your name.

304
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,616
No, thank you.
You've supported me financially all along.

305
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,452
You'd want to wear pretty clothes
once you go to college.

306
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,497
You should have coffee
with your friends too.

307
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,791
They can't always treat you.

308
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,584
I'm going to work part-time.

309
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,586
Use it for your wedding.

310
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,632
You haven't saved up much anyway.

311
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,638
I'm sorryâ€¦

312
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,184
about last time. It's been bothering me.

313
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,815
It's fine.

314
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:57,527
I'm sorry. I couldn't accept the money.

315
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:01,740
Don't be. I make enough money.

316
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,617
I can continue working
for at least another decade.

317
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,953
That's when I'll graduate from college.

318
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,622
I'll pay for your college tuition.

319
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,750
Be good,
and I'll even pay for grad school.

320
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,334
May I touch your belly?

321
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,675
-Is the baby kicking yet?
-Not yet.

322
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,262
I was upset at my husband

323
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,891
so I just took off and went on a cruise.

324
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,060
But I couldn't stop thinking about you.

325
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,438
I was concerned about the baby.

326
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,440
Finally, I feel relieved.

327
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:41,529
He visited me once,
and he looked very worried.

328
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,865
It was obvious that he was having
a tough time.

329
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:47,285
My entire marriage life was a struggle.
He hurt me numerous times.

330
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,745
He won't hurt you anymore.

331
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,331
They say people change
when death knocks on their doors.

332
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:55,126
I don't expect anything from him.

333
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,921
He can live however he wants
since I don't care anymore.

334
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,966
I've found peace.

335
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,636
Are you going back to your friend's place?

336
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,595
Yes.

337
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,099
-When is your next check-up?
-In two days.

338
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,935
Should I stay here and go with you?

339
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,686
Could you do that?

340
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,816
Of course. I'm finally free at last.

341
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,807
-Hi, Mom.
-I arrived in Busan yesterday.

342
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,392
Are you home now?

343
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:55,520
No. I'm in Nonhyeon-dong.

344
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,232
-Are you visiting Song Yuan?
-Yes.

345
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,401
How is she doing?

346
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:05,154
She's doing well. I'm taking her
to the OB-GYN the day after tomorrow.

347
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,741
She has a round belly now.

348
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,579
-Hello?
-I'm here.

349
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,247
-Are you crying?
-No.

350
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,999
How's Hye-ryung doing?

351
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,127
-Is she pregnant?
-Not yet.

352
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,880
Are you sure she actually wants a baby?

353
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:22,964
Yes, she does.

354
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,926
It won't be easy to get pregnant
when she's so busy with work.

355
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,345
Tell her to cut down on her work.

356
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,639
She's not the type who'd listen.

357
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,519
What is she doing right now?
Can I speak with her?

358
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:41,566
People are naturally greedy
and always expect more.

359
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,943
You'll want to come here
once you hear her voice.

360
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,779
The marketplace is open,
so she went to buy some soft tofu.

361
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,656
Does she look exhausted?

362
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,909
Yes, but she looks happy.

363
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,119
By the looks of it, she does love you.

364
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:57,206
When a woman is carrying the baby
of someone she doesn't love,

365
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,334
you can tell by her face.

366
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:04,797
I'll take good care of her,
so don't worry. Focus on your work.

367
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,843
Don't tell Hye-ryung that I'm here.

368
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,680
She wants me to secretly take
photos of her.

369
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,558
-She wants to see her face.
-Never.

370
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:19,103
I got it. I know that's not right.

371
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,689
If anything,
she should introduce herself first.

372
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,692
She's here. I'm hanging up.

373
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,985
Goodbye.

374
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,248
Dongmi, did you hear that?

375
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,920
My wife must have abandoned me.

376
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:47,048
If not, how could she do this to me?

377
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:51,928
Like Song Yuan said,
I should've sincerely apologized to her

378
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,763
from the get-go.

379
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,473
But I made a rash apology.

380
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,395
I ruined it.

381
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,940
To be honest,

382
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,234
I wasn't even sincere.

383
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,069
BADA'S MOM

384
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,950
-Hello?
-It's me. Have you been well?

385
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:17,203
How could I be
when everything's falling apart?

386
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:21,749
Have you not heard from her yet?

387
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,127
She's at my place.

388
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:29,007
Make sure she stays there.

389
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:33,678
Okay. She'll stay for another two days,
and we'll go to the hospital together.

390
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,513
Is she sick? Where?

391
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:38,933
No, she'll come with me for my check-up
at the OB-GYN.

392
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:45,440
Why do I feel more at home here
than at Sa-hyeon's?

393
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,026
-Does it fit you?
-Yes.

394
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,866
You didn't have to knock.
We're both women.

395
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,160
You look good in bright colors.

396
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,621
My skin is fair. That's why.

397
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,834
I spoke with Sa-hyeon when you were gone.

398
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,295
He asked about you.

399
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,382
He's dying to come over.

400
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,931
-Can you speed up?
-There's a speed limit.

401
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:24,020
Mun-ho, let go of your pride.

402
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,440
Don't provoke her anymore.

403
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:52,006
Look up. That's it.

404
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,384
Gosh, you're terrific. Keep going.

405
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,472
Mom, come on in!

406
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,432
Hurry up!

407
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,708
You should let Ji-a spend a night
at your mother's.

408
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,711
She never even invited Ji-a over.

409
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,465
She can't bring herself to ask.
She's hesitant.

410
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,509
I'm sure she misses her dearly.

411
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,219
She'll be in sixth grade soon.

412
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,930
She shouldn't skip academy classes.

413
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,473
Invite her for Lunar New Year's.

414
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,600
We should have breakfast together.

415
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,021
Okay?

416
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,731
Did you speak with her?

417
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,318
I called her last week,
and she sounded down.

418
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,530
It'll be best for Ji-a to see
her maternal grandmother.

419
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,620
Do you ride Chadol from time to time?

420
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,751
-He died.
-Oh, no. He died?

421
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,921
-When?
-The day after New Year's.

422
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,423
Why didn't you tell me?

423
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,467
I was heartbroken.
I didn't want to make you sad as well.

424
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,094
Was it colic?

425
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,638
-Was there a funeral?
-Yes, they had one.

426
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,266
I thought you hadn't gone lately
because you were busy.

427
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:29,312
I have no plans to go there for now.
I don't want a new horse either.

428
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,617
Watching TV together makes it more fun.

429
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,785
I agree.

430
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,831
I love that you're here.

431
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,209
The house feels warmer now.

432
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,211
You've been lonely for too long.

433
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:57,256
I don't feel uncomfortable here either.
It feels like home.

434
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,927
Isn't this place too small for you?
You were at a big house.

435
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,222
My friend's apartment in Busan
was about this size.

436
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,389
I meant your house.

437
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,516
I can go there whenever I want.

438
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,936
Apartments have their perks as well.

439
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,314
Don't you have class at 9 p.m?

440
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,443
It's 8:50 p.m.

441
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,404
I'm teaching on the first floor.

442
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,490
Of this building?

443
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,574
Yes.

444
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,204
Put that on before you go. It's cold.

445
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,627
Isn't it tiring?

446
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,713
Teaching can be really exhausting.

447
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,258
You should quit starting next month.

448
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,386
Who could it be?

449
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,187
Hello.

450
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,690
Hey, going somewhere?

451
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,776
I'm teaching Chinese now.

452
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:02,822
What for? You'll feel exhausted.

453
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,419
He looks haggard.

454
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,924
He looks miserable.

455
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,064
I'm terribly sorry.

456
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,819
I'll beg for your forgiveness

457
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,865
until you feel better.

458
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,578
I was spoiled and entitled.

459
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,247
I was too proud.

460
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,293
I was on a high horse.

461
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,046
A married couple needs
to respect each other

462
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,007
since they are equal.

463
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,842
I was an idiot.

464
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,345
You're trying to squirm your way out
by saying that.

465
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,388
I'm not.

466
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,350
I admit that I was wrong.

467
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,771
In any case, I am truly sorry.

468
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:22,443
I know saying sorry won't relieve
the grudge you've heldâ€¦

469
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,489
-for decades.
-At least you know.

470
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:30,284
I put myself in your shoes.
If I were you, I would also be upset

471
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,787
and disgusted.

472
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:34,580
I understand.

473
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,624
Then stop talking.

474
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,834
I don't know how much long we'll live,

475
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:43,381
but I promise to treat you like a queen
with all my heart.

476
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,426
Isn't that from a song?

477
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:52,098
No, that's "with all my life."

478
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,809
It's one of the soundtracks

479
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,896
from Love Me Once Again sung by Nam Jin.

480
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,609
It's already too late.

481
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:07,279
If I look down on you
or hurt you once again,

482
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,534
I'll consider myself a dog.

483
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,871
Ye-jeong. Ms. So.

484
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,542
Please forgive me this once, ma'am.

485
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,377
Just this once.

486
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,132
If you do, I promise

487
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,344
to treat you with respect from now on.

488
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,221
I know you very well.

489
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,683
Every time I treated you well,
you never appreciated it

490
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,977
but rather belittled me.

491
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:42,189
-You neglected me.
-Not anymore.

492
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,607
I swear to God.

493
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:48,320
I swear on my deceased parents.

494
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,494
I don't have an appetite.

495
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,414
Since you're goneâ€¦

496
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,042
I can't sleep in peace.

497
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,091
Life is meaningless.

498
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,720
There's no point in living.

499
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,765
Everything was my fault.

500
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,727
I had a terrible temper.

501
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,564
I was an asshole.

502
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:28,277
There's no better wife than you.

503
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,030
You can treat me the same way I did.

504
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:34,283
Take your revenge on me.
I'll endure it all.

505
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,205
Mistreat me as much as you want

506
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,457
until you can forgive me.

507
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:47,129
Why would the chairman of Signal Country
be so weak and cry?

508
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,216
They're tears of repentance.

509
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:55,262
Then why does it feel like
they're crocodile tears?

510
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,807
Not at all! I'm not that evil!

511
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,310
I'm not, ma'am.

512
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:06,398
You know I'd never pretend to cry.

513
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,026
As you know, I am a proud man.

514
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,572
I don't want to cry and look pitiful.

515
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,453
But I can't stop crying.

516
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,705
I know you're fuming inside.

517
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,832
Not at all. Never.

518
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,210
I'm not furious at all.

519
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,547
But my knees hurt.

520
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,346
Sit comfortably.

521
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:44,728
I was wrong.

522
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,607
I must have been out of my mind.

523
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,862
If you want the herbal medicine back,
I'll get it from her.

524
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,281
She probably finished it.

525
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:59,451
I'll tell her to throw it all up.

526
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,203
Stop exaggerating.

527
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,746
I'm not.

528
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:07,543
I'll do whatever you want me to do.
Your wish is my command.

529
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,046
I'm going to rename Dongmi.

530
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:15,551
I'd give her your name if I could.

531
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,224
Iâ€¦

532
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,061
search and call out for you

533
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:30,983
even in my dreams.

534
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,611
-Really.
-Gosh.

535
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,530
Should I beg like this?

536
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,831
Slap me

537
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,958
until you feel better.

538
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,192
You've torn my heart into pieces.

539
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:19,156
Hit me in the chest as much as you want.

540
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,163
I don't want to see your face.

541
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:27,873
I'll do my best

542
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,794
so that you won't feel that way anymore.

543
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:33,962
I mean it.

544
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:37,299
Trust me. Trust your man.

545
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,806
Can you relate to these lyrics?

546
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:47,184
Yes. There are many women like that.

547
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,727
Speaking from experience?

548
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,646
What are you getting at?

549
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,482
Just be straightforward with me.

550
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:16,672
"Trust me. I'll only love you.

551
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,424
I'll hug you forever."

552
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:21,343
Well, they say everyone is different.

553
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,886
But I think it's the opposite.

554
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,847
It's not just because I'm a woman.

555
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,808
But don't men tend to cheat more?

556
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,977
I bet we'll get many complaints
if I say this.

557
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,021
I think it all boils down
to how flirtatious you are.

558
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,982
Whether you're flirty or not.

559
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,317
For all of you tuning into our show,

560
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,779
ask yourselves how flirtatious you are.

561
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:44,324
If you're too flirtatious,
turn it down a notch

562
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:48,203
so that you won't hurt
your significant other.

563
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:51,248
It's already time to say goodbye.
Here is our final song.

564
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,836
That's another day done.

565
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,173
You're so quick-witted.

566
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,800
I'm a good writer but a terrible talker.

567
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,385
You have a knack for writing.

568
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,137
Most writers aren't eloquent.

569
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,515
A friend of mine is a famous writer.

570
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,101
But I need to take a deep breath
and brace myself

571
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,145
before I listen to him talk.

572
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,232
-Are you saying I'm all talk?
-That's your job.

573
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:19,943
-Are you good at writing?
-I'm not too bad.

574
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,406
-See you tomorrow.
-Goodbye.

575
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,242
Hey.

576
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:36,001
I wish he could joke around at least once.

577
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,628
He only states facts.

578
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:40,172
Would it be that bad
for him to clown around?

579
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,383
-What is it?
-It's funny hearing that from you.

580
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,094
Why? Does it make me sound old?

581
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,972
It doesn't suit you.

582
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,351
That's what marriage will do to you
after some time.

583
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,520
Aren't you trying for a baby?

584
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:58,232
I'm too busy and exhausted.
It's difficult to make time.

585
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,733
It's not easy at all.

586
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:03,070
-Still, you should make time.
-I plan to.

587
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,446
Visiting your in-laws for the holiday?

588
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,115
My mother-in-law is on a cruise,
so I don't need to go.

589
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,034
Goodness. How classy.

590
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,832
Should we turn on the TV, ma'am?

591
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,919
You never used honorifics to me.

592
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:22,256
I will from now on
as a way to show respect.

593
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,968
Turns out, I did indeed respect you.

594
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,095
I realized it this time around.

595
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:31,640
But what's the point in that
if I don't express it?

596
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:34,810
From now on,
I'll treat you with due respect.

597
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,983
-Thank you.
-Stop exaggerating. It looks insincere.

598
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:43,110
I told you it's not.

599
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,279
Like Byeol-hui said, "Never."

600
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,114
You'll see.

601
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,127
It's very sweet.

602
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,339
May I tag along to the OB-GYN

603
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,383
for the check-up?

604
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:07,843
Sure.

605
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,347
I can finally breathe.

606
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,392
How are you doing?

607
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,480
Good. What about you?

608
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,610
I'm doing well.

609
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,405
Take care of your health.

610
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:31,241
Nothing's more important than that.

611
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,417
Have breakfast with us
this Lunar New Year's.

612
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,712
Thank you.

613
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:56,683
Mom, can Grandma and I visit
your radio station?

614
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,394
I'd like to take a look around.

615
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:02,189
Sure. As long as you're quiet.

616
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:36,807
Here.

617
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:40,894
-I'll sit in the front.
-No. Sit back here.

618
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:41,978
Get in.

619
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,443
You should sit here.

620
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,616
I prefer the front seat.

621
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,160
Make sure you drive safely.

622
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:58,787
Yes, sir.

623
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,667
What's taking her so long?

624
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,836
They need to look at the ultrasound.

625
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:49,129
-Is everything okay?
-Yes.

626
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:50,922
Goodness.

627
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,144
Sin Central Medical Center, please.

628
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,270
Yes, ma'am.

629
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:12,819
Please enjoy.

630
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,285
No, you first.

631
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:23,205
Eat up while you can still stomach it.

632
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:24,539
He's right.

633
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,835
I'm worried that you might need
to get a C-section.

634
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,005
The doctor said natural birth
looks possible as of now.

635
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:34,424
I truly hope Lady Luck
will be on our side.

636
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:40,180
-Wrap it in the lettuce.
-Okay.

637
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:48,730
Goodness. Ma'am, eat up.
Meat doesn't taste good when it's cold.

638
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,273
"Ma'am"?

639
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:55,278
For you two, consider me your servant.

640
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,613
That's ridiculous.

641
00:51:56,696 --> 00:52:00,033
Feel free to ask me for any favors.

642
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:01,993
Be careful what you say.

643
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,871
You're my husband, not a servant.

644
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,624
I'm not joking. I mean it.

645
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,709
From the bottom of my heart.

646
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,847
You first, ma'am.

647
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,473
Eat up.

648
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:32,023
Don't tell me you're being overly kind
because you hate me.

649
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,358
That's right.

650
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,656
I need to be hospitalized.

651
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,201
-Neuropsychiatry?
-Yes.

652
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,580
Did you harm yourself?

653
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,873
I don't know.

654
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:51,251
Could you fill this in, please?

655
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:52,961
NEW PATIENT REGISTRATION FORM

656
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,135
NAME

657
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,978
Are you okay, ma'am?

658
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,271
-Ma'am!
-Wake up!

659
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,029
SIN CENTRAL MEDICAL CENTER

660
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:57,067
Don't you think it'd be better for her
to stay with us?

661
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,778
I thought the same thing.

662
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,156
What if Hye-ryung comes over?

663
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:04,866
She wouldn't, ma'am.

664
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,285
And she always calls beforehand.

665
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,996
Just talk like you used to.

666
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,165
Don't try to change yourself.

667
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,376
It doesn't suit you.

668
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,836
It would be rude of me to talk casually

669
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,216
when you use honorifics.

670
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:23,176
What would Won think?

671
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:28,139
Using honorifics would make us
look respectable if anything.

672
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,355
Have you made your order yet?

673
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,398
I'm still full.

674
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,775
Let's share a bowl of doenjang stew.

675
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:40,235
We'll order in a bit.

676
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:47,117
-I won't be long. I'm going to Sobaeksan.
-Okay.

677
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,411
Why, hello.

678
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:52,247
Your food's being prepared.
Please wait inside.

679
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:53,957
Okay.

680
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:05,844
He thinks it'd be nice for you
to stay with us.

681
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:10,890
We have plenty of rooms.
You'll have us and Dongmi.

682
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,977
Walking in our front yard every day
will be good for you too.

683
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:17,647
The air is much cleaner
compared to Gangnam.

684
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,485
-Are you sure it'll be okay?
-Why not?

685
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:25,572
I don't want you to be in a pickleâ€¦

686
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:27,991
because of me.

687
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:32,328
I know what you mean,
but you have nothing to worry about.

688
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,874
Sa-hyeon's wife rarely comes over
since she's so busy.

689
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:39,044
She stops by if she needs to,
but she always calls beforehand.

690
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:42,464
My wife's dishes are addicting.

691
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:51,014
This is work-related.

692
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:52,390
Sure, answer it.

693
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:00,690
Hello?

694
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,573
Oh, I see.

695
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:31,304
It's okay. There are times
when I need to postpone my classes too.

696
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:33,848
Okay.

697
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:35,809
Goodbye.

698
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,770
1 UNREAD MESSAGE

699
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,926
Are you here with someone?

700
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,762
I'm here with your parents.

701
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,938
SOBAEKSAN

702
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:30,280
Goodness. What a surprise.

703
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:31,990
Dinner plans?

704
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:32,991
No.

705
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:35,535
Have a seat.

706
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:44,919
How did you know?

707
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,380
It wasn't me.

708
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,382
I ordered some ribs to go.

709
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,885
She got a check-up today.

710
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,637
-Everything's fine.
-The baby's growing well.

711
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,556
-How are you feeling?
-I'm okay.

712
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,641
You must be hungry. Order something.

713
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,728
Tell them you'll eat yours here. Why not?

714
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,690
-You should.
-How's your morning sickness?

715
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,276
-It's better.
-She's eating well.

716
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,490
-Yes?
-I asked for take out,

717
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,824
but I'll just have it here.

718
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,955
-Are you going to Sobaeksan?
-Yes.

719
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,836
Your husband's in Room Five.

720
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:48,191
I'd appreciate it if you could take photos
every month starting from now.

721
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,610
I have been.

722
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:53,154
What's taking them so long
to serve the food?

723
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:54,906
Maybe they forgot.

724
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:58,535
They need to place everything
in plates again.

725
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,805
Do youâ€¦

726
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,808
live in Nonhyeon-dong by any chance?

727
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,478
Yes.

728
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,232
Let's talk outside.

729
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,276
Let's go.

730
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,404
Youâ€¦

731
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:26,205
How dare you all deceive me?

732
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,999
Let go!

733
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,294
Let go! Honey!

734
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:35,256
Hey! Can't you see that she's pregnant?

735
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,009
Mother, aren't you supposed to be
on a cruise?

736
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:40,720
I came back two days ago.

737
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,013
I thought you ended it.

738
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,557
Sit down and hear us out.

739
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,685
Actions speak louder than words.
What's there to hear?

740
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:50,396
-What I'm seeing is the truth.
-It's a misunderstanding.

741
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,732
You should be ashamed of yourself.

742
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,401
Don't speak rashly.
You're embarrassing yourself.

743
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,946
Seriously? Is that what concerns you?

744
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,239
Lower your voice.

745
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,992
-Wait outside.
-She's not going anywhere.

746
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,162
Sit down.

747
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:35,692
Don't do this.

748
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:38,861
I understand how you're feeling,
but hear us out first!

749
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:58,089
You told us to visit her every so often.

750
01:01:58,172 --> 01:01:59,966
We took her to the OB-GYN today, and

751
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,467
we ran into him.

752
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:05,179
He had ordered some marinated ribs to go.

753
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:06,597
Do you expect me to believe that?

754
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:09,100
Then go ask the waitress.

755
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:11,144
Press the bell.

756
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:21,112
I heard you wanted to eat the ribs here.

757
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:23,114
-Yes.
-I'm sorry,

758
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:24,615
but can I have it to go again?

759
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:26,909
You should eat.

760
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,495
That's okay.

761
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,497
Then have some rice with this stew.

762
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,665
I'm fine.

763
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:40,006
I'm sorry. It was an accident.
We'll pay for it later.

764
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:52,810
Look at her glaring.

765
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:54,270
What brings you here?

766
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:55,772
Dinner plans with my friends.

767
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,315
Are they already here?

768
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:04,489
-Hello?
-What's taking you so long?

769
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,365
-Eat by yourselves.
-When will you come?

770
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:07,658
I'll call you back later.

771
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:15,041
You should go first.

772
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:15,958
To Daejeon?

773
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:17,585
Get up.

774
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:21,547
I'm not done here.

775
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:23,966
Be polite.

776
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,885
Must I?

777
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,804
Must I do that to your mistress?

778
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:31,224
Hey. I know you're upset,
but watch what you say.

779
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,266
She's pregnant.

780
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:35,478
Just talk to me.

781
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,814
What more do we need to talk about?

782
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,191
What difference would that make?

783
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:44,403
-You guys can leave.
-Let's all go together.

784
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,823
I need a word with her.

785
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:49,200
She needs to explain all this.

786
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:52,161
Then let's talk at your place.

787
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,081
-There are eyes here.
-He's right.

788
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:04,590
-What?
-What is it?

789
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,595
-Hye-ryung--
-Be quiet!

790
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:10,596
Pick it up.

791
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:12,640
What's going on?

792
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,685
The food will be ready soon.

793
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:17,854
Pick it up and come home.

794
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:20,857
Let's go.

795
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,659
Please drive my car back to my house.

796
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,291
Get in. We'll be in the car too.

797
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,347
How dare he give his seat to her

798
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:56,434
in front of me just because
she's carrying his grandchild?

799
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,978
I hope she won't get stressed.

800
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:19,040
How about we sing at our wedding?

801
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,499
I could invite a few, butâ€¦

802
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,752
I'd be glad to, but I'm a terrible singer.

803
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:24,337
We can practice.

804
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,880
I'm awfully tone-deaf.

805
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:28,925
We'll find an easy song.

806
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,680
-U-ram.
-Yes?

807
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,558
Come sit here. We need to talk.

808
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:47,068
You've matured both physically
and emotionally, right?

809
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:48,694
-Of course.
-You might hear

810
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:52,949
that your dad is getting married
to his new girlfriend.

811
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:56,285
-When?
-I don't know the exact date,

812
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,079
but it'll be before spring.

813
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:04,502
You may see articles online
about his wedding.

814
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:07,797
Really? Who is he marrying?

815
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,800
She's a musical actress.
I'll tell you her name later.

816
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:12,802
I understand

817
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:15,554
that you may be confused and upset.

818
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:20,059
But I hope you'll be mature about it.

819
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,062
It's really nothing.

820
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:24,689
I'm fine with it,

821
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:28,442
but what will my friends think?

822
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:32,154
Some of my friends know him.
Ji-a, for example.

823
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,907
What should I tell them if they ask me?

824
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:38,035
What can I say?

825
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,246
It'll die down.

826
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:41,872
Even the most shocking news

827
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:44,375
startles us at first,
but we soon forget about it.

828
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:46,043
Sure, if they're celebrities.

829
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:50,506
But do you think those around us
will forget about it?

830
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:54,510
He's inconsiderate.

831
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:57,096
You may be able to understand him

832
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:59,932
once you grow up.

833
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,768
That won't happen. Ever.

834
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:07,815
I hope you won't grow into a man like him.

835
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:09,066
Never.

836
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:15,948
How are you here already?

837
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:19,952
I bet he rushed over here out of worry.

838
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:22,246
How did you two meet?

839
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:25,332
First, what's your name?

840
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:32,423
-Song Won.
-You look old.

841
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:34,759
How old are you?

842
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:37,136
Is this an interrogation?

843
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:40,014
You don't need to know her age.

844
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:43,184
I was curious how old she is
to have an affair with a married man.

845
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:44,268
That's why.

846
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,307
End it today once and for all.

847
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:26,018
This is hard on all of us
and painful for that matter,

848
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,103
so let's end it.

849
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,021
That's exactly why he was drawn to me!

850
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,273
Fine. Draw up the papers tomorrow.

851
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,818
Song Yuan.
I knew she had a classy personality.

852
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:35,361
There was a newly admitted patient.

853
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:37,655
Name, A Mi. Age, 27.

854
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:41,450
She had drowned herself in wine
and whiskey for the past few days.

855
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:42,910
I truly admire you, Dad.

856
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:44,662
In every aspect.

857
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:46,914
You're even emotionally stable.

858
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,000
-Is it a guest from overseas?
-That's right.

859
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:52,002
That friend you gave the jacket to?

860
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:55,005
Seo-hyang? What's wrong with her?

861
01:08:57,591 --> 01:08:59,009
Try the sikhye I made.

862
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:10,646
