EPISODE 14

2
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,558
Isn't Ms. Sa getting married
this Saturday?

3
00:00:58,641 --> 00:00:59,768
She is.

4
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,648
What's wrong?

5
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,821
Should I pull over?

6
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,534
-No.
-Are you feeling sick?

7
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,995
-Should we go to a pharmacy?
-I just have a weak stomach.

8
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,795
What kind of woman washes
her husband's feet nowadays?

9
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:30,298
She's definitely Song Yuan. I know it.

10
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,508
What should we do?

11
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,843
She's so good to us now.

12
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,514
What if we carry out an exorcism

13
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,308
and ruin everything?

14
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,393
This is a dilemma.

15
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,939
It sure is.

16
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,358
But I'm quite jealous to be honest.

17
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,735
I've never been pampered like that

18
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,531
in my entire life.

19
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,532
What about me?

20
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,910
I did my best as the breadwinner.

21
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,286
I brought food to the table.

22
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,414
It's not like I didn't cook for you
or leave you to starve.

23
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,251
You went abroad for a month
on a luxurious cruise ship

24
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,418
because you were upset.

25
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,713
None of that mattered
since I was miserable.

26
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,717
Did you climb on the deck at night

27
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,845
and cry or something?

28
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,473
You did while thinking of me.

29
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,308
I cried for all the wrong reasons.

30
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,102
I cried out of frustration.

31
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,271
Eat up.

32
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,273
Can't you see that I'm busy?

33
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,233
I don't want it.

34
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,613
Can I look forward to tonight?

35
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,698
What for?

36
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:40,326
I'd have nothing more to ask for
if I got a foot massage.

37
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,162
-From my granny wife.
-"Granny"?

38
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,455
We have a grandson now.

39
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,374
-Please?
-I can do that.

40
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:50,128
-Seriously?
-But that's not the issue right now.

41
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,798
Our youngest son
is living with a ghost and is happy.

42
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,885
And the two of them get along so well.

43
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,053
Let's wait it out.

44
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,098
I doubt anything will happen
in a year or two.

45
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,600
You want me to believe that?

46
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,352
I'm not making this up.

47
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,230
She's made your father
get sick and pass away.

48
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,649
He had a heart attack
at the movie theater.

49
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,360
-You don't know anything.
-Are you really a doctor?

50
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,905
And she was the one who
caused him to have a heart attack.

51
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,698
If you don't believe me, ask her.

52
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,325
They loved each other dearly.

53
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,993
She told me so herself.

54
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,454
I should have taken a video.

55
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,289
But I was too shocked.

56
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,957
She's not herself right now. She's sick.

57
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,126
Pi-young and I
are still worried about her.

58
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,294
But you're ignoring us again.

59
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,921
-I'm not.
-Then dismissing it?

60
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,006
I'm busy.

61
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,342
I need to make my rounds.

62
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,052
I'm scared of her.

63
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,140
Not that one. Get a smaller one.

64
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,726
She's not a VIP guest.

65
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,479
-Mr. Seo is eating out too.
-Okay.

66
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,440
And the chairman
doesn't like dried yellow corvina.

67
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,359
He prefers barley-dried yellow corvina.

68
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,822
Did she starve her kids?

69
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,241
They eat like hungry beggars.

70
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,202
They were stuffing themselves.

71
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,914
Not many ordinary families can have
as much Korean beef as they want.

72
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,585
It's not like she's not Cinderella.

73
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,836
Is she "Grandmarella"?

74
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,761
She's being pampered
now that she's married into SF Group.

75
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,432
Why should we cater to her?

76
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:30,144
Exactly. Why did the madam
have to pass away?

77
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,647
She would have never allowed them in here.

78
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,943
I sent my entrance ceremony photo
to my friend,

79
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,528
and she thought he was my uncle.

80
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,322
So what did you say?

81
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,578
I told her you're my stepdad.

82
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,250
You must have been busy today.
Thank you for making time.

83
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,751
Of course, I should come.

84
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,884
I'm craving olive oil
and balsamic vinegar today.

85
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,344
I'm sure they have some.

86
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,888
Just eat what you have. Don't be picky.

87
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:06,973
I'm not being picky.

88
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,809
You said olive oil was better than butter.

89
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,895
Do you have balsamic vinegar
and olive oil?

90
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,188
Yes. I'll give you some.

91
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,857
You're unbelievable.

92
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,192
I didn't raise her to be picky.

93
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,903
I'm in middle school now.
You should understand.

94
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,114
Puberty hits its peak in middle school.

95
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:26,367
You better behave yourself nonetheless.

96
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,954
-What will you do about it?
-I'll give you a good beating.

97
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,999
-Are you serious?
-I always mean what I say.

98
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,917
Crazy dogs and bratty kids deserve…

99
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,545
Later.

100
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,796
Why not tell me now?

101
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,300
-How were you in middle school?
-I was always optimistic.

102
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,927
You're not optimistic. You're just brazen.

103
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,888
Am I?

104
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,723
It depends.

105
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,397
"I'm so jelly."

106
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,777
Her mom remarried three years ago.

107
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,989
"My stepdad will turn 60 soon.
It's so sad."

108
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,616
"When we go out,

109
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,327
people say that my grandpa
looks young for his age."

110
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,455
It's sad and funny.

111
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,623
Oh, well.

112
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,416
Enjoy.

113
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,337
I've never given a school entrance gift
before, so I thought a lot about it.

114
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,382
-Buy whatever you need.
-Grandpa already gave me some.

115
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,592
This is from me.

116
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,806
I'm already grateful
that you came with us today.

117
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,601
And your wedding is the biggest gift ever.

118
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,980
Thanks to you,
Mom seems to be happy again.

119
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,316
I'm truly glad and at peace.

120
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,111
My late paternal grandpa always said

121
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,488
that being at peace was the best.

122
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,906
He's right.

123
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,618
But it'd be nice
if you bought something for yourself.

124
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,912
My birthday is around the corner.

125
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,416
All right, then.
I'll get you a nice birthday gift.

126
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,468
He's in his bedroom.

127
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,495
A one-day honeymoon was too short, right?

128
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,998
We still were able to get some good rest.

129
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,918
My kids said
they had a great time here yesterday.

130
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,630
I thought they'd be lonely and miss you.

131
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,841
We had fun chatting.

132
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,430
Let's get along well from now on.

133
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:56,225
And let me know whenever
you're upset about something, okay?

134
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:57,768
Okay.

135
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,272
Go get changed into comfortable clothes.

136
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,485
It was Ji-a's entrance ceremony today.

137
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,777
We're having dinner.

138
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,113
Okay.

139
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,497
Ji-a, when you're talking on the phone
with someone older than you,

140
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,125
it's common etiquette to wait
until they hang up first.

141
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,629
There are times
when the younger person hangs up first.

142
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,214
That's very rude.

143
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:29,300
If the other person knows good manners,
they'll be offended.

144
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,426
Okay.

145
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,386
Should I cut it for you?

146
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,347
It's okay. It's easy to slice.

147
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,560
When I was little,

148
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:43,731
I learned all kinds of etiquette such as
social and car etiquette.

149
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,399
It's all about your upbringing.

150
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,570
If you act however you want,
they'll blame the parents.

151
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:54,575
Okay. I'll keep that in mind
and make sure you two are praised.

152
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,998
If you have anything to say, tell us.

153
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,334
It's our turn to listen to her.

154
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,628
People say even kids
can teach us something.

155
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,507
My mom is too perfect

156
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,133
that at times…

157
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,343
Do I suffocate you?

158
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,095
It's not that bad.

159
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,846
I'm just saying.

160
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,395
People can be so cunning.

161
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,898
If I wasn't perfect and made mistakes
you'll scold me for that too.

162
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,149
You're right.

163
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,027
-Did you talk to Si-eun today?
-No.

164
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,073
-I'm so curious.
-Let's have dessert at my place.

165
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,533
Ji-a can see her new room too.

166
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:40,121
Let's just allow the newlyweds
to enjoy each other's company.

167
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,420
-Do the classes finish late?
-Yes.

168
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,298
They have a long journey ahead. Let's eat.

169
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,392
Is this how you eat normally?

170
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,728
There are too many side dishes.

171
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:08,357
You're right. When I ate at Pi-young's,
she only prepared a handful of dishes.

172
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,359
It's a waste to throw them away.

173
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,196
Right. My mother
was also against wasting food.

174
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,496
How does it taste?

175
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,458
It's similar to store-bought ones.

176
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,792
You like it?

177
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,128
Flavor enhancers?

178
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:46,979
They say it's not healthy for kids
to watch TV or use the computer.

179
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,900
Song Yuan once said that
it hinders brain development.

180
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,196
Can you please fold your newspapers
before putting them in the utility room?

181
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,533
We've been too occupied lately
because of the possession.

182
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,701
Still…

183
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,883
I think I'm pregnant.

184
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,844
-Pregnant?
-Yes.

185
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,179
This is just great.

186
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,223
Did you go to a hospital?
Or is it just a feeling?

187
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,517
-I used a test kit.
-A test kit?

188
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,061
-A pregnancy test kit.
-Is there such a thing?

189
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:27,978
Really?

190
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,732
Yes, so buy some flowers on your way home.

191
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,110
-Or a cake.
-I will.

192
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,947
We've finally received good news
after all we've been through.

193
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,324
You're right. It's unexpected.

194
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,784
We need to celebrate.

195
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,082
-It's a gift.
-Why did you buy such a pricey bag?

196
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,626
Because you deserve it.

197
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,629
I've had my eyes on this for a while.

198
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,298
What else do you want? Tell me.

199
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,176
-Will you buy them all?
-Of course.

200
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,803
I'm on cloud nine.

201
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,263
Why didn't you have dinner?

202
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,014
How could I?

203
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,809
She only gives me food
that will end up killing me.

204
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,936
What kind of food?

205
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,855
Don't ask.

206
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,023
I grilled her some meat for lunch.

207
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,900
-You weren't hungry--
-Eat with me then.

208
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,235
Sure.

209
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,655
Beef tenderloin.

210
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,906
Again?

211
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,160
I could have meat every meal.
I can never get sick of it.

212
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,494
It's good for you.

213
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,912
Save me from this misery.

214
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,790
What did you just say?

215
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,376
You cursed me to die, didn't you?

216
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,589
See what I mean?
She keeps cursing me so that I die.

217
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,966
She was putting a curse on me.

218
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,347
-How much was this?
-Don't ask. It's a gift.

219
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,224
Yes. You're right.

220
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,769
I'll use it well.

221
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,440
My friends are going to die of jealousy.

222
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,488
Let's let Song Yuan go.

223
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,157
Let's part ways.

224
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,369
Hye-ryung's pregnant now too.

225
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,997
I doubt she'll change.

226
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,753
Your dad's here.

227
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,882
Let her say hi first.

228
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,510
Right.

229
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,470
Knock, knock.

230
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,471
Who is it?

231
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,805
Can I come in?

232
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,096
She used to work as a nurse.

233
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,557
She tended
to the mentally ill for decades.

234
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,351
She knows
you're trying to feed her medicine.

235
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:16,188
Just listen to what she has to say
and don't criticize her.

236
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:21,652
Love and attention are the best remedies
for those with troubled hearts.

237
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,737
Why does she have a troubled heart?

238
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,073
It's not like anyone abused her.

239
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,243
Don't nitpick and criticize her
like you did earlier. Leave it to me.

240
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:33,122
She's stressed and troubled
about something.

241
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,499
I'm a doctor
and I've known her all my life.

242
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,128
Then you should have taken better
care of her so she doesn't fall ill.

243
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,769
If I had to pick one of you,
it would be her.

244
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,773
She raised me with love since I was seven.

245
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:03,444
It wouldn't be right for me
to send her away

246
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,404
just because she's sick.

247
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,949
Leave if you hate this so much.
I won't beg you to stay.

248
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,250
Are you telling me to leave?

249
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,128
So that you can live with your stepmom
who is your first love?

250
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,922
-Watch what you say.
-That's how I see it.

251
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:23,839
That's all you say.

252
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,508
You just said so yourself.
That you'd pick her over me.

253
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,760
You're just like Pi-young.

254
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,971
-You're cold and heartless to me.
-No, I'm not.

255
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:35,100
You get so easily irritated by me.
But you're so sweet toward her.

256
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,061
-I can see it in your eyes.
-She's sick

257
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,395
Say it louder!

258
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,900
How are you the same
when you're not even related?

259
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,783
If Father really died because of her--

260
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,910
Don't you know
it's a sin to think that way?

261
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,287
What if it's true?
Would you still love her?

262
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,844
I'll see you in the evening, Father.

263
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,139
Okay. You don't need
to see me out from tomorrow on.

264
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,788
Try not to be late if you can.

265
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:38,789
Of course.

266
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,424
Just lie around and rest.

267
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,689
Will I be able to give birth safely?

268
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,566
You'll have to be careful.

269
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,777
A woman with the same condition
had both a son and a daughter.

270
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,154
Goodness.

271
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,864
We were talking about farting.

272
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,366
Then Ms. Kim stood up
after placing the cups down

273
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,327
and asked Grandpa
what kind of tea he wanted.

274
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,788
-That's when she farted.
-Oh, dear.

275
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,541
Ms. Kim was so embarrassed
and pretty much ran away.

276
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,918
But then it started to reek.

277
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,882
So he told us to open the window
and told me to get mulberry leaf tea.

278
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,356
He wants mulberry leaf--

279
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,236
Make sure
your daughter-in-law stays at home.

280
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,404
Okay.

281
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,950
Please pray that she'll give birth
to a healthy baby.

282
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,535
Of course.

283
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,955
My son doesn't know about this.
He doesn't need to, does he?

284
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,596
You need to relieve your stress
in order to be able to focus.

285
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,598
Exercise is the best for that.

286
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:23,811
I'm always impressed by
female equestrians in the Olympics.

287
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:24,937
They are amazing.

288
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,355
But I'm a little scared.

289
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,357
Maybe at first.

290
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,568
But after some time, you'll be
the invincible and intimidating one.

291
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,530
It's been a long time.

292
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,739
Hi.

293
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,699
You seem to have lost weight.

294
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,244
I have. My pants were too big for me.

295
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,411
The 14th?

296
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,288
Okay.

297
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,082
Hyeon-seung won't make it.

298
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,732
All right.

299
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,984
Goodbye.

300
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,260
How's this one?

301
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,013
I like it.

302
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:58,906
-Hello.
-Hello.

303
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,532
She's not home.

304
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,744
Ma'am, can you buy
some moving boxes from the supermarket?

305
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:10,250
You look so much prettier now that
you've snagged yourself a young groom.

306
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,878
She's right. I'm so jealous.

307
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,173
My husband has presbyopia
and needs glasses to read now.

308
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,509
Come on. I just got a few facials.

309
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,136
INCOMING CALL
HOUSEKEEPER

310
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,263
It's my housekeeper.

311
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,600
Hello?

312
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:31,021
Dr. Shin is here.
He wants me to buy some moving boxes.

313
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,773
-Moving boxes?
-Yes.

314
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,567
So is he there alone right now?

315
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:40,239
Yes. I had just left and ran into him
in front of the elevator.

316
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,074
I had told him you weren't home.

317
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,575
What's wrong?

318
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,663
I need to take this.

319
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,461
INCOMING CALL
PI-YOUNG

320
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,305
The number you have dialed
is not available. Please leave a message…

321
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,773
Sorry but I need to head home right now.

322
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,317
What's going on?
We're here because of you.

323
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,443
Ex-husbands are a pain.

324
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,153
Is he throwing a fit?

325
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,780
Anything will do.

326
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,782
Try the convenience stores.

327
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,575
Okay.

328
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,366
-What is that?
-I'm taking Ji-a.

329
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,367
But that's been settled.

330
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,494
I'm going to raise her at all costs.

331
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,330
Says who? What gives you the right?

332
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,415
It's my right as her father.

333
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,250
-You gave up on that.
-Seo Dong-ma, that scumbag.

334
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,544
He has no right to be her dad.

335
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,171
He's just a pretty boy
with no life experiences.

336
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:23,091
Were you always this petty?
And you call yourself a doctor?

337
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,968
What's wrong with me wanting
to raise my daughter?

338
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,428
She chose to live with me.

339
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,346
If it was just you two, then sure.

340
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,433
You didn't say anything to her back then.
You yielded and left.

341
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,354
Sit down.

342
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,696
What's wrong with you?

343
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:49,743
How could you let our young daughter
go shopping with your boyfriend?

344
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,370
-What's wrong with that?
-They were walking arm-in-arm.

345
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,081
Of course, I'd be furious.

346
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:57,626
It's not like she grabbed his waist.
Even if she did, so what?

347
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,253
They'll be family soon.
In fact, they're already acting like one.

348
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,297
-Who'd think he's her dad?
-Why are you shouting?

349
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,465
Who cares what others think?

350
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,093
Then Ji-a shouldn't grab
A Mi's arm either.

351
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,553
Who'd think she's her stepmom
even if they lived together?

352
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,971
Maybe an aunt or a sister.

353
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,933
A Mi is female just like her.
She's not the opposite gender.

354
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,351
Don't make me laugh.

355
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,520
I can't believe you.

356
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,480
Is that all you think about?

357
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:22,984
In any case,
I don't care how many men you meet.

358
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,736
I'm taking Ji-a today.

359
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,488
The court gave me custody.

360
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,074
Then file a lawsuit.
Get the court's ruling.

361
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,328
Yes?

362
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,915
Don't come home.
I'll call you when I'm done.

363
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,626
You told me to have dinner with Mr. Seo.

364
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:40,794
Right.

365
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,171
Keep your promise.

366
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,798
I never made one.

367
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,634
She's in middle school now.

368
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,470
Are you going to bring this up
and stress her out again?

369
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,515
Yes, until I get it my way.

370
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,853
She should go through some storms in life.
They will help her grow.

371
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,231
I know I'm the root of everything.
But she won't suffer for long.

372
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,275
She can think for herself.

373
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,735
How can she call someone that young "Dad"?

374
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,738
-She said it felt natural.
-She's my daughter.

375
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,366
I let you have custody of her
because you were stubborn.

376
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:14,077
I thought she'd be better off
with her mom than her dad.

377
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,495
But things have changed now.

378
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,497
You have no right to ignore her wish.

379
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,083
I'm going to be a perfect dad
from now, so don't worry.

380
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,919
Other than my affair,
I've always been a great dad.

381
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:26,089
I will never let Ji-a
grow up with a stepmom.

382
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,465
We're going to break up.

383
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,467
As if a single dad is any better.

384
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:34,556
-And her grandma is out of her mind.
-She'll get better.

385
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,142
That reason alone will make
the court take my side.

386
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,644
You want to file a lawsuit? Be my guest.

387
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,689
And don't you ever show your face
around here before that happens.

388
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,610
-"Show my face"?
-You don't own any part of this place.

389
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:47,944
This place is my mother's.

390
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,363
And Ji-a will be escorted
to and from school starting tomorrow.

391
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:55,285
Stop being so stubborn.
You have no reason to do this.

392
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:59,122
You know that very well.
She'll only be more disappointed in you.

393
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,958
Dong-ma used to ride horses too.

394
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,754
He said horseback riding was great
for kids who were going through puberty.

395
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,590
You always told us
how beneficial horseback riding was.

396
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,758
So I allowed her.

397
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,384
And she was willing.

398
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,303
I couldn't go today since I had plans.

399
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,096
So why are you so furious?

400
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,936
When Ji-a was born,

401
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,521
I was the first person
to receive her from the nurse.

402
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:27,525
I was the first person she saw
when she opened her eyes.

403
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,654
I was the one
who changed her diapers countless times.

404
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:33,490
We bathed together until she was six.

405
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,831
But today,

406
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:47,045
I saw her grinning ear to ear
while clinging to some guy's arm.

407
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,214
Imagine how I felt.

408
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,967
I was the one who raised her.

409
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,844
He did nothing for her.

410
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,347
Did he feed her? Carry her on his back?

411
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,099
Or did he ever cut her nails?

412
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,687
Does the love and devotion I've given her

413
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,772
mean nothing?

414
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,732
After having the affair,

415
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,610
did I kick you out and cut off ties?

416
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,570
Isn't this too harsh?

417
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,781
My affair is irrelevant.

418
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:17,409
I've always been a devoted dad.

419
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:20,578
Just as women can't understand
men's animal-like nature,

420
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:24,582
if you don't get it, imagine how you
felt today and multiply that by a hundred.

421
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:29,879
You're upset when you were
the one who caused this.

422
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,259
But Ji-a and I are just innocent victims.

423
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:37,762
And you deceived
your precious wife and daughter.

424
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,764
You fooled us completely.

425
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:44,561
And not once.
You betrayed us countless times.

426
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:48,481
Dong-ma may have bought Ji-a pants,
but you bought A Mi a car.

427
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:53,194
Ji-a isn't a baby anymore.
She can understand everything.

428
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,113
You were her one and only dad.

429
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,742
She was very hurt
since she loved and respected you so much.

430
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,370
It's natural for her to distance herself.
She's human after all.

431
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,456
You should know.

432
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,212
Do you think

433
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,841
we should understand your mistakes?

434
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,928
That must be why you came here
and packed her belongings.

435
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:23,600
Can't you think in my shoes
and Ji-a's too for once?

436
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:28,480
Stop complaining
about how heartless we are.

437
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,235
Please, stop doing this.

438
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,737
I'm sick of it.

439
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,407
We're already fallen out of love with you.

440
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,494
Don't make us despise you too.

441
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,455
We were a family once.

442
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,424
I was thoughtless once again.

443
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,221
All right.

444
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,724
Let's end this here.

445
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,371
Should I unpack before I go?

446
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,664
Just go.

447
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:39,592
You always brushed it off
and made excuses whenever I said

448
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,094
I wanted another baby.

449
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,305
But I heard you agreed
to give him a child of his own.

450
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,638
Isn't it good? Dig in.

451
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,438
You said you were free tomorrow, right?

452
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,522
Yes.

453
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:38,568
I asked the monk
from last time to pray for us.

454
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:42,614
He offered to come to us instead
since you're carrying a child.

455
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,032
I see.

456
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,486
Which school does Ji-a go to?

457
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,781
Same as mine.
But we're in different classes.

458
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,743
Did your mom get married?

459
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,287
She did.

460
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,792
Is anything bothering you?

461
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,796
No. We have a driver who drops me off
at school since it's far away.

462
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:41,881
I see.

463
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:43,716
You should eat too.

464
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,677
Okay.

465
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,592
The spirit of Song Won should leave.

466
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,939
You should leave this world and move on.

467
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,712
Baby… My baby…

468
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,760
Jeong-bin.

469
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:54,847
Jeong-bin.

470
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,016
I wanted to see you today

471
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,977
because I wanted to apologize.

472
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:44,814
I think both Dong-ma
and I were wrong in how we treated you.

473
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,862
I was too proud of my son and objected
to the marriage solely due to your age.

474
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,947
But you gave us your blessing in the end.

475
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,323
I should have done that sooner.

476
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:59,078
I know he's my son,
but he can be pretty heartless.

477
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,290
Perhaps…

478
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:05,626
Never mind.

479
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,211
Go on.

480
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:11,424
Maybe he was like that
because he had a sincere heart.

481
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,928
He's never vague
about what he likes or dislikes.

482
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,723
He's always honest.

483
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:23,144
I think that's better
than deceiving someone.

484
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,357
You weren't happy
that I was a musical actress.

485
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,526
What kind of a daughter-in-law is she?

486
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,988
Let's just talk about us.

487
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:37,158
She's not much better than you.

488
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,995
Talking about one thing
will lead to another.

489
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,333
I don't want to bad-mouth
a new family member.

490
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:52,173
It's true that parents
are bonded to their children.

491
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:56,219
The old sayings are so true.

492
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,181
I was thinking of what I could do for you.

493
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:07,897
Please accept this
as a token of my apology.

494
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,525
You don't need to be sorry.

495
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,486
And Dong-ma probably had no choice either.

496
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:18,324
You can't get married
when your feelings have changed.

497
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,956
My parents left me everything they had.

498
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:29,001
Then what could I do for you?

499
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,962
I vaguely remember Dong-ma

500
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:34,966
saying that you had trouble
selling the house you had in Yangpyeong.

501
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,217
I'll buy it from you.

502
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,428
That's okay.
I'm going to keep it as my second home.

503
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,182
It must still be tough for you.

504
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,146
When is he getting married?

505
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,355
It's…

506
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,859
this Saturday.

507
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,329
How do I look?

508
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:02,071
-Hye-ryung wants seasoned cabbage.
-Yes.

509
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,197
I've never heard of it.

510
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,032
-Is she up?
-She's sleeping again.

511
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,867
She eats and sleeps all the time.

512
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,536
Her back must ache.

513
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,871
That's what happens when you're pregnant.

514
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,665
-Really?
-Yes.

515
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:16,002
I don't remember you sleeping
all the time when you were pregnant.

516
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:19,255
How could I when my in-laws
were around back then?

517
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:23,551
Jeez. Pregnant women
nowadays have it easy.

518
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,262
We're the ones walking on eggshells now.

519
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:27,805
Come and help me.

520
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,516
Come on. Let him rest at home.

521
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,934
It's not that hard.

522
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,019
Can't you buy them pre-minced?

523
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:36,605
They smell different.
And we need to use good garlic.

524
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,528
Just go to your room
and prepare for your next trial.

525
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,238
I was only joking.

526
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,489
I'm just taking a break.

527
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,826
Don't you wish it was a girl this time?

528
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,411
-I do.
-I want another son.

529
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,371
Jeez. You sure love sons.

530
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,914
We already have two granddaughters.

531
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,500
-Do you say that in front of them?
-Of course not.

532
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,668
I can never do that.

533
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,340
There they come.

534
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,862
Come on.

535
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,113
Just keep shooting.

536
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,772
We'll be quite busy
thanks to the new family members.

537
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:00,773
Tell me about it.

538
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:03,401
Can't we ask
the chairman to give us a raise?

539
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,528
I was going to ask him anyway.

540
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:10,616
They even have a dog.
There will be fur everywhere.

541
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,165
Okay. Let's begin.

542
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,042
One, two, three.

543
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,336
That's good. One, two, three.

544
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,505
One, two, three.

545
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:32,847
Do I look okay?

546
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,184
Our age difference is obvious, right?

547
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,979
Not at all. You look perfect.

548
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,606
Okay. I'll take one.

549
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,360
Did Hye-ryung call
and apologize for not coming?

550
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,864
Yes. Her OB-GYN told her to just lie down.

551
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,116
One, two, three.

552
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,660
Ji-a, how do you feel?

553
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:58,164
I was happy until someone younger
like you called me by my first name.

554
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,707
Why would you want me to be formal?

555
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,333
I just want to hear you be formal.

556
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,461
Come on.

557
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,922
If not, the adults will scold you.

558
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,966
We'd like all the guests to sit down.

559
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,429
The wedding will begin soon.

560
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,392
I'm even more nervous
than I was at my first wedding.

561
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,102
Are you sure they're not butterflies?

562
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,856
Seeing you like this
makes me want to get married again.

563
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,985
I'm sure your late wife is here with us.

564
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,070
I think so too.

565
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,072
Here comes the groom.

566
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,533
Please welcome him
with a round of applause.

567
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,780
Dong-ma was always annoying.

568
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,406
And he's even more so today.

569
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,700
What a handsome groom he is.

570
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,130
How do you feel right now?

571
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,384
Why do you keep asking everyone that?

572
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:37,012
-How do you feel?
-I'm sure you're all dying to see her.

573
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,265
The bride will finally enter.

574
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,433
Here comes the bride.

575
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,102
Please welcome her
with a round of applause.

576
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:20,175
I won't ask you any more questions

577
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:25,264
If you want to leave me

578
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:32,229
Do so and don't look back

579
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:37,317
I hope you will find a woman

580
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:44,116
Who's better than I am

581
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,591
Dear Future Mom, here's your food.

582
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,767
I brought bibimbap.

583
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,105
-Should I mix it for you?
-Yes.

584
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,649
I didn't add any gochujang.
Spicy food may not be good for you.

585
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:18,942
Okay.

586
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,152
Have some soup.

587
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:26,617
My Queen. Future Mom.
How should I address you?

588
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,951
Use both of them.

589
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:31,997
Eat up.

590
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,502
Is it good?

591
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,129
I fried the egg. You know that, right?

592
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:41,423
Do you feel heavy?

593
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,008
I feel sluggish.

594
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:46,762
-It must be pyebaek time.
-Ms. Sa?

595
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:49,723
Yes. Dr. Shin must be upset.

596
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:59,024
When Song Yuan was pregnant,

597
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:02,319
I couldn't even see her often
or take care of her.

598
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,955
There. Have as many kids as you want.

599
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,724
Thank you for the meal.

600
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,102
What if I have indigestion?

601
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,979
They're just vegetables and rice.

602
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:43,527
-Can you buy some pregnancy books?
-Sure.

603
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,862
I think I ate too much. I feel sick.

604
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,201
Do you want a bowl
so you can brush your teeth in bed?

605
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,495
We have a chamber pot in Daejeon too.

606
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,166
She eats so well. I'm so happy.

607
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,585
I wonder when she'll start getting sick.

608
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,047
If she was a sensitive person,
she'd be having them now.

609
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,592
Your baby is so considerate.
It doesn't want its mom to suffer.

610
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,721
INCOMING CALL
HYE-RYUNG

611
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,267
Yes?

612
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,020
The hospital. 911.

613
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,313
What's wrong?

614
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:33,178
911 EMERGENCY

615
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,059
I'm getting dizzy.

616
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,353
They'll see us on the CCTV.

617
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,729
Who cares?

618
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,358
Put me down. I'm heavy.

619
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:48,151
You feel as light as a feather to me.

620
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:52,864
Where should we go?

621
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,324
Las Vegas.

622
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,640
-Honey.
-Yes?

623
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:19,683
I've been waiting for this day.

624
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,275
Let's shower together.

625
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,238
It's okay. I'm your husband,
and you're my wife.

626
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:36,241
Still. We'll never shower together.

627
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:38,702
You have a great body. Flaunt it.

628
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,579
Who's going to appreciate it
if not your husband?

629
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,706
-It doesn't matter.
-What do you mean?

630
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,501
Will you listen to me
or do you need a good beating?

631
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,421
What is it?

632
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,301
I'm worried.

633
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,636
About what? I'll solve it for you.

634
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,055
It's not something you can solve.

635
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,474
Is it about Ji-a?

636
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,476
We're done with that.

637
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:12,319
Tell me while you're in my arms
whether it's good or bad news,

638
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,201
-I'm embarrassed.
-About what?

639
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:23,872
I'm pregnant. It was after that night.

640
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:29,628
Is this a joke?

641
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:40,889
How long has it been?

642
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,307
It's been three months now.

643
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:45,644
What do you want as a gift?
Just say the word, Cutie.

644
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,562
-The stars.
-The stars?

645
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:53,944
Come back here.

646
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,363
After I get the stars.

647
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,324
Come here.

648
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,042
How are you always so great?

649
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,503
Hold on. Maybe it was me.

650
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,297
It's me, right?

651
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,343
I should tell Dad.

652
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,971
You're going to tell him?

653
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:21,972
Yes.

654
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,433
-What's wrong with you?
-He'll love it more than me.

655
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,395
What's wrong?

656
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:31,189
Let's hurry and tell him
this good news. He'll love it.

657
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,858
What will that make us?

658
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:35,277
Well, I don't see what's wrong.

659
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,947
You better keep it to yourself
unless you want to humiliate us.

660
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,198
I can't hold it in.

661
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,659
Sew my lips shut.

662
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,163
It will be just him.
Help me be a good son to him.

663
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,290
Not today.

664
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,045
I want some noodles.

665
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:56,756
Right. Noodles are a must
on a wedding day.

666
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,174
Should we go out?

667
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,135
Is there any open this late?

668
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:01,553
We'll find a substitute.

669
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,482
I see.

670
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,947
She had a miscarriage.

671
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,831
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

672
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:35,921
Honey.

673
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,883
It's here. It'll get soggy.

674
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,600
Was your dress too tight today?

675
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:50,560
The baby is still tiny.

676
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:55,440
Don't lift a single finger. Just eat.

677
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,609
-Just for today?
-Until you have the baby.

678
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,235
Forever.

679
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,195
Until you die.

680
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,416
I love the smell of garlic.

681
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,378
Here.

682
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,970
-It's even tastier.
-Why?

683
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,179
Because it's from you.

684
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:28,431
I'll be your number one forever.

685
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:32,185
We should eat well
and live a long and healthy life.

686
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,396
What about its nickname?

687
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:38,692
I haven't thought of one yet.
I was too occupied.

688
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,861
Are you sure you're all right?
We even went sledding.

689
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,822
I have a healthy womb.

690
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:47,075
I got a checkup last week.
The baby is doing well.

691
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,618
Maybe it's thanks to my mom.

692
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:52,038
You should have some vegetables too.

693
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,462
What about Dangdang?

694
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:00,588
As in "confidence"?

695
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,633
-I like it.
-Dangdang…

696
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:06,845
Grow up healthy, Dangdang.

697
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:12,058
I don't care if you're a boy or a girl.
I'll be grateful either way.

698
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,979
All right. Have a sip
of this vitamin drink.

699
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,778
I'm being pampered thanks to Dangdang.

700
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,780
I'll pamper you for the rest of your life.

701
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,575
I'm truly happy.

702
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:31,494
I can't express it in words.

703
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:37,751
We can have another baby.

704
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,336
I don't want to.

705
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,048
It's useless.
I'm the only one who'll suffer.

706
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:47,761
Where are you going?

707
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,971
To buy some food.

708
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,765
They only sell snacks here.

709
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,224
I should watch what I eat.

710
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,908
What will you be tonight? A wolf? A sheep?

711
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:16,247
A wolf disguised as a sheep.

712
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,335
Don't worry. I'll be patient.

713
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,962
When is your due date?

714
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:23,922
Aren't you sleepy?

715
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:27,133
No, I'm not. It's comfortable and nice.

716
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,302
Will you remarry?

717
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,387
What do you mean?

718
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:33,306
If I die first.

719
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,767
Usually, the husband dies first.

720
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:39,270
We'll probably die around the same time.

721
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:43,316
I'll feed you everything that's healthy
and keep you around for a long time.

722
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:45,944
Let's just say that I died first.

723
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:47,695
Isn't it obvious? Of course, I will.

724
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,781
What do you mean?
You should remain a widow.

725
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:50,949
You'll wake up Ji-a.

726
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:55,161
Let me ask you again.
Will you remarry or not?

727
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,705
What about you? Will you remarry or not?

728
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:58,623
I won't.

729
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:02,669
-Even if the world falls apart?
-Even if the universe explodes.

730
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:30,155
Make sure you memorize them tonight
so we can move on tomorrow.

731
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,114
Okay.

732
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,700
Say, "Yes, ma'am." She's our teacher.

733
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,577
Yes, ma'am.

734
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,204
Ask your mom to pay you.

735
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,998
-How much?
-As much as you deserve.

736
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:41,416
Did you hear that?

737
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,169
Can I pay you with snacks?

738
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:45,211
Of course not.

739
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,301
Gosh, wheat pancakes. It's been a while.

740
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,386
It's not much but have some.

741
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,306
-It's surprisingly tasty.
-It's addictive

742
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:57,515
Do you want some cake?

743
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,683
No, thank you.

744
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:05,607
It's so chewy.
Our mom's wheat pancakes are the best.

745
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,240
-Have some.
-I had some while making them.

746
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,992
What are you guys eating without me?

747
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:19,537
I didn't offer you any
since it's flour-based.

748
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:24,042
It's bland. It's not seasoned.

749
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:27,504
It's much tastier if you use your hands.

750
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:34,844
Goodness, Father.
You know how to eat them.

751
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:38,139
My late mom used to make these for us.

752
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,066
It tasted just like this.
Even the texture.

753
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:51,611
I tried to mimic her but failed.

754
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:53,947
I finally got to have some.

755
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,492
What's your secret?

756
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:58,910
It's all in the hands.

757
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:02,664
You have to try it a couple of times
to get the hang of it.

758
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,625
My mom added some guacamole to it.

759
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,919
That's even tastier and full of nutrition.

760
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:10,338
You must miss her
since it's her first time away.

761
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,340
I'm not alone, so it's okay.

762
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,425
I have Hyang-gi

763
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,553
and my little cousin.

764
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,893
Do you think she had a miscarriage

765
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:27,105
because of Song Yuan?

766
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,190
Because we kicked her out?

767
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,775
That thought crossed my mind too.

768
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:31,818
What if that's true?

769
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:35,071
Should we summon her back or something?

770
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,282
How exactly can we do that?

771
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:40,034
Will she possess Hye-ryung again
if we ask her to?

772
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:43,246
-Should I remove the talisman?
-It doesn't matter.

773
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:46,207
I wouldn't come back if I was her.
I'd be offended.

774
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:49,502
I wonder if she has truly moved on.

775
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,087
This was five weeks.

776
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,131
This was last week.

777
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,258
Where's the womb?

778
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:56,926
Here.

779
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,013
This was ten weeks.

780
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,098
Doesn't it grow so fast?

781
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:04,767
Dangdang.

782
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:08,271
-Can it not hear me yet?
-Only after five months.

783
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:14,402
I'm proud of myself
and I love you so much.

784
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:19,949
Dad needs to know.
It'll help lessen his grief.

785
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:24,329
Okay. You can tell him
once we see him tomorrow.

786
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,172
I'll do my best.

787
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:35,340
Me too.

788
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:39,218
Do you think Father is asleep?

789
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,305
No. He goes to bed past midnight.

790
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:43,681
Why do you ask?

791
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:45,600
No reason. I'm just worried about him.

792
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:49,687
What a caring girl you are.

793
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:53,900
I'm not a girl.

794
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,861
When September comes, you'll give birth.

795
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,321
I might die if I wait too long.

796
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,450
-Don't you dare cheat on me.
-I will never do such a thing.

797
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,037
I've had my fun.

798
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,832
I'm happy
just chatting with you like this.

799
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,334
I'm grateful.

800
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:12,585
You're grateful?

801
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,420
Yes.

802
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:16,714
Call Father.

803
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,844
I think I'll be too embarrassed
to tell him face to face.

804
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,180
Okey dokey.

805
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,849
Why are you talking like that?

806
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,267
Today…

807
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,729
Dong-ma got married.

808
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:34,941
If you were here,

809
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,945
you may have been very sad.

810
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:43,241
But what can we do?

811
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,625
INCOMING CALL
DONG-MA

812
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,671
-Hello?
-What were you up to?

813
01:01:56,754 --> 01:02:00,425
I received some work reports
and had a late-night snack.

814
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:01,884
Hold on.

815
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:05,179
Hello, Father.
I'm sorry for calling so late.

816
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:09,392
Don't be. I was thinking of you guys.

817
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:10,560
I see.

818
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:16,023
Father, there's something Dong-ma
would like to tell you. One minute.

819
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:16,983
Okay.

820
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:19,861
Dad, I have
an important announcement to make.

821
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,530
You'll be a grandpa in September.

822
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,616
What do you mean? September?

823
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,453
Yes. And the baby's nickname is Dangdang.

824
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:29,829
A baby?

825
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,080
Yes.

826
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,543
-Hello?
-You're joking, right?

827
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:38,004
No one would ever
joke about something like this.

828
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,006
I just found out too.

829
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,178
Dangdang?

830
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:47,096
Yes. That's the nickname.

831
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:50,266
September, was it?

832
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:53,853
Yes. But please don't tell
the rest of the family for now.

833
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,273
She's embarrassed,
and Ji-a is going through puberty.

834
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:59,442
All right. Let me speak to her.

835
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:04,113
-Hello?
-Thank you.

836
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,241
I should have been
the one to give you two a gift.

837
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,828
But I got a huge one instead.

838
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:14,415
We're so thankful
that you're happy for us.

839
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:15,708
I'm elated.

840
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,797
-Always be careful from now on.
-I will.

841
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,382
You must be exhausted.
Go to bed. For your baby's sake.

842
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:27,512
Okay. You should go to bed soon too.

843
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,555
You need to take care of yourself more.

844
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:32,058
Yes, I should
if I want to hold my grandchild.

845
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:33,267
Exactly.

846
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,685
Is there anything you want?

847
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:37,104
I've already received so much.

848
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,648
Still, give it some thought.

849
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:39,774
I will.

850
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:41,317
Goodbye.

851
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,293
Did you not brew coffee?

852
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,003
I don't smell anything.

853
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,177
Why are you crying?

854
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:10,555
-Did you two fight again?
-I'm so upset.

855
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:18,312
-What is it this time?
-The breakfast I made is all gone.

856
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,109
-Did she eat it all?
-She must've taken it somewhere.

857
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:25,111
She won't pick up her phone.

858
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:28,531
I had marinated bulgogi
and maeuntang that I just needed to boil.

859
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:31,909
I painstakingly made
acorn jelly out of acorn flour

860
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:35,037
after looking up
the recipe online, but it's all gone.

861
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:38,207
I can't take this anymore.
She just won't stop.

862
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:58,769
-Goodness.
-Hello.

863
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,730
I was just going to leave them here.

864
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:02,982
I guess it's fate.

865
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,483
What did you bring this time?

866
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:05,818
Just a few side dishes.

867
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:10,031
Careful with your back.

868
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:12,783
I don't mind skipping a meal.

869
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:17,121
You're going to work out.
You should have some toast.

870
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,334
Let's get married in the fall.

871
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,590
Hang in there until then.

872
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:31,510
We should do everything we can
if we want to marry without any worries.

873
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:34,388
When in fall exactly?

874
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:36,182
September or October. Whenever.

875
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:40,561
We'll try for a baby later down the line.

876
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,982
Don't expect anything from her
since she's sick.

877
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:48,027
If you can't take it anymore, vent to me.

878
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,820
I'll be all ears anytime you need it.

879
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:07,338
The persimmons melted
just the right amount.

880
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:12,385
They say persimmons lead to constipation,
but that's not always the case.

881
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,220
That's only when they're not ripe.

882
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:20,393
You look worse than the last time we met.

883
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:21,978
You don't have one, do you?

884
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:25,189
A boyfriend. Someone you love.

885
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,066
No.

886
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:30,069
They say everything
is meaningless once you die.

887
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,029
You should love while you still can.

888
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:35,032
If not,
you'll be crying over spilled milk.

889
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:37,326
I'm in love with musicals.

890
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:40,121
Look at you.
That's such a naive thing to say.

891
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:41,455
You should fall in love

892
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:45,668
and get married
while you're still beautiful and young.

893
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:49,714
You can't do musicals forever.

894
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,632
Well, I guess you can.

895
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:53,801
Of course you can.

896
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:56,387
For now, people think you're still single

897
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,639
since you're competent and busy with work.

898
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:02,810
But they won't think that way
when you're 70 or 80.

899
01:07:02,893 --> 01:07:05,229
You'll be too old then,
both your mind and your body.

900
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:08,858
It's better to die
a divorcée than a spinster.

901
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:10,943
You know they turn into ghosts, right?

902
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,319
Right.

903
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:16,949
The best thing I ever did in life
was getting married.

904
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:20,453
My husband passed away last year,

905
01:07:21,662 --> 01:07:23,789
but I'm still able to stay cheerful

906
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:27,334
thanks to the love he had given me.

907
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,297
I know someone

908
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:35,092
who'd be perfect for you.

909
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:36,969
Are you interested?

910
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:38,471
Trust me on this.

911
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,438
Does Ms. Choi not come on the weekends?

912
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:51,692
No, ma'am.
And the rest of us work in shifts.

913
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:07,852
What did I ever do to tire you?

914
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:09,728
What do you think you're doing?

915
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,063
Stop putting on an act.

916
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:15,359
I know a reporter, and she said
that Dong-ma married a divorcée.

917
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:17,945
Father upset you, didn't he?

918
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:19,947
I mean, he only cares for Ms. Sa.

919
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:21,323
It's because she's younger.

920
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:22,491
What a mean brat.

921
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,827
She's a divorcée,
and from a regular family.

922
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:27,580
-This house is full of old ladies now.
-I'm going to turn the tables.

923
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,457
Let's all do this together, okay?

924
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,084
Ms. Choi, let's do this.

925
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:34,628
Can I get a pregnancy test kit?

926
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,922
I'll get married too for revenge.

927
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:41,093
-Mother.
-Yes?

928
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:44,096
It feels as if
something's going to go wrong.

929
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:56,108
