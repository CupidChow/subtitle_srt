1
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,850
I saw everything.

2
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,061
Don't make any excuses.

3
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,938
I saw you two hugging.

4
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,399
What is she to you?

5
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,361
Did you admit her to your hospital

6
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,489
so you can make out with her whenever?

7
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,117
Bring her here. I want to see her.

8
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,120
Should I go to her?

9
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,747
-Honey--
-You gave her the puffer jacket.

10
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,167
-Are you even human?
-I'm sorry.

11
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,251
You're sorry?

12
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,672
You've deceived and cheated on your wife.

13
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,675
-Do you think "sorry" will cut it?
-I don't know what to say.

14
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,053
What could I say?
I won't justify my actions.

15
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,806
I know I was wrong.

16
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,477
I'll do exactly as you say.

17
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:44,687
I want a divorce.

18
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,899
If that's what you want.

19
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,656
EPISODE 9

20
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,083
What's her temperature?

21
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,461
It's slightly low. 35.4°C.

22
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,561
She has high blood pressure. 150 over 90.

23
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,443
I heard the director's wife
is hospitalized.

24
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,571
Yes. You shouldn't talk right now.

25
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,215
Okay. Dr. Shin ordered porridge
for you to have for breakfast.

26
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,301
-I see.
-Would you like some?

27
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,973
Yes. Which room is his wife in?

28
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,101
-I'd like to say hi.
-VIP room one.

29
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,020
Is she very ill?

30
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,397
Once she wakes up, she'll be okay.

31
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,274
She was in shock because of her mother.

32
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,119
Do you remember anything? You fainted.

33
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,211
Mom…

34
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,005
Your mother?

35
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,386
She's not doing too well.

36
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,518
I know you'll be shocked to hear this,

37
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,479
but you need to know.

38
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,982
CANCER: TUMOR RESULTING FROM
DIVISION OF ABNORMAL CELLS

39
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,443
I had her get a CT scan.

40
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,864
It has spread throughout her entire body.
Surgery won't help.

41
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,116
It won't be easy even if we do.

42
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,754
I think you should prepare yourself
for what comes next.

43
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,179
Don't do that. That won't help.

44
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,850
Use a wheelchair or I'll carry you.

45
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,557
Hello.

46
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,040
Mother.

47
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,254
Talk to her.
She might respond to your voice.

48
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,423
Mom…

49
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,676
Mom…

50
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,451
I should take good care of my health

51
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,787
and enjoy life like the others do

52
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,706
if I don't want to die in vain.

53
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,546
I know you're in shock,
but you need to make a decision.

54
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,592
I'll send her to a university hospital
if you want.

55
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,012
Since she's not too old,
they may suggest surgery

56
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,597
although it'll be useless.

57
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,265
Did you know?

58
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,060
I looked her up,

59
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,646
and she signed a DNR order.

60
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:42,110
So? Should I send her there
so you won't regret it later on?

61
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,073
It's time to make your rounds.

62
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,199
I'm coming.

63
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,370
Rest up. I'll come back.

64
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,557
-Is Mom not home yet?
-No.

65
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,600
When will Grandma be discharged?

66
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,562
She needs to be hospitalized for now.

67
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,731
Will we not be able to spend
the Lunar New Year's together?

68
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,649
Maybe.

69
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:26,362
Spending time together is important,
but her health matters more.

70
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,867
Grandpa appeared in my dreams last night.

71
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,871
-What did he say to you?
-Nothing.

72
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,081
He just looked at me.

73
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,586
You should wash up.
Would you like some abalone porridge?

74
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,171
Sure.

75
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,969
Stop appearing in our dreams
and just leave.

76
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,679
You're unbelievable.

77
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:56,767
You still refuse to let go
even after death.

78
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,239
Yes. How's Pi-young?

79
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,367
She's awake but is depressed.

80
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:17,580
Can you bring Ji-a here?
Maybe seeing her will help.

81
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,916
Okay. What about her mother?

82
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,126
-We need to brace ourselves.
-That bad?

83
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,045
The cancer has spread all over her body.

84
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:27,715
Oh my. Was she trying to
get herself killed?

85
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,759
She should have told her family.

86
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,594
I think that's why she flew here.

87
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,055
We'll be there after breakfast.
I made some porridge.

88
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:37,975
Okay.

89
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,812
She and her daughter
are just unbelievable.

90
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,231
Like mother, like daughter.

91
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,484
She should have let Pi-young
take care of her.

92
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,070
How could she leave her daughter
behind like that?

93
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,948
Even someone as strong as Pi-young
won't be able to endure it.

94
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,284
Have some breakfast.

95
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,704
Your dad wants to see us.

96
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,122
-Me too?
-Yes.

97
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,207
Let's buy flowers.

98
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,000
Okay.

99
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,599
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

100
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,187
Mr. Seo gave me allowance money.

101
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,148
And you accepted it?

102
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,360
I thanked him first.

103
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,781
What did he say?
What did you two talk about?

104
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,366
U-ram, do you like baseball?

105
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,326
-Yes.
-What about soccer?

106
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,038
I like watching it.
It's too tiring to play.

107
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,165
Would you like some allowance money?

108
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,463
-What will you do with it?
-Can I treat my friends?

109
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,716
-Sure.
-I'll have to think about it.

110
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,098
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

111
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,081
-Let's go see your grandma's sister first.
-Okay.

112
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,089
I heard you got some sleep.

113
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,093
-I did.
-We don't have enough beds here,

114
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,262
so we'll move you to
Sin Seocho Jeil Hospital.

115
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,139
They're an affiliated hospital.

116
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,933
-I see.
-You have severe gastritis.

117
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,062
Stay away from stimulants,
especially caffeine,

118
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,190
carbonated drinks,
and flour-based foods for the time being.

119
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,650
Okay.

120
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,029
Right. If you get hospitalized again,

121
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,822
we'll contact your parents in the US.

122
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,283
So, do your best to recuperate.

123
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,289
Dad.

124
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,792
Hey.

125
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,878
-Ms. Mo must be getting some tests done.
-She's getting an MRI.

126
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,590
-Is that for your mom?
-Yes.

127
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,429
She's very worried about your grandma

128
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,972
and is rather feeling down.

129
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,183
Cheer her up for me, my princess.

130
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,397
Mom.

131
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,783
She already looks so haggard.

132
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,663
-Have some abalone porridge.
-And fruits.

133
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,581
Did you visit your grandma?

134
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,252
Did you…

135
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:53,587
Honey.

136
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,761
Mom, don't cry.

137
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,265
Say Ji-a's name or mine.

138
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,979
Can you not speak?

139
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:11,897
Mom.

140
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,405
We'll talk later.

141
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,866
Can you not speak?

142
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,292
Mom, are you not coming home today?

143
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,298
What's wrong?

144
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,646
Could it be mutism?

145
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,691
She must have been badly shocked.

146
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,902
She couldn't take good care of her.

147
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,820
She thought Ms. Mo was healthy.

148
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:04,116
She should have told her daughter herself.
After all, she's her mother.

149
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,037
Look at what she's done.
Pi-young can't even speak.

150
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:09,872
What should we do?

151
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,416
She has to overcome the shock.

152
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,628
When? What if her mother passes away?

153
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,547
Go home. Don't worry about me.

154
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,426
I need to stay here and take care
of your grandma for the time being.

155
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,764
Can't you just visit her from home?
Won't that be more comfortable?

156
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,977
Would you like some porridge or fruits?

157
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,527
You need to eat

158
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,320
if you want to take care of her.

159
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,744
You should go home.

160
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:52,414
-I want to stay with you.
-We can always visit her again.

161
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,133
Have one bite. Then I'll go.

162
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,135
Yes. You are such a good daughter.

163
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,688
Daughters are the most considerate.

164
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,254
You might beat me next year.

165
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,256
You'll be practicing too.

166
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,383
Come have some tteokguk with us
for the Lunar New Year.

167
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,719
You don't have to bow to them.

168
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,971
No, thanks.

169
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,932
It's not like you to hold a grudge
against your family.

170
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,267
I don't have a grudge.

171
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,312
I'll just end up making things awkward.

172
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,646
That's what you think.

173
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,190
Goodness, I thought you were
at the hospital.

174
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,693
I'm fatigued.

175
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,613
How is she doing?

176
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,158
They'll let me know
if something happens to her.

177
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,412
By the way,
aren't you working nine to six?

178
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,040
Shouldn't you come to work at 9 a.m.
and leave at 6 p.m.?

179
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,584
I pretty much live here.
I never really clock out.

180
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,086
Still, shouldn't you have come
an hour earlier?

181
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,757
You shouldn't slack off
just because your employer isn't here.

182
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,010
The house is empty,
and there's nothing to do.

183
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,554
Of course, there is.
You could clean the windowsills

184
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,890
or take off and wash
all the mosquito screens.

185
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,727
The dishes in the top cupboards
are full of dust.

186
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,981
Look closely at the chandelier.
It's dusty as well.

187
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:49,406
Gosh, I'm not in the mood for rice.
I'd like some handmade kalguksu for lunch.

188
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,452
-We have pre-made noodles.
-I want handmade ones.

189
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,871
I don't want store-bought noodles.

190
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,999
The texture is different.
Handmade noodles are more chewy.

191
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,836
Why aren't you answering me?

192
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,921
Okay.

193
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,302
VIP ROOM

194
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,557
-Are you leaving now?
-Yes.

195
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,643
Go to the ER and take the ambulance.

196
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,395
I can just take a taxi.

197
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,188
You can't. It's Dr. Shin's orders.

198
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,190
Okay.

199
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,539
SA **-****

200
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,295
Book a room at Busan Hotel.

201
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,590
Let's spend the Lunar New Year's there.

202
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,052
Your parents won't feel comfortable
seeing me,

203
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,721
and I'm still hurt by what they did.

204
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:39,141
-They're probably fully booked by now.
-I know you have connections.

205
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,519
-Should I do it?
-No, I will.

206
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,521
Forget everything and start fresh.

207
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:48,609
Don't forget
that this is your last chance.

208
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,533
-Hello, Ms. Lee.
-What's going on?

209
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,994
-What do you mean?
-The director called.

210
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,704
Lee Jeong-gyun will be taking over

211
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,832
for Pi-young starting tomorrow
because she's sick.

212
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,293
-Goodness.
-And her phone's off.

213
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,046
-She was fine yesterday.
-Exactly.

214
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,216
Tell U-ram to ask Ji-a about her.

215
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,300
I'll do that.

216
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,262
Ji-a's phone is off too.

217
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:21,433
If it's that serious, don't you think
she would be at the hospital?

218
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,560
-Sin Central Medical Center.
-You're right.

219
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,355
-Do you want to go there together?
-Are you free today?

220
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,566
Yes. I'm home. I'm taking the day off.

221
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,402
I'll go alone.
You haven't had a day off in a while.

222
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,113
That's not right.

223
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,157
She moved to her mother's room.

224
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,203
Ms. Hwang Eun-su is at the ER.

225
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,709
I'm going to get some fresh air.

226
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,134
Should we ask a receptionist where she is?

227
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,387
Do you know Dr. Shin's number?

228
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,304
I don't.

229
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,684
Hello.

230
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,061
Oh, hello.

231
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,688
The director called.

232
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,899
What happened to Pi-young?
Her phone's off too.

233
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,151
Let's go to my office.

234
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,319
Has she been hospitalized?

235
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,156
-Her mother collapsed yesterday.
-My goodness.

236
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,242
The CT scan showed that
cancer had spread throughout her body.

237
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,201
Oh, dear.

238
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,537
She kept all of us in the dark,
so we had no idea.

239
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,748
She never let on that she was sick.
And after finding out…

240
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,837
my wife is unable to speak
due to the shock.

241
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,381
-Oh, no.
-That's what happened.

242
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,717
You must be worried sick.

243
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,512
-What about Ji-a?
-She visited Pi-young this morning

244
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,681
and went home crying.

245
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,225
I'll tell them you visited.

246
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,312
There's no point in visiting
since she can't talk.

247
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:53,275
Life is full of ups and downs.

248
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:58,030
You're right.
I've only heard about mutism.

249
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,575
I can't even imagine her
not being able to speak.

250
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:05,078
She must be frustrated and anxious.

251
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,914
There's nothing we can do.

252
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,790
Shouldn't we tell Mr. Seo?

253
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,334
I'm sure the director told him.

254
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,503
Then he would have called us
out of curiosity.

255
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,464
He's not the chatty type to begin with.

256
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:20,677
Ms. Sa isn't just feeling ill. She's mute.
He might call her because he doesn't know.

257
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,554
Then call him.

258
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,399
He's not picking up.

259
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,154
By the way, Ms. Sa is a strong woman.

260
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,365
How could she have lost
the ability to speak?

261
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,825
-Beats me.
-It's not like her.

262
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,078
She thought her mother was healthy.

263
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,914
Hearing that her mother has cancer

264
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:53,752
must have made her feel guilty
for not taking better care of her.

265
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,879
I understand the shock she's in,

266
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:59,967
but have you ever heard of anyone losing
the ability to speak solely due to guilt?

267
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,525
U-ram's mom and Hye-ryung visited.

268
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,194
They're worried sick about you.

269
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,409
You shouldn't just sit here.
Let's go to my office.

270
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,914
Please try to stay strong for Ji-a and me.

271
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,959
You need to be strong
especially at times like this.

272
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,256
I know it's tough,

273
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,384
but we can't do anything
about life and death.

274
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,095
Seeing you like this befuddles me.

275
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,513
I don't know what to do.

276
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,976
They say surgeons struggle
to operate on their family members.

277
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,527
Do you resent me?

278
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,114
Blaming yourself won't solve anything.

279
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,784
It's not going to cure her.

280
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,414
-Doctor, your outpatients are here.
-Coming.

281
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,709
I've filled them in on what's going on.

282
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,629
You should send them a text later.

283
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:39,816
The stars twinkle in the night sky

284
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:45,030
A cool breeze blows

285
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:49,117
The soft moonlight shines down

286
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:54,247
Nighttime walks bring me happiness

287
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:58,085
I smell your scent

288
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,922
Sing with confidence. Okay?

289
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,548
Let's do it again.

290
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:09,638
The soft moonlight shines down

291
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:14,643
Nighttime walks bring me happiness

292
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:19,523
I smell your scent

293
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:24,611
My heart is like the moonlight

294
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,238
That was fantastic.

295
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:27,948
What?

296
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,325
It's Song Won.

297
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,787
-Hello?
-Hi, are you busy?

298
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,038
No, I'm not.

299
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,334
A Mi was hospitalized.

300
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,003
She had been quiet lately,
so I texted her.

301
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,798
-Oh, no. Where is she?
-Sin Seocho Jeil Hospital.

302
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,216
I should visit.

303
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,301
I'm not sure if I should.

304
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,595
You shouldn't go.

305
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,139
I'll visit her and let you know.

306
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,975
It must be serious,
seeing how she's been hospitalized.

307
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:58,436
She said she had trouble sleeping
and was exhausted.

308
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,647
Okay.

309
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,361
Do you want to go to the hospital with me?
I don't want to go alone.

310
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,238
-Who's hospitalized?
-One of the trios.

311
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,158
The friends you went to Jeju Island with?

312
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,827
The new model seems to be quite popular.

313
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,664
It is. There's a four-month waiting list
even if you purchase it now.

314
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,416
Are you switching cars already?

315
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,251
I just wanted to see.

316
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,172
She's our new model.

317
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,756
She goes to our equestrian club.

318
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,466
Do you ride horses?

319
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,218
Yes.

320
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,680
No wonder you look phenomenal.
You're so fit.

321
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,015
She was a model.

322
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:38,101
Make sure to get an autograph.
She's a rising star.

323
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,144
Get me one, too.

324
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,521
She must be busy.
I don't see her often these days.

325
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,112
Let me.

326
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,841
Dr. Shin told me to bring
all her medications.

327
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,052
What if her family's here?

328
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:16,139
They're in the US.
And we're her only close friends.

329
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,683
Then we ought to visit her.
I bet it'd be lonely.

330
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,895
Especially if you're sick. You won't
know unless you've experienced it.

331
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:25,232
-But you have me now.
-Then should I get sick?

332
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:28,902
Don't say such things.
Nothing good comes from getting sick.

333
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,030
Will you make porridge for me
if I have no appetite?

334
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:32,989
Of course.

335
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,617
I like vegetable porridge.

336
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,203
It's actually harder to make
than abalone porridge.

337
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,163
I can look it up online.

338
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,125
-What about you?
-I don't like porridge.

339
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,836
I won't be an inconvenience
even if I get sick.

340
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,798
GET BETTER SOON
NAM GA-BIN

341
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,175
Maybe we should have
brought her dinner too.

342
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,386
We can ask her then get some nearby.

343
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,403
I'm going to go home.
I need to bring some clothes for us.

344
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,158
Text me if you need anything
other than underwear.

345
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,172
Ga-bin.

346
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,010
You should have told me.

347
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,804
If it wasn't for Won,
I wouldn't have known.

348
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:40,348
I'm not sick. I just overexerted myself.

349
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,768
What happened?

350
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,770
I got hurt when I fainted.

351
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,022
You fainted?

352
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,067
Right. I told you about him.

353
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,362
Nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

354
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,656
Me too. Thank you for coming.

355
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,908
You look haggard.

356
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,785
Are you sure you weren't dieting?

357
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,580
Sit down.

358
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,667
I'm sorry. There's nothing in the fridge.

359
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,627
-I'll go buy something.
-Okay.

360
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,547
That's not what I meant.
I don't have anything to offer you.

361
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,257
Is there anything you're craving?

362
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,926
Nothing. I can only have porridge
due to gastritis.

363
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,305
-You two can chat.
-Okay.

364
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,188
I can tell he's a total gentleman.

365
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:32,067
-He has a nice voice, right?
-Yes. You guys look good together.

366
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,986
-Did you pick your wedding dress?
-Yes.

367
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,739
But I'm having second thoughts.

368
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:42,619
WARD 16

369
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,943
She only had bits of food
that are easy on the stomach such as fish

370
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:20,198
just so she could take her medication.
She took so many pills.

371
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,992
I think they were all painkillers.

372
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:26,579
I even told her that she was filling
her stomach with pills.

373
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:30,917
I couldn't drag her to the hospital
since I wasn't a family member.

374
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,213
She also said there was no point
in getting hospitalized.

375
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,049
What should we do?

376
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,719
It seemed like
she was waiting for your call.

377
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,305
She'd get up right away
whenever the bell rang

378
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,849
even when she was sleeping.

379
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,311
She's needed my help to get around
since last month.

380
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,731
She was too weak and dizzy

381
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,775
and couldn't wash herself.

382
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,798
Did your friends visit?

383
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,301
Ga-bin came.

384
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,054
It's porridge.
Do you want it later or now?

385
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,806
I went all the way to Gangnam Hotel.

386
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,852
Have it while it's still warm.

387
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,146
My blood sugar level…

388
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,735
Sa-hyeon and Hye-ryung are going
to Busan for the Lunar New Year's.

389
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:39,986
What for?

390
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,865
-Why?
-They're staying at a hotel for our sake.

391
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,201
Just relaxing at a hotel?

392
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,246
It sounded like Hye-ryung decided
to do that for our sake.

393
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:54,292
She said it's because we'd be
uncomfortable seeing her,

394
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,753
but this only means
she'll do whatever she wants.

395
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,881
She doesn't care about us
or her duties as our daughter-in-law.

396
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,135
She's using Sa-hyeon's affair
as her excuse.

397
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:08,515
That's good then.
Let's tell Won to come visit.

398
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:11,351
She'd feel awkward
around our other son's family.

399
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,812
And what will we tell their kids?

400
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,898
Kids these days know everything.

401
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,527
-Thanks to television and the internet.
-Maybe next holiday.

402
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,988
Then will this house be teeming
with family members during Chuseok?

403
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,866
And a baby, too. Hold on.

404
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,954
What if Hye-ryung gets pregnant as well?

405
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,210
What's on your mind?

406
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:42,173
-Is A Mi seeing someone?
-Are you planning to set her up?

407
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,635
-She does.
-Who is it?

408
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:47,428
That's private.

409
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,181
I guess it's not someone her age.

410
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,853
-How did you know?
-If it was, you would have told me.

411
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,022
I don't want to
gossip about her or Song Won.

412
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,900
It's really none of my business.

413
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,610
Are they like us?

414
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,571
Yes.

415
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,410
-Don't bring it up.
-Of course not.

416
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,335
I already feel rejuvenated.

417
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:24,549
Have some fruit. Ga-bin bought them.

418
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,398
I won't be coming here again.

419
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,234
The employees will suspect us.

420
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,361
You understand, right?

421
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:49,908
-I want to leave the day after tomorrow.
-You'll be alone during the holidays.

422
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,285
I have to stay here for my mother-in-law.

423
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,121
-I could go to Won's place.
-Does she know about me?

424
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,041
She saw you on the plane.

425
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,293
Does she know the details?

426
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:04,964
Just roughly. Actually,
they're in a similar situation too.

427
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,174
Nam Ga-bin too?

428
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,968
There was no news online,

429
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,850
but her boyfriend got divorced.
They'll be getting married next month.

430
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:18,353
I envy them.

431
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,024
-Hello?
-Are you still at work?

432
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,359
Dinner's ready.

433
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,027
-I'll be there soon.
-Okay.

434
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,239
-I should go.
-Your stepmom, your first love?

435
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,532
Don't say that.

436
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,870
I may not be able to call you that often,
given the situation.

437
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,682
Hello.

438
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,226
-Are you going to Napoli?
-Yes.

439
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,352
Goodbye.

440
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:09,195
-Hello?
-I got into a car accident nearby.

441
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,864
Goodness. Are you okay?

442
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,241
I am.

443
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,744
Look at him.
He's pretending to be injured.

444
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,579
You never know.

445
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,290
Go talk with him first. He's waiting.

446
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,751
-I made the reservation under my name.
-Okay.

447
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,507
Reservation for Ms. Park Chang-hui…

448
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,551
-This way, please.
-Okay.

449
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,393
-Are you here because of Ms. Park?
-Yes.

450
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,984
-Let me take your jacket.
-Okay.

451
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,865
Are you okay with a course meal?
Chang-hui told us to go ahead and eat.

452
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,493
How about ordering just single dishes
since it's dinner?

453
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,786
Sure.

454
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,206
One truffle cream pasta, please.

455
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,835
-I'll have the Spaghetti alle vongole.
-How about a superfood salad?

456
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,670
Sure. I like veggies.

457
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,881
-Any drinks or wine?
-No, thank you.

458
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,632
May I get carbonated water instead?

459
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,259
Sure.

460
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,764
I'm sorry. I didn't have
time to get changed

461
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,475
after working out.

462
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:24,979
-It's fine. This isn't a fancy restaurant.
-I don't speak a lick of Chinese.

463
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,983
Most Koreans are.
Why do you want to learn Chinese?

464
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:33,488
To prevent dementia.
I heard learning a new language helps.

465
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:38,242
I'm just kidding.
Chang-hui is a close friend of mine.

466
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,577
I see.

467
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:44,499
It's not easy to learn their characters
and pronunciations.

468
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,709
I know I'm too old,
but it'll be as a hobby.

469
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:50,213
-When is good for you?
-Twice a week in the evening.

470
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,090
-During the weekdays?
-Yes.

471
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:57,595
May I recommend a friend of mine instead?

472
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:02,225
As you can see, I'm with child.

473
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,851
Evening classes will be difficult.

474
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,478
I see. Sure.

475
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:10,108
I apologize. Chang-hui didn't tell me
the details. She just told me to come.

476
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,110
I've wasted your time.

477
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,821
It's okay. I haven't had dinner anyway.

478
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,448
You don't mind, do you?

479
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,533
No.

480
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,160
-Make sure to brush your teeth well.
-Okay.

481
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,708
You didn't tell her colleagues
that she became mute, did you?

482
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:32,338
-Of course not.
-There's something I just don't get.

483
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,133
Pi-young is a strong and smart woman.

484
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:39,720
So how could she lose the ability to speak
after hearing about her mother?

485
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:43,766
To be honest, they weren't on good terms.

486
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,603
Exactly. Out of sight, out of mind.

487
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,398
She left for the Philippines
as soon as you got married.

488
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,276
I doubt they were that close
to begin with.

489
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,154
Pi-young must blame herself
for not being a good daughter.

490
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,906
Ms. Mo wasn't forced to go abroad.

491
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,993
She was just more concerned
about her sister who lived there alone.

492
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,370
She didn't go abroad
because she wanted to.

493
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,913
There must be more to this story.

494
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,748
Pi-young can tell you later.

495
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,710
-What is it?
-It's personal.

496
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:14,255
Did Ms. Mo cheat on her husband
when she was young?

497
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,217
Many daughters can't stand
to see such a thing happen.

498
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,971
That's not the issue.
I get that she lost her ability to speak,

499
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,766
but she won't look me in the eye
or let me make physical contact.

500
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,268
Really?

501
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,938
-I just don't get why.
-For some women,

502
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,067
when they are sensitive,
they don't want to be touched.

503
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,361
-It's too much, though.
-Let her be.

504
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,696
I have no choice anyway.

505
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,912
Ji-a cried several times
after returning from the hospital.

506
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,873
She must be shocked.
After all, it's her mom.

507
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,667
Imagine if you had to
say goodbye to your mom

508
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,085
because she was sick.

509
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,921
How would you feel?

510
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:00,218
-Don't say that.
-That's how she's feeling right now.

511
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:05,139
There's nothing we can do to help.

512
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,517
I just have to be by her side.

513
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:12,063
My heart breaks for her.
And I feel sorry for Grandma.

514
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,190
Consider this your second farewell

515
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,943
after saying goodbye to Grandpa.

516
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,740
Do I have to go through this?

517
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,576
They say,
"Those who meet will always part."

518
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,537
You're bound to bid farewell
to everyone you meet in life.

519
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:32,375
All the leaves on a tree fall eventually.

520
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,960
Same goes for flowers.

521
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,213
People are no different.

522
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,928
You must have worked
as an interpreter too.

523
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,054
Of course.

524
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,807
At times, interpreters need to eat

525
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,642
-with their clients.
-I see.

526
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,061
But I can barely eat during those times.

527
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,646
Nothing in life is easy.

528
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,606
Isn't your job fairly easy to do?

529
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,733
I guess so.

530
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,152
He's an engineer for a music radio show.

531
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:05,157
-You just do it as a hobby, don't you?
-Did Chang-su say that?

532
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,451
Which show is it?

533
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,162
Boo Hye-ryung's Love, Memories, and Music.

534
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,417
Many of my friends listen to it.
How is she?

535
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,544
She's the same. Nothing different.

536
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,005
You know what I mean. Her personality.

537
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,881
That has nothing to do with the job.

538
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,175
She just needs to lead the show well.

539
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,763
It seems like it's been a while
since you two met. You should catch up.

540
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:33,019
-I'll call you later.
-Okay. I had a nice time talking with you.

541
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,569
You should have said yes.

542
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,778
I don't have the time.

543
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,281
I didn't introduce you to him
just to get you a job.

544
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,410
He's the eldest son of SF Electronics.

545
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,832
-Is that so?
-Just say you'll do it.

546
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,584
Evening classes are even better.

547
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,462
You could easily develop feelings
for each other during class.

548
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:03,632
If it works out and you start dating,
you'd be hitting the jackpot.

549
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:07,136
A lot of things happened
while we were out of touch.

550
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,804
You're seeing someone.

551
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,854
No way. How?

552
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,986
I packed the underwear.

553
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,031
Ms. Mo isn't
in a critical state right now.

554
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,202
I wish you could just sleep here.

555
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,832
This will be a marathon.

556
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,336
-You need to take care of yourself.
-That's not right. Pi-young can't speak,

557
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,254
and Ms. Mo is still unconscious.

558
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,275
She's been transferred
to Sin Seocho Jeil Hospital.

559
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:49,655
Dr. Shin said we needed more beds
for critical patients.

560
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,367
Nurse, the IV came out.

561
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,461
-It was a gift.
-Michelle.

562
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:04,879
Coming.

563
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,507
My boyfriend gave it to me
so I could wear it on set.

564
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,771
You could catch a cold out here.

565
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,192
I had to make sure Ji-a was okay.

566
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,362
You need energy
to take care of your mother.

567
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,406
Try to eat something.

568
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,969
You're really breaking my heart.

569
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,556
I can endure everything else,

570
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,391
but I'm your husband.

571
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:08,817
There she is.

572
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,542
Lie down. I need to give you some albumin.

573
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,670
Later.

574
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:39,515
Ji-a and I feel the same way about you
as you do for your mother.

575
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:42,601
If you can't eat anything,
you should get an IV drip.

576
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,436
What if your health deteriorates too?

577
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,318
I know it's painful,

578
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,862
but your family is all you have.

579
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,156
We need to keep each other strong.

580
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,616
I'm your husband.

581
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,911
We have the closest bond.

582
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,603
Ms. Kim gives
quick and painless injections.

583
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,818
How are you feeling?

584
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,696
I'm feeling better after sleeping all day.

585
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,824
Seo-hyang.

586
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,660
Please open your eyes.

587
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:45,205
I flew all the way to Korea for you.

588
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,625
Pi-young, say something.

589
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:51,378
I heard they can still hear you. Right?

590
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,634
Don't just stare at her.

591
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:02,681
Call her name. Listen to me, will you?
Is this because of what I said yesterday?

592
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,601
May I have a word?

593
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,186
Okay.

594
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,982
-Really?
-Yes.

595
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,777
-What should we do?
-She needs time. Don't provoke her.

596
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,903
Okay.

597
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,656
Ms. Kim Eun-sil woke up.

598
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,074
Okay.

599
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,340
-Bye.
-Bye.

600
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,308
Why aren't you coming in?

601
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,784
I'll throw it away.

602
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,119
It's fine.

603
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:13,794
I know you like dried yellow corvina.
Someone gave it to me as a gift.

604
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:14,711
Take it back.

605
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,382
Wait. About Pi-young's husband…

606
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,302
I was right.

607
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,974
About what? Cheating on her?

608
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,935
You made me a laughingstock.

609
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,563
She checked, and it wasn't true.

610
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:35,691
Don't assume that all men are like you.

611
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:39,486
The woman he's seeing is
close to Nam Ga-bin.

612
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,407
It's a long story.

613
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,205
A MI
NO RESULTS

614
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,383
You can go home.

615
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:04,344
-Please come back in the morning.
-Okay.

616
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,014
She goes by the name "Sabina."

617
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,475
She shot a few commercials.

618
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,855
I can't believe it.

619
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,691
He's such a devoted husband.

620
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,152
He always treated her well.

621
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:25,741
I saw them together,
and Ga-bin confirmed it.

622
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:29,119
It's up to you whether to tell her or not.

623
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,248
-It may just be a fling.
-Is she Korean-American?

624
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:40,214
She's just like Ga-bin.
Birds of a feather flock together.

625
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,010
-Why was Hyang-gi at our neighbor's?
-She teaches English.

626
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:47,721
She must be busy with her own studies.

627
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,101
Ga-bin has a job as well, you know.

628
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,604
Child support is a given.

629
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,523
Would you have gladly accepted it?

630
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:01,193
It's only money.
She needs to go to university.

631
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:04,446
Don't tell Ga-bin about this.

632
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,572
I won't.

633
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,492
By the way, Ms. Sa is a strong woman.

634
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:11,245
How could she have lost
the ability to speak?

635
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,372
Maybe Pi-young found out.

636
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:16,250
If not, how could someone so strong
fall apart so easily?

637
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,379
No. She was fine yesterday.

638
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,676
She'd always look at your family photos.

639
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,427
The album was completely worn out.

640
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:31,807
I don't know if you still remember,
but your grandmother once said that

641
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:36,478
people should always
be laidback and easygoing.

642
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:41,400
Had you understood her
and been a good daughter,

643
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:45,696
she may have never gotten sick,
and you wouldn't have gone mute.

644
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,825
You must be frustrated.

645
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,997
I should have come here sooner.
I had no idea.

646
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,082
I thought she was doing just fine.

647
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:02,170
If you could talk,
you'd be able to apologize

648
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,256
and ask her for forgiveness.

649
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:08,552
Had I been in your shoes,
the pain would have been unfathomable.

650
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:15,434
I shouldn't stay here.
She could get pneumonia from me.

651
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:21,648
I should go home.
I'm getting chilly again.

652
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,945
-Grandma.
-Did you dream of Grandpa?

653
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:27,863
No.

654
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,619
-Just because.
-Come lie down.

655
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:45,255
Ji-a, there's a famous saying
"This too shall pass."

656
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:49,718
I know it's tough. But it'll all pass,
and you'll be happy again.

657
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,803
-Just hang in there.
-Okay.

658
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:57,517
For every happiness I felt,
I had to endure pain numerous times.

659
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,727
That's how it was.

660
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,312
What gave you so much pain?

661
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:03,565
You won't understand.
You'll know once you grow up.

662
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,026
Did you apply something to your neck?

663
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,696
Isn't it glossy? It's caviar oil.

664
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,782
-Do you mean the food?
-Yes.

665
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:12,783
Why?

666
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,994
-To prevent wrinkles.
-I'll get one for my mom on her birthday.

667
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,081
-It's expensive.
-Then you should get it for her.

668
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:20,582
Okay.

669
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:32,010
Ji-a, you're going to take
good care of me, right?

670
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:37,349
You and your parents
are the only ones I have.

671
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,518
Okay.

672
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,728
He rode horses
for the first time in Yongin.

673
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,022
A middle school girl
from back then grew up,

674
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,816
and they met at this equestrian club.

675
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,025
That's what he said.

676
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:50,195
I see. I had no idea.

677
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,072
I'm glad he brought it up.

678
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:55,075
If not, he would have suspected
my husband forever.

679
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:59,287
-You too.
-Right. Misunderstandings are dangerous.

680
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,790
My husband hates immoral things.

681
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:04,876
He always puts his family first
just like his father.

682
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,806
If it's true,
she must feel utterly betrayed.

683
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,817
You led Dad to his death!

684
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,111
You'll never see Ji-a again.
Just like you took Dad from me,

685
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,696
I'll take her from you too.

686
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,072
You have some nerve.

687
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:42,914
Aren't you just as responsible?
Don't you think you drove him to that?

688
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,166
How dare you!

689
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:47,210
Dad must have been fed up with you,
just like me.

690
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,935
Mom…

691
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,940
Mom…

692
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:37,445
Pi-young, don't cry. My daughter.

693
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:48,164
I was a bad mother
who gave you nothing but pain.

694
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:14,232
I…

695
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:24,075
I AM…

696
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,453
I AM SORRY

697
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:40,467
PLEASE…

698
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:44,387
PLEASE FORGIVE…

699
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:48,266
PLEASE FORGIVE ME

700
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:16,378
I…

701
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:29,099
I LOVE…

702
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:32,811
I LOVE YOU

703
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,270
I LOVE YOU, MOM

704
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,830
Mom…

705
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,155
EMERGENCY BELL

706
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,852
YU-SIN

707
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:58,998
YU-SIN

708
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:10,385
-Hey.
-Ms. Mo passed away

709
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,095
just now.

710
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,264
Okay.

711
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,444
I heard Mr. Lee Jeong-gyun
likes get-togethers.

712
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:30,029
-Ms. Oh Sang-hui said so.
-He does.

713
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,700
If he wants to have dinner after work,
let's make an excuse.

714
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:36,619
We'll be working together
for the time being.

715
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,079
We should at least eat once.

716
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,914
It won't end there.

717
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,792
-He'll want to have drinks too.
-Don't you like a light drink?

718
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,878
It depends on whom I'm drinking with.

719
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:48,631
On days when I work all day,
I don't even want to talk.

720
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,009
I actually have to go
grocery shopping today.

721
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:53,011
You make up an excuse.

722
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:56,848
I also need to pack.
I'm going to Busan tomorrow.

723
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,391
-With your husband?
-Yes.

724
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,978
-Your in-laws told you to?
-I brought it up.

725
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,647
You guys sure are different.

726
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,107
It's common these days.

727
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,859
You should make a baby there.

728
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,903
We're planning to.

729
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:14,240
It's my treat.
Mr. Lee Jeong-gyun likes milk tea.

730
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,579
I'll have a hot black coffee.

731
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,921
-Hello.
-Hello.

732
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,381
How is Ms. Sa?

733
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:32,884
Ms. Lee and I visited her
at the hospital yesterday.

734
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:36,971
She has mutism.

735
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,100
She can't speak. We couldn't meet her.

736
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,856
Why didn't you pick up yesterday?

737
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,775
I thought you called me by mistake.

738
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:51,486
Still…

739
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:54,739
I figured you'd eventually text me,
but you didn't.

740
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:56,282
I was showering when you called.

741
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,826
At that hour? Did you play golf?

742
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,328
-Yes.
-Where?

743
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:02,539
-Signal Country.
-Goodness.

744
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:06,626
My father-in-law is the owner.

745
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:07,835
I see.

746
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,504
I could get you a discount.

747
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:10,630
I should have waited.

748
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:13,466
-Are you already a member?
-I am.

749
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,010
Mr. Seo, how well do you play?

750
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,262
Eighty strokes.

751
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:22,183
Goodness. You're pretty much a pro-golfer.

752
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:23,893
You should ask about me.

753
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:34,821
I'm certain that his family is well-off.

754
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,868
-Let me.
-It's okay.

755
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:44,539
If her mother's very sick,
I think it's possible.

756
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:45,790
Gosh. Really?

757
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,667
When my mother passed away,

758
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,836
I thought the world was crumbling down.

759
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:53,423
And that's coming from a son.
Imagine how a daughter would feel.

760
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:55,300
The bond must be stronger.

761
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:59,137
-How old were you when this happened?
-I was 27.

762
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,347
-What about your father?
-He's alive and well.

763
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,182
Has he remarried?

764
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:06,394
Yes. If I can't visit her,
I should at least send a bouquet.

765
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:08,730
Me too. I'll get a cake for Ji-a.

766
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:17,030
Her mother passed away.

767
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,948
-Oh, dear.
-What should I do?

768
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,326
It was difficult to book a hotel in Busan.

769
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,745
It wouldn't be right for you
to skip the funeral.

770
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:25,830
I didn't mean I'd skip it.

771
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,879
I know she was your mother,

772
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:35,798
but we've also been a family
for a long time.

773
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:39,594
I'm the one who's left alone now.

774
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,513
I'm going to live for you and Ji-a,

775
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,724
so you can lean on me.

776
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:48,144
There are some things
husbands just can't fill.

777
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:52,857
Perhaps, we should be thankful
that she didn't suffer for too long.

778
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,569
There are so many bedridden patients
who fight long battles that last years.

779
01:00:57,445 --> 01:01:01,949
Don't blame yourself
for the things you've done wrong.

780
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:06,329
I may have never been a mother before,

781
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,207
but I know how parents feel.

782
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:13,628
My friends said that there's nothing
they want more than their kids' happiness.

783
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:16,464
Your life has been full of joy
all these years.

784
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:18,216
You married a wealthy man

785
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:21,719
who lacks nothing and loves you deeply.

786
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:28,601
And Ji-a is one smart and pretty girl.

787
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:31,396
God doesn't give you everything.

788
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:35,483
It would have been wonderful
if your mother was healthy.

789
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:38,403
But life doesn't always go your way.

790
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:42,949
Ji-a is so sad to see you like this.

791
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,077
She can't even sleep by herself.

792
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:04,262
You're better than me.

793
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,056
My mother…

794
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:12,603
I was all she had…

795
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:17,191
but she died in resentment.

796
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:20,278
Because I married Yu-sin's father.

797
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,700
She met an untimely end.

798
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:32,457
She hasn't even appeared in my dreams.

799
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,671
Not once.

800
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,934
Dr. Lee's wife is here.

801
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,455
Get up. Let's go pay our respects.

802
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:13,998
-I'm not going.
-Why not?

803
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,712
I shouldn't go there
when I'm expecting a baby.

804
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,756
-Says who?
-My brother.

805
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:27,094
Look at how being an expecting father
made you superstitious.

806
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,218
Are you okay?

807
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:12,181
I was worried sick. Can we talk?

808
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,687
Hey.

809
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,731
They just put her in the casket.

810
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:37,748
Please bid your last farewell.

811
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:41,794
Ji-a, are you going to say goodbye?

812
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:53,556
Seo-hyang…

813
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:04,483
Grandma, I won't forget you.

814
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,278
I love you.

815
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:16,662
Seo-hyang, how am I to live without you?

816
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:33,012
Seo-hyang…

817
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:20,977
Dad.

818
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,020
Please welcome Mom with open arms.

819
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:24,689
Welcome her with love.

820
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:27,608
Seo Ban and Seo Dong-ma.
Are they brothers?

821
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:30,111
So he's the eldest son of SF Electronics?

822
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:32,822
How do you think it'd be for us
on the next Lunar New Year?

823
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:35,574
Which room is Ms. A Mi in?

824
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,248
How did you find out?

825
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:43,416
Did she call you first?

826
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:44,792
That son of a bitch.

827
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,585
Who could it be that seduced him?

828
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:49,296
-There's the splitting of assets…
-But I'm scared.

829
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,673
You have me, so don't worry.

830
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:53,634
We're in love.

831
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:02,893
Dad, don't go.

832
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:08,941
