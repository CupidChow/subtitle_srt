00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,591
EPISODE 7

2
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,434
Did you have to show your face to U-ram?

3
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,144
I missed him, that's all.

4
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,354
Take off your mask.
I can't hear you properly.

5
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,236
What about Hyang-gi? Since when
did you feel the need to see him?

6
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,364
U-ram's still young
and is our youngest child.

7
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,450
You're supposed to be their father.

8
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,497
You came by so that he could spot you
after asking me to keep it a secret.

9
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,415
I only hoped to get a glimpse of him.

10
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,042
In your car,

11
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:27,378
right in front of the entrance
to our apartment building?

12
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,506
He's considerate for a boy,

13
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,299
so how would he have felt?

14
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,384
You're always so selfish.

15
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,221
I told him it was easily treatable.

16
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,389
And yet he burst into tears.

17
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,351
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,313
This isn't me lying or making excuses.

19
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,234
I just think about them more
now that I'm sick.

20
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,568
I've grown weaker.

21
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,946
So you must want comfort
and a boost in courage.

22
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,532
Have you already forgotten?

23
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,952
I still remember it
as if it were yesterday.

24
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,078
What good would regret do?

25
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,125
Is that doenjang?

26
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,133
Don't you wash your dishes?

27
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,511
I do it all at once.

28
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,306
That…

29
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,768
-Take it with you.
-What is it?

30
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,104
-You get cold easily.
-Tell me what it is.

31
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:40,160
I ordered it after seeing it on TV.
It looked warm.

32
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,497
Aren't you taking it with you?

33
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,040
Return it.

34
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,807
My gosh.

35
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,810
What is it?

36
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,109
I was just lost in thought.

37
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,361
Park Jun-ho's decent, isn't he?

38
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,487
He is.

39
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,120
-Good day, then.
-Sure.

40
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,094
-Yes, Director Jung.
-I'd like a word.

41
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,973
You did fine work producing your show.

42
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,517
There was a definite uptrend in ratings.

43
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,770
But you've been at it
for three seasons now.

44
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,521
Right.

45
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,523
So how about a break from it?
You can start developing other things.

46
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,778
-Who'll take over?
-Han Gyeong-a wants a shot at it.

47
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,863
Don't I get a say in this?

48
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,699
Take a year off
and come up with something new.

49
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,868
As if he's doing me a favor.

50
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,455
Stealing successful programs
is what Ms. Han does best.

51
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,415
I think it's unethical.

52
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,833
It is without a doubt.

53
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,962
You should have said
you'd like to stay on the show.

54
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,880
Begging is the last thing I want to do.

55
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,591
I met her on my way to work yesterday,

56
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,718
and she nitpicked how I ran things
as if it was advice.

57
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,845
A person like that exists
everywhere you go.

58
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:31,980
It's not him.

59
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,525
As if Mr. Seo's brother
would be at a cafe like this.

60
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,778
Did you run into him?

61
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,864
The day before yesterday at Yeoksam Hotel.

62
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,618
You've met him before, you know.

63
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,664
He paid for our wine that one time.

64
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,874
-That dashing young man?
-Yes.

65
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,129
He was having breakfast with Mr. Seo
at Yeoksam Hotel.

66
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,590
I don't remember his face.
Just his overall look.

67
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,593
He picked up your tab?

68
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,805
When we turned down
a bottle of wine he sent to our table,

69
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,640
he just paid for our drinks instead.

70
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,311
-He showed interest in you.
-I doubt it.

71
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,563
He knows who Hye-ryung is

72
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:17,066
and that she works with his brother.
That's why he was generous.

73
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,318
It makes sense now.

74
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,194
-Did he give you his card?
-Only later.

75
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,448
We met again at a hair salon.

76
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,741
Really?

77
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:28,036
We had dinner
so that I could thank him for the wine.

78
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,496
-Just to be polite?
-No, it happened naturally.

79
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,914
I treated him to the meal.

80
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,292
But still, you didn't know?
Didn't he tell you?

81
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,335
No.

82
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,881
You can imagine how shocked I was
to see him have breakfast with Mr. Seo.

83
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,592
You should have asked
why he didn't introduce himself.

84
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,844
It didn't seem appropriate at the time.

85
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:48,473
Besides, Mr. Seo left right away
to attend a friend's funeral.

86
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,807
It was his close friend.

87
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,394
What is he like?

88
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,023
Compared to Mr. Seo,
he's more of a perfectionist.

89
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,318
He's cynical,
but he's super confident too.

90
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,829
-What is it?
-Something silly crossed my mind.

91
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,583
What if I had dated his brother?

92
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,920
Any other woman
would have thrown herself at him.

93
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:22,548
He's clearly from a wealthy family
and is handsome and fit.

94
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,509
He's not your usual wealthy brat either.

95
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,552
Our situation would have been hilarious.

96
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,888
I know.

97
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,437
-Oh, Ms. Sa.
-Yes?

98
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,355
Can I set you up?

99
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,233
It's my close friend's cousin
who is also divorced.

100
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,610
His ninth-grader son
is being raised by his ex.

101
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,320
He's a director
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

102
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,240
-He must've passed the state exam.
-And he's from a good family.

103
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,950
-How old is he?
-Forget it.

104
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,243
Agree to at least one date.

105
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,744
Even men in their fifties

106
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,372
go after women in their thirties
if they have the ability to.

107
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,167
Unless you plan on staying single.

108
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,419
Are you interested in remarrying?

109
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,088
Have you forgotten?

110
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,632
That I went after Mr. Seo?

111
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,259
With another guy, I mean.

112
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,894
What are those? Oysters?

113
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,564
-No, lobsters.
-I'm not too fond of those.

114
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,649
Blue crabs are better.

115
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,276
Or maybe snow crabs.

116
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,069
They're not just for you, you know.

117
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,781
Like me, Sa-hyeon prefers blue crabs too.

118
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,576
-Place them in the fridge for now.
-Yes, ma'am.

119
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,536
Keep it down. You'll wake him.

120
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,123
-Hye-ryung likes stir-fried lobster.
-I see.

121
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,626
-Is she coming by today?
-It's been a few days.

122
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,630
She seems to have grown attached
to our Jeong-bin.

123
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,007
Isn't that right?

124
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,218
There's no need to sigh.

125
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,512
If not the best, then the second-best.

126
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,056
It'll all work out.

127
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,894
I guess Song Yuan
was just a brief encounter in his life.

128
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,731
She would have lived out her life
had she not met Sa-hyeon.

129
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:06,027
We should just accept what has happened.

130
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,781
Thanks to her,
we were able to welcome Jeong-bin.

131
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,826
Our precious little grandson.

132
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,369
U-ram, have some persimmons.

133
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,542
Don't worry about your dad too much.

134
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,129
Exposure to cold, overfatigue, or stress
can cause that condition easily.

135
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,383
It happened to a friend of mine
while writing a doctoral dissertation.

136
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,470
-Are you sure it's treatable?
-Yes.

137
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,056
I saw him this morning

138
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,350
and he's in much better shape.

139
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,977
Dig in.

140
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,438
-I'll cut the rest.
-I'm already full.

141
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:49,779
I'm sure you're aware
that I've been dating Mr. Seo.

142
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,907
Of course.

143
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,743
He asked me to marry him.

144
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,580
-When?
-He'd rather not drag out the inevitable.

145
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,041
-You should marry him.
-Is that what you want?

146
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,377
Must you ask?
Of course she's on the same page.

147
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,301
I'm not sure. It doesn't seem right.

148
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,054
What do you mean?

149
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:19,058
I'm fond of Mr. Seo,
but this is a different matter.

150
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,184
It really isn't.

151
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,436
How can being a nice family friend

152
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,690
be the same as being our stepdad?

153
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,567
Would you prefer some old man instead?

154
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,111
Can't it just always be the three of us?

155
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,445
-Hey!
-All right.

156
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,949
Mom, it's not like
we'll be living together forever.

157
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,242
Aren't you going to marry?

158
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,078
-Even high school kids have girlfriends.
-I won't.

159
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,455
I doubt you plan to die a single man.

160
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,292
Must she give up
a new chapter in her life for us?

161
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,876
That wouldn't be the case.

162
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,714
What about her happiness?
Men like Mr. Seo don't come by easily.

163
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,340
What will you call him?

164
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,053
Can you call him Dad?

165
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,681
My friend's dad seems like an uncle.

166
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,309
He had her at 22, you see.

167
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,811
He married early, right out of school.

168
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,981
Mr. Seo may not seem like it,
but he's the same age as Dad. Right?

169
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,358
We can call him that.

170
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,361
Don't be a baby, but be her son, U-ram.

171
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,204
Are you looking for something specific?

172
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,498
How many carats is that?

173
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,541
Two, sir.

174
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:30,338
The D color, VVS1 clarity,
five-carat diamond, please.

175
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,382
It'll have to be shipped from New York,
so it will take some time.

176
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,675
How long?

177
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,220
NAM GA-BIN

178
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,978
So even though
we only recently started dating,

179
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,189
he seems like an old friend.

180
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,733
We're comfortable around each other.

181
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,818
How fascinating. Right, U-ram?

182
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,780
Is it okay to say that I'm happy for you?

183
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,618
-Aren't you?
-Me too.

184
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,663
I'm embarrassed to tell you about us.

185
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,290
Don't be, Mom.
The heavens are rewarding you.

186
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,167
He'd like to take us out to dinner.

187
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,670
Of course. I can't wait.

188
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,385
Who is she?

189
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,136
Are you saying he already
found someone else?

190
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,973
-I doubt it.
-I asked if someone had caught his eye

191
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,559
and he said it wasn't his eye but his ear.

192
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,687
He never lies. More than anything,
he's too straightforward.

193
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,899
He doesn't care if he hurts others.

194
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,026
I don't know what to say.

195
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,653
Is he eating…

196
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,446
and doing well?

197
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,865
He left for the German office today.

198
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,575
-For good?
-No.

199
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:45,246
He's the devil I shouldn't have met.
It wasn't love.

200
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:49,333
I know he's my brother,
but even I can't condone his ways.

201
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,794
There are times when
I don't understand him myself.

202
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,879
Although, he'd say the same thing.

203
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,551
Anyone you end up with
will be better than Dong-ma.

204
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,262
He can be cruel

205
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,223
when it comes to the women in his life.

206
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,231
Where did you get that pretty shirt?

207
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,732
It's from my favorite brand.

208
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,527
You could probably wear that
even when you're not golfing.

209
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,196
I normally do.

210
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,205
Good shot.

211
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:52,480
Pi-young, you should
take my wife out to golf often.

212
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,815
But you're the one with the cleaner swing.

213
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,275
I'd be more at ease with you.

214
00:12:56,358 --> 00:13:00,613
A few classes and private lessons here
helped me improve.

215
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,115
Really? Maybe I should
take some classes too.

216
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,367
You'll see an improvement in no time.

217
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,955
Then it's settled.
I'll leave my wife in your hands.

218
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,466
Mom, I gained a kilogram.

219
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,009
Hardly. You grew taller, that's all.

220
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,314
Mom, can't you stock up on some juice?

221
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,025
Of course not. That's only sugar water.

222
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,493
I'll probably live forever.

223
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,827
-Thanks to me?
-Who else?

224
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,956
A long and healthy life
is how you can do everything you want.

225
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,960
I'll play video games every day
when I become a grandma

226
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,546
and eat everything I want.

227
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,257
My dream is to die while eating.

228
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,803
I'm not kidding.
Ice cream, juice, chips, and chocolate.

229
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,055
There are too many delicious snacks.

230
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,474
Nothing brings you more happiness
than good health.

231
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,310
Cancer cells live on sugar, remember?

232
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,521
They have good taste, I give them that.

233
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,191
Ji-a.

234
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,904
Is it normal for people
to have a change of heart?

235
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,031
Or is it not?

236
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,659
Well, it should stay the same.

237
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,369
Only a saint would achieve that.

238
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,246
For people, it's perfectly normal.

239
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,249
You argued with your best friend So-yul
over something trivial

240
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,500
and now you hardly talk.

241
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,713
You did nothing wrong

242
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:44,800
and what So-yul did wasn't that bad,
but that's what happened.

243
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,014
It's the same with me.

244
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,601
I no longer feel the same about your dad.

245
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:59,690
Just like others, he made a few mistakes.

246
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,568
And they upset me.

247
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,403
I wanted to let it slide,

248
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:09,199
-but I couldn't.
-What kind of mistake did he make?

249
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,160
Not everyone is perfect.

250
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,831
I get why he did it,
but now I've gotten used to

251
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,125
living apart from him.

252
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,004
I like the life we built here together.

253
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,758
Are you upset?

254
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,053
A little. Shouldn't you
have cut him some slack?

255
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,264
It's not about forgiving
or teaching each other a lesson.

256
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,267
I find it better to have a separate life.

257
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,646
And while doing so,

258
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,190
if he and I find someone

259
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,943
we are more fond of,

260
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,904
we will begin new relationships.

261
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,449
Are you and Dad divorced?

262
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,786
Actually, yes.

263
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,917
I'm sorry
for deciding on it without asking you.

264
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,755
I knew something was up.

265
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:08,884
You'll learn once
you marry someone later on in life.

266
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:13,472
You could disappoint your husband

267
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,016
and you could be the one
who's disappointed.

268
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,436
To forgive or to divorce.

269
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,896
A choice must be made.

270
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,190
In life,

271
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,027
we go through many events
and make countless decisions.

272
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,822
Decisions that aren't easy to make.

273
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,369
Whether you calmly accept our divorce

274
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,913
or throw a tantrum is up to you.

275
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,373
There's nothing I can do

276
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,042
if you neglect your studies
because of your sadness.

277
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,921
Your life is yours to manage.

278
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,633
I can't live it for you.

279
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,888
Children and parents
can't live each other's lives for them.

280
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,143
So take your time and choose wisely.

281
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:05,149
Some things in life
are controllable by willpower,

282
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,859
but some are not.

283
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,696
When I walked down the aisle
in my wedding dress,

284
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,615
I thought I'd be happy forever.

285
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,162
Life not going as planned
doesn't mean you'll be unhappy.

286
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,040
Do I look sad to you these days?
Do I seem depressed?

287
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,295
There are many paths for people to take.

288
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,922
Some even live without ever marrying.

289
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,132
A coworker of mine

290
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,218
only found true happiness
after a third marriage.

291
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,473
There's no right or wrong.
We just have different paths in life.

292
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,100
Was what Dad did unforgivable?

293
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,228
It depends on how you look at it.
I guess you can say

294
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,566
I could have understood him
and looked past his flaws.

295
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,735
It's just

296
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,990
I couldn't bring myself
to hug him and kiss him anymore.

297
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,618
It seemed off.

298
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,995
And still living in the same house

299
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,664
only made things
uncomfortable and unnatural.

300
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,416
I like how things currently are.

301
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,048
There's no big difference.
It's not like you can't see your dad.

302
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,301
We can go out to eat from time to time.

303
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:18,013
The only difference is we're not living
under the same roof.

304
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,058
Is this hard for you to accept?

305
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,937
You'll understand with age.

306
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:29,399
Right now, you won't understand
no matter how much I explain it.

307
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,819
I only thought
this happened in soap operas.

308
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,532
This can't even be categorized
as misfortune.

309
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,784
When I was a young girl,

310
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,787
I heard my aunt humming this song.

311
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,623
"Heartbreaking Mia-ri Hill."

312
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,751
This may not be word-for-word,
but the lyrics go like this.

313
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,881
Gunpowder smoke blinds me

314
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,427
As I wander not knowing where I'm going

315
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,180
You

316
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,768
Bound with string wire

317
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,522
Look over your back again and again

318
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:13,068
Limping barefooted

319
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:17,239
You're dragged over this hill

320
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,534
The Mia-ri Hill

321
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,580
Full of heartache and sorrow

322
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,790
Imagine that scene.

323
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:34,381
It depicts a woman watching her husband
get dragged to North Korea

324
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,675
bound tightly with string wire.

325
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,094
Imagine that it happened to you.

326
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,890
What if that's the last image you see
of the person you love?

327
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,684
It's sad. It scares me too.

328
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,395
There's no need to be lost or in pain

329
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,356
over what will never change.

330
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,694
What I hope
is for you to maturely accept this.

331
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:59,489
The fact that I have as well is why
I'm still on good terms with your dad.

332
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,118
Your dad and I
started off as strangers anyway.

333
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,246
It's like having a falling out
with a friend.

334
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:12,377
At first, I thought some time apart
would help me forgive and forget.

335
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,173
That's why I kept the truth from you.

336
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,594
But now I've adapted to this way of life.

337
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:25,557
If we were still under the same roof,
I'd nag your dad from time to time.

338
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,646
How would that make your Dad feel
when he's a prideful man?

339
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,939
I get it.

340
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,775
I understand what you're saying.

341
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,527
Your dad has adapted too.

342
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,822
There's no man in this world
who enjoys being nagged anyway.

343
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,867
Besides, your grandma's been
taking good care of him.

344
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:54,086
Keep your distance from the golf ball
and hit the golf ball.

345
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,879
I think you're quite good.

346
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,636
-Yes?
-Hello?

347
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,847
-Can't you hear me?
-Where are you, Dad?

348
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,223
The music's loud.

349
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,767
I'm out with some friends.

350
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,269
A club?

351
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,270
Somewhere similar.

352
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,732
-Got it.
-What's this about?

353
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,067
-It's nothing.
-I see.

354
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,652
-I'm hanging up.
-Sure.

355
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,075
It was Ji-a. We should get home.

356
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,161
-But we're still dancing.
-You got to loosen up, didn't you?

357
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,704
As if that was enough.

358
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,417
I guess I don't need to worry.

359
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,171
The children accepted it
easier than expected.

360
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,589
It's what I said.

361
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,674
Let's get married before the holidays.

362
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,470
Are you sure about
not asking your family first?

363
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:30,265
-I don't need my father's permission.
-Still, it doesn't seem right to me.

364
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:33,101
It's not like he asked for my opinion
when he remarried.

365
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,686
But you and your brother are close.

366
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,564
I once met him while out with Hye-ryung.

367
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,405
Don't they make a great couple?

368
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,759
What about Dad though?

369
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,304
-What about him?
-He'll be shocked to hear this.

370
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,474
You reap what you sow.

371
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:16,061
We may not need him

372
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,646
since we have Mom,

373
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,649
but we are all that he has.

374
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,443
Out of sight, out of mind.

375
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,487
Besides, I don't care
if we're related by blood.

376
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,156
It's natural to not care about
someone who abandoned us.

377
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,159
-But I still do.
-What are you getting at?

378
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,370
-Are you at ease?
-Should I not be?

379
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,039
Just think about Mom and her happiness.

380
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,457
Don't get in the way.

381
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,960
-I'm not trying to.
-Then what is it?

382
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,129
Doing nothing is how you can help.

383
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,881
Have you not seen how cheerful she's been?

384
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,342
She seems more vibrant
and we like her this way.

385
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,343
This'll hurt Dad.

386
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,471
What about us? He hurt us first, you know.

387
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,932
He made his own bed to lie in.

388
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,225
I'm sure he regrets it.

389
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,852
The ship has sailed.

390
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,436
He dumped his own fortune.

391
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,564
And now Mom's being rewarded.

392
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,691
So let this teach you to be a good person.

393
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,527
Not good in a gullible way, but sensible.

394
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,120
It was a long road.

395
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,997
Are you sure I'm fully recovered?

396
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,584
Yes, just come in from time to time
for moxibustion.

397
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,751
Thank you, doctor.

398
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:25,380
Don't overexert yourself
and maintain mental stability.

399
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,966
Stress can be the cause of all diseases.

400
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,467
Yes, doctor.

401
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,663
Do you have that in size 66?

402
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,165
-Yes, sir.
-I'll take it.

403
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,626
-Is it a gift?
-Yes, for my wife.

404
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,294
ALARM

405
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,065
Hello?

406
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:26,775
Are you up?

407
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,861
-I want to stay in bed.
-Aren't you well?

408
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:34,241
It's just that I wish you were here.

409
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:40,247
I miss you every day and every moment.

410
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,415
Then shorten your trip and come.

411
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,254
I think my stay will be extended a week.

412
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,923
Then I'll see you in the new year
which isn't bad.

413
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,841
It's not bad, you say? Take that back.

414
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,720
-When will you quit your job?
-Maybe ten years later.

415
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,681
You're so mischievous.

416
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:00,058
-Cheer me up?
-How?

417
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,394
Scream at the top of your lungs for me.

418
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,020
That'll get me out of bed.

419
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,606
Wash up and head out.
And don't forget to eat something.

420
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,692
Are you telling me to hang up? Really?

421
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,402
-Yes.
-I don't want to.

422
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,445
-I'm hanging up.
-That's cold.

423
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,614
-Be nice, will you?
-How much nicer can I be?

424
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,449
No more childish complaints.

425
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,452
You'll be the only one
who gets to see this side of me.

426
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,207
What would you do for me if you were here?

427
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,419
-Tell me what you'd do for me first.
-Love.

428
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,589
I'll love you in every way.

429
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,218
I'd make you breakfast.

430
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,053
Many prioritize eating,

431
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,222
but I value love more.

432
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,975
Love takes priority for me no matter what.

433
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,227
Breakfast isn't why
I asked you to marry me.

434
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,063
Pi-young.

435
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,650
-Yes?
-Ich liebe dich.

436
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,613
Have a good day then.

437
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,666
-Who was that?
-My gosh.

438
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,084
Why are you jumpy?

439
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,754
-Did you wrap up the show?
-Yes.

440
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,839
It was Ji-a.

441
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,966
-School's on break, isn't it?
-Of course.

442
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,930
Please bring the receipt
should you want a refund.

443
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,015
Sure thing.

444
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,749
I'm going to get you whatever I want.

445
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,292
I already have too many clothes.

446
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,585
So you're greedy in a way.

447
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:54,255
My brother sends some over
while shopping for himself.

448
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,132
Aren't you thirsty?

449
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,470
Ji-a.

450
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,973
Could we talk? I'll buy you bread.

451
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,728
You're lucky to have a brother like him.

452
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,523
I bet he has a girlfriend.

453
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,486
-What is it?
-He's too much of a player.

454
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,862
He sees a lot of women?

455
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,365
No, but his relationships don't last.

456
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,868
He leads them on
under the premise of marriage.

457
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,036
It's only a phase.

458
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,872
Better he breaks their hearts now

459
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,250
than breaking them later
after getting married.

460
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,919
-I'm worried he'll stay this way.
-What's his type?

461
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,212
He doesn't have one.

462
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:37,549
What about Hye-ryung?
I'm not saying we should set them up, but…

463
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,717
It'll only be a fling.

464
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,511
Only set him up
if you want to be cursed at.

465
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,640
What do you think about Mr. Seo?

466
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,352
-In what way?
-He and my mom are getting married.

467
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,188
Really?

468
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,444
But it's not bad news.

469
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,363
I'm surprised though. When's the date?

470
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,241
-In the new year.
-Aren't you happy about it?

471
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:07,579
It's just that I feel bad for my dad.

472
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,748
He's better than any other guy though.

473
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,915
I don't know.

474
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,502
My mom seems happy,

475
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,088
but I'm not.

476
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,717
Why would you be happy
when it's not your wedding?

477
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,347
-What did Hyang-gi say?
-She loves the idea.

478
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,057
The same goes for my mom,

479
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,686
but your mom spent her life
raising you and your sister.

480
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,438
Think of it as returning the favor.

481
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:37,776
Isn't there a way for everyone,
including my dad, to be happy?

482
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,403
We'll want to marry someone
when we're older.

483
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,571
In dramas and movies,

484
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:45,408
you see the heartbreak in situations
where family members don't approve.

485
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:46,993
Don't be that person.

486
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:52,040
-My mom and dad also divorced.
-Why?

487
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,001
I don't know. All I can do is speculate.

488
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,628
You must be just as upset.

489
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,963
Will we be this way as adults too?

490
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,096
Is he asleep?

491
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,556
Yes.

492
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,559
Do you have the magic touch?
You're even better than we are.

493
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,436
Is Sa-hyeon this late every day?

494
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,104
Well, it's the year-end.

495
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,273
-Does he check on Jeong-bin?
-Of course.

496
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,484
He checks on him on his way out as well.

497
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:23,112
-What are you up to on Christmas Day?
-I have a formal event and other plans.

498
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,864
-Will a pre-recorded show be aired?
-Yes.

499
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,699
You're probably tired,
so head home and rest.

500
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,159
You keep stopping by.

501
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,121
-We're grateful, but--
-It hasn't even been an hour.

502
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,790
This is just as relaxing anyway.

503
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,835
Isn't Jeong-bin's 100th day
the same as Lunar New Year?

504
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,546
No, it's a week apart.

505
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,882
What a relief.
You'll be throwing a party, right?

506
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,552
We'll have the family gather,
order a rice cake,

507
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,178
and hand it out to our neighbors.

508
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,514
-Can you make it?
-If my schedule allows it.

509
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,641
-I should be here if I can.
-You know…

510
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,310
-Hye-ryung.
-Yes?

511
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:58,106
How about you two get back together?

512
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,904
It seems inevitable.
At least that's what we believe.

513
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,783
There's no need to doubt his loyalty now

514
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:13,329
and there's nothing about him
that'll give you a hard time.

515
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,914
It never crossed my mind.

516
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,624
If you're not going to stay single,

517
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,460
isn't Sa-hyeon the best choice out there?

518
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:20,962
In what way?

519
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,632
All men make that kind of mistake in life.

520
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,219
-Except me, of course.
-We're not forcing you.

521
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,847
It's only our opinion.

522
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,182
We mention it because
you seem to adore Jeong-bin.

523
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,976
I feel bad for him.

524
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,313
Exactly. Which is why
if you can be his mother,

525
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:42,066
you both…
Well, Jeong-bin will be one lucky boy

526
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,943
and we'll be less worried.

527
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,904
Sa-hyeon can't move on that quickly.

528
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,655
Time will solve that.

529
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,490
It always does.

530
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,825
Of course.

531
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,953
That's why people say,
"Out of sight, out of mind."

532
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,622
I've been out of mind for him for a while.

533
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:59,208
They just weren't meant to be.
Besides, she was too old for him.

534
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,251
I'm older than him too.

535
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,421
Not by today's standards.
Being a year older is nothing.

536
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,928
It's over between us.

537
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,346
You didn't end on bad terms.

538
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,057
I poured my disappointment
and hatred out on him.

539
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,767
It ended well because I backed off.

540
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,065
I don't have
any feelings left for Sa-hyeon.

541
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,193
I just keep thinking about the baby.

542
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,363
Exactly. Consider it as doing a good deed.

543
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:31,407
Sa-hyeon will be able
to meet a nice woman.

544
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,952
We can't accept just any woman again.

545
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,536
For your good deeds,

546
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,872
the heavens will grant you
a nice daughter-in-law.

547
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,631
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.

548
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,490
As if I'd take back a shell of a man.

549
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,625
Serves you right.

550
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,259
Did you see Hye-ryung on the way in?

551
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,678
-No.
-But she just left.

552
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,526
My son, did you have a good day today?

553
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,371
-Dinner?
-I've eaten.

554
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,123
You should wash your hands first.

555
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,043
-Sure. Was he fussy today?
-No.

556
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,304
My poor sweet puppy.

557
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,145
She'll give in
if I ask for forgiveness every day,

558
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:28,357
given our kids and her personality.

559
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,468
Which book did you order?

560
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,471
RECIPIENT: LEE SI-EUN

561
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,310
Is that an engagement ring?

562
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,687
Yes.

563
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,316
Is that real diamond?

564
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,277
-Of course.
-How many carats is this?

565
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,489
It's too big to wear every day.
I couldn't wear it to the office.

566
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:19,283
Why not? You totally should.

567
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:22,662
-He can obviously afford it.
-Don't tell U-ram about this.

568
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:26,457
Why not? You should have been
treated this way a long time ago.

569
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,167
Enough with the worn-out t-shirts.

570
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,294
Start sleeping in feminine pajamas now.

571
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,046
I'll buy one for you.

572
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,967
-It's fine.
-I saved up working part-time.

573
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,636
Mr. Seo likes that I'm down-to-earth.

574
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,972
This isn't what you'd call down-to-earth.

575
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,807
To put it in good words, it's frugal,

576
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,560
in bad words, it's being a penny-pincher
but that's rude.

577
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,523
Gosh, this is beautiful.

578
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,441
No wonder people go crazy over diamonds.

579
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:58,364
Don't worry, I'll doll myself up now.

580
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:02,577
Being a woman,
I know what's nice and pretty.

581
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,621
I just had to give that up for the family.

582
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,792
Hae-ryun, I'm truly grateful.

583
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,714
I guess it's true that hardships
can be a blessing in disguise.

584
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,846
We've been barking up the wrong tree.

585
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,307
As Hae-ri says, we fell flat on our faces.

586
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,100
She could already be seeing someone.

587
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,143
Already?

588
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:30,188
She's pretty
and has always had many male fans.

589
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,939
Regardless of gender,

590
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,651
it helps no one
to only look pretty on the outside.

591
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,069
Their character matters more.

592
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,864
Our youngest son
is one of those pretty faces.

593
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:43,159
Sa-hyeon's a good man.
On the inside and the outside.

594
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,535
But no one knows that.

595
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,455
Besides, we need Hye-ryung
to think that way about him.

596
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,582
But he really messed things up with her.

597
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,167
If not an unmarried man,

598
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,045
isn't the devil you know better?

599
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,131
It's better to be with
someone you already know.

600
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,174
Exactly.

601
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,968
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

602
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,849
I know that all too well.

603
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,187
She's been coming by
every three days to see Jeong-bin,

604
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,231
so I thought she was interested.

605
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,691
She won't come by anymore
now that we've scared her off.

606
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:19,570
So be it.
Find someone decent for Sa-hyeon, then.

607
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,405
He needs to be on board first.

608
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,824
Her grave is still fresh.

609
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,368
Just push women on him.

610
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,498
You know how it is.
One is bound to catch his eye.

611
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,836
I heard that Mr. Seo and U-ram's mom
are getting married.

612
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,047
-Why didn't you tell me?
-It's between grown-ups.

613
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,634
Your issues sometimes involve us too.

614
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:43,678
Did U-ram tell you?

615
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,515
-What did he say?
-He feels bad for his dad.

616
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,142
I know that humans
are naturally forgetful,

617
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,061
but what about what he did to them?

618
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,814
You know how kind and forgiving he is.

619
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,441
-What about you?
-I can't say I'm cruel.

620
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,445
That's true. Only the kind-hearted
find success in life.

621
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,823
Don't you forget that.

622
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,617
Look how U-ram's mom
is being rewarded in her later years.

623
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,619
Mom, please don't say things like that.

624
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,539
-Why not?
-You sound like a fortune-teller.

625
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,166
That's a profession too,
and you shouldn't discriminate.

626
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,295
I bet you'll be seeking some out
with friends when you're older.

627
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,754
-Why?
-For fun, of course.

628
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,841
How you choose to treat people

629
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,218
and what you choose to do
can change your fate.

630
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,096
Just don't become an ardent believer.

631
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,306
Got it.

632
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,102
But what puzzles me is,

633
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:36,272
why did Mr. Seo
pick U-ram's mom and not you?

634
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,775
I get that they met as kids, but…

635
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,323
I didn't know you liked him as well.

636
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,700
Hyang-gi's taking us to a bookstore today.

637
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,161
That's great.

638
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:53,331
I had lunch plans with
Hye-ryung and U-ram's mom.

639
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,125
You meet every day.
How can you have so much to talk about?

640
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,877
It hasn't been every day lately.

641
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,922
Things haven't been smooth between
Hye-ryung and U-ram's mom,

642
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,966
so I'm taking them out to talk.

643
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,719
I guess grown-ups are just like us.

644
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,763
You sulk and argue too.

645
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:12,433
We don't necessarily argue,
but misunderstandings sometimes occur.

646
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,477
Grown-ups aren't that different.

647
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,229
We must all keep maturing.

648
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,151
I bet I'll be less stressed
when I grow up.

649
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:23,819
No more studying.

650
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:27,698
That'll be replaced
with worrying about making a living.

651
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,577
You can think of it as stress,

652
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,788
or as a challenge.

653
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,923
Have you told Ji-a about me?

654
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,342
-No.
-Isn't it okay to tell her now?

655
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,346
She saw me that day,
so wouldn't she remember?

656
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,597
When the time is right.

657
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,850
Which is when, exactly?

658
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,103
Is marriage even on your mind?

659
00:39:58,687 --> 00:39:59,647
It's the hospital.

660
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,191
Hello?

661
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,533
Ji-a, wait. It's your dad.

662
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,578
SUNRISE AT THE WEST SEA
ESSAY COLLECTION

663
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,417
Do you know me?

664
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,836
-Yes.
-Why did my dad leave?

665
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,421
He got a call from the hospital.

666
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,465
It must be an urgent patient.

667
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:10,968
I'll talk to her for a bit.

668
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,304
Call us.

669
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,066
What if they fight?

670
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,903
As if a grown-up
would argue with a little girl.

671
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,615
Ji-a can be scary when angry.

672
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,284
I think we should keep an eye on her.

673
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,417
I think we met.

674
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,380
How about a beverage?
They have ice cream here.

675
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,590
An orangeade, please.

676
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,144
Did everyone go out?

677
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,230
Yes, but without telling me.

678
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,525
It sure is nice to be home.

679
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,109
You should have called.

680
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,448
-I even got you a gift too.
-Mine as well?

681
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,715
Are you his girlfriend?

682
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,760
-Yes.
-Since when?

683
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,804
-It's a long story.
-Has it been over a year?

684
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,727
I'll take that as a yes.

685
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,648
-My mom knows, doesn't she?
-Yes.

686
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,860
We're actually quite close.
I even call her by her name.

687
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,738
I have her number
saved on my phone as well.

688
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,448
We meet once in a while.

689
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:01,036
What do you two talk about?

690
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,788
Just this and that.

691
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:04,623
You should ask her.

692
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,835
Do you like my dad?

693
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,879
-Yes.
-Is it love?

694
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,637
Are you going to marry him?

695
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:19,638
Probably.

696
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:24,560
I've been wanting to meet you.

697
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,688
Me? Why?

698
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:31,859
No reason. It'll be nice
for you, me, and your mom to get together.

699
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:32,943
I don't get it.

700
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:36,071
If you're on good terms,
my mom would have told me.

701
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,282
It must have been hard for her to explain.

702
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,658
Tell me about your family.

703
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,119
I grew up in the US since the age of five

704
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,788
and I moved to Korea
less than two years ago.

705
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,750
My two younger brothers
and parents still live there.

706
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,503
My biological father was in Korea,

707
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:55,507
but he recently passed away.

708
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:03,223
My name is A Mi. Mi is my first name.

709
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,350
I don't really care.

710
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,144
I've always wanted a little sister.

711
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,815
Are you saying you want me
to see you as my big sister?

712
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,610
You just said you're friends with my mom.

713
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,781
In Korea, we call this
a mess of a family tree.

714
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,535
Do you have a job?

715
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,830
I shot a few commercials up until recently

716
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,626
and had a minor role in a movie.

717
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,128
Ms. Sa asked me to take Ji-a home.

718
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,964
Why? Can't I have my burger?

719
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,550
She said to come right away.
It must be urgent.

720
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,968
Do you live at my house…

721
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,888
with my dad?

722
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:07,162
Please tell my dad
that I wish him a good life.

723
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:30,227
It won't kill us
to have a heavy meal at lunch.

724
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,437
Of course not.

725
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,647
Shouldn't you lose some weight
for the big day?

726
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,732
I probably should.

727
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,610
But you're naturally slim and slender.

728
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:39,903
Was there a grand proposal?

729
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,655
The ring said it all.

730
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:44,825
He proposed to me at a church.

731
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,996
-I left it at home.
-A diamond ring?

732
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,581
-Yes.
-How many carats?

733
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,208
I doubt he would have gotten her
a small one.

734
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,422
Are you going to move into his place
after the wedding?

735
00:45:58,505 --> 00:45:59,882
Isn't it obvious?

736
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,845
That reminds me.
Did your ex have a boy or a girl?

737
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:06,847
They had the baby, right?

738
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,558
-A boy.
-Well, I'm glad.

739
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,852
Chairman Pan must be thrilled.

740
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,145
Not really.

741
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,398
His youngest son
didn't get to marry the mother.

742
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:20,277
I guess you can say he's a widower now.

743
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,445
What do you mean by that?

744
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:25,032
-Did they break up?
-She died straight after giving birth.

745
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,492
-My gosh!
-What happened?

746
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,243
She paid for her sins.

747
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:34,833
The baby's adorable. He really is.

748
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,671
I don't know if Sa-hyeon's parents
are shameless or clueless, but…

749
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,007
-Why?
-They want us to get back together.

750
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,718
Of course his parents would want that.

751
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:46,094
Why is that?

752
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,681
I'm fully aware of how they were.

753
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:52,142
They cared for the pregnant mistress.

754
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,269
I'm the one who demanded this divorce.

755
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,188
Wasn't it the other way around?

756
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:57,689
It's the same thing.

757
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,734
So how could they possibly
want me to take him back in?

758
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:04,238
Either way, there's no need
for you to doubt him anymore.

759
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:07,115
-As long as he can move on.
-As if.

760
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,160
He'll keep her buried in his heart
and forever miss her.

761
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:13,121
Divorce is better
than losing a spouse by death.

762
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:17,751
What he did
erased any feelings for him I had.

763
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:19,253
It's the same for me as well.

764
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,422
What about the little one though?

765
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,715
Tell me about it.

766
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,177
It kills me to think about the poor baby.

767
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,764
-Does he smile at you?
-He's barely two months old.

768
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:33,267
-They smile even after one.
-Boys sometimes take longer.

769
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,977
His grandparents will raise him.

770
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,229
Right. They're staying in Seoul for now.

771
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,940
It must be hard for them.
Babysitting isn't a joke.

772
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,316
They're not that old.

773
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,113
Just imagine how fun it was for them
to care for the pregnant mistress.

774
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,915
What is this?

775
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,458
-A tree.
-For Christmas?

776
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,751
-Yes.
-Where should we put this?

777
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:00,794
Over here.

778
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,383
-Where is Sa-hyeon?
-He went out.

779
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,552
A high school friend is getting married.

780
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,470
I'm off to the restroom.

781
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,471
Sure.

782
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,856
A MI

783
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,783
Don't you think Hye-ryung's a bit harsh?

784
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,412
She tends to only think about herself.

785
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,290
The mother must have
held on for dear life.

786
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,374
I know.

787
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:46,798
The doctor said deformation
didn't mean infertility.

788
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:54,765
What have I got to lose?
I should just make my play.

789
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,933
Older brothers are said to be better,

790
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:59,645
but Mr. Seo in his fifties
while his brother is in his thirties.

791
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,105
His brother is way better then.

792
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:18,330
I still hate Ms. Lee's guts,
but throwing her a bone would be wise.

793
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:20,957
Thank you.

794
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,418
-Here you go.
-We'll take it for the road.

795
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,504
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

796
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,343
Christmas Day is only two days away.

797
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:32,969
Who would set it up?

798
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,013
Us.

799
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,398
We're not kids, you know.

800
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:47,275
And it's not like we're in a festive mood.

801
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,903
Jeong-bin won't understand it.

802
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:52,280
Why wouldn't he when he has eyes?

803
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:56,326
He gazes up at us and follows the rattle.

804
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,078
But we're not in the mood.

805
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:03,208
Well, it's not just for Jeong-bin.

806
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,335
It's for Sa-hyeon too.

807
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,589
He comes home to two old bats
and a housekeeper.

808
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:12,217
I thought a tree

809
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:16,054
would lift his spirits
and our overall mood.

810
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:19,433
Let's get it done before he gets back.

811
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,947
When will we get all of these done?
It'll take us all night.

812
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:36,867
Stop complaining and just do it.

813
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,745
-What are these?
-Tree lights.

814
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,123
-Who's that?
-Probably Song Yuan's friend.

815
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,208
I'm right.

816
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,294
She was in the neighborhood
and wanted to see the baby.

817
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,212
I never thought they actually meant it.

818
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:55,051
You should keep working
even though Mr. Seo tells you to quit.

819
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,262
I'd be lost if you leave the show too.

820
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,639
Gosh, when it's your name on the title?

821
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,851
Producer Han's not only weird,
but she's bad at her job too.

822
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,561
The song choices are a mess.

823
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,438
You've been on our website, right?

824
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:09,274
She's a kiss ass
and easily grovels to those with power.

825
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:13,737
We only need to hang in there for a year
and then you'll be back.

826
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:14,738
She won't back down.

827
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,991
Director Jung will have no choice
once the ratings plummet.

828
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:19,451
She even asked me

829
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,162
to introduce someone
to her talented niece.

830
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,955
-She asked me too.
-What does she do?

831
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,582
She's a cellist for an orchestra.

832
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:28,335
By the looks of it,
her brother's quite well off.

833
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,462
From her photo,
I saw plastic surgery madness.

834
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:33,006
-Plastic surgery?
-And a lot of it.

835
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:37,469
Maybe you could consider her
as a sister-in-law.

836
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,306
Ban will be against it.

837
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,433
-Why?
-Because his brother's a player.

838
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,393
He's handsome and wealthy.

839
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,895
Of course women
would throw themselves at him.

840
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,356
I bet he's seeing someone.

841
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,234
He was, but he ended it,
and now he's at the Munich branch.

842
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:00,116
Okay, nice. There's a chance for me.

843
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,703
-They must have an office in Munich too.
-Right.

844
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,540
What about your wedding though?

845
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,916
He'll be back in a few days.

846
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:28,603
Won, your baby's a sweetheart.

847
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:32,732
It takes a player to handle a player.

848
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:39,239
The pedestrian crossing sign
has turned green.

849
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,782
Please cross the crosswalk.

850
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:45,954
But a true player
never reveals their true colors.

851
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:48,290
Look at this innocent face.

852
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:55,130
What about the musical actress
who was with you at the funeral?

853
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,382
She's been having a hard time lately.

854
00:52:57,465 --> 00:53:00,427
We all go through hardships in life.

855
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,178
That's just how life is.

856
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,766
Are you already packing up the tree?

857
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,351
But Christmas is two days away.

858
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:12,314
On the contrary.
He just got one for us today.

859
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,065
In hopes of creating a festive mood.

860
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:17,360
Wouldn't Jeong-bin love to see the lights?

861
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,362
-It'll help develop his senses.
-Of course.

862
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,949
-I'm actually good at decorating trees.
-We'd appreciate the help.

863
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:27,412
My wife's already been
nagging me about this.

864
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,164
For making a fuss.

865
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,126
Hyang-gi dropped you off, right?

866
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:34,294
Yes.

867
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:36,671
Grandma's back.

868
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:42,093
-Did she call?
-Yes. And she bought gifts for us.

869
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,973
-Did she call us over?
-I said you were out.

870
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:06,284
I didn't expect this to be so much work.

871
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,036
It's all done. You should sit.

872
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:11,081
Jeong-bin, take a look. Isn't it pretty?

873
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,503
-Is that sikhye?
-Yes.

874
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,338
Please have some. You must be hungry.

875
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,547
Not at all.

876
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:23,551
I'll watch the baby
while you buy her some dinner.

877
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:25,387
Not at all. I need to get going.

878
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,848
Goodness. Did we keep you here
when you're busy?

879
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,850
No, I just need to order a cake.

880
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,102
They'll be sold out on the day.

881
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:39,943
So?

882
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:42,696
She didn't say
what they talked about and I couldn't ask.

883
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,574
You should borrow a page
from Ji-a's book sometimes.

884
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:47,909
You want me to be like her?

885
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,787
Yes, since you explode from time to time.

886
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:53,164
With good reason.
You know what it's been like.

887
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:56,876
Whatever.
I saw a different side to Ji-a today.

888
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,881
It's Dad!

889
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:10,557
-Dad, your paralysis is gone.
-It is.

890
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,521
Are you done with your treatments?

891
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:17,439
Yes.

892
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,650
-Here. I wanted to thank you.
-There's no need.

893
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,945
You took me to a clinic
that came highly recommended.

894
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,030
It's fine.

895
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,615
You're embarrassing me
in front of the kids.

896
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,580
I bet you haven't had dinner.

897
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,541
They're not hungry,
so we were taking our time.

898
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,043
May I sit?

899
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,880
Is there something you need to say?

900
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,006
You should sit too.

901
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,564
I'll cut right to the chase.

902
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,442
Let's go back to how things were.

903
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,741
Go back how? After all this time?

904
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,993
I have repented hundreds of times.

905
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:16,331
And I will not make
the same mistake again. Ever.

906
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:18,625
Please forgive me.

907
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,003
Forgive me, guys.

908
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,426
I'm going to devote myself
to you and the family.

909
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,553
This is wrong. It's over between us.

910
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:33,890
I'll do whatever is needed
to earn your forgiveness.

911
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,144
Yours as well.

912
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,690
It was stupid of me.

913
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,902
I didn't realize
that I had what most people desire.

914
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:51,366
I looked back on my ways
and repented with tears.

915
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:53,868
I'll beg on my knees if I must.

916
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,787
Are you here to confuse the children?

917
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,831
-No, to apologize.
-You should go for now.

918
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:03,211
Go home and meet me at Deung tomorrow.

919
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:07,132
-Do you have plans for Christmas Eve?
-We do.

920
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:09,592
-U-ram, what about you?
-We're going skiing.

921
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:12,971
With Mom and Hyang-gi.

922
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:14,222
Where? Yongpyong?

923
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,684
I'll drive.

924
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,770
-Did you throw my skis out?
-I did.

925
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,982
I'll buy a pair or rent one at the resort.

926
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:32,490
Actually, I'm fine with just driving you.

927
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:34,868
Mom…

928
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:42,208
You can go without me
if you don't feel like it.

929
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,126
Follow me out.

930
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,181
Mom, you can talk here.

931
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,391
Come on.

932
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,731
-I'll get going then.
-Sure.

933
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,071
Dad will be shocked.

934
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:16,367
What do we do?

935
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,786
You should go after them.

936
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,539
You stay home.

937
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,792
It's late, so have tea instead.

938
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:32,383
Two cups of chamomile tea, please.

939
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:53,071
MR. SEO

940
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,290
Good health is everything.

941
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,251
Anything cold is bad for you.

942
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,253
You should cut back on coffee too.

943
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,301
Letting it soak for too long--

944
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,344
I'm getting married.

945
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,187
You're getting married?

946
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,775
-With whom?
-That's what you want to know?

947
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:34,195
-This must be a joke.
-Since when do I joke?

948
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:40,785
Do the kids know?

949
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:47,542
-When?
-In the new year. Next month.

950
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,086
Don't pry. It's a long story.

951
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,175
Do the kids approve?

952
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,970
Did you have their approval?
They're not against it.

953
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,974
Don't confuse them
with this issue ever again.

954
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:03,933
What does he do?

955
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:07,020
I don't need to answer that
and you have no right to ask.

956
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,646
I wouldn't do anything about it.

957
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,440
I don't want to explain myself to you.

958
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:27,373
I made a fool out of myself
in front of the kids.

959
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:32,378
Do you really love him?
Or is there another reason?

960
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,590
What other reason?

961
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:38,885
You don't easily open your heart.
How long have you known him?

962
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,387
It turns out
we knew each other a long time ago.

963
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,140
We're done here, right?

964
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,021
Take good care of yourself

965
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:52,440
so that the kids won't worry.

966
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,902
Is he taking you skiing?

967
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,436
Why didn't you come in?

968
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:13,062
-My gosh.
-Were you leaving?

969
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,189
I brought over
a portable seat for Jeong-bin,

970
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:17,400
but I thought Father
would be uncomfortable.

971
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:19,235
Don't be absurd.

972
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:23,656
Shouldn't the housekeeper
take out the trash?

973
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,324
I wanted some fresh air.

974
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,827
-Here. It looks heavy.
-It's actually not.

975
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:31,748
Sa-hyeon's father is taking a shower

976
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:33,708
and Sa-hyeon went to a friend's wedding.

977
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,710
An evening wedding?

978
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:38,671
No, but he probably stayed behind
for the after-party.

979
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,965
-Which friend?
-He teaches English.

980
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:44,719
Oh, him. He must have found someone
that satisfies his high standards.

981
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:52,143
-My gosh.
-Hye-ryung's here.

982
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:53,060
Sure.

983
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,773
-I'll wash my hands here.
-Sure.

984
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,569
-You probably haven't eaten.
-I had some cake.

985
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,866
Gosh, he's awake.

986
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,034
Allow me.

987
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,661
He had his milk,
so he must have wet himself.

988
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:17,585
Hey.

989
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,299
What's that?

990
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,968
A portable seat.

991
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:30,014
Gosh, how cute is this?

992
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:32,517
They make
just about everything these days.

993
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,352
When will we get to take him out?

994
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:35,561
When he can sit up.

995
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,814
He could sit with us at the dining table.

996
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:39,482
We could eat with him.

997
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:44,195
Nice and dry.

998
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,364
Feels good, doesn't it?

999
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:50,159
Let's stretch.

1000
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,331
Jeong-bin.

1001
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,662
I just suddenly got emotional.

1002
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:17,788
Is your world falling apart?

1003
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:23,920
Maybe I was just seeing things.

1004
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,296
That can't be.

1005
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:28,049
You didn't even call.

1006
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:32,970
-I just can't believe it.
-I did well, right?

1007
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:33,888
You're the best.

1008
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:37,558
He didn't call or text yesterday.

1009
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:40,227
Maybe he fell for a blonde in Germany.

1010
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:51,030
I'm here. Should I go up?

1011
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:04,877
