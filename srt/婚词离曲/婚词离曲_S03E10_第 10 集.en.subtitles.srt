00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,758
EPISODE 10

2
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,774
You're here.

3
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,026
Hi.

4
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,704
You must work out every day.

5
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,831
Of course.

6
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,668
If you haven't
worked out today, I'll join.

7
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,002
Sure.

8
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,922
Let me get changed.

9
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,097
You're going to work out together?

10
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:20,974
Yes.

11
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,792
Your sikhye is the best.

12
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,210
It has a lot of malts.

13
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,760
Did you not have lunch?

14
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,761
I had a light meal.

15
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,848
-Do you want something before working out?
-I'll prepare it myself.

16
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,478
What's gotten into her?

17
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,856
She always used to come up
with excuses not to eat.

18
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,693
You must've been thirsty.

19
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,949
I made some yukgaejang
for Father because he craved it.

20
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,161
That sounds good.

21
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,245
Sit down.

22
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,052
Sure, take as much as you want.

23
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,437
I have no meat dishes.

24
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,773
There are only seasoned vegetables.

25
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,691
Let me grill some fish.

26
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,487
It's okay, Mother.
Seasoned vegetables are delicious.

27
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,533
HAPPY ALL-YEAR-ROUND SLED PARK

28
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,431
Did you not have lunch?

29
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,766
She had a light one.

30
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,726
I need the energy to work out.

31
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,856
That's right.

32
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,819
-You're eating so well.
-Should I eat too?

33
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,571
You should.

34
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,659
Let me.

35
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,869
That's okay. Keep eating.

36
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,961
I should have prepared some meat.

37
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,629
I always have meat when I eat out.

38
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,844
How about a fried egg?

39
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,846
Yes, please.

40
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,225
Fried eggs are my specialty.

41
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,320
Mom!

42
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,699
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

43
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,451
This way.

44
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,545
Right. Let me peel some fruit.

45
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,299
Do you have tangerines?

46
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,675
Yes. Apples too.

47
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,802
Tangerines will be fine.

48
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,262
Okay.

49
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,306
Is your workout outfit in your car?

50
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,223
Of course.

51
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,768
Isn't Jeong-bin adorable?

52
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,063
Absolutely.

53
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,777
Does he look like me?

54
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,111
He does.

55
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,824
I can peel them myself.

56
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,744
Just keep eating.

57
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,955
You need to teach me how to make
this dried pollack dish.

58
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,709
But you're too busy.

59
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,924
It must be tiring to raise Jeong-bin.

60
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:30,056
Not if you think that
he's a treasure and a gift from heaven.

61
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,817
More rice?

62
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,110
Yes.

63
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,864
Hello, Father.

64
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,741
Hey, where are you guys going?

65
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,118
To the gym.

66
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,329
Does your back hurt?

67
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,082
Maybe it's because I sleep on the floor.

68
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,626
I heard sleeping
on a hard floor isn't good for you.

69
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,295
I'll buy you a bed.

70
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,672
Is that true?

71
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,756
Yes.

72
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,260
Let's work out next time
and go shopping instead.

73
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,845
Why is she speaking so formally?

74
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,597
-Sure.
-I can buy it myself. Go on, then.

75
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:15,643
No, Father. Back pain is very painful.

76
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,770
-You can go home first.
-Then I'll tag along.

77
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,565
-I should test them out.
-Would you like that?

78
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,987
-I'm not sleepy at all.
-Me neither.

79
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,240
Are you thirsty?
I forgot to bring a water bottle.

80
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,450
I am.

81
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,536
-You weren't asleep?
-Only for half the time.

82
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,894
I didn't know there was a place like this.
Have you been here before?

83
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,687
No. I had to look it up.

84
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,939
Isn't it impressive?

85
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,529
Do you want a cake?

86
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,615
Yes.

87
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,992
There are so many great places in Korea.

88
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,999
This is nice.

89
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,419
Sledding was fun.

90
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,630
It was my first time.

91
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,091
-What about you?
-I sled in Switzerland.

92
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,802
I've only been there
in the summer and fall.

93
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:35,389
The slopes there
are dangerous and slippery,

94
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,891
so we wear helmets.

95
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,684
It's several kilometers long.
It's not bad.

96
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,771
Goodness. Are the slopes that long?

97
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,066
It's beautiful. There are fir forests too.

98
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,735
Let me know if you ever want to go.

99
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,695
-How about tomorrow?
-Hey.

100
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,448
-Let's check the flights.
-She's joking.

101
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,825
It was just a wish.

102
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,037
-I'd love to go right now.
-Then let's go.

103
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,580
Who knows what the future holds?

104
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,083
I don't have time to go.

105
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,046
I used to be pressured about studying.

106
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:11,217
But just like how good things
always come to an end,

107
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,552
so do your studies and misfortunes.

108
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,680
Take me for an example.

109
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,983
All the furniture here is pretty.

110
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,277
The beds are this way.

111
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,737
I want something comfortable.

112
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,407
This design is the most popular.

113
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,118
The texture feels cozy and warm.

114
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,288
Our customers really like this one
because it blends well

115
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,206
with the rest of their furniture.

116
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,666
-Can I lie down?
-Of course.

117
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,502
This mattress is a new product as well.

118
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,051
I'm in heaven.

119
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,554
-Here.
-No!

120
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,763
I should buy it for him.

121
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,640
Of course. I'll let my son treat me.

122
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:03,144
I should give you something for once
after all you've given me.

123
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,855
What's taking him so long?

124
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,110
Maybe there's a ghost in the toilet.

125
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,072
That's such a lame joke.

126
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:19,452
When I was little, my great-aunt told me
about a ghost who lived in a toilet.

127
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,412
I was terrified.

128
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,707
I couldn't go to the toilet
by myself at night for a while.

129
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,376
Maybe he's smoking.

130
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,586
He doesn't smoke.

131
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,213
I'll look at it tomorrow.

132
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,882
Goodbye.

133
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,688
I'll definitely lose.

134
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,579
No.

135
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,266
Play with me.

136
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,351
Okay.

137
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,354
Technique over strength.

138
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,899
Can you get me my scarf?

139
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,706
You should marry him.

140
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,168
You should marry him.

141
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,380
You look great together.

142
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,382
Do you mean that?

143
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,600
I was worried about you.

144
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,603
I was just about to call you.
It's cold outside.

145
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,272
I got a bed.

146
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,275
I'm glad you did.
We'll be here for a long time.

147
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,361
About Hye-ryung…

148
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,448
She's changed.

149
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,824
She's gentle and polite now.

150
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,245
Did you notice that too? How did you know?

151
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,872
I met her outside.

152
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,167
We picked out a bed together.
Sa-hyeon was there too.

153
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,586
-She's very soft-spoken.
-That's right.

154
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,921
She used to always refuse to eat,

155
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,507
but she finished an entire bowl of rice.

156
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,886
Seeing her eat
must have made Sa-hyeon hungry.

157
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,971
He had a filling meal too.

158
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,222
I'm glad.

159
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,949
Korean parents used to tell their kids

160
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,577
not to get beaten up by others.

161
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:10,080
-Do you know what Japanese parents say?
-No.

162
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,749
"Don't inconvenience others."

163
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,418
Chinese parents say, "Don't get duped."

164
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,047
This is the lobster dish for Course C.

165
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,388
Enjoy.

166
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,473
Thank you.

167
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,812
Go on and eat. I don't eat much.

168
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,564
-Why not?
-For my health.

169
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,234
You should at least have a bite.

170
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,110
I don't like lobsters.

171
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,071
That's why I got Course A for you.

172
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,658
You remembered?

173
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,507
There's nothing to eat.

174
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,302
To be exact, there's no junk food.

175
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,431
Roasted sweet potatoes?

176
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,308
Yes. It's not ready yet.

177
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,856
Mr. Seo is really considerate.

178
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,650
I could tell by the food he ordered.

179
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:24,071
It was the best lobster of my life
though I haven't had many.

180
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,531
All the dishes were tasty.

181
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,867
Mr. Seo's father wasn't that scary, right?

182
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,788
INCOMING CALL
DAD

183
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,040
It's Dad.

184
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,844
Pick it up.

185
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,309
-Yes?
-It's me.

186
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,520
-Hello.
-Can I see you and U-ram tomorrow?

187
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,941
Can't we just talk over the phone?

188
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,568
It'll only take 20 minutes.

189
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,750
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

190
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,086
Thanks for coming.

191
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,087
It was fun.

192
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,214
-See you again.
-Okay.

193
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,762
Rest up.

194
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,558
Okay. Text me when you get home.

195
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,476
You too.

196
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,898
I'm going to the gym first.

197
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,652
He must not be tired.

198
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:48,489
Working out makes you less tired
and more energetic.

199
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:53,452
I'm also going to work out diligently
starting tomorrow with U-ram's mom.

200
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,080
Will she be wearing a wedding dress too?

201
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:57,831
Of course.

202
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,500
It's hard to imagine.

203
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:03,253
A wedding dress can make
any woman look gorgeous.

204
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,214
Then I guess I should marry at least once

205
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,840
just to wear the dress.

206
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,300
Okay.

207
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,056
Sa-hyeon is going to watch
a movie with Hye-ryung.

208
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,310
What's gotten into them?

209
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,106
-They used to ignore each other.
-Beats me.

210
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,278
How capricious.

211
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,072
You mean Hye-ryung?

212
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,256
My gosh!

213
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,674
I'm so pissed.

214
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,520
Are you sure it wasn't on a whim?

215
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,773
-Do you stand by your words?
-I do.

216
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,735
Why would I say that on a whim?

217
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,988
What about him made you change your mind?

218
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,116
Are those made of rice or wheat?

219
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,868
Do you like wheat? This is rice cake.

220
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,953
-I like rice cake.
-Me too.

221
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:00,996
I prefer wheat cakes.

222
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,129
Here.

223
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,758
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

224
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,677
-Thank you.
-Of course.

225
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,305
It's tasty and not salty.

226
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,390
Wheat cakes don't have a nice texture.

227
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,975
They're not chewy.

228
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,310
That's the beauty of it.

229
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,646
Should we go to a sled park?

230
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,980
Because of me?

231
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,398
It'll help us digest.

232
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,567
But not if you don't want to.

233
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,700
Can I call you Mr. Seo?

234
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,413
Sure.

235
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,706
Because he made good food.

236
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,086
I like how he's not unnecessarily chatty.

237
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,046
And he doesn't try to impress me.

238
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,926
Is he also quiet when it's just you two?
Does he not talk much?

239
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,139
Well, I'd say
he's just simple with his words.

240
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,892
He jokes around at times
and makes lousy jokes.

241
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,352
But you know what?

242
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,564
He's too young. Even I can tell.

243
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,525
What can I do?

244
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,487
Should I give him a tough time
and make him age faster?

245
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,446
That's not right.

246
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,869
I know a part of you

247
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,954
feels hurt, right?

248
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:24,997
I'm not hurt.

249
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,792
And now that I think of it,
it's not bad news either.

250
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,546
This is your life,
and I have my own life to live.

251
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,339
That's true.

252
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:38,343
But it's sad to hear that from you.

253
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,387
It's not like you'll abandon me.

254
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,347
Are you crazy? That's ridiculous.

255
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,975
When will we get together
with him and his brother?

256
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:45,893
Soon.

257
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,067
INCOMING CALL
A MI

258
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,822
Yes?

259
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,115
It's me.

260
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,910
I'm in front of your house.
Can I see you for a minute?

261
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,286
Just come up.

262
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,579
Can I?

263
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,460
I'm sorry I'm late.

264
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,003
It's okay.

265
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,047
Is that it?

266
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,840
-Yes.
-It fits you, right?

267
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,300
She should still try it on.

268
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,262
You must be busy
preparing for your wedding.

269
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,932
There's not much to do,
but I'm still busy.

270
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:28,393
She changed into a different person
after being in a good mood all day.

271
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,520
She even chopped off her long hair.

272
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,106
So I heard. Ji-a was surprised.

273
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,650
It doesn't seem like dementia.

274
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,069
I heard they become forgetful.

275
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,904
I heard the symptoms differ
from person to person.

276
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,822
Some people become violent.

277
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,452
The knife was stuck in the cutting board,
and Yu-sin wasn't picking up.

278
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,538
I was too scared to be home.

279
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,541
On top of that,
we've always been on bad terms.

280
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,168
He must have finished working out.

281
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,799
He'll call.

282
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,677
Right. I heard you
and Boo Hye-ryung fought.

283
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,721
How do you two know each other?

284
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,852
They say it's a small world,
and that we're all connected.

285
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,813
That's how.

286
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,061
Your mom's showering.

287
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,359
Here.

288
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,778
Ban got it for you.

289
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,946
He wants you to be healthy.

290
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,823
He got this for me?

291
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,658
Yes.

292
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,707
JOINT SUPPLEMENTS

293
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,167
He went out of his way to get it?

294
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,626
Yes, he did.

295
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,379
I'm surprised.

296
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,214
I wonder why he bought this.

297
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,593
Because he cares about you.
You're not getting any younger.

298
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,470
How was the dinner?

299
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,972
It was all right.

300
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,182
I'm glad you went.

301
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,143
People around her think of her fondly.

302
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,895
She seemed kind-hearted.

303
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,522
She's not the type
who'd trouble her husband.

304
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,940
Then it's good.

305
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,193
They say you can't even
trust your own siblings.

306
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,903
You say you care for him, but--

307
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,321
He likes her.

308
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,572
Sure, but for how long?

309
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,450
He'll regret it eventually.
He's a man after all.

310
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,951
Good night.

311
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,037
Why did you end it with Nam Ga-bin?

312
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,705
You seemed so set on marrying her.

313
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,998
We just weren't meant to be.

314
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:00,128
You've had your fun.
Now, listen to your mom.

315
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,838
Many women want to marry you.

316
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,886
Observe her closely
not as her family, but as a doctor.

317
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,137
She's really strange.

318
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,514
You're at fault too.

319
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,266
You only pretend to help out.

320
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,186
She makes all the side dishes.
No wonder she's irritated.

321
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,729
What are you talking about?

322
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,440
She always makes me prepare the fish.

323
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:24,111
Also, is that a valid reason
to stick a knife into a cutting board?

324
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,862
Then she was childish enough
to say, "I'm pissed."

325
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,241
That's because she's been exposed
to that word. Even Ji-a says it.

326
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:32,327
That expression is widely used
on TV and the internet.

327
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,163
What is this world coming to?

328
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,541
A stitch in time saves nine.

329
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,043
"Nine" what?

330
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,548
It's due to the hormonal imbalance
during menopause.

331
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,924
They get mood swings.

332
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,904
That's so hilarious.

333
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,615
What's so funny?

334
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:14,119
What took you so long?

335
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:17,038
Variety shows are funnier
than comedies nowadays.

336
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,250
Did you have dinner?

337
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,880
No. How could I when the man
of the house hasn't come home yet?

338
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,891
A Mi, set the table.

339
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,559
Okay.

340
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,565
You didn't have to knock.

341
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,070
Take care of your skin with this.

342
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,489
I'm already old and wrinkly.

343
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,618
Mom, people can tell
if you're taking care of yourself or not.

344
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,203
It's not too late.

345
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:04,211
Be careful not to catch a cold either.

346
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,466
I should.

347
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,218
We've switched positions.

348
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,846
If this was back in the day,
you would've gotten married already.

349
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,390
People get married late now
since they can live longer.

350
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:21,353
You're right.
In the past, people rarely lived past 60.

351
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,356
But that means they'll give birth late.

352
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,816
The bride and the groom will enter now.

353
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,068
ALARM

354
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,579
MS. SA PI-YOUNG

355
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,045
Are you up?

356
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,088
Sorry.

357
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:34,509
WHY ARE YOU

358
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,811
-Hello?
-Why are you sorry?

359
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:47,605
I just woke up
and texted you for no reason

360
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,649
to see if you were up.

361
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,234
Do you think of me when you wake up?

362
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,193
Because I do.

363
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,863
I have something to tell you in person.

364
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,282
Are you sure? Or do you just miss me?

365
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,825
-Both.
-I'll be right over.

366
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,619
-Really?
-In exactly 30 minutes.

367
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,289
You're not going to shower?

368
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,457
See you in a bit.

369
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,171
Did you sleep well?

370
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:54,923
Yes.

371
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,597
You rushed over
and didn't even brush your hair.

372
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,142
Of course. Stroke my hair a bit more.

373
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,524
Do you wear sweatsuits to bed?

374
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,484
No.

375
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:17,070
Even if I did,
I wouldn't have come out in pajamas.

376
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,865
Why do you think I called you?

377
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,034
What did Ji-a say about me?

378
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,833
She wants me to marry you.

379
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,169
-Did you sleep in the same bed?
-No.

380
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,212
Then she said this yesterday.

381
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,340
Why tell me now?

382
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,591
You didn't ask yesterday.

383
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,719
You told me to rest,
so I thought you were asleep.

384
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,012
It's only a day apart.

385
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,809
That hurts.

386
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,270
You can slap me for hurting you.

387
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,282
-Resign from work today.
-Can I just take a leave first?

388
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,618
I can quit whenever I want.

389
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:06,745
Would you like that?

390
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,207
Okay, then.

391
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,920
You should hurry home.
You said your father wakes up early.

392
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:19,549
I haven't eaten anything
since the cafe yesterday.

393
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,761
Why are you on a diet?

394
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,345
You're not entering a contest.

395
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,388
I'm not dieting.

396
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,556
You should go.

397
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,392
I'm too weak to drive.

398
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,772
My hands are about to tremble.

399
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,190
Then hurry and go eat.

400
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,149
That's so cold.

401
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:40,236
I'd love to cook you something,
but what would Ji-a think if she woke up?

402
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,990
What if she thinks you sneaked in
and spent the night? I'll be humiliated.

403
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,033
Tell her the truth.

404
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,411
Come on. There will be a traffic jam soon.
Hurry up and go.

405
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,704
Fine.

406
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:58,963
Come over for dinner.

407
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,884
Right. Ban asked us to dinner.

408
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:04,844
Si-eun too?

409
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:09,224
Our father must have had
a good impression of her.

410
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,100
He's a great judge of character.

411
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,180
Let's be honest today.

412
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,518
Do you truly support and like
the fact that your mom is getting married?

413
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,937
-Yes.
-What about U-ram?

414
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,982
It's her life.

415
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,609
Just tell me how you truly feel.

416
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,696
Do you want him to say no?

417
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:07,532
This isn't a courtroom.
Why are you being so cynical?

418
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,158
Why did you ask?

419
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,202
Are you curious what we think?

420
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:14,372
Mom seems to be happy. Even we can tell.

421
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,208
How would you feel
living under the same roof as him?

422
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,794
I wouldn't be able
to call him Dad off the bat.

423
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,087
That's not important.

424
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,882
Of course, it is.
You'll have to address him one day.

425
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,884
Or will you say, "Hey" or "sir"?

426
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,845
I think we can start off
by calling him "Mr. Seo".

427
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:32,140
Don't be ridiculous.
It'll be too difficult to change it later.

428
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,391
This is our concern.

429
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,061
Let me tell you what I think.

430
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,815
Let her be happy with that man.

431
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,984
You two can live with me.

432
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,111
That's only natural.

433
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,906
She's taking this marriage seriously.
She's not like you.

434
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,115
Come to your senses.

435
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:52,118
He will have to live
with his full-grown stepchildren.

436
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,162
Would you like that?

437
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,122
I know you didn't agree
because you liked it.

438
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:59,250
You just want to live with your mom.
You had no choice.

439
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,003
Are you saying we're buy-one-get-one-free?

440
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,923
Try to understand what I mean
instead of nitpicking.

441
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,843
Convince her.

442
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,679
And think in her shoes.

443
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,724
She must feel guilty.
I can't say she's all happy.

444
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,602
We spent some time at a ski resort,
and everything was fine.

445
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,979
He truly likes us and treats us well.

446
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,524
They're all like that at first.
And that was a trip, not daily life.

447
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,402
And they'll be newlyweds.

448
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,695
You've seen it in dramas.

449
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,448
They will want to joke around
and show affection.

450
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,909
But how will they do that
when you're there too?

451
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,537
As a man, I know very well how he'll feel.

452
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,998
He'll become more discontent
as days go by.

453
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:42,001
Only those who are two-faced
or have multiple personalities

454
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:46,172
can hide their true feelings
until the very end.

455
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:55,682
Fools only know that the water is hot
once they dip their hands in it.

456
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,685
But those who are wise
don't even bother to touch it.

457
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,605
Explain it to her.

458
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,773
You won't be far away.

459
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,234
You'll just be living apart from her.

460
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,654
You can just live apart for a year or two.

461
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:12,782
Give them some space
during their honeymoon phase.

462
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,117
She wouldn't want that.

463
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,077
I know how convincing you can be.

464
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,329
Living together
isn't always the best option.

465
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,583
Like some married couples do,
you can sleep over once a week.

466
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,295
I doubt your stepdad
will treat you better than I do.

467
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,300
Give it some thought.

468
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,886
Which option do you think
will be best for her

469
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,888
and lessen her burden?

470
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,642
She was always chained down by her family.

471
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,728
As soon as we got married,

472
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,147
she moved in
with her in-laws then had you two.

473
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,649
We never had a honeymoon phase.

474
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,778
I'll give you my word.

475
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:54,032
I'll bring food to the table.
I'll feed you good food.

476
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,908
I can also cook now.

477
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,161
And we can always buy side dishes.

478
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,381
Did Mr. Seo buy you that?

479
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,841
It suits you.

480
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,428
I bought this.
I decided to splurge for once.

481
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,347
You look so stylish.

482
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,518
How was your father-in-law?

483
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,604
It seemed like he took a liking to you.

484
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,898
He's extremely charismatic.

485
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,149
Were you intimidated?

486
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:32,153
He tried to make me feel comfortable.
And the kids too.

487
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:38,034
Don't worry. He approved of me.

488
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,911
I put myself in his parents' shoes,

489
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,206
and I think they'll be speechless
and dumbfounded.

490
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:47,460
Both of their sons
are getting married to divorcées

491
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,378
despite having no flaws themselves.

492
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,463
What can they do?

493
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,466
We should start bracing ourselves.

494
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,260
We need to accept the fact
that we can't control our kids.

495
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,765
About Hye-ryung…

496
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:03,434
Turns out, she's pretty sly

497
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,686
and two-faced.

498
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,938
Why do you say that?

499
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,574
HYE-RYUNG

500
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,868
Hello?

501
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,121
It's me, Mother.

502
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,205
Hey.

503
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,625
Did Jeong-bin cry last night?

504
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:31,295
He woke up twice because he was hungry.

505
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,381
That's not bad at all.

506
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,342
Are you coming over for dinner?

507
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,219
Is it okay if I'm a bit late?

508
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,262
Of course.

509
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:42,348
Is there anything you need?

510
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,725
Or anything you want to eat?

511
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,311
No, there's nothing.
What time will you be here?

512
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,438
-About 9 p.m.
-Okay.

513
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,816
Okay. Goodbye, Mother.

514
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:52,984
Bye.

515
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,740
Is she taking medication or something?

516
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,119
She's not being capricious.

517
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,122
Hyang-gi.

518
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,671
Don't you think Dad's right?

519
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,467
We'd feel more comfortable
living with him.

520
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,554
That's not true. He brought so much drama.

521
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:24,015
-But in Mom's shoes--
-Would she be happy without us?

522
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,225
That's not what I mean. But like Dad said,

523
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:30,146
I think Mr. Seo
may feel uncomfortable over time.

524
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,064
You should talk with her.

525
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,985
-Okay?
-This isn't a simple matter.

526
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,613
I'd also feel that way
if I were Mr. Seo. It's natural.

527
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:43,159
It'd be better for Dad
to live with us than live alone.

528
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,785
And we'd feel comfortable too.

529
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:49,290
Let's be honest.
We were worried about him.

530
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,709
You were too. Right?

531
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:57,131
Living with him will help him
forget about Mom.

532
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,592
And I like this house.

533
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,427
We were so happy when we moved here.

534
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,805
Can you live apart from Mom?
You're the youngest.

535
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,767
I'm no longer a kid.
I'll be in middle school soon.

536
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,810
I'll have you and Dad.

537
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,646
And we can visit her on the weekends.

538
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:15,733
Grandma used to say
being at peace was the most important.

539
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:24,867
Goodness.

540
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,831
Hello. I'm a fan of yours.

541
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,208
I see.

542
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,670
I was just going to leave them here.

543
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,798
-You brought this all the way up here?
-I did.

544
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,304
-Please come inside.
-No, that's okay.

545
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,723
Please come in. Let me offer you some tea.

546
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,766
But…

547
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,185
Come in.

548
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:53,980
Oh, my.

549
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,816
Your house is lovely.

550
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:00,945
I have jujube tea and black tea.

551
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,823
Either one is fine.
Actually, black tea would be great.

552
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,659
Right. You should put this in the fridge.

553
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,872
I brought some kimchi
and a few side dishes.

554
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,958
It must have been tiring
to carry these up.

555
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,460
You came when the elevator isn't working.

556
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,504
I took my time.

557
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,343
I was browsing through
the TV channels last night

558
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,137
and saw your performance of Miekka.

559
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,180
You looked incredible.

560
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,808
I'm sorry,
but I didn't know you before that.

561
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,728
Only those who watch musicals know me.

562
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,855
I was filled with emotions,
and my heart raced.

563
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,357
I just wanted to give you something.

564
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,819
Did my agency inform you of my address?

565
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,321
Of course not.

566
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,743
My friend's husband works
in this line of work, so I asked him.

567
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,661
I'm truly sorry for this inconvenience.

568
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,538
I was going to leave them by the door.

569
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:55,333
Strangely, I wanted
to come home early today.

570
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,959
And my schedule got canceled too.

571
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,503
Goodness. Maybe fate brought us together.

572
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,213
Perhaps so.

573
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,132
This feels surreal.

574
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,217
None of my friends will believe me.

575
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,386
-Send them a photo of us.
-Really?

576
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,680
Will you really take one with me?

577
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,768
Say cheese.

578
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,065
It turned out great.

579
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:21,942
Should we take another one?

580
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,820
That's okay. You're much prettier than me.

581
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,906
That's just ridiculous.

582
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,408
Thank you.

583
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,453
I know that cooking
requires a lot of effort.

584
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:36,374
I looked you up online and saw
you had gone through so much recently.

585
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,667
I just thought
you'd miss your mother's food.

586
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,755
Let me know whenever you crave something.

587
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,883
Just text me since you're busy.
I can leave them with the guard.

588
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,260
I'm a decent cook.

589
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,557
I also had to say goodbye to my husband.

590
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,606
Are they here?

591
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,324
This is Ms. Lee Si-eun.

592
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,120
Hello. I remember your face.

593
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,121
Me too.

594
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,545
You can speak casually to me.
I'm your future brother-in-law.

595
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:38,602
This reminds me
of the bean dish you made, Mom.

596
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,362
I'm loved

597
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:52,074
and acknowledged by many people.

598
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,869
That's all I need.

599
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,080
I don't need a man.

600
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,793
Do you know his strengths and flaws?

601
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,296
I'm not sure.
I haven't noticed any flaws yet.

602
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,964
Let's talk about yours first.

603
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,551
You know my flaw, right?

604
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,677
They're subjective.

605
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,472
She has many strengths.

606
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,598
Stop it.

607
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,143
First, she's a good singer.
Don't you agree?

608
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:23,772
I do. She's also considerate,
and everyone knows how hardworking she is.

609
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,775
She's a great writer and a cook.

610
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,612
I'm not that good at cooking.

611
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:32,072
You're favoring the writer
more than the producer.

612
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,866
But it's true.

613
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:34,783
I never denied it.

614
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:40,581
Ban, my flaw is that
I'm attracted to naughty women.

615
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,294
I'm aware of it, but it can't be helped.

616
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,922
Your flaw is that you mean
the opposite of what you say.

617
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,008
Cheers.

618
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,515
You should get drunk today.

619
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,059
We've never seen him drunk, have we?

620
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:03,020
No. We'll probably see it in the future.

621
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,605
You're already such a caring wife.

622
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,315
-Ms. Lee.
-She'll be your sister-in-law.

623
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,192
Right. Si-eun.

624
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,696
Ban can surprisingly be a handful.
Did you know that?

625
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,781
In what ways?

626
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,659
He's never taken care of me.
It was always the other way.

627
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,494
Don't flatter yourself.

628
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:21,080
I have many flaws as well.

629
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,875
To be honest, I feel guilty.

630
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,670
He could have met a better woman.

631
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:28,921
The same goes for you.

632
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,590
We should let
these lovers talk in private.

633
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,427
-Let's finish our drinks.
-I know that's just an excuse.

634
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:41,600
Right. Make him promise you something
before you get married.

635
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,977
Promise me what?

636
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,521
That he won't ride bikes anymore.

637
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,482
Right. She knows.

638
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,485
About how we wore garbage bags
on our way back from Cheongpyeong.

639
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,159
Do you feel better now?

640
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,291
Isn't it nice?

641
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,594
You'll be able to sleep comfortably now.

642
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,678
Yes.

643
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,098
You're in a good mood.

644
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,269
-He recognizes you, doesn't he?
-He does.

645
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,313
Babies know

646
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:30,107
when someone likes or dislikes them.

647
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,276
They study your face.

648
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:40,909
I haven't seen a prettier baby than him.

649
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,621
-Right?
-Your daddy is going to be late.

650
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,039
Did you call him?

651
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:45,998
Yes.

652
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:55,215
Why aren't you drinking much today?

653
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:58,135
I'm enjoying the ambiance.
I'm not craving much alcohol.

654
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,763
-You shouldn't make her drink.
-Do you have nicknames?

655
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:02,973
Do you?

656
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,933
We didn't date for long.

657
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:06,977
Cutie.

658
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,735
-Tell us.
-We're not the affectionate type.

659
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,447
He's not? That's not true.

660
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,824
-Cutie.
-Gosh.

661
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,035
Pretend you didn't hear that.

662
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,204
You're drunk.

663
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,540
Don't cover your beautiful face.

664
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,918
-What's wrong with you?
-I'm just happy.

665
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,797
Mr. Seo, I'm sure you feel awkward.

666
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,965
I've seen him do
all sorts of embarrassing things.

667
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,343
Like what? Are you as honest as I am?

668
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:43,055
If he ever mistreats you,
let me know right away.

669
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,765
That won't happen.

670
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:49,645
Thanks to Cutie,
I've been born again. It's true.

671
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,980
What about him drew you in?

672
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:56,360
-Nothing?
-I think it was due to all those years.

673
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,113
We were already colleagues
for a very long time.

674
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,240
You guys look alike.

675
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,825
You're meant to be.

676
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,411
Are you really getting married?

677
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,081
Have you two held each other's hand?

678
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,875
Stop it, and let's go.

679
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,590
I know

680
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,927
my brother can be boring.

681
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,556
But please be good to him.

682
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,070
My heart aches

683
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,407
for my brother.

684
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,829
I know Si-eun will treat him well.

685
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,636
Aren't you sleepy?

686
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:07,723
Let's do this.

687
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,559
When Sa-hyeon and Hye-ryung are here,

688
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:14,897
let's make up an excuse
and leave the house.

689
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,107
Let's give them some privacy.

690
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,736
Don't you think she's changed?

691
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,654
-Hye-ryung?
-Yes.

692
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,282
I thought she was just being capricious,
but I was wrong.

693
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,117
Even the way she looks at us changed.

694
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,785
Tell me about it.

695
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:33,081
It must be because of Jeong-bin.
There's no other reason.

696
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:37,961
How wonderful would it be
if they rekindled their relationship?

697
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,379
And that's how it should be.

698
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:43,300
But how can we suggest it again?

699
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:44,968
Remember how embarrassed
we were last time?

700
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,386
It's all or nothing.

701
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,722
Let's help them out.

702
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:51,391
They even spoke to each other today.

703
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,768
Sa-hyeon's finally smiling.

704
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:55,395
Jeong-bin must have grown on her
in the past three days.

705
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,648
Maybe she wants to be his mom.

706
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,484
Women can be like that.

707
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:01,985
I hope so.

708
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:03,654
I'm home.

709
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,614
Hey.

710
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,742
-You just got off work?
-Yes.

711
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,412
Gosh, he must be tired.

712
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:22,464
Hello?

713
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,219
You should tell her today.

714
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,805
Don't drag it out.

715
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:32,140
Dad texted me again yesterday.

716
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,983
Did Mr. Seo not say anything?

717
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:42,985
I said yes.

718
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:46,572
Oh, that? He's happy and grateful.

719
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:51,827
Goodness.

720
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:55,747
It's him.

721
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,125
It's open. Come in.

722
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:04,590
Oh, my. A puppy out of the blue?

723
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,508
Hi.

724
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,054
A gift for you.

725
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,889
But if your mom says no, I'll keep it.

726
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,478
It's so cute.

727
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,943
Let me hold it too.

728
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:31,992
-Is it a small breed?
-Ever heard of Maltipoos?

729
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,246
Maltipoos?

730
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,832
I've heard of them.
Aren't they a Maltese-Poodle mix?

731
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,083
You're right.

732
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,961
Let's order chicken today.
It's been a while.

733
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:44,463
Okay.

734
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,257
Aren't you thirsty?

735
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,717
I had milk.

736
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,762
Mr. Seo wants to buy furniture soon.

737
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,555
We should buy new beds too.

738
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,265
Our mattresses are too worn-out.

739
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,518
I visited the house.
There are many built-in closets,

740
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,020
so you'll have enough space.

741
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,237
Do you have something to say?

742
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,991
Mom, we thought about it.

743
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:17,037
Because of many reasons,
I think it's best we live with Dad.

744
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:19,956
What do you mean?

745
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,750
You two will be newlyweds.

746
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,211
-We just need to study.
-And what's stopping you?

747
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:28,548
By next week, I will have quit work.
I'll have a lot of free time.

748
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:32,094
-I can solely focus on you.
-But in our point of view--

749
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,512
Did you meet your dad?

750
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,600
What did he say?

751
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,435
Does he want you to live with him?

752
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,522
But come to think of it,
what he said makes sense.

753
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:44,898
Not one bit.

754
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,608
Unbelievable.

755
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:50,362
We all need time to adjust.
And U-ram is going through puberty.

756
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,864
Then don't you think
I should be there for him?

757
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,200
I don't care where I live.

758
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:57,244
I just need to focus on my studies.

759
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:00,330
Dad and Hyang-gi
will help me with my studies.

760
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,416
Why would I get married
if we'll live apart?

761
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,460
You should live your life.
We're all grown up now.

762
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,212
You're only 14.

763
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:10,716
Raising and taking care of you two
is the most important part of my life.

764
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,426
And I can do anything for you now.

765
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,802
I know.

766
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:16,430
We'll just be sleeping
under different roofs.

767
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,015
You can stop by often and take care of us.

768
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,600
Ask anyone.

769
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:24,020
They'd all say getting married
and leaving the kids behind is absurd.

770
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,605
Not in our situation.

771
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:29,025
I don't think
I can call him "Dad" right away.

772
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,569
It's not natural either.

773
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:34,239
Like you said,
I agree that we need time to adjust.

774
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:37,242
Even married couples
are strangers at first.

775
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:40,078
But no one's forcing you to call him dad.

776
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,079
That's how we feel.

777
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,664
Things can't always be peachy.

778
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:45,709
It may be a bit uncomfortable
and awkward at first.

779
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:48,962
You don't need to worry about us anymore.

780
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:53,633
Thanks to you, we've grown up well.

781
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,803
-We should take care of ourselves.
-I agree.

782
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:03,393
You were never able
to live your own life until now.

783
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:09,357
You deserve to enjoy your life
on your own terms from now on.

784
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,067
Did your dad tell you to do this?

785
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,446
We'll move out one day.

786
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,239
Yes, but it's too early for that.

787
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,200
Only by a few years.

788
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:20,702
To be honest, we like Mr. Seo.

789
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,788
But Dad feels more comfortable.

790
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:29,002
You'll feel more at ease
if Dad lives with us.

791
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:30,295
Why are you doing this?

792
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:34,341
Many parents send
their kids abroad to study.

793
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,551
We'll still be living nearby.

794
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,804
-It's not a big deal.
-Think in my shoes--

795
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,305
I would have agreed to it.

796
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:41,932
I would have listened to us.

797
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,896
Mom, please do as we say this time around.

798
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:50,941
Is this what you want?

799
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:54,110
Dad said he'd cook us breakfast every day.

800
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,031
Don't be emotional.

801
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:03,245
We want to be at peace too.

802
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:10,085
Mom, this is the best solution
for all of us if we want peace.

803
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,254
Did I ever
make you do something you'd regret?

804
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,798
Just for a year. Or even a few months.

805
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:16,424
Let's live apart for six months.

806
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:30,230
Just enjoy your honeymoon phase
for a few months.

807
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:33,108
Honeymoon phase? I'm too old for that.

808
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:35,569
Mr. Seo and I are like friends.

809
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,029
We're not like other couples.

810
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,741
Were you uncomfortable in Yongpyong?

811
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,703
Let's just do this for a few months.

812
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:50,041
I think it's right
to give everything a try.

813
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:06,766
Forget it.

814
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,185
I'm not going to get married.

815
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,188
Then what about Mr. Seo?

816
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,905
At least give it some thought.

817
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,574
Promises should be kept.

818
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,784
We'll keep our promise too.

819
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,961
She would never choose
marriage over her kids.

820
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:38,965
Damn it.

821
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,011
Are we keeping it?

822
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,513
Of course, we can since I'll be home.

823
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,390
-Did you quit?
-A leave for now.

824
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,851
I'm so excited. Really?

825
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,950
-Are you that happy?
-Totally.

826
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,498
Should we order pet items online
or go get them ourselves?

827
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:12,999
We should shop for them ourselves.

828
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,126
-Do you have time?
-Yes, until 4 p.m.

829
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,587
Thank you. You made my wish come true.

830
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,798
My mom was against
having a pet all this time.

831
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:23,468
I heard they get
separation anxiety from being alone.

832
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,490
Look at these clothes.

833
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:47,492
They're still too big for the puppy.

834
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:48,868
How about this one?

835
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,038
It's pretty.

836
00:54:58,211 --> 00:54:59,587
You need this.

837
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,340
They constantly chew when teething.

838
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,968
-Here's your card.
-Thank you.

839
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:07,846
Let's go.

840
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,558
You need to name it.

841
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,351
Danchu.

842
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,436
"Danchu"?

843
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:17,022
Look at its eyes.
They look like black buttons.

844
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:19,858
I've always wanted a puppy
named "Danchu," meaning button.

845
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:22,444
-I like it.
-Doesn't it need vaccinations?

846
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:23,945
It's already had them.

847
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,073
Do you like it better than me?

848
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,825
I can't compare a dog to a human.

849
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,702
That's true. You're wise.

850
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:33,830
Ji-a.

851
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,624
Thank you for taking a liking to me.

852
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,085
I won't let you down.

853
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:42,005
I won't let either of you down.

854
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,566
-Non-alcoholic drinks, please.
-Okay.

855
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:11,868
I didn't need to tell you this,
but there's something you should know

856
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,954
about my brother.

857
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:20,627
DOES HE HAVE A KID?

858
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,471
-Your eldest son is here.
-Where?

859
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:32,847
Meeting room, seventh floor.

860
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,517
I'll see you tomorrow.

861
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,935
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

862
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:51,616
-You should have texted me.
-I heard you were in a meeting.

863
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,664
I told Si-eun your birthdate
since she asked.

864
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,916
She'd like to cook something for you.

865
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,127
But you're busy, right?

866
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:06,256
I'm telling you beforehand
in case you have a breakfast appointment.

867
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:07,924
Why do you think I won't make it?

868
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:14,347
-Where?
-My house. If you're okay with that.

869
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,015
I'm free that morning.

870
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,226
I already made dinner plans.

871
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,061
I see.

872
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,355
Invite Dong-ma's mom too.

873
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:25,191
Okay.

874
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,655
I saw that you sent me some supplements.

875
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,324
Thanks.

876
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:38,955
Take care of your health.
Your wedding's coming up.

877
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,041
You won't be living alone anymore.

878
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,669
You need to become the man of the house.

879
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,976
I will fully understand
if you break off this wedding.

880
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,481
I had only thought in our shoes until now.

881
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,232
But you should know everything about him

882
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:09,444
-before getting married.
-This won't change anything.

883
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,323
We trust and rely on each other

884
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:16,034
much more than others think.

885
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:19,496
And we've known
each other for decades now.

886
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,000
I could tell when I looked at him.

887
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,544
Don't worry.

888
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:32,258
I can finally understand
what you said to me last night.

889
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:10,672
Danchu.

890
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,758
Can we sleep together?

891
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,677
It'll become a habit.

892
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,221
-So what?
-Your bedsheets will smell.

893
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,557
Danchu can sleep in its own bed.

894
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,354
Make sure you clean up the poop too.

895
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:28,815
You need to do that much
if you want to raise a dog.

896
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,150
But I'm squeamish.

897
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,402
And so am I.

898
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,530
If you can't do it,
I'll tell him to take the puppy.

899
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:38,449
Once you two get married,
the puppy will be ours anyway.

900
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:40,201
His parents can take care of it.

901
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,452
No. I don't want that.

902
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:44,414
Then you should learn
to do things that aren't too nice.

903
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:46,457
You can't always do what you want to do.

904
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,336
Listen carefully.

905
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:53,214
I was swayed

906
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,259
just like you two were.

907
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,761
The wedding will go on as planned,

908
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,430
and we'll all live together.

909
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:06,352
How you'll address him won't matter.

910
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,064
It's possible that
small conflicts or discomfort

911
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:13,109
can snowball into something serious.

912
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,820
But it's all about
how much effort we put in.

913
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:20,575
It's not right to worry beforehand,
avoid the situation, and change your minds

914
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,827
without trying first.

915
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:26,581
We should all do our best
in our given positions

916
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:29,042
to create good results.

917
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,335
Am I wrong?

918
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,049
-U-ram?
-Okay.

919
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:40,178
You're finally going
through hurdles in life.

920
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:44,766
The first one was the divorce.

921
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:47,810
This could be the second hurdle.

922
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:52,190
It won't always be
as peachy as it was in Yongpyong.

923
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:55,026
I could hurt your feelings,

924
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:58,905
and Mr. Seo may not live up
to your expectations.

925
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:04,160
What I'm saying is,
things we least expect will occur.

926
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:12,919
But let's use the wisdom we have
to create the results we want.

927
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:14,962
I beg you.

928
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,007
Okay.

929
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:22,637
He'll be joining our sweet, little family.

930
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:25,431
We need to take initiative

931
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,893
and treat him well
so he won't feel left out.

932
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:31,229
I understand what you mean.

933
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:34,357
You may understand me,
but it'll be easier said than done.

934
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,527
I'm grateful for your love, Mom.

935
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:42,407
Parents these days
easily give up and abandon their kids.

936
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,288
I'm truly lucky

937
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:52,667
to have you two

938
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,920
as my children.

939
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,842
You're the best son
and daughter anyone could have.

940
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:06,055
You didn't tell him about this, did you?

941
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,143
Don't. He might feel hurt.

942
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,896
How do I put it?

943
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,441
My heart breaks for him.

944
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:21,904
I'll tell you next time.

945
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:49,015
What brings you here?

946
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:52,727
No reason. I just wanted to see your face.
Did you go to my house today?

947
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:56,063
No. My manager was feeling
under the weather.

948
01:02:57,064 --> 01:03:00,985
A new, luxury sauna opened up nearby.
I want to go.

949
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:04,155
Let's go. But what if they recognize you?

950
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:05,823
I'm not an actress.

951
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,828
No one's here.

952
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:21,088
Is this our first time at a sauna?

953
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:22,131
Yes.

954
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,969
I already feel relaxed.

955
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:31,682
Let me massage your shoulders.

956
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:34,602
That's okay.
You're probably more tired than I am.

957
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:46,113
You know my parents
are very grateful, right?

958
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:47,448
I also am grateful.

959
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:50,618
Seeing Jeong-bin gives me
a sense of comfort.

960
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:54,664
And he's happy to see me too.

961
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:59,001
I heard you're not seeing anyone.

962
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:00,878
No.

963
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:19,438
Can we get back together? I'd like that.

964
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:57,268
Hello?

965
01:04:57,351 --> 01:05:00,521
My friends want to throw me
a bachelor party.

966
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:01,606
A bachelor party?

967
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:04,483
Yes. They want to do it right now.

968
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,819
Do you want to go? Are you excited?

969
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:07,820
I'm asking you.

970
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,363
I wish you didn't go.

971
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,366
That's what I wanted to hear.

972
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:15,995
You know what?

973
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:17,747
Don't expect me

974
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:22,126
to call you by endearing nicknames.

975
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:23,336
Do you know why?

976
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,923
-Why?
-Because your name

977
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:32,261
always gave me a sense of yearning.

978
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:36,098
I've always wanted to call you by name.

979
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,685
I'm on cloud nine these days.

980
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,730
I can call your name whenever I want.

981
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,984
I don't need
any endearing nicknames either.

982
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,194
Si-eun.

983
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:50,029
Yes?

984
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:53,366
Can you grant me a wish?

985
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:54,867
Sure.

986
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,911
You don't even know what it is.

987
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:58,829
Just tell me while I'm being nice.

988
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:00,748
I might change my mind.

989
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,707
Okay.

990
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:05,962
I'll come over and tell you in person.

991
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,214
Don't come. You sound pretty drunk.

992
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:11,384
Then should I just go
to the bachelor party?

993
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,637
Hey, what's taking you so long?

994
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:18,224
Come here when you can.
I'll grant your wish.

995
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:33,072
Yes, Father.

996
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:35,908
Is it true that you're
looking at wedding venues?

997
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,870
Yes. How did you find out?

998
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:40,955
Through your mom.

999
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:43,916
Someone must have told her about it.

1000
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,126
I'll tell you in person.

1001
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:46,252
Sure.

1002
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:57,722
My wish is not to return home tonight.

1003
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,098
What's stopping you?

1004
01:07:00,224 --> 01:07:01,183
And sleep in the car?

1005
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:04,979
Why would you sleep there?
There are hotels nearby.

1006
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:07,773
Let me sleep over for tonight.
I'm in front of your place.

1007
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:14,405
No matter how long I waited,
you never invited me over.

1008
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:17,241
I'm sorry. I had no time.

1009
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:20,578
We prepared for the wedding in a rush.

1010
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:22,913
Then we spent
the little time we had in Yongpyong.

1011
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:25,041
Will you leave me standing by the door

1012
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,501
if I ring your doorbell?

1013
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:29,128
Of course not.

1014
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,672
Then can I sleep over?

1015
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:36,886
Your house was always filled
with warm lights

1016
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:39,013
whenever I looked up at it.

1017
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:41,682
I've always wanted to follow you inside.

1018
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:49,482
I really don't want to go back
to my cold, lonely house tonight.

1019
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:56,197
I can sleep on the sofa.
Or lay on a blanket on the floor.

1020
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,742
If you don't have
an extra blanket, a pillow will do.

1021
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:01,494
I can use my clothes as a blanket.

1022
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:05,664
Should I ask U-ram myself?

1023
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:07,500
If I can sleep over?

1024
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:11,003
Come up in ten minutes.

1025
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:20,846
Are my parents asleep?

1026
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,224
No, the chairman is in the bathroom.

1027
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:25,351
And your mother is visiting her brother.

1028
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,278
What for?

1029
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:37,446
I didn't ask.

1030
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:42,952
Did something happen to Uncle?

1031
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:45,830
They fought over something
and want a divorce.

1032
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,666
It's nothing.

1033
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:50,209
If they were serious,

1034
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,628
they would have done it
and not called your mother.

1035
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:56,757
You're not dating a singer again, are you?

1036
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:58,634
-No.
-What's her occupation?

1037
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:00,761
A producer.

1038
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,138
Is she self-assertive?

1039
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:03,764
You can say that.

1040
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:08,144
You've met the right one. How old is she?

1041
01:09:58,485 --> 01:09:59,737
Ga-bin, it's absurd.

1042
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:01,655
Song Won will be turning in her grave.

1043
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:03,324
What kind of daughter-in-law do you want?

1044
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:07,328
Since you're in your mid-thirties,
eight years your junior would be perfect.

1045
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:08,662
-Any siblings?
-She's an only child.

1046
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:09,705
Her parents must be young.

1047
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:10,873
Your wife is arriving soon.

1048
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:12,124
It's not that easy.

1049
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,918
-Could it be…
-What?

1050
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:14,835
No, right?

1051
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:17,838
I won't be able to attend your weddings.

1052
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:19,965
Why did you bring so much?

1053
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,218
This is the last time
I'm bringing you food.

1054
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:24,803
-What is it?
-She couldn't bring herself to tell you.

1055
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:38,651
Have you cleaned up her belongings?

1056
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:40,110
Not yet, sir.

1057
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:47,159
