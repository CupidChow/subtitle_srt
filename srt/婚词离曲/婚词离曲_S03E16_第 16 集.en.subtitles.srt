1
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,382
FINALE

2
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,389
Is Father in his room?

3
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,766
He's in the study.

4
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,523
-We need to talk.
-Sure.

5
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,657
Some tea?

6
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,410
I'm not thirsty.
I already had red ginseng tea.

7
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,918
Are you not feeling well?

8
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,461
Emotionally, no.

9
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,797
I'd like to move out with Si-eun.

10
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,217
-Why?
-It's for the best.

11
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,177
You must have a reason.

12
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,222
I don't like
how you discriminate against her.

13
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,223
What do you mean?

14
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,682
Do you really not know?

15
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,060
You only favor Pi-young.

16
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,938
I can see that you adore her so much.

17
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,148
That's not why.

18
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,691
I don't need you to explain.

19
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,111
I'm sure Si-eun felt it too if I could.

20
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,781
She's just staying quiet
since she's kind and easygoing.

21
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,491
I have my reasons.

22
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,327
You gave the tasty dishes to Pi-young

23
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,162
when the kids were there too.

24
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,707
You even told Si-eun
to grab a glass of water.

25
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,710
You also gave Pi-young
your card a few days ago, right?

26
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,339
I saw you give her a ring
earlier today as well.

27
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,716
You're right.

28
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,721
It must be difficult
to take care of her so secretly.

29
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,684
We'll move out
so you can do as you please.

30
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,730
Why did you even tell us
to move in with you?

31
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,525
Hear me out.

32
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,610
They say people never change.

33
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,654
How could you hurt me again?

34
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,282
I must have sinned a lot in my past life.

35
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,826
-To you.
-Dong-min--

36
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,744
I've erased that name from my life.

37
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,289
You could get the wrong idea.

38
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,833
I've wanted to tell you guys too.

39
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,586
But they wanted it to be a secret.

40
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,548
Pi-young is pregnant.

41
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,513
And Dong-ma only found out
on his honeymoon.

42
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,516
She was too embarrassed
to let the others know.

43
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,478
I had no choice but to take care of her.

44
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,939
And about that ring…

45
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,067
It was a ring your stepmother cherished.

46
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,778
You wouldn't have liked it
had I given it to Si-eun

47
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,280
since it was your stepmother's.

48
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,284
You'll have your first nephew
or niece in September.

49
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:25,705
And you, the baby's uncle,
had the conception dream.

50
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,541
I was thoughtless.

51
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,918
How would you have known?

52
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,171
I would've been hurt and upset
if I were you as well.

53
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,548
-I had no idea.
-Me neither.

54
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,468
This is great news.

55
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,179
It's been decades
since a baby came to this house.

56
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,513
You're right.

57
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,556
Don't tell anyone.

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,600
She'll think I'm a blabbermouth.

59
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,894
But she'll show soon.

60
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,104
She's especially embarrassed
to tell the kids.

61
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,359
Pi-young and I were right.

62
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:59,030
Your father died a premature death.

63
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,658
She murdered him.

64
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:05,370
She overfed him carbohydrates
so his blood vessels would get clogged.

65
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,247
Had they used a defibrillator,

66
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,374
he would still be alive.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,253
Do you still not believe me?
After what you heard?

68
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,463
I don't get it.

69
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,632
I just can't.

70
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,426
How could she?

71
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,138
My grandmother used to say
that humans are the most vicious.

72
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,475
-She was right.
-But to Father…

73
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,687
she was a perfect wife.

74
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,147
-She was sincere.
-She was faking it.

75
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,066
-But why?
-Maybe he was too old for her.

76
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,402
-After all those years?
-Who knows behind closed doors?

77
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,697
How could she have deceived
even me for all those years?

78
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,824
All lies are bound to be exposed.

79
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,200
She has countless faces.

80
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,870
Maybe she's suffering
from schizophrenia and delusions.

81
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,455
Maybe it's just her subconscious.

82
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,374
You're impossible.

83
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,042
She's not even your real mother.

84
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,086
Are you really a neuropsychiatrist?

85
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,880
Why would someone so carefree get sick?

86
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,009
Her guilt must have eaten away at her.

87
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,762
Plus, Father refused
to leave and even possessed Ji-a.

88
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,849
It all makes sense now.

89
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,560
He was too resentful to move on.

90
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,980
You decide.
I'm too scared to live with her.

91
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,107
What if she harms me?

92
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,985
Either admit her to a hospital,
or I'm leaving.

93
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,031
-Should I go pack?
-She was young when she came.

94
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,824
She raised me

95
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,952
as if I was her biological son.

96
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,830
I owe all my success to her.

97
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:31,956
She had an ulterior motive.

98
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,374
-She had feelings for you--
-Shut it.

99
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,917
I was only seven.

100
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,794
I didn't say it happened then.

101
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,005
You became a wonderful, young man
and then reached your prime.

102
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,215
And your father became an old man.

103
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,676
Meanwhile, she was still young and lively.

104
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,597
Take her to the hospital
or tell them to pick her up.

105
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,974
I can't do this any longer.

106
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,894
I can't live with her.

107
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:43,444
I truly love you

108
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,407
-Get changed and come out.
-But it's late.

109
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,785
It doesn't matter. Let's eat out.

110
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,328
What are we eating?

111
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,128
What do you want to eat?

112
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,339
Go to your room.

113
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,843
Stop staring at me and go.

114
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,013
I want pizza.

115
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,515
Let's order in.

116
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,933
Did you really ignore Father…

117
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,562
while he was having a heart attack?

118
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,147
I don't want to talk about it.

119
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:20,982
Why?

120
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,194
You loved him more than anyone else.

121
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,448
You said you admired and loved him.

122
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,658
What do you mean "admire"?

123
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:36,831
-Did you not like him?
-I despised how that old man reeked!

124
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,293
You'll become old one day too.
It's natural.

125
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,294
Whatever.

126
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,424
Are you attacking me right now?

127
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,633
Are you scolding me?

128
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,219
I hate all of you!

129
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,139
Father…

130
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,266
Don't call for him like a baby.

131
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,236
Call someone over.

132
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,751
Open up.

133
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,711
Open up.

134
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,425
The key.

135
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,093
You better not come in.

136
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,678
I'll kill myself!

137
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,642
Why are you here?

138
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,893
We're here for someone.

139
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,520
Why are you still here?

140
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,813
-Who?
-Don't ask.

141
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,316
-It's a secret.
-When?

142
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,902
Within a month of our arrival.

143
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,871
Can you at least tell me
whether it's a male or female?

144
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,582
Is it the chairman?

145
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,334
Don't ask. It won't do you any good.

146
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,628
Where's my phone?

147
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,380
Here you go.

148
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,634
INCOMING CALL
A MI

149
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,888
-Yes?
-Where are the room keys?

150
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,057
In the utility room.
Or check the shoe shelf.

151
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,976
Ms. Kim locked herself in her bedroom.

152
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,228
What you and I suspected was true.

153
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,815
She confessed that she killed Father.

154
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,149
What did she say?

155
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,276
It's a long story.

156
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,499
Put this on.

157
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,171
You shouldn't catch a cold.

158
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,140
What's wrong with you? Calm down.

159
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,892
Fine. You can just stay home.

160
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,227
Don't touch me.

161
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,478
Get lost!

162
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:11,902
Right now.

163
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,780
Prepare a room for her.

164
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:17,992
Aren't your legs sore?

165
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,201
No.

166
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,954
Hyang-gi ordered our drinks.

167
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,130
Hey, people will get the wrong idea.

168
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,590
Circumcision?

169
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:33,716
I can't help it.

170
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,103
Where's dinner? I'm hungry.

171
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,485
Who are these young men?

172
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,861
They're from the hospital.

173
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:55,988
Sit down for a minute.

174
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,907
Take a seat.

175
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,586
Let me go!

176
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,964
Touch me, and I'll pee.

177
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,431
What are you doing? How dare you?

178
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,642
Let me go!

179
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:28,104
I'm going to tell
Dr. Shin to fire you all!

180
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,480
Yu-sin!

181
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,985
What did I do? Tell me?

182
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,823
Do you want me to die?
Should I kill myself in front of you?

183
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,617
How about you kill me yourself?

184
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,788
Fine! I'll let you do it.
Just kill me with your hands!

185
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,586
How could you do this to me?

186
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,588
You of all people!

187
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,632
Help me, A Mi.

188
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,678
I'm sorry.
I'll treat you better from now on!

189
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,517
Yu-sin! My son!

190
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:11,647
Spare me!
I won't be able to live! I'll die!

191
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,316
Can you live without me?

192
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,776
Please!

193
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,611
They're going to kill me!

194
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,822
They will kill me!

195
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,158
Help me!

196
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,617
Let me go!

197
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,786
If I die, I want to die here!

198
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,997
I want to die in my own house!

199
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,430
You'll be punished.

200
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,016
You'll die a painful death.

201
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,310
You'll see.

202
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,107
Is this how you repay me?

203
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,568
Shin Yu-sin.

204
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,070
Why aren't you saying anything?

205
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,577
Dong-mi.

206
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,037
Hi.

207
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,466
Since it's late,
have dinner with me before you go.

208
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,510
Let's drink instead.

209
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,807
Did you think of me from time to time?

210
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,727
I'd be lying if I said no.

211
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,314
I wanted to call you many times,
but I stopped myself.

212
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,942
Is it really impossible

213
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,945
for us to go back to the way things were?

214
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:49,161
They say traitors never change.

215
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,747
My conscience won't allow it.

216
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:59,630
Ms. Kim is an avid fan of mine.

217
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,674
She treats me like I'm her daughter.

218
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,926
She was very eager to introduce me to you.

219
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,179
I didn't think it was right to refuse.

220
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,559
So I told her I'd just see who it was
and agreed to come out.

221
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,894
In any case,

222
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,273
don't you think this is fate?

223
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,986
I won't just think of myself and use you.

224
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,362
All pain subsides

225
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,823
over time.

226
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,127
So it's because of your baby?

227
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,005
-Yes.
-You're too attached.

228
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,883
And that's where all your pain stems from.

229
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:48,304
They say a sparrow near
a school sings the primer.

230
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,390
Being a Grim Reaper for a century
has made you patient.

231
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,270
I just couldn't leave my child behind.

232
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,442
How could we understand?

233
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,069
We only lived as men on this earth.

234
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,743
Do you think
I had sinned too much in my previous life?

235
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,876
Trouble sleeping?

236
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,964
I should be the one tossing and turning.

237
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,718
-Why?
-Let's buy another bed tomorrow.

238
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,347
-Suppressing my urges is hard.
-Let's sleep in separate rooms.

239
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,099
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

240
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,024
Why are you upset?

241
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,570
Tell me. Did I do something?

242
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,781
Was it because of what I said?

243
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,575
I was joking.
I just wanted to hug you, but I couldn't.

244
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,870
I can't sleep
because I'm craving bibim guksu.

245
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,580
Then have some with some kimchi.

246
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,332
-We ran out of noodles.
-Even ramyeon?

247
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,508
Then we can make some noodles.
Do we have flour?

248
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,592
We do.

249
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,014
Where are you going?

250
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,896
I'll make you some, so you can go to bed.

251
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:29,196
How did you two become Grim Reapers?

252
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,614
It was due to our karmas.

253
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,324
Due to our actions on this earth.

254
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,744
This job does you no good.

255
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,463
Why are they still up?

256
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,257
Maybe they want a late-night snack.

257
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,259
Do you know what's funny?

258
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:54,138
Despite being a ghost,
I still crave food when I see them.

259
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,682
How about you guys?

260
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,058
It'll subside over time.

261
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,810
It's a habit from when you were alive.

262
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,062
-Flour?
-Yes.

263
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,529
You've never done this before.

264
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,906
But I watched others do it.

265
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,492
-On TV?
-Yes.

266
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,786
I just need to mix it with water.

267
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,621
Let me. Just roll it later for me.

268
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,707
Don't touch it. Go back to the room.

269
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,917
-I'll bring it up.
-You, Master Dong-ma?

270
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,087
That's not me anymore.

271
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,800
I'm a husband. Your husband.

272
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,515
-My dear husband.
-Do you love me?

273
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,558
Of course.

274
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,853
All right. Go to our room.

275
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,354
Maybe take a nap.

276
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,107
I said I couldn't sleep.

277
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,151
It doesn't matter. Just lie down.

278
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,032
-How will I eat it?
-With chopsticks.

279
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,743
-I feel bad.
-Every time you do, just…

280
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,217
Kalguksu?

281
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,885
No, sujebi.

282
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,154
Father…

283
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,219
-… has happened.
-After getting married,

284
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,180
I've realized that
keeping myself in good health and…

285
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,308
Right.

286
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,708
Who is that?

287
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,293
It's me.

288
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,217
I'm sorry,
but where is your foot massager?

289
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,804
Why do you ask?

290
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,143
Pi-young can't sleep
because she craves guksu.

291
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,061
Then get her some.

292
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,982
-Good night.
-Are you cooking?

293
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,276
Then who else? You?

294
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,273
It's kalguksu.

295
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,070
But I stepped on that.

296
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,240
You stepped on the middle,
so I'll use the corners.

297
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,241
But still…

298
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,868
I need a tool.

299
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,414
I'll put flour on it.

300
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,505
-Is everyone eating?
-Is that a lot?

301
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,132
Of course, it is. Where will you make it?

302
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,597
That's too small.

303
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,309
I know.

304
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,858
It's perfect.

305
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,319
Bring half of the dough.

306
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,154
And enough flour.

307
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,533
We didn't move back in with my parents
to just live with them.

308
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,661
It was because we both had to work,
and we didn't have enough money.

309
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:32,582
But you keep
treating my parents like that.

310
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,128
We're going to live all together,
so could you please…

311
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,257
Let me.

312
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,135
This requires skill.

313
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,346
Do it evenly.

314
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,476
She'll never forget it
if she can't have what she wants.

315
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,562
When your mom was pregnant,

316
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,273
she craved ice flakes
in the middle of winter.

317
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,901
Nowadays, they're sold
during the winter too.

318
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,321
But that wasn't the case back then.

319
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,780
She always brought it up.

320
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,074
I remember her telling me.

321
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,744
Gochujang bibim guksu
or kimchi bibim guksu?

322
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,037
Kimchi, I think.

323
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,039
Do you know where the kimchi is?

324
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,665
Probably in the kimchi fridge.

325
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,834
And exactly which one is that?

326
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,422
We should have some too, right?
I could eat.

327
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:26,136
Just consider yourself unlucky
when it comes to having a wife.

328
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,805
You can't be blessed with everything.

329
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:33,310
I'm blessed with parents, a wife,
children, wealth,

330
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,604
and even good health.

331
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,647
Enough with the bragging.

332
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,858
You can't be certain about your health.

333
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,444
Right. I take that back.

334
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,615
I'm blessed with everything but one.
I have no daughter.

335
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,368
Devote yourself to Jeong-bin from now on.

336
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,536
Hye-ryung is…

337
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,414
How do I put it?

338
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,584
She tends to be a bit heartless.

339
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,169
She's self-centered too.

340
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,754
Don't let it get to you.

341
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,923
But she's still pretty and competent.

342
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:06,843
He's right. It'd be perfect
had she been friendly and affectionate.

343
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,013
Just focus on raising Jeong-bin.

344
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,599
And don't expect anything from her.

345
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,644
Even if she curses at you,
just ignore her.

346
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,729
She's extremely on edge right now.

347
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,315
It's best not to provoke her.

348
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,340
The noodles are a bit thick.
My knife skills aren't great.

349
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,300
Thank you so much, Father.

350
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,218
I helped out too.

351
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,267
I can't believe this.

352
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,353
We tried it, and it tasted fine.

353
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,360
It's really tasty.

354
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,319
I'm glad.

355
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:07,988
Goodness.

356
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,991
-What's wrong?
-One minute.

357
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,245
She wants to take a photo.

358
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,913
It's nothing grand.

359
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,082
Cooking is painstaking.

360
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,334
I should always be grateful when eating.

361
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,882
-What's my temperature?
-It's 36.7°C.

362
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,093
It's perfectly fine.
Your blood pressure is normal too.

363
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,845
I have a piercing headache.

364
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,346
I'll inform your doctor.

365
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,474
Is it a girl?

366
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,351
Goodness. How did you know?

367
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,853
I could tell.

368
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:52,949
Pi-young.

369
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,711
What happened?

370
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,716
Please give us the grocery list.

371
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,051
One minute.

372
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,346
I'll be honest.

373
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,641
I've wanted to tell you
this numerous times.

374
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,518
But I just couldn't bring myself to.

375
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,854
You're pregnant, aren't you?

376
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,231
Did Father tell you?

377
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,774
I could tell.

378
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,777
I don't even have morning sickness.
I have a bigger appetite.

379
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,530
I wanted to ask you,
but I held myself back.

380
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,075
When's your due date?

381
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,451
You heard, right?

382
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,620
Your brain is healthy too.

383
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,206
But I'm still in extreme pain.

384
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,167
Rest up. Relax.

385
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,543
Don't think too much.

386
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,754
I miss Jeong-bin.

387
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,506
I can't bring him here though.

388
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,592
He's becoming cuter by the day.

389
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,513
Sa-hyeon is still young.

390
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,890
I know he still lacks a lot.

391
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,393
If you'll understand and be patient,

392
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:05,689
he'll become
a better husband in all aspects.

393
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,525
Men tend to mature slowly.

394
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,987
-I'm not that great either.
-That's not true at all.

395
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,239
You have a successful career.

396
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:17,826
I bet Jeong-bin's mother was feminine.

397
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,661
The same goes for you.

398
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,787
Look at yourself.

399
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,083
JUST YOUR FACE

400
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,710
Father made them?

401
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,503
-Yes.
-It's unimaginable.

402
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,255
-Right?
-Was it tasty?

403
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,756
The noodles were…

404
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,135
I'm not exaggerating.
They were as thick as Ji-a's fingers.

405
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,971
Dong-ma must've kneaded
the dough since he's strong.

406
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,973
It was chewy and delicious.

407
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,350
And they put in just enough kimchi.

408
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,812
On top of that, they added an egg.

409
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,647
A boiled one at that.

410
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,776
-You're craving some.
-Yes, since you mentioned it.

411
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,153
I can't make it myself.

412
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,071
Let's go to my favorite place in Jongno.

413
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,532
To be honest…

414
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,161
I'm pregnant as well.

415
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,121
No way.

416
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,415
Goodness.

417
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,376
I couldn't believe it at first either.

418
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,336
What did Mr. Seo say?

419
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,587
I haven't told him yet.

420
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:15,133
-Why not? He should be the first to know.
-What if I end up like Hye-ryung?

421
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,595
I only just saw the test result.

422
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,305
-On the pregnancy test kit?
-Yes.

423
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:26,061
I'll tell him after I visit the OB-GYN
next week and know for sure.

424
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,729
Is it a honeymoon baby?

425
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,148
I believe so.

426
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,525
You must've had one steamy night.

427
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,110
I was worried you just held hands.

428
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,279
Don't tease me.

429
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,616
I'm not. The Seo family
will have two celebrations back-to-back.

430
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,785
Plus, Mr. Seo is the eldest son.

431
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,162
He'll be ecstatic
once he hears about this.

432
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,040
Who knows?

433
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:47,957
I know.

434
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:52,003
Not only will he be happy,
but Father will be delighted.

435
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,302
Please keep it a secret
until I know for sure.

436
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,347
Si-eun, you can trust
the pregnancy test kit.

437
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:06,142
I can only be assured
once the baby is three to four months old.

438
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,311
Si-eun, I'm so happy for you.

439
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,271
This ought to be a big celebration.

440
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,650
So that's why
you haven't been eating much.

441
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,068
I thought you were on a diet.

442
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,196
Fatty and creamy dishes make me nauseous.

443
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,572
Just like when I had Ji-a.

444
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,741
Do you think it's a boy or a girl?

445
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,702
It'd be great if it was a boy.

446
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,704
Father will be on cloud nine.

447
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,507
It's not their eldest son, is it?

448
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,096
-Is it?
-We can't tell you.

449
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:46,766
If we do, we can't be Grim Reapers
anymore. We could reincarnate as animals.

450
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,664
The number you have dialed
is currently busy.

451
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,254
Please leave a message after the beep.

452
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:25,930
INCOMING CALL
SHIN YU-SIN

453
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,684
-Hello?
-Can you talk?

454
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,643
Yes.

455
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,189
I heard about it. How is she?

456
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,274
She's being sedated.

457
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,443
She's more frightening than I thought.

458
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,320
How could she?

459
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:43,031
I should've listened to you.

460
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,951
Tell A Mi to prepare a ritual for Father.

461
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,412
-You must do that.
-Okay.

462
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,582
Will she move back in
with you once she gets better?

463
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:53,917
A Mi refused vehemently.

464
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,502
And I don't think I can anymore.

465
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,296
I would've felt the same way.

466
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:01,549
You used to make alcohol
every now and then. What's the recipe?

467
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,384
I'll text it to A Mi.

468
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,221
Okay. How's Ji-a?

469
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,180
She's doing well.

470
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,182
Is she adjusting well to school?

471
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:12,519
Yes. I didn't tell her about Mother.

472
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,647
She doesn't need to know.
It'll only trouble her.

473
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,898
Goodbye.

474
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,200
Hello.

475
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,285
Hey. You're home early.

476
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,203
I'm going out again.

477
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,455
What's with the flowers?

478
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,837
-Oh, my.
-These are for Pi-young.

479
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,633
-Pi-young.
-Yes?

480
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,928
They're from him.

481
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,179
Gosh, I love them.

482
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,974
Thank you for buying me some as well.

483
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,020
Brothers-in-law
always cherish their sisters-in-law.

484
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,480
What about my love for you?

485
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,399
That means a lot too.

486
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,316
I'm touched.

487
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,110
You're the best.

488
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,450
STUDY CAFE

489
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,580
-So?
-Is this the recipe?

490
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,956
Yes. I followed hers.

491
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,625
I like it.

492
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,680
Did you want more foam?

493
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,225
You need to drink it in one shot.

494
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,102
-Beer?
-Try it.

495
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,396
Cheers.

496
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,439
Drink up.

497
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,697
-It has a unique taste.
-Drink it all at once.

498
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,414
This is for the flowers
your brother got for us.

499
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,917
If I buy them tomorrow,
can we drink this again?

500
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:46,714
What's the recipe?

501
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,759
I used to work part-time back in the day.
I was a bartender.

502
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,427
-Oh, please.
-I'm serious.

503
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,721
-I was popular.
-Among the customers?

504
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,473
Among the men.

505
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:12,115
Tell me. You better talk
while I'm being nice.

506
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,201
I learned from a Japanese cuisine chef.

507
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,452
Which restaurant?

508
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,496
Did you flirt with him?

509
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,872
I'd never do that.

510
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,666
I just smiled at him.

511
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,544
Why couldn't he just focus on cooking?

512
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:31,217
The drink was on the house.
I said it was tasty, so he taught me.

513
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,011
It's not windy today.

514
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,887
Tell me about it.

515
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,724
We can just take a stroll
around the neighborhood for today.

516
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,084
What's your relationship with A Mi?

517
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,337
She's not just your client, is she?

518
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,882
- A Mi?
-Yes.

519
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,133
Is "A" her surname?

520
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,719
-Don't play dumb.
-Who is she?

521
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,430
Bring her over. I'm curious.

522
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,598
Do you really not know her?

523
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,558
Call her, or we can all meet together.

524
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:22,894
I don't get you.

525
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,253
Hello. It's been a long time.

526
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,421
Hello.

527
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,300
Are you here alone?

528
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,510
Yes.

529
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,971
Would you like
to have some tea downstairs?

530
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,973
When is your next musical?

531
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,892
I haven't looked online lately.

532
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:03,935
This fall.

533
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,478
You're always working.

534
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,605
I'm just blessed when it comes to work.

535
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:12,443
You know about me and Ms. Lee, right?

536
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,986
A Mi must've told you.

537
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,030
I do.

538
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:25,248
I heard Ms. Lee got married.

539
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,668
Yes. She met a wonderful man.

540
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:35,591
Seeing her,
I guess being kind pays off in the end.

541
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,761
I heard
you got back together with your ex.

542
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,559
And we broke up once again.

543
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,732
Does she not work anymore?

544
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,860
She should take a break.

545
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,820
She's been working since university.

546
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,446
It's almost been 30 years.

547
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,116
I'm taking a sabbatical too.

548
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,411
I agree. Everyone needs downtime.

549
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,456
But musical actresses are too afraid
of being forgotten.

550
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:14,255
Could you tell Ms. Lee
that I would like to meet her again?

551
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:19,051
Putting aside everything that happened,
she's like a life mentor to me.

552
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,471
-You're an only child, right?
-Yes.

553
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:26,851
I'm also an only child,
so I know how you feel.

554
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,270
We want to have close friends.

555
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,771
Si-eun is…

556
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,274
I call her by her first name.

557
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:37,945
She puts others before herself.
She has a big heart.

558
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,072
You're right.

559
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,241
Did you not meet Professor Park again?

560
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,745
I ran into him recently.

561
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,831
I never really loved him.

562
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,917
So I was pretty calm.

563
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:59,342
DOCTOR'S OFFICE

564
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,509
Ms. Han Hui-won?

565
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:33,292
LIVE STUDIO

566
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,169
-Good work.
-See you tomorrow.

567
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,009
INCOMING CALL
SI-EUN

568
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,679
Yes?

569
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,347
Are you done?

570
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,100
Yes. Should I go home early?

571
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:50,977
No.

572
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,646
Then should I go elsewhere?

573
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,314
Treat me to dinner.

574
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,400
We have Korean cuisine at home.

575
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:00,987
French? Chinese? Italian?

576
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,780
Italian.

577
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,700
I'll make a reservation and call you.

578
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,994
-Okay.
-Call me more often.

579
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,121
It's nice.

580
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,709
She doesn't want it.

581
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,962
-Did you say it was gelato, not ice cream?
-Yes.

582
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,845
I shouldn't have gotten it.

583
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,222
I thought she'd eat this.

584
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,102
What if she has a serious illness?

585
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,687
The doctors said she didn't.

586
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,778
She got a thorough checkup.

587
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:47,033
There's this friend I used
to go to middle school with.

588
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:50,328
Six months ago,
his checkup showed no issues.

589
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,456
One day, he collapsed
and went to the hospital.

590
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,374
He has a stage-four brain tumor.

591
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:59,295
Jeez. Be careful what you say.

592
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,547
Sa-hyeon isn't doomed
to have no wife, is he?

593
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:09,764
We didn't expect
Song Yuan to pass away like that.

594
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:13,059
After going through that we need
to be more careful.

595
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,393
She has depression.

596
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:18,189
I told her to get therapy,
but she refused.

597
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,025
Who cares about rumors spreading?
Her health comes first.

598
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,652
She can barely eat anything.

599
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,029
This is good.

600
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,866
So this is why people love ice cream.

601
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,371
-You're old.
-Me?

602
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,164
You like it because you've aged.

603
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,749
Isn't it the opposite?

604
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,043
Doesn't this mean I'm still young?

605
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,003
-We'll have this wine.
-Yes, sir.

606
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,675
Do you have good news?

607
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,928
Will you only treat me
if there's good news?

608
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,639
No. I'd love to treat you anytime.

609
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,350
I've wanted to come here with you.

610
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,604
DIRECTOR JUNG

611
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,190
Hello?

612
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:04,693
Yes.

613
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,780
Ms. Lee is doing well too.

614
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,618
Not yet.

615
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,830
Our youngest is in
middle school now, so she's busy.

616
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,499
She's a mom too.

617
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,584
Yes.

618
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,336
Okay.

619
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,133
He wants you to work.

620
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,717
But he has many writers.

621
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,136
It doesn't matter.

622
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,347
Most of them are incompetent.

623
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,310
Should we take up horseback riding?

624
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,396
It'd be nice to join our kids.

625
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,773
-You can.
-Just me?

626
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,942
You know I get easily scared.

627
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,862
I'm scared of dogs
that are bigger than Danchu.

628
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,321
SEOK-JUNG

629
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:54,243
I thought I could enjoy
this evening with you.

630
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,661
I should turn it off.

631
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,496
Yes?

632
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,000
I hope you reincarnate as a human.

633
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:05,504
They must've been so lazy and bled
people dry to reincarnate as a dog.

634
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:09,508
Judging by its owners,
they must've not been that bad.

635
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,853
Do you not like it?

636
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,982
I hope Lady Luck is on your side.

637
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:28,235
She already is. I got to marry you.

638
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,167
Our kids like this.

639
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,545
Let's order some to-go.
Three would be enough, right?

640
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,130
It won't taste good cold.

641
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,798
What does "calzone" mean?

642
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,345
"Stretched pant legs", was it?

643
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:57,515
I wish someone grabbed my pant legs too.

644
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,559
-Who?
-You.

645
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,604
I'm going to do that now,
and I won't let go.

646
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,022
Okay.

647
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,652
Have you ever thought
about having your own kid?

648
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,574
Do you feel pressured?
Do you not like the idea?

649
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:20,079
I'd be lying if I said
I didn't think about it.

650
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:22,665
But it's important
to be happy with what you have.

651
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:27,127
I'm more than content
with what I have right now.

652
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,923
Perhaps…

653
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,885
If God allows us and you're lucky enough,

654
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:39,265
you may become a dad this year.

655
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,440
What do you mean? Do you want to adopt?

656
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,319
I'm five weeks pregnant.

657
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:56,115
I'm a bit worried
that I might have a miscarriage.

658
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,661
I went to the OB-GYN today.

659
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,539
They ran a blood test.

660
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,583
I'm pregnant.

661
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,464
I can't believe this.

662
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:13,924
Me neither.

663
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,596
Pinch me.

664
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,729
Does it hurt?

665
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,105
Not one bit.

666
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,941
Oh, dear. Then this must be a dream.

667
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:37,489
I could be stabbed right now
and not feel a thing.

668
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,782
I feel totally numb.

669
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,957
So this is how it feels

670
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,376
to become a dad.

671
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,507
We don't know what'll happen.

672
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:58,052
I'm always going
to prepare myself for the worst.

673
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,096
Don't do that.

674
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,432
That's not a way to treat our baby.

675
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,185
We should love it.

676
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:07,686
Should we?

677
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,939
We should put our trust in our baby
and hope it will grow well.

678
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,484
We should shower it with love.

679
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,402
Even if it's a fetus.

680
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,321
Okay.

681
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,448
You're right.

682
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:25,746
How do you judge other people?

683
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:26,955
I've never judged others.

684
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,833
Even if you don't, others will judge you

685
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,586
once you grow up and start work.

686
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,171
I'll think about it.

687
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,215
I judge them on the impression I get.

688
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,552
When it comes to material things,

689
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:46,433
those who say, "What's mine is yours,
and what's yours is mine," are ignorant.

690
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,561
Someone who says, "What's mine is mine,
and what's yours is yours,"

691
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,146
is normal.

692
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,525
Someone who says,

693
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,778
"What's mine is yours,
and what's yours is yours,"

694
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:01,073
is respectable and admirable.

695
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,200
Can you do that?

696
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,077
To be honest, no.

697
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,161
What about you?

698
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,580
I can do that every now and then.

699
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,958
But I'm far from being admirable.

700
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,751
But you make so many donations.

701
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,002
Lastly…

702
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:17,297
someone who says, "What's yours is mine,
and what's mine is mine,"

703
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:20,134
is evil. The Talmud says so.

704
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,344
Thieves and robbers are examples of that.

705
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,848
They believe what others have is theirs.

706
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:29,768
That's why they don't hesitate to steal.

707
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,856
At times, they go
as far as hurting others.

708
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,610
Do you understand
what kind of person you should be?

709
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,613
-Yes.
-It won't be easy though.

710
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:45,868
This world would be easier to live
without those who are evil, Father.

711
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,753
Why are you home already?
You should've enjoyed some alone time.

712
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:03,886
Did I do something wrong again?

713
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,888
-No.
-You can tell me.

714
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,808
I shouldn't have sold my dream
to Dong-ma last time.

715
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,727
-About the big snake?
-Yes.

716
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,312
Why? Did you buy a lottery ticket?

717
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,775
She's pregnant.

718
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:23,655
I went to the OB-GYN today.

719
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,369
I'll be careful
so I can have a healthy baby.

720
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,373
So you're pregnant as well?

721
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,542
Yes.

722
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,127
Hold on.

723
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,796
April Fools has passed, right?

724
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,881
It has.

725
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:43,509
Two babies at our house?

726
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,094
When is your due date?

727
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,221
December.

728
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,600
Are you unhappy?

729
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:52,809
No.

730
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,771
I'm okay.

731
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,358
I was a terrible father.

732
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:01,818
But look at this.

733
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,115
I'm truly touched.

734
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,286
You're better than me.

735
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,373
Thank you.

736
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,043
Aren't you happy?

737
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,503
I am.

738
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,673
I'll do my best as well.

739
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,758
But you should take good care of her.

740
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:27,177
She shouldn't trouble herself.

741
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:31,640
It'd be nice if you could take a leave
and tend to her around the clock.

742
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,518
Would you like that?

743
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,436
I'm not joking.

744
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,814
It's okay. I'll be careful.

745
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,899
Call Dong-ma and Pi-young over.

746
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,693
We're going to tell the kids first.

747
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,319
We should receive their help too.

748
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,822
Right. Okay.

749
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:54,246
I don't deserve this from you.

750
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:59,042
I couldn't be more grateful.

751
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,253
I mean it.

752
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,594
We should celebrate over some beer.

753
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:11,179
You can have some. We don't need to drink.

754
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,472
It's only meaningful if we all drink.

755
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:17,185
Don't rush things. Take your time
with the baby and give birth next year.

756
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,437
We'll only be a few months apart.

757
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,272
Still, our kid will be older.

758
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,149
Give it a nickname.

759
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,152
It's not mandatory, right?

760
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,863
Still, wouldn't it be nice
to call it every now and then?

761
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,406
How does Janggun sound?

762
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,325
That's a boy's name.

763
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,744
What about something neutral?
We don't know the gender yet.

764
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,912
-Right.
-Would you like something?

765
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,289
No, I'm okay.

766
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:40,083
-Are you sure? Don't you crave a drink?
-I do.

767
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,212
The men should drink for them

768
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:46,757
to celebrate their pregnancy.

769
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,551
So try to do things on your own.

770
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,471
Try not to make your mom move
as much as possible.

771
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:53,388
Okay.

772
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,227
-Why are you crying?
-They're tears of joy. Right?

773
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,483
-Are you worried about her?
-I am.

774
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,734
INCOMING CALL
DONG-MA

775
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:07,986
I'll take good care of her.

776
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,325
-Yes?
-Dad wants to celebrate. Come downstairs.

777
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:15,077
To a safe delivery.

778
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,161
Congratulations.

779
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,957
Hire more housekeepers this instant.
Take good care of your bodies.

780
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,751
-Okay.
-Yes, Father.

781
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:26,004
Don't forget that you're our treasures.

782
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:30,759
We feel much happier
since you're here with us.

783
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:31,843
Really?

784
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:32,928
Yes.

785
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,946
-Any other precautions?
-No.

786
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:55,409
Shouldn't we buy baby stuff soon?

787
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,202
It'll only take a day or two.

788
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,746
-Make sure I go with you.
-Gosh. You're busy.

789
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,164
I can still make time.

790
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,211
Loosen up. You're making us tense.

791
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,048
Be honest. Do you want a girl or a boy?

792
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,800
-Honestly?
-Yes.

793
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,511
I want twins.

794
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,350
DOCTOR'S OFFICE

795
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,021
Everything's fine.

796
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,155
He's greedy. He wants twins.

797
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,868
My Cutie wants naengmyeon.
What do you crave?

798
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,328
I crave buckwheat noodles.

799
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,582
-Should we split up?
-I want buckwheat noodles too.

800
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,961
Hye-ryung is hospitalized here.

801
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:49,755
Right.

802
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,175
But if she sees us…

803
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,098
Maybe next time.

804
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:02,142
We'll only upset her.

805
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,570
Look.

806
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,906
Everything's fine.

807
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,909
Her blood vessels are clean too.

808
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,620
Then why is she still in pain?

809
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:22,954
It's neurological.

810
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,583
The only way to get better
is for her to overcome it.

811
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:02,744
I'm dying here, but they can't find
anything wrong with me.

812
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,580
I can tell. You don't look too good.

813
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,958
They say it's neurological.

814
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,960
You have a headache and no appetite.

815
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:13,171
You must be tired
since you're not eating well.

816
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,758
-Yes.
-Maybe it's lupus. An autoimmune disease.

817
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,052
I got a checkup for that too just in case.

818
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:21,888
Just like us,
you've been working too hard.

819
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,724
I agree. Your body is telling you
that it wants to rest.

820
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,643
Your husband must be worried sick.

821
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,312
-He is.
-Don't feel anxious.

822
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,897
Just rest for a year or two.

823
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,399
What if people forget about me?

824
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:34,651
Sorry.

825
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:36,736
PROFESSOR PARK

826
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,364
Why is he calling me?
He could've just texted.

827
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:40,448
Professor Park?

828
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:44,744
Sorry. I was too thirsty and hot
that I ordered first.

829
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,668
She's all dressed up like a wealthy lady.

830
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,425
What would you like?

831
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,303
A hot cup of chamomile tea, please.

832
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:02,846
-Okay.
-In this hot weather?

833
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:07,017
U-ram got good grades.

834
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:08,935
He did.

835
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,021
I need to move out.

836
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:13,064
I thought you two were close? Why?

837
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,191
His family member is coming from Busan.

838
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:18,778
And the place is so rundown
that the AC always breaks.

839
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:19,946
You should move.

840
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,033
You have enough money
to find a new studio apartment.

841
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,868
Paying monthly rent would be a waste.

842
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:28,163
Can I move into our old apartment?

843
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,541
-It'll still be yours.
-I rented it out.

844
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,085
Pay for the move and the brokerage fee…

845
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:37,380
-I'll do it.
-You could've just called.

846
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:40,091
I thought it'd be nice to see you
and talk about the kids.

847
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:44,095
They must be too busy to call.
They only reply after several texts.

848
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,848
They don't have time to chat over text.

849
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:49,225
Out of sight, out of mind.

850
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:52,437
The tenants moved in less than a year ago.
I can't tell them to leave.

851
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,147
-Yearly or monthly rent?
-Monthly.

852
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:58,985
I gave them a good deal,
so I doubt they'll want to move out.

853
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,487
Get a two-bedroom studio.

854
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,823
New studios nowadays are pretty good.
They're structured differently.

855
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:12,707
-Do you want to cut your hair?
-Yes.

856
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:13,750
Which designer?

857
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,506
-Is this your first time here?
-Yes.

858
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,840
Sit down.

859
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,887
-You can sit here.
-Thank you.

860
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,768
Thank you.

861
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,229
I should thank you instead.

862
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:40,193
You would've already given birth
the next time we meet.

863
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:41,444
Yes.

864
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:43,947
Be careful.

865
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,768
We hope you'll have a safe delivery.

866
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:14,936
Thank you.

867
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:17,772
Door closing.

868
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,085
Hey.

869
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,720
The driver is waiting.

870
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:49,721
Let's talk.

871
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:50,889
Later.

872
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:07,113
I realized that quacks
don't only exist in the medical field.

873
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:11,201
I think some Grim Reapers are quacks too.

874
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:12,827
I really do.

875
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:17,373
I was worried,
but your entire family is still alive.

876
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,501
And the Grim Reapers disappeared.

877
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:29,094
It's funny how our minds work.

878
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,472
It was only for a brief time.

879
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,599
But I wished

880
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:37,936
it was you who would die.

881
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:40,897
Because I'm lonely.

882
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,568
I was kicked out of Sa-hyeon's house.

883
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:49,364
I can't see my baby boy anymore.

884
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,325
I thought it'd be nice

885
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:56,204
to spend my time chatting with you.

886
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:00,792
I'm terrible, aren't I?

887
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,340
You look happy these days.

888
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,468
You look good.

889
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,643
I'm sorry.

890
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,186
Was there traffic?

891
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,440
No. The GPS took me to the one in Jamsil.

892
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,358
I didn't know there was another branch.

893
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,694
-How's Ms. Kim?
-She's doing fine.

894
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,237
Or is she just pretending?

895
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,324
You really are pregnant.

896
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,702
I was surprised when Yu-sin told me.

897
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,412
It's belated, but congratulations.

898
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,206
Your husband must be delighted.

899
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,417
Kiwi juice, please.

900
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,627
Do you sell vanilla shakes?

901
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:45,879
Yes.

902
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,717
We're getting married.

903
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,801
When?

904
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:54,804
-October 10.
-In 2 months.

905
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,973
-Yes.
-How's the preparation going?

906
00:57:57,056 --> 00:58:00,143
I've picked out my wedding dress.
We're not buying any household goods.

907
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:02,729
Get new furniture. That's a given.

908
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:03,771
We'll keep the ones we have.

909
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:06,274
Does he not give you any money?
Ask for some.

910
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,526
That's not why.

911
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,572
I'd like to use the same furniture
you did and gain some luck.

912
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,990
You're lucky.

913
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,618
For getting married twice?

914
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:17,660
It was an upgrade.

915
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,913
You chose the life you live.

916
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,626
Even my mom said that I dug my own grave.

917
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,128
But what matters is the result.

918
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,881
I wish you well.

919
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,424
Thank you.

920
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:35,595
Anyway, call me whenever you need me.

921
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,889
I'll put aside whatever I'm doing and go.

922
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:42,810
Are you feeling okay?
Are you due anytime soon?

923
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:44,479
Next month, the 20th.

924
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:20,306
Sit down.

925
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,770
It's about Hye-ryung.

926
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,356
Maybe she needs to become a shaman.

927
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:29,983
You also heard, right?

928
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,318
People like her feel extreme pain.

929
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,738
But when they get a checkup,
they turn out to be fine.

930
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:39,075
That can't be.
We're talking about Hye-ryung.

931
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:42,495
I'm certain of it.
I've been observing her lately.

932
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:46,958
Come on. They said it's neurological.
She's a fussy one.

933
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,419
Don't you dare say a thing.

934
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,171
Isn't it hot?

935
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:53,840
Yes.

936
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,467
How do you feel today?

937
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,597
I felt too bloated
and couldn't eat all day.

938
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,269
Who is he?

939
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,651
No one's here.

940
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,111
Do you see something?

941
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,616
Hey, kid. What's your name?

942
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,182
Have some grapes.

943
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,602
I don't have an appetite these days.

944
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:50,188
You'll feel better
during your final month.

945
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,859
Shouldn't you get ready?

946
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:59,364
We decided to eat in today.
Ji-a shouldn't skip academy either.

947
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:03,034
But it's your birthday. You should enjoy
the day with your husband.

948
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:04,952
I just want to spend it with my family.

949
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,371
Hold on.

950
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:09,582
You should've told me in advance.
I thought you were eating out.

951
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,335
I asked the housekeeper to make kongguksu.

952
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:13,920
I craved some.

953
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:37,860
Does your wife wear a size five?

954
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,613
She was a size four,
but that might change after childbirth.

955
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,449
These are the new arrivals
for the fall and winter seasons.

956
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:55,211
-Take your time.
-Okay.

957
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,965
Give me the birthday gift I want.

958
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:42,133
What is it?

959
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:46,179
Come home early
and spend some time with me.

960
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,264
Don't bring anything home.

961
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:50,641
Okay. I'll carry it on my back.

962
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,352
No gifts.

963
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,855
I just want you. That's more meaningful.

964
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:57,648
All right.

965
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:03,613
I'll come before 5 p.m.

966
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:05,865
I'll set my alarm.

967
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,642
To Min General Hospital!

968
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:15,768
Take him there!

969
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,826
-What will you do?
-What do you mean?

970
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:35,037
Someone else
is going to snatch that old man.

971
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,025
Who are you?

972
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:07,278
Who are you?

973
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:30,903
