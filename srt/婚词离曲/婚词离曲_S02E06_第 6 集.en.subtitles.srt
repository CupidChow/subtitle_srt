00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,684
EPISODE 6

2
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,688
It's been a while.

3
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,648
-When did you get back?
-Last week.

4
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,734
Are you here to see someone?

5
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,404
Why are you reading
what's in the brackets?

6
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,199
I apologize. Can we go again?
I'm really sorry.

7
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,371
Excuse me, but what show are they filming?

8
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,463
Yes, Mother.

9
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,256
Ji-a was injured at the academy.

10
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,177
-How?
-By a shard of glass.

11
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,013
-You have dinner plans, right?
-Was she stabbed?

12
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,307
Is she at a hospital?

13
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,059
She's being taken as we speak.

14
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,353
-Was it her face?
-I couldn't ask.

15
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,396
Her teacher was just as shocked.

16
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,482
I'll call you from the hospital.

17
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,067
Which one?

18
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,735
They'll let me know.

19
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,114
-I'm sure it's a nearby clinic.
-She must see a dermatologist.

20
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,615
I'll call her teacher.

21
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,248
Thank you. Please come again.

22
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,499
Sure.

23
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,973
You paid for my table that day.

24
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:21,975
I did.

25
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,060
You must have plans for dinner.

26
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,229
-Today?
-Yes.

27
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,564
I'd be willing to cancel it.

28
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,941
I'll buy you a meal
as a way of paying you back.

29
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,235
May I choose the location?

30
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,737
-Sure.
-The French restaurant at Blue Hotel.

31
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,489
Do you really not have any plans?

32
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,658
No. I'll make the reservation myself.

33
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,743
I don't think there will be a table.

34
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,412
It's hard to book one on the day.

35
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,788
Is it too steep for you?

36
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,166
I'm only kidding.

37
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,214
At least text me
if you're going to stand me up.

38
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,427
I'll text you my number.
Let me know if you can't book a table.

39
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,678
Sure.

40
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,942
SF ELECTRONICS
SEO DONG-MA

41
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,116
The deputy manager at SF Electronics.

42
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,495
Dinner.

43
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,139
You like dried yellow corvina.

44
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,230
Don't take it out on the fish.

45
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,029
Do you have a reservation?

46
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,489
-Under Seo Dong--
-I see.

47
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,502
Let me take your coat.

48
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,423
-Should I serve the food right away?
-Sure.

49
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,385
-Would you like some wine?
-No, I'm good.

50
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,056
You must be a regular.

51
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:26,933
The hall is packed.

52
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,018
It's just that I love to dine out.

53
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,646
-What about alcohol?
-I enjoy wine now and again.

54
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,606
So you must tune into my show.

55
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,566
-Not really.
-You don't?

56
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,567
No.

57
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,281
I usually don't meet fans privately,

58
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,866
but you're hard to read
whether you're a fan or not.

59
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,744
I don't think you could call me that.

60
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,706
Then why did you send
a bottle of wine to my table?

61
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,083
I was just happy to see you, that's all.

62
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,295
Those I see through media outlets
seem like acquaintances in a way.

63
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,005
How generous of you

64
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,799
to send over expensive wine
to an "acquaintance."

65
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,385
-Are you disappointed that I'm not a fan?
-Hardly.

66
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,470
I should repay your generosity.

67
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,222
That's why I asked you to dinner.

68
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,475
You're just like you seem.
Very straightforward.

69
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,103
The industry made me this way.

70
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,187
What were you like before?

71
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,689
Well…

72
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,567
my friends teased me
for being naive and clumsy.

73
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,154
I was only being nice to them,

74
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:24,699
but men often mistook that friendship
for a romantic gesture.

75
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,869
I won't think that way,
so I'd appreciate your generosity.

76
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,956
Do you say your hobby
is listening to music?

77
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,750
That's more like my job.

78
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,626
I play golf once in a while.

79
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,630
You're probably older than me
judging by your appellation.

80
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,175
Your profile says you're 33.

81
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,220
-That's right.
-I'm two years older.

82
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:50,266
I bet some might think you're
in your twenties if you wore t-shirts.

83
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,810
In foreign countries,
people think I'm a student.

84
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,645
Does that make your day?

85
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,439
It's not upsetting at least.

86
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,151
I heard on a show that your husband
is a year younger than you.

87
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,569
That's right.

88
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,489
Why would he mention my husband
and not just talk about us?

89
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,074
What are the pros?

90
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,870
Usually, marrying a younger man
proves a woman's competency.

91
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,956
That's how most people
congratulated me when I got married,

92
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,417
but I won't know until later on in life.

93
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,379
You always know what to say.

94
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:24,258
Most women think before they talk,
but your answers come flying out.

95
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,260
Well, talking is how I make a living.

96
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,931
You seem to know a lot about women.

97
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,974
Are you asking if I've dated a lot?

98
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,061
The number isn't high by my standards.

99
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:39,190
I won't ask for the number
you think is adequate.

100
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,029
It's my father. I should take it.

101
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,989
Sure.

102
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,950
Yes, Father.

103
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,120
I'm eating dinner with a client. Sure.

104
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,705
The son of a business owner?

105
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,552
Have you been able to walk well lately?

106
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,513
I bet the stairs aren't easy.

107
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,227
My legs are still good.

108
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,938
You must watch your health
while you're healthy.

109
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,150
Joints should be greased
while they're still good.

110
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:30,741
They say that you can ignore
a dog while eating, but not a person.

111
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,452
Why aren't you offering me any?

112
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,911
You know I like strawberries.

113
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,707
She's so vicious.

114
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,838
You've been ignoring your husband
as if he's a ghost.

115
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,801
You know I'm the silent type.

116
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:53,055
That's why a few things
went by unmentioned.

117
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,349
It's how we Chungcheong men are.

118
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,769
Weren't you attracted to me
because of that?

119
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,731
-When did I say that?
-I don't know, but you did.

120
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,358
Let's go shopping tomorrow.

121
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,652
You love to shop and spend money.

122
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,031
Just call me "woman."

123
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,867
I'm "woman" and you're "fellow."

124
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,244
You know that was just a joke.

125
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,413
I apologize for everything, all right?

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,129
Your father once told me that being
respected and loved by one family member

127
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:30,218
is far more meaningful
than falling in love with 100 people.

128
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,011
That he did.

129
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,597
That's why I never cheated on you.

130
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,474
Not physically,

131
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,684
but you did emotionally.

132
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,061
Is this about Dong-mi again?

133
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:44,982
Remember how good
your father was to your mother?

134
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,445
Did he ever belittle her
and give herbal medicine to another woman?

135
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,030
You never know.

136
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,034
He could've been lucky enough
not to have been caught.

137
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,953
Are you badmouthing your late father

138
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,287
to justify your wrongdoing?

139
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,665
No, of course not.

140
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,209
Didn't you learn
anything from him growing up?

141
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,502
Can you just let it go?

142
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,629
Do you know what my mother said?

143
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,257
The best man is the one
who cares for his woman's health.

144
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,676
You worried about her health enough

145
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,553
to send her herbal medicine,

146
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,139
but never did you give a damn
when I showed discomfort.

147
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,934
The youth and energy stored in me

148
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:23,771
wore out while I gave my all
to you and your family.

149
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,608
Has Kim Dong-mi ever cooked for you

150
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,278
or washed your handkerchief for you?

151
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,779
I never gave her any money.

152
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,863
Shut it!

153
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,618
Stop annoying me and get lost.

154
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,046
Still, make sure you take those.

155
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,396
One of the children went into the restroom
while drinking juice

156
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,981
and lost grip of the bottle.

157
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,568
Ji-a was right behind
and slipped on the shards

158
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,070
as she entered the restroom.

159
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,698
A shard nicked her arm.

160
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,744
The cut was a centimeter away
from an artery, so it could've been worse.

161
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,459
Is the first-aid kit in your room, Mother?

162
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,543
Yes.

163
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,295
Does your head hurt?

164
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,881
Mine's throbbing too.

165
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,556
That reminds me.

166
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,643
No, I'll tell you later.

167
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,019
Tell me what?

168
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,562
It still hurts.

169
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,654
Go to a different academy or take a break.

170
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,657
She needs to study though.

171
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,869
-Dad.
-Have you been drinking?

172
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,540
-Yes.
-You have it good, don't you?

173
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,459
Did you meet her?

174
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,794
Song?

175
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,631
-Song Yuan?
-Do you not even care about her?

176
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,633
She said she'd call

177
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,177
once she gets back from Jeju.

178
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,390
-Did you check that she left?
-No.

179
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,184
She might've lied about going

180
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,479
to give herself some peace and quiet.

181
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,980
Is that so?

182
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,235
-So what?
-Don't speak like she's some stranger.

183
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,278
She didn't seem like the lying type.

184
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,531
I only met her once, but still.

185
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,327
Why are you sighing? Because you miss her?

186
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,871
You have no idea
how I'm feeling right now.

187
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,958
How could I possibly know
what you're going through

188
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,586
when I never fathered
a child out of wedlock?

189
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:57,842
Just bear the pain.
Blessing finds those who do.

190
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,969
I don't need to be blessed.

191
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,977
Don't just wait for her to call
and check in on her.

192
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,228
See how she's doing.

193
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,647
All right. Where are you right now?

194
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,859
Finish your drink and go home already.
You'll only ruin your health.

195
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,569
I'm home.

196
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,864
Right. Sure thing.

197
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,245
Why are you drinking?

198
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:28,831
Because I'm tired.

199
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,125
Then a can of beer would have sufficed.

200
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,710
Right.

201
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:36,338
That reminds me. Shouldn't the tester
show the result by now?

202
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,590
Says the expert.

203
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,260
I didn't get pregnant this time.

204
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,684
My boyfriend gave it to me
so I could wear it on set.

205
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,314
It kills to see your child in trouble.

206
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,066
I was scared out of my wits today.

207
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,943
I'll have nightmares for sure.

208
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,737
We'll have to help Ji-a wash up.

209
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,493
-Yu-sin.
-Yes?

210
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,371
-What is it?
-Your puffer jacket.

211
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,581
What about it?

212
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,543
Some woman had the jacket
you gave to your friend in LA.

213
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,798
What do you mean?

214
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,511
Outside the broadcasting station,
a crew was filming a movie or a TV series.

215
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,598
An actress I didn't recognize
had your puffer jacket.

216
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,600
I doubt it.

217
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,312
But that's the only one
with the burn on the inside.

218
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,235
-Really?
-Yes.

219
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,321
I asked where she got it
and she said it was from her boyfriend.

220
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,076
That boyfriend must be me then.

221
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,536
Stop joking around.

222
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,581
Could Cheol-ho have given it to someone?

223
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:56,001
Then that actress
must be your friend's girlfriend.

224
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,921
There's no way that's true.

225
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,048
-He's in the US.
-Call him and ask.

226
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,637
It's morning in LA.

227
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,558
Besides, what if
he really did give it to someone

228
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,727
who gave it to that actress in Korea?

229
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,229
He'd feel terribly guilty.

230
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,650
LA doesn't have the weather
to wear a jacket like that,

231
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,652
so he must've given it to a family member.

232
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,821
-Really?
-That's the only explanation.

233
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,908
He should've just sent it back to me.
It was bought in Milan.

234
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,953
Didn't you tell him
that I was the one who bought it for you?

235
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,538
And make him feel guilty?

236
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,375
I'm glad someone's putting it to use.
An actress, no less.

237
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,877
I hate it though.

238
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,297
Some random woman
is wearing the jacket I bought you.

239
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,048
Buy me a better one some other time.

240
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,010
I'll wear it carefully
and not burn it this time.

241
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,761
I won't ever give it to anyone else.

242
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,473
Now, let's go to bed!

243
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,393
I bet you're not an only child.

244
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,561
How did you know?

245
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,981
It's the vibe you give off.
You're like a well-loved youngest son.

246
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,151
Yes, I have an older brother.

247
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,197
-You must adore your nieces and nephews.
-Do I have any?

248
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,324
You must certainly do.

249
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,909
Nothing is for certain.

250
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,662
A sunny morning
should result in a clear day,

251
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,206
but it sometimes rains and gets cloudy.

252
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,626
-You don't have any nieces or nephews?
-No.

253
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,961
I know what you'll ask next.

254
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,340
"Why aren't you married?"
or "Are you against marriage?"

255
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,010
I can refrain from
the obvious answers, right?

256
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,595
Please don't. I'd like to know.

257
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,016
-I'm only kidding.
-Maybe you're not.

258
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,895
-I'm curious though.
-I will marry in five years.

259
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:41,774
If you're not seeing anyone,
I could set you up with a newscaster.

260
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,275
I find blind dates boring.

261
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,653
You must have someone.

262
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,364
I'm not ready
to commit to anyone just yet.

263
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,367
-Not with a person?
-Not a person or anything else.

264
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,869
Now, tell me about yourself.

265
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,330
About my past?

266
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,540
About my present or future?

267
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,459
To know the present, I must know the past.

268
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,752
Are you a Buddhist?

269
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:05,214
Not really.
But I read a few books on religion.

270
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,843
He's a match for me in many ways.

271
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,514
He doesn't bore me
and keeps me on my toes.

272
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,153
Goodness. You must be Dongmi.

273
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,073
-She seems gentle.
-Dogs take after their owners.

274
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,159
She sleeps indoors in the winter.

275
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,203
Dogs of this size
are sensitive to the cold.

276
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,204
Jun-jae?

277
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,625
-Thank you.
-Sure.

278
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,715
I've never been to
a house like this before.

279
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,301
Come by often to relax.

280
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,469
Think of it as home.

281
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,724
Here.

282
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,894
Here.

283
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,103
Go ahead.

284
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,991
You must need a gardener.

285
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,659
-Right.
-You have no idea

286
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,329
how much our granddaughters
love the front yard.

287
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:04,166
I can't wait for spring to come
so that we can host a barbecue party.

288
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,542
What's your choice of meat?

289
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,252
I'm not picky in that way.

290
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,964
Although, I haven't been able
to enjoy duck.

291
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,758
We have similar palates!

292
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,177
You don't like duck

293
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,678
-ever since that indigestion.
-Right.

294
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,098
Stay the night. We have many vacant rooms.

295
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,434
-It's all right.
-You can wear my pajamas.

296
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,727
Maybe some other day.

297
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,071
Bada.

298
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,492
You may not have grandparents
from my side,

299
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,996
but your father's parents
are very eager to meet you.

300
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,583
They are nice people

301
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:51,755
who already love you
with all their hearts.

302
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,184
Hello?

303
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,312
You actually picked up.
Where are you right now?

304
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,858
I was just about to call you.

305
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,568
I came back from Jeju, you see.

306
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:16,363
Really? I'm on my way to Seoul
to run an errand.

307
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,115
Could we meet for dinner?

308
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,033
Sure.

309
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,373
Come on in.

310
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,723
Okay, here we go.

311
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,600
Nice.

312
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,772
A Mi, they want you.

313
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,535
Pi-young, don't be ridiculous!

314
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,175
RADIO STATION

315
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,986
It'd be cool if Santa was real.

316
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,363
Is it a gift you want?

317
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,864
It's not that.

318
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,159
An old man flying through the sky
on a sleigh pulled by reindeer.

319
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,912
Magical, right? It's like a fairytale.

320
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,790
When did you find out
that Santa wasn't real?

321
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,541
I guess I just naturally did.

322
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,168
-In elementary school?
-Yes.

323
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,336
Mom, what about you?

324
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,338
I was in third grade.

325
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,132
On Christmas Eve,
to get a glimpse of Santa,

326
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,176
I forced myself to stay up.

327
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,388
I ended up seeing my dad
come into my room with a gift in his arms.

328
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,979
NAM GA-BIN

329
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,026
-Hello?
-This is Nam Ga-bin.

330
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,070
-Hello.
-Right.

331
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,155
I was hoping to meet you sometime.

332
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,741
That's why I called.

333
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,909
You have more to say?

334
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,040
He wore the puffer jacket
when he left for the airport.

335
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,792
It was in his car

336
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,378
which he gave it to an old friend
he ran into.

337
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,088
Even if he was seeing her,

338
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,340
they couldn't have met
on the day he got back.

339
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,843
Besides, you don't give
your clothes as gifts.

340
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,469
You'd buy a new one.

341
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,933
Why are you still here?

342
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,811
Ms. Sa.

343
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,397
-Yes?
-Why are you still here?

344
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,274
I'm choosing the songs.

345
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,525
I can't focus at home.

346
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,534
Yu-sin's telling the truth.

347
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,789
-A warm Americano, please.
-Sure.

348
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,375
-One cup, right?
-Yes.

349
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,962
-See you tomorrow then.
-Sure.

350
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,677
Yu-sin, I just finished filming
and am going horseback riding.

351
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,097
It's a better stress relief
than being with you.

352
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,813
I'd rather sit up front.

353
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,607
Come and sit in the back.

354
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,115
Where's Ms. So?

355
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,618
-My errand didn't concern her.
-I see.

356
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,412
How was the weather in Jeju?

357
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:55,707
It's not cold these days,
but still quite windy.

358
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,210
-Sea breeze can be chilly.
-Right.

359
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,753
Was that bird poop?

360
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:01,880
Yes.

361
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,633
-Was that funny?
-Yes.

362
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,594
Laughing is always good.
Especially for the baby.

363
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,643
I hope Ms. So is well.

364
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,602
She is.

365
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:21,733
On the most recent day we met,
Sa-hyeon gave me this.

366
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,443
It looks good on you.

367
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,987
-We should've gotten you something too.
-Gosh, no.

368
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,740
How did your brother and his wife
take the news?

369
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,703
They seemed flustered at first,

370
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,914
but then congratulated me.

371
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,500
I spared them the details though.

372
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,212
Sa-hyeon seems to be
quite worried about you.

373
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,256
Of course he would be.

374
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,176
Please tell him that I'm doing fine.

375
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,429
-And the morning sickness?
-It's better now.

376
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,848
I'm glad.

377
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:56,643
You'll soon get cravings,
so don't hesitate to tell me.

378
00:23:56,726 --> 00:24:00,063
What they don't sell in restaurants,
we'll make for you at the house.

379
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:03,942
My wife is an exceptional cook, you see.

380
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,528
-Mother, it's me.
-Yes?

381
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,863
Have you had dinner?

382
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,157
Yes. I ate early since it was just me.

383
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,285
Have you met that woman recently?

384
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,287
She isn't back from Jeju yet.

385
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,916
Once she does,
meet her, and take a photo of her for me.

386
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,084
Why?

387
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:25,755
I'm curious, that's why.
I need to know what she looks like.

388
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,049
Like I said, she's average-looking.

389
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,427
And what excuse could I give her?

390
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,554
She'll know who the photo is for.

391
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:37,184
Then take her to a fancy restaurant.

392
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:40,020
Pretend to take a photo
of a unique dish that's served

393
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,938
and tilt the phone up a little.

394
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,232
That wouldn't be right.

395
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,568
And carrying a married man's child is?

396
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,778
Please, Mother.

397
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,782
This is for my wife.
She'll want to know what we ate.

398
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,411
It looks tasty in the photo.

399
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,497
Now, dig in.

400
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,267
I heard your stomach rumbling.

401
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,103
Don't mind me and dig in already.

402
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,438
You heard that?

403
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,981
I'm not deaf yet, you know.

404
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,903
Are you here alone? That's new.

405
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,030
Yu-sin will be here soon.

406
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:36,284
Traffic's heavy at this hour.
Do you want some tea?

407
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,662
I already had a lot today.

408
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:42,207
-Yu-sin.
-Hey.

409
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,417
Good evening.

410
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,878
Good evening. It's been a while.

411
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:50,131
Right. I've been busy.
With what is lost on me though.

412
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,425
-Did you go riding?
-Yes.

413
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,887
You live at Pavilio Apartments, right?

414
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,557
-Yes.
-A friend moved there after his divorce.

415
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,851
You should have said hello.

416
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:02,936
I was driving away.

417
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,106
She doesn't find our place comfortable.

418
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:10,944
See you, then.

419
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,622
Have you ever argued with Sa-hyeon?

420
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,916
No.

421
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,002
-Not even once?
-No.

422
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,463
We've only been acquaintances.

423
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,216
You know, I honestly don't get it.

424
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,681
We met while working out at the same gym

425
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,935
and Sa-hyeon would come to me for advice
with personal problems.

426
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:48,189
So you were like his…

427
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,609
-Counselor?
-Yes, what exactly is that though?

428
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,112
It's been a while since I was in school.

429
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:57,490
A counselor is someone who
consults on your issues and gives advice.

430
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,160
I see. What kind of issues?

431
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,912
-Work-related?
-Actually…

432
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:07,000
they were more about his issues at home.

433
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,668
With Hye-ryung?

434
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,422
That's her name, you see.

435
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,508
I wouldn't call her gentle.

436
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,511
She's like a poster child
for a strong career woman.

437
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:21,931
Fruit?

438
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:25,352
I'm full. The meal was so delicious
that I ate past my limit.

439
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,395
It's better than being hungry.

440
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,237
Well, I don't know if you noticed,

441
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,574
but I haven't been on the best terms
with my wife lately.

442
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:41,451
It's like the Cold War.

443
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:42,994
What triggered it?

444
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,621
A misunderstanding.

445
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,165
She won't even talk to me
when we're alone.

446
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,625
You should try and appease her.

447
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:52,087
I've tried.
A bag full of money didn't work.

448
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,630
She's sulking like a child.

449
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,591
Is her anger justified?

450
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,551
It's absolutely nothing by my standards,

451
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,887
so maybe it's because she's a woman.

452
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,306
She won't accept my apology.

453
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,601
Whether she won't or she can't
is lost on me.

454
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,956
What you did was--

455
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:31,000
-Am I in the wrong?
-May I be honest with you?

456
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,170
-Sure.
-You stepped over the line.

457
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,172
You don't care about her in that way,

458
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,342
but you got carried away
since she's a hometown friend.

459
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,885
Exactly.

460
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:46,307
The Lord will know that I'm not lying
about not having feelings for her.

461
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,978
Showering Ms. So with gifts
will only make things worse.

462
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,523
Only a heartfelt apology
will truly appease her.

463
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,901
I want to sincerely apologize too.

464
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,530
Not half-heartedly.

465
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,074
It should be a sincere
and heartfelt apology.

466
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,955
How can I show her I'm sincere?
Should I write a letter?

467
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,459
Men are terrible when it comes to words.

468
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,670
Letters can be trickier.

469
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,216
If you've tried apologizing to her,

470
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,554
why don't you go all the way and kneel?

471
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,639
Was what I did that wrong?

472
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,975
Men shouldn't do things like that.

473
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,770
We shouldn't be kneeling to women.

474
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:35,064
Imagine that Ms. So had been
harboring feelings for her first love

475
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,609
throughout your whole marriage.

476
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,570
What if she didn't show you any affection,

477
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:44,073
but bought herbal medicine
for that man in secret?

478
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,658
How would you feel about that?

479
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,369
I'D SEE RED

480
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,455
Apologize until she accepts it

481
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,374
and say that you'll kneel until she does.

482
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,793
Tell her you'll stay up all night.

483
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,336
What about my knees, then?

484
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,671
She won't let you kneel all night.

485
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:02,634
She's more vicious than I thought.
This incident taught me that.

486
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:07,180
A gesture as grand as that
and a heartfelt apology

487
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,390
will tame her temper.

488
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,227
Most women feel the same way, you see.

489
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,896
And doing something half-heartedly
has no effect.

490
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,865
Wait. I thought it was date night
for you and Yu-sin.

491
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,617
He's horseback riding.

492
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,077
He's riding this late?

493
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:30,954
Yes.

494
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,754
Have this instead.

495
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,215
-Thank you, Mother.
-You're welcome.

496
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:48,096
Gosh, that was rude of me.
You make me feel too comfortable.

497
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,430
I like how we seem closer.

498
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:55,770
It's not too sweet
and quenches my thirst perfectly.

499
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,648
Maybe he's out drinking instead.

500
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,859
-At a bar with girls?
-Yes.

501
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,444
He doesn't like things like that.
You know that.

502
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,739
You never know.
Who rides horses until this late at night?

503
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,366
You should see his muscular thighs.

504
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:15,748
He should be able to enjoy
talking and drinking with men his age.

505
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,135
-You'll be late today?
-Yes.

506
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,596
Then I'll go horseback riding.

507
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,098
It's better than going to a house
without you in it.

508
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,975
But there's Ji-a and Mother.

509
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,478
Welcoming me home
should be you though, my dear wife.

510
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,523
-"My dear wife"?
-The lady of the house.

511
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,988
-Are you feeling better?
-Yes.

512
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,199
How about a drink then?

513
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,492
At my place.

514
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,912
-Do you have beer?
-We can buy some

515
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,204
and order fried chicken.

516
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,834
Could there be trouble in paradise?

517
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,754
I doubt it.

518
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,385
Could something be wrong with Hae-ryun?

519
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,012
Cheers.

520
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,356
I should have come to Korea
right after graduation.

521
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,150
If I had, I'd be a known actress by now.

522
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,777
Then we wouldn't have met.

523
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,654
We would have if it was meant to be.

524
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,824
Don't you think it's fate
that we're together?

525
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,661
-Don't you?
-If that were true,

526
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,454
we'd be married.

527
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,331
It's not like you to believe in fate.

528
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:43,628
Marriage is love
when it turns into a formality.

529
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:48,007
Meanwhile, some kinds of love
just keeps going, like with us.

530
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,807
-Aren't we in love?
-We are.

531
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,850
You're being awfully moody today.

532
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,144
How about a pick-me-up?

533
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,322
This month…

534
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,075
will be our last.

535
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,329
I realized that I'm no help to you.

536
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,455
Who said I needed help?

537
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,374
Once you become well-known,

538
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,418
we'll have to break up anyway.

539
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:27,213
Why? When did we ever agree on that?

540
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,466
Celebrities have a love life too,
you know.

541
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,051
This is different though.

542
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,304
-You know what I mean.
-We can find a way.

543
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,224
I'll be dragging you down.

544
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,643
Working in this field

545
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,771
could lead to meeting someone better.

546
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,606
Nothing matters more than how I feel.

547
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,817
Even with love,
some things are unsolvable.

548
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,446
I'm not ready to break up.

549
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,657
Were your feelings for me this simple?

550
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,535
Simple enough to break up this easily?

551
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:01,205
Knowing that I'm dragging you down
overwhelms me with guilt.

552
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,874
Don't you dare think that way.

553
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:06,169
I don't want anything more.
All I need is you by my side.

554
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,628
How am I of help to you?

555
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,130
And how am I of help to you?

556
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,215
Is our relationship about give and take?

557
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,468
All we have between us is innocent love.

558
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,929
-Everything comes to an end.
-Not now.

559
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:21,934
Focus on your work.
You've made enough friends now.

560
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:25,021
I just met them for work.
They're not really friends.

561
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:30,860
If I could be selfish with my emotions,
I'd keep you by my side.

562
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,070
Then do that!

563
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,447
As a father myself, I can't.

564
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,033
Did…

565
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,577
your wife find out?

566
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,620
No.

567
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:45,374
I just want to end it
before it gets more painful.

568
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:50,046
Better now
before things get ugly between us.

569
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:54,342
We'll end things now while we
still can give each other our blessings.

570
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,887
I'm not mature enough for that yet.

571
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,515
Think how determined you were
when you got here.

572
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,727
It's never easy to juggle
both a career and a relationship.

573
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,188
-Give up on one.
-Then it'll be my career.

574
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,606
That's ridiculous.

575
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,484
You'll thank me in the long run.

576
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,568
Don't you love me?

577
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:18,449
Just like water that flows,
we move onto new people

578
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,660
while forgetting those in our past.

579
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,621
That's life.

580
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,290
Will you forget me in a few months then?

581
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,543
You'll forever be in my heart.

582
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:30,878
How could I forget you?

583
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,465
It's just as painful for me too.

584
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:38,386
Then why? Why must we end it?

585
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,014
I can't.

586
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,562
You don't know me at all.

587
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:52,316
I'm not as strong as you think I am.

588
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,484
I do know you.

589
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,237
I know many men have been eyeing you too.

590
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,197
Am I to choose one of them?

591
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,659
I don't care if 100 men like me.

592
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:05,288
The only one I love is you,
so what use is that?

593
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,915
I couldn't care less about the other guys.

594
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,179
Can't you choose me instead?

595
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,891
I'll just have to be greedy then.

596
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:28,603
Choose me.
I'll love you with all my heart.

597
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:30,730
Please?

598
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,194
White blood cells which are immunocytes

599
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,905
get to work
by traveling through our blood.

600
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:42,450
It protects our body
from germs and viruses.

601
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,118
That's why our body…

602
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,496
-Good night, sir.
-See you.

603
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,795
Fine. I'll kneel for crying out loud.

604
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,883
Dongmi!

605
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,927
Were you keeping the house safe for me?

606
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,221
Good girl.

607
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,566
Where did she go?

608
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,861
-Hello?
-Yes, sir.

609
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,781
Did my wife step out?
Even her phone is off.

610
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,408
I asked, but she left without telling me.

611
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,868
With or without a packed bag?

612
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,370
With a packed bag.

613
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,582
-How big?
-The biggest suitcase you have.

614
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,459
-Could she have gone abroad?
-No way.

615
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,420
-It didn't seem that way.
-I see.

616
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,968
Bangkok?

617
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,930
What was the name of that person?

618
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,100
Could she have gone
to see her school friend?

619
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,602
Her passport…

620
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,110
Dongmi, do you know where her passport is?

621
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,903
No?

622
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:12,808
Don't tell me she went to join
a monastery or something.

623
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,155
"Return to Amita Buddha,
the Buddha of infinite light and life."

624
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,449
VEHICLE ARRIVES: 54S2200

625
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,413
You should sleep in your room.

626
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,938
Dr. Shin.

627
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:39,079
Dongmi, I'm afraid
we'll have to change your name.

628
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,582
To Yejeong, not Dongmi.

629
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,835
That'll probably upset her too.

630
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,630
"I'm not a dog, you know!"

631
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,759
She gets angry when I do one thing

632
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,970
and then angry again
when I do something else.

633
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:56,972
It's not easy.

634
00:41:57,056 --> 00:42:00,684
You know, you have it much easier
than I do.

635
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,896
Female dogs don't nag you in any way

636
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:08,901
and are thrilled
just to get a bite to eat.

637
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:14,198
The lady of this house
was a puppy when we first got married.

638
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,992
But she turned into a fox,

639
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,328
and now she's a tiger!

640
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,457
However…

641
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:30,214
despite her being scary,
she also makes life thrilling.

642
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,261
-Knock, knock.
-Yes?

643
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,683
-I'm sorry.
-About what?

644
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,059
I didn't greet you last night.

645
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,978
Oh, that.

646
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,147
I thought that's what you wanted.
Didn't you mean it?

647
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,150
I just assumed you were tired.
You didn't stir when I kissed you.

648
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,027
-Did you kiss me?
-Of course.

649
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,535
The day's already off to a good start.

650
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:13,215
Do you have plans for Christmas?

651
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,468
No. Please, just cut to the chase

652
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,220
and skip the formalities.

653
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:23,267
I was thinking about having the wedding
after Lunar New Year.

654
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,102
Of course you can.

655
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,187
Still, I wanted to ask first.

656
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,982
It's because I'm not that young.

657
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,859
Did Hae-ryun suggest that you ask me?

658
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:36,405
Is he worried
that the wedding won't go smoothly?

659
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:39,158
No, he doesn't know I called you.

660
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,035
Do as you wish.

661
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,871
I won't congratulate you though.

662
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,498
Since I'd be lying through my teeth.

663
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,168
Neither my children nor I

664
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:52,004
harbor any resentment toward him.

665
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:54,006
We accepted the truth and moved on.

666
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:57,885
Thank you.

667
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,388
Your parents must have approved.

668
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,767
Barely. I met with them recently.

669
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:11,148
Also, I wish to be with child.

670
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,193
Before it's too late.

671
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:20,991
It's natural to want a child
with the person you love.

672
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:24,370
I would love for Hyang-gi and U-ram
to come and go.

673
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,081
Could that be possible?

674
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,999
Just like they do overseas?

675
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,587
Life isn't that predictable.

676
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,341
Never did I imagine
sitting across from you

677
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,302
talking about this of all things.

678
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,223
There may come a time
for the kids to visit your family,

679
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:46,809
but not now.

680
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,185
Whenever that may be…

681
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,105
Even if it takes years,
I'd still want that.

682
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,902
May I be honest with you?

683
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:01,240
I actually want us to be friends.

684
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,784
I know it's too much, but still…

685
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:17,649
Hold on.

686
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:20,360
Right.

687
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:50,682
This car runs solely on an electric motor,

688
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,518
so it'll be quiet inside.

689
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:56,021
It also has cruise control,
so is popular with…

690
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,439
SHIN YU-SIN

691
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,400
It can be delivered to your house.

692
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,654
It's fine. Just don't forget
the glass coating.

693
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:04,655
Of course.

694
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:09,993
No wonder the room seems empty.
You took down the tree.

695
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,120
We're selfish that way.

696
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:15,290
You love the festive mood it brings
until Christmas Day,

697
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:16,625
but then it gets old.

698
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:22,548
I had a lot of fun decorating the tree
with you back in the day.

699
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:26,426
You gave me
all the happy childhood memories I have.

700
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,887
I liked it back then too. I was younger.

701
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,098
Do you miss being younger
or spending time with me?

702
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,349
Both.

703
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:36,144
I don't know if you remember,
but you asked me this once.

704
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,063
You asked if I wanted a younger sibling.

705
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,106
And you refused.

706
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,524
-Do you remember that?
-Sure.

707
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,360
It was because
I wanted your love for myself.

708
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,028
Do you regret it now?

709
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,239
I'm not one to live in regret,

710
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,033
but I feel bad for you.

711
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,829
You'd be less lonely
if you had a daughter.

712
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,915
It's not like I can choose
what sex my child will be.

713
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:57,916
I'll do better.

714
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,715
Why didn't you go to the musical?

715
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,134
Mother and daughter
should have some alone time.

716
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:10,470
Didn't you say you wanted to see
the Vienna Philharmonic New Year Concert?

717
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,556
-Yes.
-I asked around,

718
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,183
-and tickets sell out a year before.
-Really?

719
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:18,312
I can pull some strings
and get one for next year though.

720
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,898
-Get two. For me and Pi-young.
-Sure.

721
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,736
Aren't your shoulders stiff?
Let me massage them.

722
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,613
Does it show on my face?

723
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:30,449
-Yes.
-Maybe you're psychic.

724
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:33,368
Maybe I am.
Cross me and you'll get a spanking.

725
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,745
Got it.

726
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,122
Lie down then.

727
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,292
I'm too tall for the couch though.

728
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:44,630
Unbelievable.
You're as good as an actual masseuse.

729
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,466
A woman who's good at one thing
is good at everything.

730
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,301
You're right.

731
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:50,886
Actually, I took classes.

732
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,930
You took classes? Really?

733
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:57,059
Yes, I thought it'd help
for when I do volunteer work.

734
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,352
At nursing homes.

735
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,312
There's my hospital though.

736
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,231
Show off your handiwork there.

737
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,733
It'll be for the unfortunate.

738
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:07,277
Not everyone can do volunteer work.

739
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,196
You should enjoy your life now.

740
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,407
I want to do some good in life
while I still have the strength.

741
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:15,577
Come to think of it,
I've never done anything selfless before.

742
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:19,081
That's not true.
You took care of me and my father.

743
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,625
Talking will only disrupt your breathing.

744
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,919
Got it.

745
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:29,132
-I might just fall asleep.
-Go ahead.

746
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,542
Is someone there?

747
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:21,995
What are you doing here?

748
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:25,207
-Is your mom home?
-Probably.

749
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,625
Didn't you call her?

750
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,172
Mom, Dad's downstairs.

751
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:39,346
He wants to tell you something
but can't bring himself to come up here.

752
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:42,098
You can wait for her
at the coffee shop nearby.

753
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:45,185
Got it. How have you been lately?

754
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,437
I'm good.

755
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,106
How's the academy?

756
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:00,617
I ordered you black tea.

757
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,537
I hear coffee drains you of calcium

758
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,288
and is bad for your bones.

759
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,333
-Would you like coffee instead?
-Says who?

760
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,960
Who says it's bad for your bones?

761
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,671
No wonder she didn't drink the coffee.

762
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:15,215
I thought it was
because I intimidated her,

763
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:19,386
but she must not drink coffee at all.

764
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,308
It's fine.

765
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,443
She's truly grateful.

766
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:37,195
I heard you two met.

767
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,866
If you'd allow it,
she wants to be someone closest to you--

768
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,618
Well, we're as close as anyone can get

769
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:45,328
since we share a husband.

770
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:49,666
It's true how they say
that one's life can't be good

771
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:52,127
from the early years to the latter years.

772
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:55,547
For me, only my early years were sunny.

773
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:59,718
But in your case,
only your early years were dark.

774
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:03,388
Your middle years weren't so bad

775
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,224
and your latter years will be sunny.

776
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,645
You must have done something right
in your past life

777
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,647
to luck out with wives.

778
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:17,110
Nam Ga-bin seemed
more innocent than I expected her to be.

779
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:19,654
If we hadn't met
under these circumstances,

780
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:23,241
we might have been good friends
despite the age difference.

781
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,493
I know it's shameless of me to say this,

782
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,079
but that's what I want too.

783
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:33,293
Ga-bin is more innocent
than the average woman her age.

784
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,753
Not more than you though.

785
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:37,839
I guess men learn a few tricks
when they have an affair.

786
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:40,467
They get better at saying
what they don't mean

787
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,801
and at lying.

788
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,471
It's not like that. I truly mean it.

789
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,265
Back in the day, the first and second wife

790
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,517
would live together like sisters.

791
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,604
Is that what you came here to ask of me?

792
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:54,648
-No.
-Then what?

793
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,609
Is it to ask if U-ram
can be a flower boy at your wedding?

794
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,027
Is that it?

795
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:06,868
I came here to tell you
about Ji-a's family.

796
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,624
-What about them?
-Ji-a's father

797
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,209
is having an affair.

798
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:17,963
Professor Han preached about
the benefits of horseback riding.

799
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,173
It didn't seem to cost that much,

800
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:23,760
so I went with him
to a ranch in Bundang recently.

801
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:27,555
I saw Ji-a's father there
with a younger woman.

802
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,015
Maybe she's an employee.

803
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:33,228
It didn't seem that way.
Besides, that would be wrong too.

804
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,354
Did you say hello?

805
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,649
Professor Han was with me,
so I just kept my distance.

806
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,485
I didn't want to catch him off guard.

807
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:43,530
Not all female companions
are girlfriends, you know.

808
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,074
There's a certain vibe that's noticeable.

809
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,492
Were they displaying affection?

810
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:48,702
They were on horses.

811
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,705
So? She's probably his relative.

812
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:54,916
But if I'm right though…

813
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,961
I felt bad about keeping quiet

814
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:00,839
since I didn't want it to end badly.

815
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:01,923
Like us?

816
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:09,681
Nam Ga-bin said she wants a baby.

817
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:14,352
I can only imagine that child
being the apple of your eye.

818
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,064
At least one of us will live a good life.

819
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,274
It's our fate, I guess.

820
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:23,278
Wouldn't U-ram and Hyang-gi
enjoy having another sibling?

821
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,655
If it were you, would you adore

822
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:29,868
your half-sibling
just because you have the same father?

823
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:36,041
Are you naive or just thoughtless?

824
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,002
I know there are no limits to greed,

825
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,838
but take it down a notch.

826
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:20,478
Why was the safety lock on
when it's daytime?

827
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:21,688
Beats me.

828
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,067
Maybe Yu-sin did.

829
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,778
So where is he?

830
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,824
He's been quiet, so maybe he's sleeping.

831
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:35,118
I thought you were eating out.

832
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:50,008
Se-mi's parents-in-law
came to visit out of the blue.

833
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,553
A nap will ruin his night sleep though.

834
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:56,931
The tranquil mood must have
knocked him out.

835
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,433
He's snoring too.

836
00:57:58,516 --> 00:57:59,976
That's not like him.

837
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,519
Exactly.

838
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:05,815
Even women snore when they're exhausted.

839
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:09,194
-The in-laws came unannounced?
-Yes.

840
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:13,865
Gosh. I know it's their son's house,
but they shouldn't show up unannounced.

841
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:14,782
Tell me about it.

842
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:19,204
-Were you desperate to pee?
-Yes.

843
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,457
-Did you wash your hands?
-Of course.

844
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,361
They should have had dinner outside.

845
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,535
He could be right about Ji-a's dad.

846
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,454
Who knew Hae-ryun
would stab me in the back?

847
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,290
Men can pretty much be the same.

848
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,419
I should let Pi-young know.

849
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,592
They'll be together since it's a Sunday.

850
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,891
Hye-ryung said she'd get pregnant,
but there's no news.

851
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,810
It doesn't happen overnight, you know.

852
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,270
But she's still young.

853
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:27,605
Could she have changed her mind?

854
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:30,608
She could be getting cold feet.

855
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,902
A baby means
she'll have to cut back on work.

856
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,821
That greed of hers.

857
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,906
Why bother when her in-laws are loaded?

858
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:40,076
That's rich coming from you of all people.

859
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,122
I…

860
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:49,002
need to get this off my chest.

861
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,547
You'll soon find out anyway.

862
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:53,923
Are you seeing someone?

863
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,720
Hae-ryun's getting married.

864
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:02,974
Unbelievable.
He's actually marrying this woman?

865
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,352
It's Nam Ga-bin.

866
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,024
That Nam Ga-bin?

867
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,361
That's insane.

868
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:27,582
The love I hid for so long

869
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:31,586
The love I can't shout out
For people to hear

870
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:33,421
She wants to be with child

871
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,633
and already asked for
her parents' blessing.

872
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:37,675
Unbelievable.

873
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:42,305
Are you okay with this?

874
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:43,640
It's as you see.

875
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,226
It's true that people were born to adapt

876
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,146
and that time does heal wounds.

877
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:53,024
I learned to accept it.

878
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,402
It's nothing compared
to losing a child anyway.

879
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:58,237
I'm speechless.

880
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,907
When people get wind of the wedding,

881
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,493
I'll be known as the poor divorcée
who lost her husband.

882
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:06,913
They say it'll be a small wedding
with just friends and family,

883
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,290
but she's a public figure.

884
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,084
The media will report on it.

885
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,004
I feel terrible.

886
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:18,091
Life is full of surprises
and is unpredictable.

887
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:20,635
One should never be arrogant.

888
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:22,220
As if you are.

889
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,305
Maybe that's why you didn't see it coming.

890
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,265
You're just too kind.

891
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:31,979
Yesterday, Hae-ryun came to see me
regarding your matter.

892
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,608
-What about me?
-He went horseback riding

893
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,026
and saw your husband.

894
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,611
Really?

895
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,739
Is Professor Park taking up the sport
with Nam Ga-bin?

896
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,534
He was with a young woman.

897
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,329
My husband?

898
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:53,167
According to him,
they seemed pretty close.

899
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:59,424
I told him it was probably
an employee or acquaintance,

900
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,634
but you never know.

901
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:04,011
Just look at me, for example.

902
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,348
I figured there's no harm in checking.

903
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,735
Did he say hello? What did my husband say?

904
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:22,155
He was with a colleague

905
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:25,074
and kept a distance because of it,

906
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,160
so your husband didn't see him.

907
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,289
-What?
-She could just be a member.

908
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:34,125
-Was she pretty?
-He only said she was young.

909
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:37,587
All right.

910
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:40,089
Thank you for telling me.

911
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,190
Pi-young.

912
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:42,443
Your seat belt.

913
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,970
MINE

914
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:02,815
-Hello?
-Where are you?

915
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,610
-I'm on my way home.
-I'm going horseback riding.

916
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:10,448
-Was the bride pretty?
-As if I could tell.

917
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:13,826
In my eyes,
you are always the most beautiful.

918
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,454
You'll be late then.

919
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:18,205
If Dr. Cho is there, then yes.

920
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:23,461
Text me if so. I have dinner to consider.

921
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:26,631
Bye.

922
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,684
Yu-sin will eat out as well.

923
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,354
Okay.

924
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:51,030
No way.

925
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:53,824
Not Yu-sin, of all people.

926
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:03,209
Hey, Seo-ri.

927
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:06,003
How is it that you always sound dreadful?

928
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:08,923
I'm old now, that's why.

929
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:12,426
I finally booked a plane ticket.
I'll be in Korea next month!

930
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,286
I'm sorry, Mom.

931
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:22,872
I'm terribly sorry.

932
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:26,250
Did you think you could trick me?

933
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:28,085
-Thanks.
-You know, I shouldn't.

934
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:30,796
-What do you mean?
-Has he been lying to me all this time?

935
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:34,592
BUNDANG EQUESTRIAN COUNTRY CLUB

936
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:39,472
You might hear that your dad is

937
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:42,141
-getting married to his new girlfriend.
-Really?

938
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:48,647
Sin Central Medical Center, please.

939
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:58,032
Your husband is in room five.

940
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,954
Do you live in Nonhyeon-dong
by any chance?

941
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:09,001
