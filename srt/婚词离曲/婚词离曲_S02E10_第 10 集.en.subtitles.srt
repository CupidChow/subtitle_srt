EPISODE 10

2
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,519
We should go to a fortune-teller.

3
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,522
I looked up a few online.

4
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,565
To ask what?

5
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,400
Whether we're meant to be together.

6
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:12,072
Because no matter how hard
I think about it, we're meant to be.

7
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,241
Even if we're not meant to be,

8
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,452
a fortune-teller won't say it to our face.

9
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,829
Then tell me your date of birth.

10
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,082
I'll just go by myself.

11
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,542
You want to let a fortune-teller
decide our fate?

12
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,712
These things shouldn't be ignored.

13
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:32,175
A friend who was studying fortune-telling
once told me

14
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,969
that I was destined to marry twice.

15
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,096
I ignored him at the time,

16
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,099
but that's how things are now.

17
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,811
Our baby is growing inside you.

18
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,270
Must I repeat myself?

19
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,106
I don't want us to commit a sin.

20
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,819
Your wife is willing
to forgive you and move on,

21
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,737
so must you insist on getting a divorce?

22
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,989
I know what it's like.

23
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,158
What about being in a dreadful marriage?

24
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,577
I'm the one who has to endure her.

25
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,830
You saw first-hand how she is.

26
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,958
What I said about her is all true.

27
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,043
This is a choice you made though,

28
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:12,132
and taking responsibility for that choice
is the right thing to do…

29
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,635
regardless of gender or age.

30
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:19,973
But taking responsibility for my child
should be a priority.

31
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,851
We barely managed
to calm her down that day.

32
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,353
Must you put me in a tough spot again?

33
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,814
I still want to know
how compatible we are.

34
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,025
I know your birthday.
What time were you born?

35
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,610
The hour is important, I hear.

36
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,116
Many often meet better partners
after getting a divorce.

37
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,785
Hye-ryung can find someone
much better than I am.

38
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,662
She's just too proud to be a divorcée.

39
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,248
She doesn't love me.
Her love for me has withered.

40
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,917
Must we stay as a loveless couple?

41
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,627
That's not my problem.

42
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,337
Whatever.

43
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,756
So, what time were you born?

44
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,926
-I don't know.
-Don't be like that.

45
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,387
Must you make me worry?

46
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,348
Please let me be at ease. I'm begging you.

47
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:08,688
Seeing fortune-tellers
could bring bad luck to the baby.

48
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,691
-I'll get going then.
-Wait.

49
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,406
We should get something to eat first.

50
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,160
-Don't you even want to eat with me?
-No.

51
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:23,995
Keep your promise.

52
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,081
Like how even an unjust law
is still a law,

53
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,209
a mature person keeps his word.

54
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,435
Can you pour me some soju
in a plastic water bottle?

55
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,888
I'm just as sad as you are.

56
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,182
I never got to spend
a lot of time with Grandma.

57
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,019
Do you still not want to talk?

58
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,023
I want to hear your voice.

59
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:45,451
Your colleagues are here.
Would you like to see them?

60
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:56,004
Recent events taught me
that just being able to talk to each other

61
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,089
can bring you great happiness.

62
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,968
And on TV the other day,
I heard that one should be good

63
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,053
to another while you
still have the chance.

64
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,890
What happened to Grandma is proof of that.

65
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,060
There's no way to be good to her now.

66
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,325
Has Pi-young been eating at all?

67
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,868
No, not at all.

68
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,203
She's barely holding on
by getting IV fluids.

69
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,707
It might take a while
for her to get back on her feet.

70
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,125
What about Ji-a?

71
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,838
What brings you here?

72
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,257
I'm here to pay my respects
to a colleague.

73
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,216
Boo Hye-ryung?

74
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,678
No, the producer's mother passed away.

75
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,180
Do you have to stay?

76
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,849
-No.
-Then I'll quickly go and pay my respects.

77
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,685
Director Yoon's father passed away.
There was no obituary.

78
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,270
-And Father?
-He's not coming.

79
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,897
Should we meet at Eungomjib?

80
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,023
Sure.

81
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,535
Seo Ban and Seo Dong-ma.
Are they brothers?

82
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,914
So he's the eldest son of SF Electronics?

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,376
Are you not feeling well?

84
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,962
I'm fine. I just had to text someone.

85
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,934
I hear you gave my granddaughter
allowance money the other day.

86
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,227
You must adore kids.

87
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,686
All children are adorable.

88
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,356
We can all relate
having had a childhood ourselves.

89
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,155
Being the foodie she is,
she spent it all that very week.

90
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,324
I ate a lot too while growing up.

91
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,536
That's probably true.
I mean, you're very tall.

92
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,330
-Can I see your hand?
-Do you read palms?

93
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,626
Is this old lady interested in him?

94
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,587
It says that you must have had
a life-threatening incident.

95
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,297
Well, I did.

96
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,091
I see you're rich.

97
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,928
-I know you're not married though.
-Right.

98
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:12,056
Marriage at an early age would have
ended poorly. It's better to wait.

99
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,057
Will I marry though?

100
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,353
Of course.

101
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,480
And your personality--

102
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:23,818
Ms. Kim, are you reading his palm?

103
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,324
This isn't the fortune-teller's.

104
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:34,203
My sister, who just passed away,

105
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:39,125
so what are you doing reading the palms
of those who have come to mourn her?

106
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,211
She's Ji-a's great aunt.

107
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,466
He's the engineer Pi-young works with,

108
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,301
and I'm sure you know Ms. Boo--

109
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,178
Buddha said that

110
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,096
reading one's face or palm is useless

111
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,474
and that it's one's heart that matters.

112
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,644
It's Seo Ban.

113
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,313
-Seo Bang?
-No, Seo Ban.

114
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,858
Goodness. And I'm Seo-ri, Mo Seo-ri.

115
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,027
-A single syllable name?
-Yes.

116
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,446
Anyway, it's a pleasure to meet you.

117
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,948
Why don't we "Seo" siblings shake hands?

118
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,409
Actually, my "Seo" is a surname.

119
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,161
Goodness.

120
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,581
This is exactly how
a man's hand should look like.

121
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:23,336
Pale skin with thin, long fingers?

122
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,797
Only a gigolo would have hands like that.

123
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,468
The old ladies are all over him.

124
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,762
Have you been drinking?

125
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,849
Does this look like alcohol to you?

126
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,566
She's in shock, that's all.
Just like the rest of us.

127
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,737
No one's more shocked
than Pi-young though.

128
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,115
All day, she's been
putting on a cold front.

129
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,995
She must either be cruel or vicious.

130
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,498
You guys should get going.

131
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,917
Thanks for coming
when it's near the holidays.

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,460
Of course we should.

133
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,128
Why are you leaving already?

134
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,798
-You should stay and--
-Goodness.

135
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:13,052
We have a conversation to finish.

136
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:16,097
I know it's hard for her,
but please tell her to get better soon.

137
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,473
Sure. Please get going.

138
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,646
-But--
-Ms. Mo.

139
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,817
-Seriously, Ms. Kim?
-Yes?

140
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,821
Don't you know that hatred for people
can bring you to your demise?

141
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,575
Why send him away
when I was talking to him?

142
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,784
You should go lie down.

143
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:42,623
After death, you have to lie down
even if you don't want to.

144
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,676
What do you think life is?

145
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,177
I don't think I know just yet.

146
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,722
So you still think
you haven't lived long enough.

147
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,183
Life is futile.

148
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,938
I never thought
I'd age as an unmarried woman.

149
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,524
My sister is divorced

150
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,943
and I never married.

151
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,279
What's your take on that?

152
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,197
I think it's obvious why.

153
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,410
You should meet
someone decent and get married.

154
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:22,455
You know what they say,
"When you marry late, it lasts longer."

155
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,337
Is that so? Do people really say that?

156
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,175
I'm hungry.

157
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,262
Mr. Seo, can you buy us lunch?

158
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,222
-Do you like lamb?
-I love it.

159
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,308
-Do you know Eungomjib?
-Of course.

160
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,728
-I'll see you there. Ms. Lee, you too.
-I need to get back to my children.

161
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,856
Mr. Seo, we should grab some lunch.

162
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,817
-I already have plans.
-Where?

163
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,860
Somewhere nearby.

164
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,071
If it's not work-related, let me join you.

165
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,906
-I'll buy.
-Maybe some other time.

166
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,158
Enjoy your Lunar New Year then.

167
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,576
Sure.

168
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,332
Isn't your husband waiting for you?

169
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:09,835
-He is, but I was hungry.
-Didn't you have rice cakes?

170
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,506
Weird, right?
But then again, I only had two.

171
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,558
How do you think it'd be for us
on the next Lunar New Year?

172
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,644
We'll be making dumplings
like we are today.

173
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,522
There's a chance I'd be making them alone.

174
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,608
Why's that? I never book shows in winter.

175
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:35,236
You could be breastfeeding
our beautiful baby.

176
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:40,116
I hear children become healthier
if they're breastfed.

177
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,452
-Were you breastfed?
-Of course.

178
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,667
Hold on a second.
Gosh. It's my dad's birthday today.

179
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,423
U-ram, you're quite good at this.

180
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,106
Dad, did you have seaweed soup today?

181
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,615
You never know.

182
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,994
Besides, Yu-sin is the epitome
of a handsome gentleman.

183
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,328
-I'm sure there--
-I'm busy.

184
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,916
-Don't call me about these things.
-Right. I was just worried.

185
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,960
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,506
Gosh, she ruined my morning.

187
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,899
-It's me.
-Yes, Mother.

188
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,694
-I bet you're not cooking anything.
-I was going to make tteokguk.

189
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,326
Dad!

190
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,996
Dad, don't go.

191
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:14,835
Mom, please forgive him
and let us stay as a family.

192
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,733
SABINA

193
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,238
SABINA, A MI

194
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,949
Shouldn't I at least tell her?

195
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,503
She looks too much like Su-hui
when she was young

196
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,255
to be a coincidence.

197
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,549
But it must be, right?

198
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,468
Su-hui's not Dr. Shin's aunt
from either side of his family.

199
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:08,347
But she said she grew up in the States
and that's where Su-hui's daughter is.

200
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,312
-Hey.
-You should just come upstairs.

201
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,815
We'll be a while.
Yeong-jae wants to buy some clothes.

202
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,692
Got it. Which floor?

203
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,318
Where are you?

204
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,070
I'm on my way to my parents'.

205
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,281
Why?

206
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:29,368
Because I can't be there tomorrow.
Although, it's more like I won't be.

207
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,288
I should at least see them.

208
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,749
How would that make me look?

209
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,544
You should have at least asked me.

210
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,005
But you went to a funeral.

211
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,888
SF ELECTRONICS

212
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,855
All the pieces of the puzzle
are finally in place.

213
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:03,444
He leads a humble life
considering his background.

214
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,029
And Seo Dong-ma…

215
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:08,866
Did he pay for my drinks
because I'm his brother's colleague?

216
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,993
It wasn't out of personal interest.

217
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:14,121
No wonder he wasn't
flirtatious that night.

218
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,373
It's true that
he's a little out of my league.

219
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,834
I'm married, for starters.

220
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,928
REST IN PEACE

221
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,589
Seo-hyang…

222
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,736
Goodbye, Mom.

223
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,904
MO SEO-HYANG

224
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,074
Dad, please welcome Mom with open arms.

225
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:36,870
I caused her a lot of pain and loneliness.

226
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,499
Please welcome her with love.

227
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:06,984
Mom.

228
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,655
Can you ask a fortune-teller
about me and Song Yuan?

229
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,781
A fortune-teller?

230
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,201
No matter how much I think about it,
I think I'm meant to be with her.

231
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,162
Whether she's your true love or partner,

232
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,666
Hye-ryung's willing to move on
and maintain this marriage.

233
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,168
You can't force a divorce.

234
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,170
Why bother?

235
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,047
I'm that desperate.

236
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:32,051
It's hard to even look
at Hye-ryung these days.

237
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,802
I just can't help it.

238
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,220
When she's that pretty?

239
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,223
-Yes.
-At first,

240
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,476
I thought she was an angel too.

241
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,937
But seeing her
beat the crap out of you in front of us

242
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,065
makes me cower
whenever I picture her face.

243
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,234
That look she had when she beat you?

244
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,446
Not you too.

245
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,199
We should honestly admit the truth.

246
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,284
Being honest doesn't
make everything right.

247
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,998
When you see her tomorrow, ask her
what time she was born.

248
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,833
She wouldn't tell me, you see.

249
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,294
She doesn't believe in those things.

250
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,963
-Did you see her?
-No, we talked on the phone.

251
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,341
What if the fortune-teller says
you're meant to be?

252
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,344
-What can you do about it?
-I'm just curious

253
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,096
whether we're compatible.

254
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,849
I never understood how foreigners
could divorce multiple times.

255
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,352
But I find it more humane now.

256
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,771
Living as loveless roommates is torture.

257
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:29,650
People maintain their marriage for
their kids, but we don't have one.

258
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,153
I'm sure we'll get good news
in a couple of months.

259
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,948
Besides, even though
the victim can be at ease.

260
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,075
the offender is ridden with guilt.

261
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,452
If you force Hye-ryung into a divorce,

262
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,789
you won't be able to sleep well at night.

263
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,083
The guilt will be overwhelming.

264
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,377
That's not the case these days.

265
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,421
Take school bullying victims for instance.

266
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,048
The agony is too great

267
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,634
that it affects them
even after graduation.

268
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,221
The offenders are the ones
who live in peace.

269
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,558
Sa-hyeon's not wrong, you know.

270
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,561
It might be a good idea
to ask a fortune-teller.

271
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,897
Your mother had a fortune-teller read
our fortune before we got married.

272
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,774
What was the verdict?

273
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,193
-Don't know. Can't remember.
-Slightly off-beat.

274
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,781
We may not seem compatible,
but we'd have a long, harmonious marriage.

275
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,826
We weren't a great match,

276
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:25,205
-but in bed--
-Enough! You and your big mouth.

277
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,666
Has old age
hindered your ability to think straight?

278
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,919
How is our compatibility
an inappropriate subject?

279
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,715
Well, Dad's right. Song Yuan…

280
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,598
Come on out. She wants to bow.

281
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:05,287
I'm grateful to be able
to bow to you on Lunar New Year.

282
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:09,124
Always stay healthy

283
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,127
and I hope for nothing
but happiness in the new year.

284
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,171
A healthy baby

285
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,049
would be the biggest joy we could have.

286
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:23,222
Bringing a new life
into the world isn't easy.

287
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:27,893
Come to us for advice
whenever you face any problems

288
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,520
and focus solely on the baby.

289
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,857
I feel reassured to have you both.

290
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,068
We're grateful you think that way.

291
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,865
Here. When's the last time
you received an allowance?

292
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,284
Gosh. But I'm not a child anymore.

293
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,787
-You are to us.
-Take it.

294
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,666
Thank you.

295
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,004
I'll make sure to spend it on the baby.

296
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,674
As if we wouldn't buy
baby products for you.

297
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,093
-Maybe today.
-No shops are open today.

298
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,094
Is that so?

299
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,179
Still…

300
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,900
-Do you have indigestion?
-I think it's enteritis.

301
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,944
My goodness.

302
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:23,115
I'll be at the hospital for
a few days and get some IV fluids.

303
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:26,910
You should get going then.
I'll get you what you need later on.

304
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,537
Have the driver bring it.

305
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:32,916
I'm sorry. But I'll only cause trouble
if I stay by your side.

306
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,211
She has me and Ji-a, so don't worry.

307
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,088
Go on.

308
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,008
-I should say goodbye to her aunt--
-I'll tell her.

309
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,635
Look at you covered in cold sweat.

310
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:45,929
I'll text you.

311
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,765
At least nod, will you?

312
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,852
Ji-a. Take care of your mom for me.

313
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,441
Bring the car around.

314
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,777
Goodness. Enteritis is brought on
by stress, you know.

315
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,530
Funerals aren't easy to host in winter.

316
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,032
Of course you're stressed out.

317
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,455
Text me.
Even if it's in the middle of the night.

318
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,000
Right.

319
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,549
Of course he's stressed out.

320
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,011
Both his wife and mistress
were admitted to the same hospital.

321
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:32,517
-I want to sleep with you tonight.
-How about a bathroom break, Ji-a?

322
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,186
I'll go when I'm home.

323
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,647
It's clean here. Besides, holding
your urine could cause health issues.

324
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,984
Come on. I'll go with you.

325
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,667
I'm staying at the hospital tonight
to treat my enteritis.

326
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,419
Goodness.

327
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,465
Don't make me worry
and stay at the hospital.

328
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,218
It's better than your empty house
since it serves meals.

329
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:09,554
All right. I'll stay put
even though I'm dying to see you.

330
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:27,447
Now, the most beautiful member
of the Mo Family

331
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,575
is me, Mo Seo-ri.

332
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,751
Seo-hyang, I hope you mature in hell.

333
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,007
It's not like…

334
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,261
I have many years to live.

335
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,720
I understand how you feel,

336
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,598
but I'm sure Ji-a misses me
every now and again.

337
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,891
It's not like you bonded.

338
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,824
Mom…

339
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:18,832
Mom…

340
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,589
Mom?

341
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:31,928
Mom?

342
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,431
Mom.

343
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,520
Mom…

344
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,673
What now?

345
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,053
How am I supposed to go on?

346
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,266
The heartache is too much to bear.

347
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,560
Mom.

348
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,523
Your heart must have ached
even more than mine is.

349
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,891
We should come by more often.

350
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,773
-You like it here more than our place?
-It's been a while since we shared

351
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,400
the same bed.

352
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,777
With our skins touching.

353
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:15,115
Whatever. You make it sound
as if we're naked or something.

354
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:18,660
You know what I mean.
I can sense your breathing.

355
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,704
I've been tossing and turning.

356
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,497
Due to the excitement?

357
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,041
From time to time…

358
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,337
doesn't it feel like
we're newlyweds again?

359
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,674
I do, but you speaking formally
shatters the mood.

360
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,551
I love and respect you so much

361
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,429
that I can't bring myself
to verbally mistreat you.

362
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,555
Respect, my ass.

363
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,142
You're going overboard with your flattery.

364
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:46,146
They aren't empty words.
I truly mean them.

365
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,942
Aren't married couples
like soy sauce that deepens in taste

366
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,029
as time goes by?

367
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,448
Chairman Pan, you surely have matured.

368
00:26:56,531 --> 00:27:00,327
-Omit the title.
-Pan Mun-ho, you've matured too late.

369
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,996
If only it didn't take you this long.

370
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,414
Omit the last name.

371
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,375
-Ye-jeong.
-Yes, Mun-ho?

372
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,671
Gosh, my tongue
already stings from saying that.

373
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:15,925
From this moment on, let's agree
to call each other by our names.

374
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,803
That's what names are for anyway.

375
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,181
When we're alone, at least.

376
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:25,977
Just stay put for a while longer.

377
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,105
If you start making noise out there,
you'll wake Song Yuan up.

378
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:34,277
Oh, right. There's nothing to do anyway.
Everything just needs to be heated.

379
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,159
Goodness.

380
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:50,460
Why has your head gotten lighter?

381
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,254
Maybe I lost a lot of
what was in my brain.

382
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,382
You can forget everything else

383
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,302
as long as you remember
your feelings for me.

384
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,263
-What feelings?
-Your feelings of love.

385
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,814
Is she having trouble getting up?

386
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:11,898
Ji-a?

387
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,194
Ji-a.

388
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,905
Time for breakfast. It's already 9 a.m.

389
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:32,127
Did your mom go somewhere?
Maybe she went to your dad.

390
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,054
I'm going out for some air.

391
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,390
Have breakfast with your grandma
when you wake up.

392
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,767
She must have gone to your dad.

393
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,693
Goodness.

394
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,167
Which room is Ms. A Mi in?

395
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,210
-Ms. A Mi?
-Yes.

396
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,131
VIP room two, ma'am.

397
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,926
Ms. A Mi was moved
to Sin Seocho Jeil Hospital.

398
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,362
PATIENT: A **

399
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,190
My boyfriend gave it to me
so I could wear it on set.

400
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,298
But that's the only one
with the burn on the inside.

401
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,217
-Really?
-Yes.

402
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,803
I asked where she got it
and she said it was from her boyfriend.

403
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:47,887
That boyfriend must be me then.

404
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,221
How's Pi-young?
She's not answering my texts.

405
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,723
She went out for some air.

406
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,308
Time will ease the pain for her.

407
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,563
She probably went to her mom's.

408
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,026
I made you some porridge with only rice.

409
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,989
My Lord.

410
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,284
I've lived my life faithfully
in my own way.

411
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,746
I know I lack in some ways,
but please take pity on me

412
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,623
and…

413
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,709
gift me with love from a younger man.

414
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:03,379
I lived the most of my life
as a second wife to an older man.

415
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,258
I may have been smiling on the outside,

416
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,846
but you're aware of how
I lived in sorrow and anguish.

417
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,643
For at least once in my life,

418
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:20,063
I wish to have my body touched
by an attractive younger man.

419
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,316
If not, I wouldn't be able
to rest in peace.

420
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,068
So please…

421
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,155
let this desperate wish of mine…

422
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,075
come…

423
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,370
true.

424
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,686
Only one of my friends got divorced.

425
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,437
She wanted to keep their son away
from her husband,

426
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,940
but I told her not to sever that kinship.

427
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,817
Mothers can never replace fathers.

428
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,486
There's a special relationship
between a child and their mother.

429
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,530
It's different from the bond
shared with a father.

430
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,624
Ji-a, what should I do?

431
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,460
I don't know how to handle this.

432
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,630
I should put you
as my top priority, right?

433
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,173
That's what's right, isn't it?

434
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,593
My priority should be
your future and happiness.

435
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,054
I've had my share of happiness anyway.

436
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:39,559
It may have all been a lie, but still…

437
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,981
Dongmi, have you been well?

438
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,527
-It's like a spring day today.
-Tell me about it.

439
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,948
Goodness me, Dongmi. Did you miss me?

440
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,575
My sweet puppy.

441
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,252
You should get some sleep.

442
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,255
The living must go on.

443
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:12,175
Missing her won't bring her back.

444
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,344
Besides, we humans learn to adapt.

445
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,680
I was a wreck after Dr. Shin died,

446
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,974
but I stayed strong despite the pain.

447
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,642
You'll manage too.

448
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,490
Why couldn't you have
just lost it for good?

449
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,991
There are many hospital rooms,

450
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,953
and I would have let you stay
in the VIP ward until you died.

451
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,456
They say you manage to
move on from a parent's death,

452
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,666
but not when you lose your child.

453
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,960
In Pi-young's case though,

454
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:51,130
the death of her mother was not
as manageable as her father-in-law's.

455
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,258
She's not the only one
who has lost both parents.

456
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,636
We tend to lose pity
for those who make a big fuss.

457
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,972
Her husband was hospitalized
after hosting the funeral.

458
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,432
It's like I said.

459
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,811
-They weren't on good terms--
-Don't make excuses for her.

460
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,730
I get it,
but taking it too far only backfires.

461
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,149
Not even parents who lose
their children become mute.

462
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,611
She's so fussy.

463
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,785
Why? Did I upset you?

464
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,914
I can stop eating porridge now,
so don't bother making them.

465
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,797
APPLICATION FOR DIVORCE AND CUSTODY

466
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:43,015
It's from a bakery and
they didn't use a lot of sugar.

467
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,393
Thank you.

468
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,065
-Is your mother still not talking?
-No.

469
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,943
Don't worry too much though.
Time will heal her.

470
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,113
Do you know what I've been thinking?

471
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,992
First, my grandpa, and now my grandma.

472
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,453
People all die someday, right?

473
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,663
Right.

474
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:09,292
What if I talk just fine
after my mom passes away

475
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,461
like my grandma did?

476
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,505
It'll mean I'm less sad.

477
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,508
Less sad than my mom is
over grandma's death.

478
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,968
That's not true.

479
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,847
How we react is different
depending on the situation.

480
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:26,225
In your mother's case,
your grandmother lived abroad.

481
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,604
She didn't have the means
to take better care of her,

482
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,440
which is why her pain is greater.

483
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,775
Being a good daughter to your mother

484
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,652
will lessen the pain for you.

485
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,154
You'll still be sad,

486
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,823
but you won't have too many regrets.

487
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,910
We should be better children. Right, Mom?

488
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,997
Hang out here and stay for dinner.

489
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,749
I'll text your mom and let her know.

490
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,312
Aren't you happy to see me?

491
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,608
I'm still sick, yet I came because
I missed you and was worried.

492
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,444
I hear Ji-a went to U-ram's.

493
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,448
We should go somewhere next week.
I mean it.

494
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,494
For the past year,
your work kept you in the city.

495
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,664
We'll go to a spring in Japan or to Europe

496
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,123
and get some rest.

497
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,502
Why not let
your fill-in take over permanently?

498
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,339
Really?

499
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,927
I'm going to send Ji-a
to study abroad in L.A. or London.

500
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,887
Wait. Can you speak now?

501
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,392
Since when?
I bet seeing me snapped you out of it.

502
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,270
I'm so relieved.
No wonder I wanted to come home.

503
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,273
We really are the perfect couple.
Always on the same page.

504
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,695
Does Ji-a want to go?

505
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:05,116
-It's what I want.
-No way. She's too young--

506
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,618
I'll quit my job and take her myself.

507
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,787
You can quit your job
but you can't take Ji-a abroad.

508
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,707
-Families should stay together.
-Think about her future.

509
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,418
You know how she enjoys speaking English.

510
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,919
I want to encourage her talent.

511
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:20,047
There are interpreters
who studied their whole lives in Korea.

512
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:25,720
It might not be a bad idea
to stay apart for periods of time.

513
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,013
So you can cheat all you want.

514
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:30,516
I don't want that at all.
It's never crossed my mind.

515
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,685
And that's the end of that.

516
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,024
-How could I live without you two?
-You have Mother.

517
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,650
And a young mistress.

518
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:43,237
I need my wife and daughter
within my sight at all times.

519
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,157
Life isn't all about academics.

520
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,367
-What's more important?
-The love of a family.

521
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,578
It can't be bought in any way.

522
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:54,498
Someone who cares for his family that much
has a young mistress on the side?

523
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,625
How long has it been
since I heard your voice?

524
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,013
What's the matter with you?

525
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:10,848
Am I an insect?

526
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,059
How can you shove me like that?

527
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,146
It's the little things
that crack a marriage.

528
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,858
Please.

529
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,611
I want to spend time abroad with Ji-a.

530
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,697
Are you saying that your daughter
takes priority over your husband?

531
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,199
Or do you just want to live abroad?

532
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:31,369
To me, you're always the top priority.
Nothing else comes first.

533
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,747
"Out of sight, out of mind," remember?

534
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,166
Must I live apart from my family?

535
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,710
It's not like Ji-a
is having a hard time at school.

536
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,754
Why does one work and earn money?

537
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,506
To live happily with one's family.

538
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,927
How can we be happy
when we're thousands of miles apart?

539
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,762
It won't mean a thing.

540
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,308
Why are you glaring at me? Am I wrong?

541
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:01,565
Is it my fault
that your mother passed away?

542
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,069
You've been acting strange
since she collapsed.

543
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,155
Being heartbroken doesn't explain it.

544
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,910
Why are you angry at me
when it was you who mistreated her?

545
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,788
Are you testing my patience?

546
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:19,333
I got enteritis while
taking care of her funeral.

547
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:00,958
Drive me somewhere.

548
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:03,752
Darling.

549
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,755
I get that you're tired and in pain,

550
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:11,093
but your mother's death
and our marriage are two separate things.

551
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,053
Must our relationship suffer?

552
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,431
I did nothing wrong.

553
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:18,559
I came home because
I missed you and was worried.

554
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,395
So what's with the cold shoulder?

555
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,552
U-ram's place?

556
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,321
You couldn't live abroad
without me anyway.

557
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,240
Ji-a too for that matter.

558
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,254
Gosh. Look at how gaunt I am.

559
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,089
So stop being so--

560
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,298
Enter A Mi's address.

561
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:43,477
I checked and she was already
discharged from Sin Seocho Jeil Hospital.

562
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,983
Do it.

563
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,860
She's just a patient.
There's nothing going on.

564
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:55,072
If that's the case, start driving.

565
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,578
Ask me what you want to know
and I'll explain.

566
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:03,080
I will, when I have both of you there.

567
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:18,971
Get out.

568
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,640
There's no need for this.

569
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,144
You won't take me there, is that it?

570
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,353
Darling.

571
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,941
Either go to her place or the court.

572
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,276
We'll file for divorce.

573
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,447
APPLICATION FOR DIVORCE AND CUSTODY

574
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,454
What will it be?

575
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,999
Will it be the court?

576
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,548
Come upstairs and hear me out.

577
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,383
Say your piece in front of her.

578
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,971
-Now!
-What are you planning on doing?

579
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,307
If not, our marriage ends today.

580
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,808
It's as simple as that.

581
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,069
So?

582
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,280
Is that why you want to take Ji-a abroad?

583
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:22,826
-Fine. Do that--
-It's too late.

584
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,581
Had you agreed to it earlier,
I wouldn't have brought it up.

585
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,833
I was going to sweep it under the rug.

586
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,336
But now, I can't take back what I said.

587
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,256
It was a mistake.

588
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,260
Can I make a mistake too then?

589
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:44,139
Are we going to stay here all night?
You know I won't back down.

590
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,601
If you don't want to,
we can head to court.

591
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,356
This is wrong. We're a married couple.

592
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:53,941
Something this minor…

593
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,360
"This minor"?

594
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,571
"Something this minor"?

595
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,282
Let's give it a few days.

596
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,455
I've done enough thinking.

597
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,837
Either go to court, her house,
or stay up here all night.

598
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,088
There's no other option.

599
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,465
MS. KIM

600
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,722
Must you do this?

601
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,224
You might regret this.

602
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,935
We only went on a few dates.

603
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,564
Then prove that in her presence.

604
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:25,157
I'll do everything you want
except going to court.

605
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,036
Please forgive me just this once.

606
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,748
I won't make
even the smallest mistake from now on.

607
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:36,001
I'll make the arrangements
for you and Ji-a to fly out next month,

608
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,419
so let's give this some time.

609
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,713
Don't make this decision
when you're emotional.

610
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,799
Do I seem emotional to you?

611
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,134
How would it make us look?

612
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:48,430
Man and wife charging through her door
is highly inappropriate.

613
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:50,474
"Inappropriate"?

614
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,811
I won't get out
unless we're at her place or the court.

615
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,772
How many times must I repeat myself?

616
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:59,691
-This isn't like you--
-This isn't like you either!

617
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:02,110
Why can't you take me there? For my sake?

618
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:03,612
Or for hers?

619
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,420
The phone you have called
is currently turned off…

620
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,854
They should've told me
if they're going to eat out.

621
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,213
Let's at least call her first.

622
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,969
What name is her number under?

623
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:17,644
Manager Kim.

624
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,864
MANAGER KIM

625
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:40,709
I'M AT THE COMPLEX AND WILL BE HEADING UP

626
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,552
I'm at the complex and will be heading up.

627
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:57,476
Sure thing.

628
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:01,980
Do you erase the texts as you get them?
There are no records.

629
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:09,988
How meticulous of you.

630
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:16,995
Don't be too harsh.

631
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,017
Come in!

632
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,752
Yu-sin, I hope milk tea is all right.

633
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:19,766
I'm Yu-sin's wife.

634
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:26,940
Give me a second.

635
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,726
Turn that off.

636
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,839
Do you drink black tea?

637
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,008
I'm good. Please have a seat.

638
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,942
A Mi, right?

639
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:56,696
-Yes.
-Who are you to my husband?

640
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:05,330
Who is she to you? You tell me.

641
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:12,462
I'm ready for it.
I don't care how long it takes.

642
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,803
We're in love.

643
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,727
What about you?

644
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,190
You're not denying it,

645
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,110
so it must be true.

646
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,197
The feeling is mutual.

647
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,954
-How old are you?
-I turned 29 in Korean age

648
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,122
this Lunar New Year.

649
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:50,000
So there's a 16-year age gap.

650
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,713
You must have had a blast.

651
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,550
How did you two meet?

652
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,969
-When?
-On the plane

653
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:02,679
a year ago.

654
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:08,101
The inbound plane from L.A.?

655
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:12,063
-Yes.
-That's when he gave you the jacket.

656
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,773
Yes.

657
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:20,071
Don't you remember me?

658
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:22,616
You were filming
outside the broadcasting station

659
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,993
-with Joo Bin.
-Right.

660
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:27,913
I asked where you got the puffer jacket

661
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,457
and you said it was from your boyfriend.

662
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,046
It isn't easy to cross paths like that.

663
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:38,590
That boyfriend…

664
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,802
turned out to be my husband.

665
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,643
You probably knew he was married.

666
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:53,271
-Yes.
-But you still fell for him?

667
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,690
When he's a middle-aged man?

668
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,861
-What do you call him?
-Yu-sin.

669
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:10,705
Since you're in love,
he must've given you gifts.

670
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,126
What did he give you,
if you don't mind telling me?

671
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,294
A purse,

672
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:19,464
perfume, a car, flowers--

673
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,091
-What kind of car?
-A Benzi.

674
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:37,565
You know already, but he's a sweet man.

675
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:40,443
Enjoy your life with him.

676
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,407
Grateful, aren't you?

677
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,956
I'll make the divorce official
as soon as possible.

678
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:58,670
Don't bother seeing me out.

679
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:01,923
Get talking.
You have your life to plan out now.

680
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,046
Bastard.

681
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,225
Where to, ma'am?

682
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,144
Where to?

683
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,856
Can you give me a second?

684
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,573
Do you know where Lassen Townhouse is?

685
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,355
PI-YOUNG

686
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,898
Is she able to talk again?

687
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:28,820
-Hello?
-Auntie, it's me.

688
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:31,990
My goodness. You can finally talk again!

689
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:35,743
I'll text you the address,
so can you pick up Ji-a in the evening

690
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,787
and let her stay overnight?

691
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,539
Yes, of course.

692
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,173
MS. KIM

693
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,342
-Did you head out for dinner?
-I'm on my way home.

694
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,928
Goodness. Can you talk now?

695
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,264
-Yes.
-Your voice sounds off though.

696
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,894
I guess that's understandable
since you couldn't talk for a week.

697
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,073
-Where's Yu-sin?
-He's right behind me.

698
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,453
Did you two argue?

699
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,413
Please have a seat.

700
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,252
What's this about?

701
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:15,218
Why not just take it to
the extreme while you're at it?

702
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,595
Regarding what?

703
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:21,057
You know, I've been worried
about your state lately.

704
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,109
-What's this about?
-We're divorcing.

705
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:33,653
A divorce? Really?

706
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:37,365
-What are you talking about?
-That won't happen.

707
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,242
Regarding what?

708
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,410
What did you do wrong?

709
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,788
He has a 29-year-old mistress.

710
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,128
A mistress?

711
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:54,132
Wait. Please tell me I heard wrong.

712
00:59:56,968 --> 01:00:00,138
I'm sure it's a misunderstanding.
Yu-sin would never…

713
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,103
Is it true?

714
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:10,273
-Really?
-I saw her with my own eyes.

715
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,568
They're in love.

716
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,362
And he didn't deny it.

717
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,035
We'll file the papers tomorrow

718
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,621
and I'll raise Ji-a.

719
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:27,081
You're not worthy of her.

720
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,210
How…

721
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:35,423
Please tell me it's not true.

722
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:38,593
We happened to meet on the plane and…

723
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:18,466
Who is she? Who's this bitch?

724
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,056
Is she pretty?

725
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,519
She seems to be an actress.

726
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:31,813
She's not famous yet.

727
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:32,814
Is that why…

728
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:37,735
you chose not to talk?
Because you were shocked?

729
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:40,780
It wasn't because of your mother's death?

730
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:44,784
How did you find out?

731
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:46,536
Did she call you first?

732
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:51,999
Where does she live?

733
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,377
In Gangnam?

734
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,754
Pavilio Apartment.

735
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,300
He even bought her an imported car.

736
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,011
Which apartment unit?

737
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:07,932
Which apartment unit?

738
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:10,518
I need to see her to believe it.

739
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:12,770
How could Yu-sin of all people do this?

740
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:26,117
That son of a bitch.

741
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,786
Who could it be that seduced him?

742
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:42,842
It's me.

743
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:47,805
I need the address
of a patient by the name of A Mi.

744
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,640
Why not?

745
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:53,144
I'll take full responsibility,
so don't worry.

746
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:56,481
Dr. Shin did what?

747
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:03,946
If you love me, come with me to my place.

748
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,201
I can't get a divorce.

749
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:13,831
I promise to settle things
and come to you in a few years,

750
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,667
-so help me get past this for now.
-Why should I?

751
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:21,297
My daughter is only 13.
Puberty is about to start.

752
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:25,343
Her love and respect for her dad
can't be crushed this way.

753
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:27,136
I won't be able to take it.

754
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:32,683
Unless you want me to be unhappy…
You want us to be happy, right?

755
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:35,144
That's what I want too.

756
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,146
So just do as I say this one time.

757
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,816
Think of it as a hardship
you have to go through once.

758
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:45,571
There's the splitting of assets,
so I have to make preparations.

759
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:47,990
Ji-a needs time to accept it too.

760
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,952
I'll settle things in two to three years.
Five tops.

761
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:53,913
-But I'm scared.
-You have me, so don't worry.

762
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,499
What should I say?

763
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:58,835
-Is she really talking again?
-Yes.

764
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:04,382
Take care, Ms. Lee. Bye, U-ram.

765
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:07,009
-Bye.
-Come by often.

766
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,511
-Sure.
-I'll see you around.

767
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:22,441
I'm sorry.

768
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:27,363
I'm partially responsible too.

769
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,756
Why would you divorce him?
It would only benefit that bitch.

770
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,969
Would you choose to stay married?

771
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:53,556
I'd hang on if it were me.
That's how you win.

772
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:55,099
The trust between us is gone.

773
01:04:56,851 --> 01:05:00,062
And when trust is shattered,
there is no love.

774
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:07,862
Come in.

775
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:36,849
Sit.

776
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:39,852
I'm glad you're here.

777
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:48,027
How dare you show your face!

778
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:49,779
Please don't.

779
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:53,449
She crawled in here for a beating
because she knows what she did is wrong!

780
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,661
-You!
-Please just calm down!

781
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:59,038
How dare you go after a married man?

782
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,706
How dare you!

783
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:02,708
Whose side are you on?

784
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:20,476
Is this how I raised you?

785
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,645
Didn't you learn anything
from your father?

786
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:25,523
How could you do this
when we raised you well?

787
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:27,024
It's a misunderstanding.

788
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,151
A misunderstanding?

789
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:33,489
Please hear us out and you'll understand.

790
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:37,702
Understand?
What if Ji-a knew about this mess?

791
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:39,996
Are you here to steal the master bedroom?

792
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:42,665
-How dare you?
-Don't get worked up

793
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:44,125
and hear us out first.

794
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:46,836
You're not even
a tenth the woman Pi-young is.

795
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:48,713
You dare glare at me? Am I wrong?

796
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:53,384
You can be mad at us
after you hear us out.

797
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:02,977
I'm sorry for causing this mess.

798
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:07,023
I grew up in the States, you see.

799
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:11,819
Since I didn't know anyone in Korea,
I needed his help.

800
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:15,114
What I said earlier isn't true.

801
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:16,657
You barged into my house,

802
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,744
which startled and appalled me.

803
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:22,747
I said whatever came to mind

804
01:07:23,497 --> 01:07:24,582
because I was upset.

805
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:27,001
Our relationship isn't what you think.

806
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:29,670
He treated me like a little sister.

807
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:32,298
You know it's hard
to trust people these days.

808
01:07:33,674 --> 01:07:35,509
I relied on him like a brother.

809
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:37,636
That's all.

810
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:43,225
Look at me. Say it to my face.

811
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:46,854
Are your parents in the US?

812
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:49,190
-Yes.
-What kind of education did you receive?

813
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:52,109
What values did your parents teach you?

814
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:58,574
Was he someone
you went to for advice from time to time?

815
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:01,452
That's right.

816
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:10,127
Can you swear on your parents?

817
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:13,881
Yes.

818
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:20,513
Then let me see your phone.
What name did you save his number under?

819
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:27,645
Show me this instant.
There's no reason you can't.

820
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:31,357
You said you're just friends.

821
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,736
How could you ask to see her phone?
That's not right.

822
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:17,486
If I were you, I would do it.

823
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,113
Aren't you being falsely blamed?

824
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:22,533
Are you trying to wreck our home
like you did yours?

825
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:34,670
Dr. Cho.

826
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:35,588
Ji-a.

827
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:40,342
How about you and I move into
Grandma's apartment for a while?

828
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:41,427
Just us two?

829
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:44,180
Let's try to make things work.

830
01:09:44,763 --> 01:09:46,765
I ended up staying single.

831
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:47,850
If it's okay with you…

832
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:48,976
I'm done now.

833
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:50,477
Come have breakfast.

834
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:52,396
-I'm at the buffet.
-The buffet here?

835
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,607
She wins if you divorce him.

836
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:04,783
