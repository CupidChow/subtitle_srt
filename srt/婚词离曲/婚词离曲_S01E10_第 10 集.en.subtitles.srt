1
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,266
Wasn't it hilarious?

2
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,102
-Did you see how she made a mistake?
-Yes.

3
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,483
-Where should we go next?
-Next?

4
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,527
-It was so funny.
-Wasn't it nice here?

5
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,676
Excuse me.

6
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,058
Never mind.

7
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,823
Who is he? Your ex-boyfriend?

8
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,324
No.

9
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,326
-She wasn't familiar.
-He's here.

10
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,537
We'll get going first.

11
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,622
-We'll be in touch, Ban.
-Sure thing.

12
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,086
-Hello, there.
-Hi.

13
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,713
-I parked over there.
-Yes, sir.

14
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,308
Stop the car!

15
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,560
Honey, wait!

16
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,396
Mr. Seo!

17
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,693
I can't stand being curious, you know.
It keeps me up at night.

18
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,862
Please tell me why.

19
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,281
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,241
I'm not sorry at all.

21
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:39,742
Come on.

22
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:41,619
Honey, please.

23
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,748
She can't seem to hold her liquor today.

24
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,880
My friends would've asked me
to introduce them to you if I'd said hi.

25
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,882
You wouldn't have liked it.

26
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,717
They might have asked you to join us.

27
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,803
They're the type to do that, that's why.

28
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,430
Tell me, Mr. Seo.

29
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,725
What type of man are you, then?

30
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,732
Now I get it.

31
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,985
You're a man with a kind heart.

32
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,280
You were being considerate.

33
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,451
But who'd care
if they asked you to introduce me to them?

34
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,580
Saying hello wouldn't
wear out my pretty face.

35
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:31,044
You're right. It might be a bit annoying.

36
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,715
Autographs and photo requests…

37
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,842
We're blocking the road.

38
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,929
Mr. Seo, I'll get going, then.

39
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,096
Sure.

40
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,308
What a gentleman.
You were being thoughtful,

41
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,018
weren't you?

42
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,854
I'm sorry. Let's go.

43
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,234
Come on, honey.

44
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,152
No!

45
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,029
-What…
-Honey, get in.

46
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:01,908
Hold on.

47
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,251
You'll catch a cold. Aren't you cold?

48
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,460
I'm not.

49
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,800
You smell incredible.

50
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,389
-How much did you miss me?
-Not to the moon and back.

51
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,807
What?

52
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:28,726
But to the galaxy.

53
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,233
Did you sleep well?

54
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,653
How could I when my husband was away?

55
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,074
So? Did you have to fight your urges?

56
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,076
I'm holding a knife.

57
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,495
As if that would ever scare me.

58
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,749
-Let's head inside.
-Don't be ridiculous.

59
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,960
Have some fruit for the vitamins first.

60
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,296
But we have it every day.
Should I hold you?

61
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,306
I'd rather meet your eyes
and talk with you.

62
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,473
Just you and me.

63
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:12,353
What if you have to choose
between my looks, voice, and body?

64
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,440
-Your heart.
-My soul that loves you?

65
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,236
As long as you know that, I'm good.

66
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,617
Did your friend sit next to you?

67
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,329
No, we met in the lounge.

68
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,789
-On the plane?
-Yes.

69
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,043
Who sat next to you then?

70
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,712
Thankfully, no one.

71
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,213
When will he return home?

72
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,466
In about a month's time.

73
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,761
-We should invite him over.
-I don't want to bother you.

74
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,638
I'll just treat him to a meal
before he goes back.

75
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,685
It must be that friend.

76
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,904
It's a spam message.

77
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:07,867
I'm done unpacking now.
Thank you so much for today.

78
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,955
-Who is it?
-How should I know? Wrong number.

79
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,040
Mom.

80
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,500
Yes?

81
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,794
I feel something on my neck.

82
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,396
MANAGER KIM

83
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,482
MANAGER KIM

84
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,742
Sleep tight.

85
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,078
Call me if you need anything.

86
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:05,341
What are you up to?

87
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,137
U-ram leaves tomorrow at 7 a.m.

88
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,389
I'm going to pack him some sandwiches.

89
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,810
-With potato salad?
-Yes.

90
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,854
But they will stop at a rest area.

91
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,022
He doesn't like the food sold there.

92
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,942
-One meal won't hurt.
-It's a mom's love.

93
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,612
It's for Gi-ppeum's family too
to thank them for taking U-ram.

94
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,573
We took Gi-ppeum before too, you know.

95
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,742
Let me do it. Your wrists are bad enough.

96
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,004
The excitement will keep me up tonight.

97
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,715
Then have a glass of wine.

98
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,800
One glass won't cut it once I get started.

99
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:50,887
I love the car,

100
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,389
but I know it wasn't easy for you
to save up the money.

101
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,808
Cars are expensive.

102
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,477
It wasn't that hard.

103
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,187
Either you spend it or save it.

104
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:04,400
I was planning to buy you one last year,
but it took me another year.

105
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,986
I'll do better.

106
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,073
Come on over here.

107
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,039
Aren't you tired?

108
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:03,000
I am. That's exactly why I need you here,

109
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,168
my energy booster.

110
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,216
RIVER PARK FITNESS

111
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,817
Ninth floor.

112
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,698
I'm also headed to River Park Fitness.

113
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,408
I see.

114
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,913
Does trainer Kang Jun teach well?

115
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,083
I happened to see you
working out yesterday.

116
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,878
He's not my trainer though.

117
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,925
My trainer took a day off yesterday.

118
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,676
I see.

119
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,141
Did you join the gym?

120
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:25,518
Yes.

121
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,229
But you're already fit.
You want to get fitter?

122
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,482
Look who's talking.

123
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,577
Every joint in my fingers aches.

124
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,707
Honey.

125
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,836
-My hands.
-What about them?

126
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,297
-Massage them.
-Why would I? They're not my hands.

127
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,926
But my finger joints are aching.
Both hands.

128
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,524
That hurts!

129
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,569
Don't wear these too often.

130
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,237
You're blaming my rings?

131
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,073
I saw you one day
wearing three on each hand.

132
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,450
Are you out of your mind?

133
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,954
It's from all the cooking
I've done for the family!

134
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,874
As if you ever did a lot.

135
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,377
The housekeepers washed, prepped,

136
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,046
and cut all the ingredients.
Then they also cooked.

137
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,631
And how long have we had them?

138
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,008
About 20 years.

139
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,634
Make that 21.

140
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,304
You forget my birthday,
but that you remember.

141
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,515
Of course, I do. I have to pay for them.

142
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,727
That's one more reason to hate you.

143
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,354
Go and see Dr. Cho when you're in Seoul.

144
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,442
Get the infrared light treatment
and do your favorite paraffin hand dip.

145
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:01,530
The man brings home the money
while the woman spends it.

146
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,116
Why not say "wench" while you're at it?

147
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:07,161
Why are you being so sarcastic?

148
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:10,581
You're nagging me about spending money.
Are you worried about it?

149
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,333
No, but it upsets me.

150
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,669
I've taken care of a family of six
since marrying you.

151
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,880
Eight after we had our kids.

152
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,508
Are you saying

153
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,219
that my mother had you cook all her meals?

154
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,472
She's the one who spent years

155
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,475
teaching the clueless girl from Seoul.

156
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,852
My mother did all that.

157
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,980
You're spoiled.

158
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,525
Just dig me a grave, why don't you?

159
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,491
I hate you, you know.

160
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,043
I only have myself to blame.

161
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:02,007
When will he ever eat humble pie
and realize how precious his wife is?

162
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,055
Dongmi, what's wrong?

163
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,434
What should I do?

164
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,108
-Is Dongmi hurt?
-Her leg is swollen.

165
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,320
-Should I serve breakfast?
-Just a second.

166
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:24,989
Bring the car around.

167
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,616
-Are you going to the vet?
-Yes.

168
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,036
-Without eating breakfast?
-Is that important right now?

169
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,873
Dongmi's leg is swollen!

170
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,459
You care about a dog's legs
more than my fingers?

171
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,712
Where are my pants?

172
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,134
You're taking her there yourself?

173
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,553
If you're not going to volunteer, shut it.

174
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,054
Stop nagging me.

175
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,098
You think I'm nagging you?

176
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,394
I devoted my youth to this family,
but you don't care about me.

177
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,231
-You said your fingers are numb.
-They also hurt.

178
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,774
But they're not swollen.

179
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,364
Dongmi's leg.

180
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,787
I guess you care about the dog more,
being a dog yourself.

181
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,709
Dongmi, How much does it hurt?
If only you could talk…

182
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,044
Pan Mun-ho.

183
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,379
Just wait until you fall sick.

184
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,176
CHAIRMAN

185
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,262
Yes?

186
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,723
I'm going to Dr. Cho. Come along.

187
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,141
No thanks!

188
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,818
CHAIRMAN

189
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,573
How dare you yell at your husband?

190
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,950
You nearly blew my ears off!

191
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,993
It's my mouth. I can do whatever I want.

192
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,828
I expect this attitude to be gone
when I return.

193
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,664
As if.

194
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,958
You're the one
who should change his attitude!

195
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,626
Seriously?

196
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:05,089
Seriously!

197
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,217
Old age has made her childish.

198
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:09,802
Come here.

199
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,809
Dongmi.

200
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,729
Okay, that's it. Hang in there.

201
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,150
Okay, exhale. Good.

202
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,777
Inhale.

203
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,407
Exhale as you stand up. Exhale.

204
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,868
Inhale and spread your knees out more.
Straighten your torso.

205
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,704
Exhale.

206
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,872
Look forward, please.

207
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,916
Right.

208
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,132
That good-for-nothing.

209
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,135
How can he care more about the dog?

210
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,723
Dr. Cho, it's me. Are you up?

211
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,225
My Dongmi…

212
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,439
No, the family dog.

213
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,235
I noticed that you treat dogs too.

214
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,738
I found her leg all swollen
in the morning.

215
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,073
So I'm about to head for your clinic.

216
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,700
Tell me about it.

217
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,745
I feel terrible for the poor thing.

218
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,882
What is this delicious smell?

219
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,884
Spicy braised chicken.

220
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,762
-Because Yu-sin will be here?
-Yes.

221
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,638
There's no one quite like you.

222
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,183
Not even a birth mother
would be this devoted.

223
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,690
That was a tough session. Was it doable?

224
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,108
Of course.

225
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,195
-If your muscles ache, take a day off.
-No, I'm good.

226
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,115
Our lounge is over there.
You can have some water.

227
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,451
-Snacks too.
-Okay.

228
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,620
-Thank you for today.
-Good job.

229
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,494
Can I eat this?

230
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,454
Sure.

231
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,881
If you eat that,
it will cancel out the workout.

232
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,717
It's just for today.

233
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,599
It's my first day.

234
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,108
-Did you pack that yourself?
-Yes.

235
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,402
-At this early hour?
-It's simple.

236
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,574
Working out makes you hungry, doesn't it?

237
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,034
There are diners downstairs.

238
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,329
Sorry for interrupting your meal.

239
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,166
-It's all right.
-Then…

240
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,469
-Welcome.
-Hello.

241
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,435
MENU

242
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,188
-Soft tofu stew, please.
-Got it.

243
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,032
Yes?

244
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,659
-Did you go to the gym?
-Yes.

245
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,411
-How was the trainer?
-Good.

246
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,205
Can you see yourself losing weight?

247
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,790
Yes, my stomach is already flat.

248
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,918
It will come to nothing if you eat.

249
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,379
-I can't starve though.
-Go to Seoul Muffin. They have salads.

250
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,341
I'm too exhausted to go there.
I don't even know where it is.

251
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,592
You can look it up.

252
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,177
I'm at a diner in the building.

253
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,262
-What did you order?
-Soft tofu stew.

254
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,264
Are you crazy?

255
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,184
Rice isn't good for weight loss,
and stews are high in sodium.

256
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,602
I'll only have half a bowl.

257
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,437
Will you be able to stop midway?

258
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,025
Then, how about you pack
my breakfast for me?

259
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,778
-Pack your breakfast?
-Yes, salad with some meat.

260
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,739
Meat? Are you kidding me?
Am I a housewife?

261
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,742
Then quit your job and stay home.
I'll provide for us both.

262
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,868
With your salary?

263
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,121
It's too early for your nonsense.

264
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,916
How is it nonsense? I wasn't kidding.

265
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,252
Let's hang up.
I have to get ready for work.

266
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,378
Okay.

267
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,781
-Head back inside. It's cold.
-I'll see you off.

268
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,867
It already feels different.

269
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,577
Do I look cool?

270
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,413
You always do.

271
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,332
-I'll get going then.
-Sure. Roll up the window.

272
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,829
I think Yu-sin's here.

273
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,331
Coming!

274
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,505
Dr. Shin's in the bathroom.

275
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,135
How did you sleep?
Did the jet lag keep you up?

276
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,262
I woke up briefly but went back to sleep.

277
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,564
What is it?

278
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,775
You seem younger than before.

279
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,155
At my age? Nonsense.

280
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,075
They say houses and women
depend on how they're maintained.

281
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,785
I don't dress up though.

282
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,828
I've never seen you lounge around.

283
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,039
-Are you hungry?
-A little.

284
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,041
Then wash your hands.

285
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,921
-Can I wash my hands here?
-Sure.

286
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,802
Who sat next to you on the plane?

287
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,845
A sweet young lady.

288
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,601
Yu-sin said

289
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,396
a pretty young lady sat next to him
on his plane back from LA.

290
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,443
No one.

291
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,071
You're here.

292
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:28,990
Hello.

293
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,287
-Take a look.
-What for?

294
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,414
The payment on the house
will be wired in two weeks.

295
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,833
I'll wire it to your account.

296
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,460
Forget it. It was in your name anyway.

297
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,795
Only by name, though.

298
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,381
-It's your inheritance.
-Breakfast is ready.

299
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,884
Spicy braised chicken.

300
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,053
She got up at the crack of dawn
to make this.

301
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,471
Thank you.

302
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,682
I forgot the plates.

303
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,815
It's even better with the shrimps.

304
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,069
Didn't you buy anything?
Not even a small gift?

305
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:08,738
No.

306
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:12,242
Where's the need for that
when it was a business trip?

307
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,577
Let's not be so tacky.

308
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,204
Now, please dig in.

309
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,873
I didn't buy any gifts this time.

310
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,584
That's good.
Buying gifts is always a burden.

311
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,752
I hope it's not salty.

312
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,422
Salty or bland.
It can always go either way.

313
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:33,972
It's perfect.

314
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,101
I'm sure the new home owner's pleased.

315
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,103
It was more than well-maintained.

316
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,771
It also has an ocean view.

317
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,608
He is. He thanked me for it.

318
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,235
Wasn't Pi-young upset about the sell?

319
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,405
Now that Ji-a's older,
they don't vacation there.

320
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,199
-Why pay extra tax?
-He's right.

321
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:57,037
I could have this chicken dish every day
and not get sick of it.

322
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,705
Your cooking is divine.

323
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,542
It's impossible to eat
the same dish every day.

324
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,710
I mean it.

325
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,254
Why not share the recipe with Pi-young?

326
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,925
No way. You know what they say
about never sharing recipes.

327
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,510
Unbelievable.

328
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,139
It's nothing special.
I use the same seasoning as others.

329
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,144
MY LOVE

330
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,523
Yes?

331
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,110
Is your jacket in your car?
You didn't bring it home.

332
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,739
I gave it to that friend.

333
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,824
Isn't that expensive?

334
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,285
He came in
with just a thin leather jacket,

335
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,995
and it was quite cold yesterday.

336
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,373
-For good?
-Sure. Why bother getting it back?

337
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,543
But it's your favorite jacket,
and we can't buy the same one.

338
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,921
It's fine. I've worn it long enough.

339
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,839
I'm having breakfast.

340
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,841
Got it.

341
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,309
How is Dongmi doing, Mr. Pan?

342
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,896
Yes, I asked for her
to be well taken care of.

343
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,691
I thought Gyu-sik's mom
couldn't come today.

344
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,693
Someone else is filling in for a day.

345
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,821
I should get going.

346
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,615
-Have a good day today.
-Thank you.

347
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,866
Here.

348
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,667
I had such a big breakfast
that I won't even want dinner.

349
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,670
Eating is everything.
It'll add meat on those bones.

350
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,465
You should stay indoors since it's cold.

351
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,384
I'll be traveling by car anyway.

352
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,553
Have Ji-a spend the night here if she can.

353
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,221
Sure thing.

354
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,228
It'd be nice to go to a resort.

355
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,396
Then we'll do that.

356
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,773
Ji-a will love to go skiing.

357
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,192
It's been a while since we went skiing.

358
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,155
Hello.

359
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,116
Yes, hello. You can wear those.

360
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,284
Yes, ma'am.

361
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,958
I must say,
you and your husband are gorgeous.

362
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:11,212
I just met your husband on the way in
and almost mistook him for a movie star.

363
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,630
He's that handsome.

364
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,929
I see he takes after his father.

365
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,514
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

366
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,392
This is my wife.

367
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:30,482
It's rude to assume people's relationships
at first glance.

368
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:34,944
I'm sorry. You look so young.

369
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:38,948
The work here can be tricky,
which is why we pay extra.

370
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,533
-This way.
-I see.

371
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,129
People in this country

372
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,132
show too much interest
in other people's lives.

373
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,930
So, you see…

374
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,725
What is it?

375
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,727
Never mind.

376
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,312
No, go ahead.

377
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,564
Maybe later.

378
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,208
You look good today.

379
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,128
I'm working out now.

380
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,088
-In the mornings?
-Yes.

381
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:40,427
Don't you find women who work out
quite sexy?

382
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,096
Of course, they are.
Those hips in leggings, right?

383
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,563
Is there someone nice at your gym?

384
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,859
Of course not.
Since it's early, most of them are men.

385
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,779
When will the document be done?

386
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,115
It's urgent, and I need it in two days.

387
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:03,950
It'll be done this morning.

388
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:18,798
Since you had rice for breakfast,
how about having bread for lunch?

389
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,634
-Bread?
-As in sandwiches.

390
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,303
Sure.

391
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,806
So I've been thinking…

392
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,685
What would you say to a custom wig?

393
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,395
You want me to wear a wig?

394
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,607
You'll definitely seem younger.

395
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,817
I hear it's extremely uncomfortable.

396
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,944
Some of my friends wear wigs.

397
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,655
They say wigs are not
as uncomfortable anymore.

398
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,618
Hair dye will only damage your scalp.

399
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,995
I won't force you to wear it
if it's uncomfortable,

400
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,039
so let's just get one custom-made.

401
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,291
Is that what you want?

402
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,713
Darker hair will make you look
20 years younger.

403
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,674
I'm not bald or anything.

404
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,761
I hate having our relationship mistaken.

405
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,971
Should I dye my hair gray then?

406
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:11,976
Sometimes, people think
we're a couple having an affair.

407
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,646
It's upsetting.

408
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,316
All right.

409
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,736
Let's get one today.

410
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,670
Are you Park Hae-ryun,
head of the department?

411
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,923
Ms. Nam Ga-bin.

412
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,800
That's right.

413
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,637
Please come on in.

414
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:36,227
-Sorry about the mess.
-It looks clean to me.

415
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,187
-Please have a seat.
-Sure.

416
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,606
Just a second.

417
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,858
That's not necessary.

418
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:48,406
-Can I get you some coffee?
-It's all right. Have a seat.

419
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,661
You must like surprises.

420
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,663
I don't.

421
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,252
Did Professor Joo not tell you?

422
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:02,670
No.

423
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,673
I told Professor Joo
I'd be coming over to greet you.

424
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,092
Is that so?

425
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:13,765
Professor Joo must've been
too busy with personal issues.

426
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,811
So that's what happened.
Did you wait for me long?

427
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,731
-About 40 minutes.
-You should've called

428
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,525
or asked the department office.

429
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,737
-I figured you'd come sooner or later.
-You must be cold.

430
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,865
I should get you something warm.

431
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,367
It's all right.

432
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:37,246
Truth be told, I haven't seen
any of your performances yet.

433
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,415
I only heard about your work
through articles.

434
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,667
You get great reviews.

435
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,585
Some of them are negative.

436
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,296
Do you hate musicals?

437
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,382
Who doesn't like musicals?

438
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,842
Then you must only watch
those with famous actors.

439
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,844
That's hardly the case.

440
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,097
Besides, you're more than well-known.

441
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,600
You look younger in person.

442
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,852
I've only been aging.

443
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:03,022
You were building a career,
not just getting old.

444
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,691
You're avoiding my question.

445
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,944
Right.

446
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,534
I didn't mean to.
I didn't realize it either.

447
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,829
Being too busy with my life
would be the reason.

448
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,331
Our paths just never crossed, that's all.

449
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,375
It's not like I watched
all musicals either.

450
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,919
Anyway, it's an honor to have you.

451
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,755
I don't know how well I'll manage,

452
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,426
but I'll do my best
to help out my juniors.

453
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,719
Good.

454
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,554
That being said,

455
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,224
I apologize for
not being able to pay you much.

456
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,643
I'm not doing this for money anyway.

457
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:45,398
I came to say hello
and get an outline of what I must teach.

458
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:49,694
You'll be teaching practical skills,
so the subjects will be

459
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:52,280
Musical Performance One
and Musical Performance Two.

460
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,491
It's already noon.

461
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,953
Should I come back some other time?

462
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,664
You already made time for me
out of your busy schedule.

463
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,666
Did you bring your car?

464
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,627
-People will recognize you, so--
-Yes.

465
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,756
If it's okay with you,
I'd love to buy lunch.

466
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,217
It won't be okay.
The cafeteria is quite a walk.

467
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,723
-Did you bring a packed lunch?
-Yes, from home.

468
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,439
Eating outside is always a hassle.

469
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,943
Tofu rice balls today.

470
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,987
They look delicious.

471
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:38,076
Would you like some?
It'll be better than the cafeteria food.

472
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,660
Sure.

473
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,163
I see it was made with love.

474
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,502
No, let me.

475
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,462
But you're the guest.

476
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:52,507
Exactly. I don't want to be rude.

477
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,264
Have some soup too.

478
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,601
I don't eat soup
since I rarely have time to cook it.

479
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,561
I mean, I do have time, but…

480
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:09,107
Anyway, I'm more used
to not having soup with my meals.

481
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,652
I see.

482
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,405
-Dig in.
-After you.

483
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,455
Won't it be not enough for you
if I eat with you?

484
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,458
A full stomach makes me drowsy.

485
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,795
Eating a little less is
better for my health anyway.

486
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,469
Are you on a diet?

487
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,430
No. I live for delicious food, you know.

488
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,230
It's good.

489
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,775
I didn't know tofu rice balls
could be this good.

490
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:56,028
Your wife must be such a good cook.

491
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,655
It's better than those you buy.

492
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,907
Eat all you want.

493
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,452
It's better to enjoy it together.

494
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,329
I know what it's like to eat alone.

495
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,999
Do you live alone?

496
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,084
At this age? Of course.

497
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,422
My family moved abroad,
so it's just me in Korea.

498
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,555
I'll get a paper cup.

499
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,348
I'll drink from the bottle.

500
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,647
Thank you.

501
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,863
A few years back, during a performance,

502
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,324
I had to drink a bottle of water,

503
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,742
but the lid wouldn't open.

504
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:44,535
So?

505
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,663
I kept trying but to no avail,
so I improvised.

506
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,707
I asked another actor to open it for me,

507
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,668
even though it went against the script.

508
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,462
You're quite quick-thinking.

509
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,714
Didn't the audience laugh?

510
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,216
They did.

511
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,805
It's really good.

512
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,809
Are those the student photos?

513
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,603
Yes.

514
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,357
Undergraduates on the right,
postgraduates on the left.

515
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,567
-To memorize their names?
-Yes.

516
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,361
Your passion shows.

517
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,155
Did I not seem passionate at first glance?

518
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,283
That's not what I meant.
When I first saw you,

519
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,661
I got the impression
that you're calm and poised.

520
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,081
I'm on the clumsier side.

521
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,416
You hardly seem like the type.

522
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,129
Did my wife tell you where she was going?

523
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,340
No, she left without telling me.

524
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,262
Can I get something to drink?

525
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,471
Tea?

526
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,432
Is there beer?

527
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,813
-Say you don't know if he asks.
-Yes, ma'am.

528
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,399
How long will you be gone?

529
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,776
That depends on my husband.

530
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:02,738
How dare he think he can walk all over me?

531
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,592
CALLS
WIFE

532
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,391
The phone you called is turned off.
You'll be directed to voicemail.

533
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,810
You even turned off your phone?

534
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,484
Should I grill a squid for you?

535
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,610
I'm good.

536
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,904
Some peanuts would be nice.

537
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,534
Did she leave in workout clothes?

538
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,744
No, sir.

539
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,129
I doubt she's protesting, so…

540
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,674
I'm protesting.
I'm more than capable of doing so.

541
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:11,349
You must have some free time
now that exams are over.

542
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,808
Yes. Finally.

543
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:17,146
We have a seminar next month, so
introduce yourself to the department then.

544
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,064
Okay.

545
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,149
How did you get the degree while working?

546
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,651
It wasn't easy, but I found a way.

547
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,779
Let's not be so formal.

548
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,489
We're alumni after all.

549
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:27,531
Okay.

550
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,326
Whenever I introduce myself
to new students,

551
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:33,120
I say my name
and that I was a student here in the 90s.

552
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,706
"I'm your professor,
but I'm also an alumnus here,

553
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:39,377
so feel free to tell me if you have
any problems or worries."

554
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,464
Goodness. How compassionate.
It's sweet of you.

555
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,767
-Hello?
-It's me, professor.

556
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,187
The administration office sent a notice
regarding general courses.

557
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,480
How should it be handled?

558
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,232
Tell them it doesn't concern us.

559
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,567
-Okay.
-Thanks.

560
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,570
I'll get going, then.

561
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,365
-I stole too much of your time.
-Nonsense.

562
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:12,535
I'll treat you to a meal sometime
before the teachers' seminar.

563
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,245
Sure.

564
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,373
I can see myself out.

565
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,381
I truly enjoyed today's lunch.

566
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,133
Call me if you have any questions.

567
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:28,592
Sure.

568
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,878
I noticed that radio show hosts
have their own nicknames.

569
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:07,089
Yes, once we hold a contest
and offer a prize,

570
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,674
ideas will come flooding in.

571
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,551
What kind of music do you listen to?

572
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,845
It changes depending on my mood.

573
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,680
Who chooses the songs?

574
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,932
Ms. Sa usually does, every morning.

575
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,977
-I bet it's not easy.
-Of course, it isn't.

576
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,812
But nothing's easy in this world.

577
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,815
Tell me about it.
Writing scripts is tough work,

578
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,067
and not everyone can host radio shows.

579
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,236
It gets fewer complaints
than TV shows, right?

580
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,946
You can say that,

581
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,033
but the listeners will try
and break in the new host.

582
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,784
Really?

583
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,786
There are all sorts of listeners out there

584
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,997
including die-hard fans.

585
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,167
Hello.

586
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,544
Hello.

587
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,758
I was a bit rude last night, wasn't I?

588
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,469
No, it was fine.

589
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,104
I got wasted last night, you see.

590
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,191
He was at the wine bar
I went with my friends.

591
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,196
Are you one to make drunken mistakes?

592
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,808
My goodness. Mother?

593
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,227
Didn't Sa-hyeon tell you?

594
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,728
No.

595
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,945
He must've been busy all day.

596
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,155
You're starting a new show,

597
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,950
so I wanted to lend you a hand
for a few days.

598
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,910
Did Father approve of this?

599
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,705
As if he's one to argue with what I do.

600
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,499
He'll require your assistance too, though.

601
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,210
-Is this uncomfortable for you?
-Of course not.

602
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,129
I'm more than grateful.

603
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,089
Then it's settled.

604
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,592
Enjoy your mother-in-law's meals
for a few days.

605
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,553
Why don't you just rest while you're here?

606
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:18,971
We can eat out--

607
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:21,515
You and Sa-hyeon both
eat out most of the time.

608
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,475
Anyway, go and wash up.

609
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:47,082
LAW FIRM JIDAM

610
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,419
-Yes?
-Your mother's here.

611
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,254
Yes, I gave her our lock combination.

612
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:55,841
-She's staying for a few days.
-And she can at her son's place.

613
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,551
My parents bought it for us anyway.

614
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,928
Even if they didn't,
they should be always welcomed.

615
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,972
-But it's uncomfortable.
-She's no stranger.

616
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,433
-It was unexpected--
-I'm busy right now,

617
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,601
so bye.

618
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:15,152
I know it's her son's,
but she can't just barge in.

619
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:23,369
-Why are you visiting Korea?
-No reason.

620
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,663
-A vacation?
-I have a meeting with an agency.

621
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,790
-In the entertainment industry?
-Yes.

622
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,417
We'll meet in person
to talk about my career.

623
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,003
It might be modeling or acting.

624
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,963
Is it a trustworthy agency?

625
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:38,342
Jeon Hun and Lee Se-rang
are signed with it too.

626
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:43,138
Still, the industry's known
to be dangerous in some ways.

627
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,141
It's why my father
conducted a thorough research

628
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:49,269
and an acquaintance of his
met with the agency head in person.

629
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,355
Do you have no relatives in Seoul?

630
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,233
-No.
-How were you contacted?

631
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,485
-Through social media?
-Yes.

632
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:59,238
Anyway, you can never be too careful.

633
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,989
I'd rather you didn't go alone.

634
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:05,119
The daughter of my dad's friend
works in this industry,

635
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,703
so she agreed to accompany me.

636
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,206
Has this world always intrigued you?

637
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,791
-Not really.
-They why?

638
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,335
I've been helping my father
manage his hotels.

639
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:16,338
We have hotels
in Orange County and San Diego.

640
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,006
I see.

641
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,135
I was contacted right around the time
I was seeking change.

642
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:30,561
DIRECTOR SHIN YU-SIN

643
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,021
MANAGER KIM

644
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,860
Your patient Lee Seung-il
would like to see you again.

645
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,528
He forgot to tell you something.

646
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,572
-In five minutes.
-Sure.

647
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,079
MANAGER KIM

648
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,001
-Hello?
-It's A Mi.

649
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,337
-Yes?
-I'm near your hospital right now.

650
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:01,049
If you're busy, I'll leave
your padded jacket with an employee.

651
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:03,802
How near?

652
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:08,932
I see. You wouldn't be able
to wait half an hour, right?

653
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,477
-I can.
-I'll see my last patient and come to you.

654
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,853
Sure.

655
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:33,749
Yes?

656
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,294
I'm sorry, but I need to meet someone now.

657
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,420
I'll eat out today.

658
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,423
Meet whom?

659
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:44,593
A friend called out of the blue.
Something must be up.

660
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:47,346
Got it. You'll probably have a drink then.

661
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:48,805
I won't.

662
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,807
What if he suggests it?

663
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,518
He's not really one to drink.

664
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:55,062
Anyway, enjoy your dinner
with our princess.

665
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,147
Sure.

666
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:03,862
Ji-a.

667
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,657
Ji-a, wake up.

668
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,077
But… I'm too sleepy.

669
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,080
You can't sleep yet. Have dinner first.

670
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:15,999
What should I help you with?

671
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,459
You don't need to.

672
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,796
Go wash the makeup off
Your eyes must be heavy.

673
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,798
I feel weird without my lashes.

674
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:25,676
-Are you making blue crab soup?
-Yes.

675
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,302
But braised crabs are better.

676
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,472
In this cold weather?
They'd get cold quickly.

677
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,352
Head back inside.
You'll only get in the way.

678
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,478
Sure.

679
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,830
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message

680
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:57,416
after the beep.
Extra fees will be charged…

681
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,628
Where the hell did she go?

682
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,521
-Did you already drink something?
-Yes.

683
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,772
Would you like something?

684
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,983
You're here anyway, so let's have dinner.

685
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:24,860
And that you can keep.

686
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,154
But it's too expensive.

687
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,488
How was the meeting?

688
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,282
I agreed to sign the contract.

689
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:31,658
Read it thoroughly first.

690
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,036
-There's a standard contract.
-What did they say?

691
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,538
I'll start by modeling
and do some commercials

692
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,790
while taking acting classes
for a few years

693
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,918
to be in TV drama shows.
The agency now produces its own.

694
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:47,090
Do you believe you have the talent?
To survive in the industry, I mean.

695
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:50,344
Well, I won't know until I try,

696
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,928
but it sounds like fun.

697
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:56,016
I don't want to only work at hotels
without taking other chances.

698
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,934
But it's a safe family business.

699
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,686
I have younger siblings.

700
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,357
Besides, I can always go back
whenever I want to.

701
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,860
Then you'll need that padded jacket.

702
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:12,491
Many wear over-sized jackets while working
on sets because of the outfits.

703
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,493
I guess you're right.

704
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,870
Thank you, then. I'll wear it well.

705
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,498
Then dinner should be on me.

706
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,124
What did you want to eat in Korea?

707
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,168
-A lot.
-Bibimbap and bulgogi?

708
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:27,005
I grew up eating those often
thanks to my mom.

709
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,757
Braised short ribs too.

710
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,677
I went to Korean restaurants a few times
to eat naengmyeon.

711
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,221
Temple cuisine is on the top of my list.

712
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,515
But you might not like it once you try it.

713
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,518
-Do you like healthy dishes?
-I do.

714
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:43,063
I know a place that serves temple cuisine,
but it must be booked in advance.

715
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,024
-So today--
-A Michelin-starred restaurant then.

716
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:47,693
Is there one nearby?

717
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:52,114
There's a place called Monet Kitchen
that's known for its French cuisine.

718
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,703
You've dressed too lightly again.

719
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:58,912
It was for the meeting.

720
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:01,248
-You should wait inside.
-I'm good.

721
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,375
It was too warm in there for me anyway.

722
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,044
Dinner will be on me today.

723
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,755
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

724
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,341
The same applies when you're in Korea.

725
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,635
In Korea, the older one always buys.

726
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,770
Thank you.

727
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,117
I'm amazed by how even cafes have
valet parking.

728
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,744
Korea's known for its surprises.

729
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,590
Yes, Dad.

730
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,551
Did your mom perhaps go to your place?

731
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:55,594
She did.

732
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,721
Wait. You didn't know?

733
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:58,972
Okay.

734
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:01,516
-Did you two argue?
-Of course not.

735
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,810
I'm sure you two bickered again.

736
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,437
No, we didn't.

737
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,105
-Anyway, bye.
-Sure.

738
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:25,916
Yes, Father.

739
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,084
Your mother-in-law turned her phone off.

740
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:31,004
She's in the middle of cooking dinner.
Let me put her on.

741
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,301
-It's Father.
-Okay.

742
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:40,096
-Hello?
-What do you think you're doing?

743
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,975
-Yes?
-What the hell are you doing there?

744
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,728
I can't hear you. What did you say?

745
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:50,357
-Come home immediately!
-Okay, I will.

746
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:05,747
You hung up on me?

747
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,483
It's better than I expected.

748
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,402
The taste?

749
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,779
That, the ambiance, and everything else.

750
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,201
When did you go to Italy?

751
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,495
The last visit was three years ago.

752
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:46,830
Where did you like best?

753
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,415
What about you, Yu-sin?

754
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,208
-Have you been to Amalfi Coast?
-Yes.

755
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,334
I love the cave there.

756
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:54,713
Yes, and the sea is
in the most beautiful color.

757
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,636
You love to eat, don't you?

758
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,388
And it leads to indigestion, right?

759
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:07,100
I'll be thinking of you
every time I get indigestion now.

760
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:09,895
You should be careful not to have it.
It's quite painful.

761
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,151
Do you take after your mother?

762
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:19,112
Only in a way.

763
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,157
Some say I'm nothing like her.

764
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:24,576
What about you, Yu-sin?

765
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:28,872
For me, it was my grandfather.
He's no longer with us, though.

766
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:32,626
When you think of your grandparents,

767
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,295
do you tear up?

768
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:39,925
Do you?

769
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,552
When I think of my grandma.

770
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,221
She raised me

771
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:48,058
until I left for the States
at the age of four.

772
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,730
I wasn't around when she passed away.

773
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,277
And that still stings.

774
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,659
If you're done, may I clear the table?

775
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:06,743
Sure.

776
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,008
No, let me.

777
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:31,267
I have a favor.

778
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,269
Will you grant it?

779
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:35,563
It depends.

780
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,776
Just tell me.

781
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:44,280
Let's go for the second round
and let me buy it.

782
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,866
I'm surprised to hear that.

783
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:51,371
I've watched a lot of Korean drama series.
I know the drinking culture in Korea.

784
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,593
I'll tell you why later on, though.

785
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,595
The reason I'm buying drinks.

786
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,228
It's blue crab soup.

787
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,273
-Mother, this is bad.
-What's wrong?

788
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,275
I'll be stuffing myself today.

789
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,528
Well, no one will be stopping you.

790
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:24,779
When did you do all this?

791
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:26,656
The gatkimchi is from home.

792
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,910
Did you roast the dried laver yourself?

793
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,038
Of course, with a layer of perilla oil.

794
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,331
I can smell the perilla oil!

795
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,879
Put on the gloves
so that your hands won't smell.

796
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:43,506
Who cares when I'm eating at home?

797
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,843
-Have some of the broth.
-You should eat too.

798
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:49,637
-This seems like hard work.
-It hardly was.

799
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,524
-Is that all you're eating?
-Yes.

800
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:04,778
But I cooked all this
for you to eat your fill.

801
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,780
I'd rather not look puffy tomorrow.

802
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,831
That's how she always is.

803
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,628
But it'll be nice to see
some meat on those bones.

804
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,296
Don't you need the energy to work?

805
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:25,965
I'll stick to the side dishes.

806
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,470
-How about a lettuce wrap?
-Sounds good.

807
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,064
Stick to this much.

808
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,608
What?

809
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,780
Don't be so stingy with his food.

810
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:51,032
-He has to eat less for dinner.
-It's still early.

811
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,075
It's 8 p.m.

812
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,327
A bowl of rice won't make him fat.

813
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:03,753
Kids are too skinny and lanky these days
if you ask me.

814
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:07,090
You know what they say.
"Well-fed ghosts look better."

815
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,010
Would he be this tall
if I hadn't fed him well?

816
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:21,062
Fast food may make you gain weight,
but not lettuce wraps.

817
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,230
Would you like some scorched rice?

818
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:05,690
I'm good.

819
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,162
Bring my car around.

820
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:21,623
Mom, U-ram's back!

821
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:22,874
Right.

822
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,337
How was it, son? Did you have fun skiing?

823
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,048
-Yup.
-Answer her properly, you brat.

824
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,175
Did you fall?

825
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:34,219
Only once this time. Where's Dad?

826
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,012
Late, as always.

827
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,100
Other than golfing,
what else do you like doing?

828
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,144
I've been going horse riding for a while--

829
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,772
-Interesting.
-What is it?

830
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:49,400
I had a dream yesterday,
while you were driving me home.

831
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:52,987
Yes, when you dozed off.
What was it about?

832
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,656
Promise me you won't laugh.

833
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,241
I was riding a horse.

834
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,994
That's hardly funny.
Are you sure it was a dream?

835
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,246
That I'm sure of.

836
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,165
Then maybe your career
will take off after all.

837
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,959
Dreaming about that is a good sign.

838
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,128
-Do you ride horses?
-I tried it as a kid,

839
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,172
but gave up since it petrified me.

840
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:16,469
Order a cocktail if it's too strong.

841
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,639
I'll stick to this.

842
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,895
When will you tell me
the reason for this drink?

843
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:29,232
-When I want to.
-I wonder when that'll be.

844
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:31,818
Well…

845
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:33,820
When I find you comfortable.

846
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:37,740
Do I make you uncomfortable?
People rarely say that about me.

847
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:41,578
In my dream, you and I rode on horses
along the beach.

848
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,415
Maybe we'll both find success.

849
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:54,007
-What's your alcohol tolerance like?
-You?

850
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,259
-It depends on my mood.
-Same here.

851
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,261
Can we both get drunk today?

852
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:02,557
I have no reason to say no,
but why must we get drunk?

853
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,893
Well…

854
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:08,021
Did you buy drinks to mention your dream?

855
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,230
Of course not.

856
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:11,566
Do you really want to know?

857
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,819
Then let your body get drunk.

858
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:15,820
But not your heart.

859
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:21,492
How can I keep his heart
from getting drunk when I'm drunk?

860
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,912
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

861
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,206
So that we can be safe from one another.

862
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,501
Empty your glass.

863
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:45,767
Now I'm feeling tipsy. It must be
because I'm mixing different kinds.

864
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,604
Are you a heavyweight?

865
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:53,775
Let's down a few glasses
and drop the honorifics.

866
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,444
That's my reason.

867
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:58,321
-I want us to be friends.
-Let's.

868
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:01,616
You say you want to be friends,
so I call you by your name,

869
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,910
-but you're still formal with me.
-So are you.

870
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,703
I'm only following your lead.

871
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,623
I'll be less formal then, young lady.

872
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:11,167
-Starting from now.
-We'll drop the honorifics?

873
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,630
How about this, Ms. A. I mean, Mi.

874
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:18,216
Anyone who speaks formally…

875
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,387
-A smacking seems too much.
-Then, a penalty drink.

876
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:25,640
It's not just for today though.

877
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:28,184
Speak formally again in a few days and--

878
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:29,185
We'll drink as a penalty.

879
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,147
-Mi.
-Yes, Mr. Shin?

880
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,440
Drink.

881
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:36,901
Sure.

882
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,239
You get one free pass.

883
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:50,498
Your wife…

884
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,042
What's she like?

885
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,842
She's…

886
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:02,885
a fine woman.

887
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,388
In every aspect?

888
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,014
That's right.

889
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:18,526
Want some fruit?

890
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,028
No, ice pops.

891
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:22,822
We don't have any.

892
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,240
I won't buy any anymore.

893
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:27,785
Just like grown-ups enjoy alcohol,
kids my age enjoy ice pops.

894
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,620
Both are equally bad for you.

895
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:32,248
Even though that's the case,
grown-ups still drink.

896
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:34,375
You also do once in a while.

897
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,420
I win, don't I?

898
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,385
-Don't we even have ice cream?
-I'll buy some tomorrow.

899
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:47,096
If only they delivered ice cream too.

900
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:52,393
Isn't this the TV series
about dads having affairs?

901
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:58,649
How did you know that?

902
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:01,360
I saw the title of the show online.

903
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,446
Do you know what an affair is?

904
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,990
Of course. I'm 12 now, remember?

905
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,744
I'll go back to my room,
so enjoy the show without worrying.

906
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,040
Ji-a.

907
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,252
What would you do…

908
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:21,339
Never mind.

909
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,346
What would I do

910
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:32,099
if my husband cheated on me?

911
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,896
-Yes.
-I wouldn't let him get away with it.

912
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:38,815
What about you?

913
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:43,694
There's no reason for me to think that
since your dad would never cheat on me.

914
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:48,908
Dad probably loves you more
than me, his daughter.

915
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:55,331
I'm sure you'll be loved by your husband
even more than I'm loved by mine.

916
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:54,390
Honey, what do I do?

917
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:55,975
Okay. I'll be right there.

918
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,603
-Hurry.
-I'm sorry, but my wife needs me now.

919
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,271
-What do you like?
-People.

920
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:03,024
-Male or female?
-Is this Truth or Dare?

921
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:05,276
You can be honest with me.

922
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:08,154
Why did you have to come here
and rub it in like that?

923
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:10,031
Is there anything you'd like to have?

924
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:13,701
-What is it?
-I'll never forget about

925
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:14,994
tonight.

926
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,787
How rude. She didn't even ask me.

927
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:19,790
-Do I seem picky?
-I thought so.

928
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,167
Wash your hands at my place.

929
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,168
Yu-sin.

930
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,087
Yes?

931
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:29,133
It's my first time being all alone,
away from home.

932
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:36,849
