1
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,603
Does your family know?

2
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,275
Yes.

3
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,031
Don't worry about me and go.

4
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,201
You're here to say goodbye, aren't you?

5
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,797
EPISODE 2

6
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,887
What's this about?
Why couldn't you come in?

7
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,644
Don't go too far.
Your father will only ask more questions.

8
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,773
His estrogen levels must be increasing
now that he's older.

9
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,776
He gets too curious and feels the need
to know about everything.

10
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,103
I smell ramyeon.

11
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,024
-Are you home?
-Dad!

12
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,860
-Hey.
-You didn't go to the hospital?

13
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,444
I stopped by on my way home.

14
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,657
You had ramyeon?

15
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,285
It's been a while. What a treat.

16
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,871
I shouldn't keep them in the pantry.

17
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,790
-How's your teacher?
-Better than expected.

18
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,587
Dr. Min notified you
of her condition, right?

19
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,754
Yes.

20
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,048
Go to her if you need reassurance.

21
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,680
How about a shoulder massage?

22
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,891
Lie down.

23
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,976
Look how stiff they are!

24
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,061
Get on top of me if you want.

25
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,939
-And step on your shoulders?
-Go ahead.

26
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,942
I'll gladly let you walk all over me.

27
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,997
That feels great.

28
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,875
Don't you fall ill.
You're the pillar that holds us up.

29
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,256
-Just a pillar?
-A pillar, the crossbeam,

30
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,343
the roof over our heads,
and the sky for me personally.

31
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,221
I'd like that in recording
for when I can't sleep.

32
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,598
-For when you can't sleep?
-I mean…

33
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,725
when I'm tired and exhausted.

34
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,812
-When are you exhausted?
-When I don't get to see you.

35
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,488
You know, right?

36
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,448
Know what?

37
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,742
That I can't live without you.

38
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,370
Likewise.

39
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,459
So here's where I stand.

40
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,047
I can't live without her.

41
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,549
Don't be absurd.

42
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,220
So what if you can't?
Will you end your marriage over it?

43
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,682
Hye-ryung's finally calmed down now.

44
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,433
And you said you'd end it with her.

45
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,477
Come to think of it,
there's nothing to end.

46
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,896
-We didn't even date.
-What were you two then?

47
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,899
We were just close acquaintances

48
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,526
who talked about life--

49
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,904
How does talking about life
lead to pregnancy?

50
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,616
It was just that one time.

51
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,910
-As if I'd fall for that.
-It's true.

52
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,745
Who would believe that?

53
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,372
Have you known me to lie?

54
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,915
You fooled Hye-ryung for months.

55
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,960
But it wasn't
a romantic relationship back then.

56
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,255
I'm telling you,
there was nothing between us.

57
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,133
We didn't cross the line in any way.

58
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,927
There was nothing to lie about
and God knows it.

59
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,471
So?

60
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,641
Are you going to keep seeing her?

61
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,184
When Hye-ryung knows?

62
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,562
Get a grip.

63
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,732
Don't ruin your life
by ruining your marriage.

64
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,400
I'm not some mindless beast.

65
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,029
Would you be able to stay away
and miss your child growing up?

66
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,071
It's inhumane.

67
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,490
You can't have both worlds.

68
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,576
Would you allow this
if you were Hye-ryung?

69
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,330
I don't care if it stings.
You need to choose one or the other.

70
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,415
My relationship with her

71
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,460
can't be understood
or explained for that matter.

72
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,962
This is driving me nuts.

73
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,839
Keep the promise you made.

74
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,466
That's how a good man should be.

75
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,888
And to keep that promise,
I'll only see her occasionally.

76
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,016
I was hoping you'd fill in
for when I can't.

77
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:53,311
That's what I wanted to ask you.
To plead to you.

78
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,944
She has already lost her parents
and only has one older brother,

79
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,613
but he lives on Jeju Island.

80
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,449
No one could be as lonely as she is, so--

81
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,201
No parents?

82
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,161
Be like a mother to her.

83
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,996
You'll want to when you meet her.

84
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,499
Mom, please.

85
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,172
From one mother to another.

86
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,677
I was going to sever ties,

87
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,931
but I realized that it's impossible.

88
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,850
It'd be easy if Hye-ryung gave up.

89
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,019
Did you forget she coughed up blood?

90
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,648
I know you're my son,
but you deserve what's coming to you.

91
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,194
Please go see her,
comfort her, and give her courage.

92
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,072
Help her have a painless childbirth.

93
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,158
-Be someone she can lean on.
-Unbelievable.

94
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,495
We'll address the baby issue
after it's born.

95
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,831
Spend the next eight months for the baby.

96
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,458
For your grandchild.

97
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,961
You must. Or else you won't go to Heaven.

98
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,462
You already ruined my chance.

99
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,926
What if we get caught again?

100
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,554
Someone will notice something for sure.

101
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,017
How about this then?

102
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,980
I'll look out for the baby,
so don't go to see her.

103
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,816
At least until she gives birth.

104
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,193
Then I wouldn't be doing right
by the baby.

105
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,155
As a dad,
I should be there while it grows.

106
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,906
Follow up afterwards with photos.

107
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,994
I'll do whatever Hye-ryung asks me to do
for the rest of my life, okay?

108
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,037
How can she be my priority right now?

109
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,290
I'm willing to take
whatever punishment there is.

110
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,500
The baby did nothing wrong though.

111
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,377
Poor little thing…

112
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,385
On your stomach. Good job, Dongmi.

113
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,390
Weren't you in the walk-in closet?

114
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,392
I didn't know you went out.

115
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,562
Why bring it indoors when it sheds fur?

116
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,023
Why would she when she's sitting still?

117
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,942
Besides, some fur flying around
won't kill you.

118
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,997
Dongmi, listen carefully
and have this carved on your soul.

119
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,833
You must be born a human
in your next life.

120
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,585
People will think you're crazy,

121
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,837
starting with our housekeeper.

122
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,547
Sit still if you don't know.

123
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,965
What is it that I don't know?

124
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,927
Even people can't understand
Buddhist scriptures--

125
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,554
Enough. Just leave
if you'd rather not hear it.

126
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,391
If only you knew what was going on…

127
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,477
What do you mean?

128
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,816
Goodness.

129
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,861
Soothing, isn't it?

130
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:57,453
For you who can't speak,
I listen and learn.

131
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,415
This is all so that my grandchild

132
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,043
can be born healthily.

133
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,712
Why can't you be this way for me instead?

134
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,678
That conniving Sa Pi-young
is controlling him.

135
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,056
If it weren't for me,
she would've never married Yu-sin.

136
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,434
But here she is
paying her debt with ingratitude.

137
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:25,356
Keep at it
and I might just move in with you.

138
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,860
SIN CENTRAL MEDICAL CENTER

139
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,372
YU-SIN

140
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,340
YU-SIN

141
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,681
The person you have called
cannot be reached. Your call will…

142
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,570
See you soon.

143
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:19,118
My beloved,
lean your ears toward my direction

144
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:23,581
A night filled with longing

145
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:31,213
I hope you accept it

146
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,095
Joining us today on Monday
is Im Baek-chun.

147
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,347
How about some questions?

148
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,352
Number 8025 says,
"I know you majored in architecture.

149
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,897
Do you regret or wonder about
the path you didn't take?"

150
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,025
I had no idea you majored in architecture.

151
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,110
You must have zero interest
in your guests.

152
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,112
I apologize.

153
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,865
After graduating,
I worked at a construction company.

154
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,451
During those six years,
I participated in projects like

155
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,536
the construction of
the Seoul Olympic Stadium

156
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,788
and many subway stations.

157
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,748
I worked hard.

158
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:06,999
Here's the next question.

159
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,628
"You've been happily married
to Ms. Kim Yeon-joo.

160
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,423
Have you had any problems
or issues throughout the years?"

161
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,551
-Of course, there were.
-For instance?

162
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,554
You want something sensational, right?

163
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,515
Ask if an avid fan ever got in the way.

164
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,476
Well, we've been married
for over 20 years now.

165
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,395
Even after decades though,

166
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,563
I still can't tell
what women are thinking.

167
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,564
DID YOUR FANS CAUSE ANY TROUBLE

168
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,401
When we were newlyweds, we once fought

169
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,778
because I said her food
needed more seasoning.

170
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,240
These days, she's been telling me
not to talk so much.

171
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,450
She says it's a sign that I've gotten old.

172
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,703
How can one live without talking though?

173
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,374
There's no right answer
to a man and woman living together.

174
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,669
He's not shaken up that easily.

175
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,801
When did you get here?

176
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,303
About 20 minutes ago.

177
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,584
From now on, study up on the guests
before the show.

178
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,712
Right. And I would have
if he were a non-celebrity.

179
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,840
How about a musical actor
for our guest artist?

180
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,050
Sounds good.
Someone young would be better.

181
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,470
-Who?
-Lee Jeong-hwa, Son Hye-rim

182
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,305
-or Nam Ga-bin.
-Nam Ga-bin.

183
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,267
I recognize the name,
but I haven't been to a show of hers.

184
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,234
-Have a seat.
-How are you feeling?

185
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:58,986
I'm good.

186
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,823
You want to eat out?

187
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,575
I doubt you have any food here.

188
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,671
I started having morning sickness.

189
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,343
-Really?
-I got sick while eating a raw octopus.

190
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,887
I hear it's best not to eat raw fish
when you're pregnant.

191
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,973
-What about meat?
-It's okay to eat meat,

192
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,808
but I'm not craving it.

193
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,186
But you should be eating well.

194
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,146
It's just momentary.

195
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,481
Let's get herbal medicine.

196
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,692
My sister-in-law had some
that calmed her morning sickness.

197
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,362
Maybe some other time.
I'd rather rest today.

198
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,576
Don't worry too much.

199
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,246
This happens to everyone
and they all get through it.

200
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,831
Have you thought of a nickname?

201
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,042
Right, a nickname for the baby.

202
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,879
Did you tell your brother?

203
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,466
No. It didn't seem like the right time.

204
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,718
Aren't you thirsty?

205
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,638
A little.

206
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,603
You seem troubled today.

207
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,692
Do you have something to say?

208
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,784
Is it what I think you're going to say?

209
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,289
You see…

210
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,835
my wife saw me

211
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,629
when we were talking over the phone.

212
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,344
She wanted a divorce at first,
but now she has changed her mind.

213
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,973
Last week, she coughed up blood

214
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,475
due to an acute duodenal ulcer.

215
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:02,234
She had to be hospitalized,
so I couldn't push it any further.

216
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,405
And now, she won't divorce me anymore.

217
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,781
Of course.

218
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,035
It's like I said.

219
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,995
She didn't mean it.

220
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,873
How I feel remains the same though.

221
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:20,002
We can just go back to how it was.
Before that night in Gangneung.

222
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,255
All we did was meet up and talk.

223
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,299
About our families and life.

224
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,470
You should leave. It's fine.

225
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,724
What do you mean it's fine?

226
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,684
I'm not leaving. I won't.

227
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:41,690
I'll wait outside if you don't let me in
and come back if you kick me out.

228
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,400
You'll only make things worse.

229
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,486
I wouldn't tell her. I'm not that stupid.

230
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,447
She doesn't know about you.
Only of our situation.

231
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:52,159
These days, you can hire a PI
to track people down.

232
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,954
I can't care for our baby in fear.

233
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,248
You're right.

234
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,378
We weren't even dating,
but whatever we had is over.

235
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,173
But I'm going to carefully
bring this baby to term.

236
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,676
If you keep coming by,
I'll go to my brother's.

237
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,471
I won't be able to take this.

238
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,349
Go and reassure your wife.

239
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,477
Tell her that all I want is the baby.

240
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,689
What about the baby though?
Won't it need its father?

241
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,692
I don't know,
but I can't think of that right now.

242
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,276
And I don't want to.

243
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,154
You know I wanted Gangneung
to be our last.

244
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,073
That night in Gangneung

245
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,284
made me realize what it was that I wanted.

246
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,704
We care for and love each other.

247
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,373
We never hurt one another.

248
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,958
It only feels natural.

249
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,838
I think of you multiple times a day.

250
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,840
When I eat something delicious

251
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,134
and when alcohol courses through my veins,

252
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,053
I wish to hear your voice
and not my wife's.

253
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,514
Was it just me?
We don't need to say it in words.

254
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,850
We can feel it, can't we?

255
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,185
Don't make this any harder.

256
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,898
It'll only bring us pain. The baby too.

257
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:11,280
Don't contact me ever again.
There's no reason for us to even meet.

258
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,532
Erase my number from your phone.

259
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,122
There's no reason for us to meet?

260
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,420
Some things are inevitable.

261
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,922
What's inevitable
are my feelings toward you!

262
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,760
That night…

263
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,305
Your plan was to scare me off,
but it backfired.

264
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:41,935
My heart and soul
live and breathe for you now!

265
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,813
So what do I do now?

266
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,994
Just put them in the machine.

267
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,288
There aren't that many, so why bother?

268
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,502
It's winter now.

269
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,005
Back when I was young,
it was freezing even in November.

270
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,634
Is there any food
that you're reminded of in the winter?

271
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,303
Baked sweet potatoes
and noodles in kimchi broth.

272
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,517
In my case, it's mung bean pancakes
and Pyeongan-styled dumplings.

273
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,770
-Me too!
-You said it was sweet potatoes.

274
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,190
The dishes you mentioned
aren't something you can easily buy.

275
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,568
Are your parents from the North?

276
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,653
They are.

277
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,573
-Where up north?
-Haeju, Hwanghae Province.

278
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,493
My mother is from Haeju
and my father from Pyongyang.

279
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,078
-My gosh.
-Before my mother died,

280
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,914
we always made both dishes in the winter.

281
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,749
-I make great dumplings.
-So do I.

282
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,254
-We should make some.
-It's a lot of work.

283
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,215
I agree, but the ingredients
can be prepared in a few hours.

284
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,759
I used to help my mother,
so I know what to do.

285
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,885
Really?

286
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,400
Yes, it's me.

287
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,111
Which show?

288
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,947
When?

289
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,701
I'll do it.

290
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,205
It must have been hard for you.

291
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,416
You didn't let it show, though.

292
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,586
You may not believe this,

293
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,839
but I was happy in some way.

294
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,762
-You should eat.
-I don't have an appetite.

295
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,432
I'll get you a few things to drink then.

296
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,439
You have to let me back in though.

297
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,946
We should go out.

298
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,908
I'll only throw up what I eat.

299
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,494
I'd like to get you some fruit juice,

300
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,414
but I'm worried you won't let me in again.

301
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,627
Unless things are sorted out legally,

302
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,837
I may not have any right to care for you,

303
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,256
but I do when it comes to our child.

304
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,258
It should hear my voice

305
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,427
and listen as I express my love.

306
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,513
Am I being too greedy?

307
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,101
Just like you can't give up the child,

308
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,562
I feel the same way and then some.

309
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,856
Please. Don't stop me.

310
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:39,780
I know things will be tough,
but let's get through this together.

311
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:41,907
Please.

312
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,710
YU-SIN

313
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,600
-Hello?
-It took you long to answer.

314
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,561
It's nothing. Are you at work?

315
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,689
I'm outside the house. Come on out.

316
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,650
-You're at my place?
-Yes.

317
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,236
Gosh, I'm hungry.

318
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,947
Head home and eat dinner then.

319
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,283
-I'm not home.
-Where did you go?

320
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,495
I can't talk for long.

321
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,914
Why's that?

322
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,916
Pi-young will be waiting, so hurry home.

323
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,755
You left the house without your car?

324
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,217
Open the gates already.

325
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,437
How are you feeling today?

326
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,646
I'm good.

327
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,814
What about your dinner?

328
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,983
I couldn't be bothered
to cook anything today.

329
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,652
I'll be fine once day breaks.

330
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,903
What about at night?

331
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,784
Last night, I had a light fever.
But I'm fine.

332
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,619
Why are you telling me to go?
I'm here because I'm worried.

333
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:10,704
You're worried?

334
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,914
Then you should have come sooner.

335
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,417
I'm fine, so forget about me

336
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,127
and go be a family man.

337
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,295
You're my family too.

338
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,839
Would you have had another doctor
care for Pi-young?

339
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,257
You wouldn't have.

340
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,718
If I had an urgent patient, yes.

341
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,347
I see that you're upset, Ms. Kim.

342
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,015
I'm not a child, you know.

343
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,476
-You're upset--
-I'm not.

344
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,686
Now that your father's gone,

345
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,938
I only expect the minimum anyway.

346
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,357
The minimum? We're still family.

347
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,573
Go and hide.
I'll leave if I can't find you.

348
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,286
You used to play hide and seek with me,
remember?

349
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,920
The game went on dozens of times,
but you never complained once.

350
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,006
You always kept me entertained.

351
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,552
I'll find you this time, so get hiding.

352
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,054
See how fun it is.

353
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,389
I'll really leave if I can't find you.

354
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,768
-Leave if you do.
-Whatever.

355
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:19,815
Our childish Ms. Kim Dong-mi
will now go back to her childhood.

356
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,617
Where on earth did you go?

357
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,754
Where are you, Ms. Dong-mi?

358
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,678
You surely know
how to play this game well.

359
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,971
Are you here?

360
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,646
Where did you go?

361
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,124
I can't even guess where you are.

362
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,716
I'll find you
even if it takes me all night!

363
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:33,597
I can't find you, I can't

364
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,223
I won't give up.

365
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:43,190
I have to find you. I'm hungry.

366
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,041
You're not here.

367
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,259
Come on out.

368
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,809
Hasn't dad been texting you?

369
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,652
He must be sick of us now.

370
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,987
Although, the feeling is mutual.

371
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,032
He's probably too embarrassed.

372
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,493
I'll see just how happy he can be.

373
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,371
Don't be too spiteful

374
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,706
and don't forget that he's your dad.

375
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,292
I wouldn't hate him
had he not been my dad.

376
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,423
It's as if Lunar New Year is near.

377
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,176
We used to be a big family,
so we made 200 to 300 dumplings

378
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,096
when we all pitched in for a few hours.

379
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,432
There aren't many restaurants
that sell northern-style dumplings.

380
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,518
They don't taste as good
as the homemade ones,

381
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,562
so I've given up
trying to find good restaurants.

382
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,774
Absolutely. The kimchi must be tasty

383
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,819
-and good meat must be used.
-And seasoned perfectly.

384
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,738
What else do you want to eat
aside from mung bean pancakes?

385
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,824
-Homemade tofu.
-That's for next week then.

386
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:16,950
It takes a while to make.

387
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,828
How can one make tofu in an apartment?

388
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,956
My mother made it happen
and there's a way to do it.

389
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,626
Do I have to wait a week to see you again?

390
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,379
I'll make time to come by.

391
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:32,757
Don't overexert yourself.
I don't want you to get sick.

392
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,884
I've been wired from birth to be healthy.

393
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,388
We can freeze about 50 to 60 of them.

394
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:42,017
Keep them in stock. Judging by their size,
six would be enough for one meal.

395
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,272
Don't you miss your children?

396
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,192
They're all grown up now anyway.

397
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,241
What about after people get wind of us?

398
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,494
Would it be okay for you at work?
What if people talk?

399
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,580
It's you I'm more worried about.

400
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:07,083
Your fans will
voice their opinions online.

401
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,669
That won't bother me.
They'll lose interest soon.

402
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,381
Besides, a dramatic life
is what an actor needs.

403
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,595
After the wedding,
let's move into the Yangpyeong house.

404
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,263
We'll take up gardening.

405
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,806
Won't it be too big for us?

406
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,725
We'll need a study each,

407
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,144
a walk-in closet, a music studio,
and a bedroom.

408
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:29,439
Also, a guest room
since my parents visit from time to time.

409
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,900
Will you tell them
when they come to Korea?

410
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,943
I'm thinking about heading out
to meet them.

411
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,988
They emigrated there a long time ago,

412
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,574
so our situation won't seem too foreign.

413
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,663
Your soup will get cold.

414
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,666
-Where's Ji-a?
-She had pizza last night,

415
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,709
so no breakfast for her.

416
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,337
Don't be ridiculous.
She needs to eat to study.

417
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,508
She'll be fine with the carrots, jujube,
pine nuts, and cherry tomatoes I pack her.

418
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,094
-Besides, she gets more sleep.
-She eats carrots?

419
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,138
She's accustomed to them now.

420
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,557
You're always the perfect mother.

421
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,938
This is perfect.

422
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,148
The food outside is always salty.

423
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,818
Tell me about it. It's bad for our health.

424
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,945
Is Mother doing all right?

425
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,238
Yes.

426
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,660
You had dinner with her yesterday.

427
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,705
Yes, I swung by.

428
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,999
Why did you send Dr. Min then?

429
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,127
You should have gone yourself.

430
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,463
First, Dr. Min,
and then the hospital director.

431
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,134
Don't put on a show
for something so frivolous.

432
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,970
What kind of show?

433
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,766
Don't get so upset. It's nothing.
We're family, after all.

434
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,519
What am I upset about?

435
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,898
I swung by
because she didn't answer my calls.

436
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,276
She must have been thrilled.

437
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,570
Look at me.

438
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,614
Eat up and head to work.

439
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,950
Pi-young.

440
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,327
Should I pinch your sides?

441
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,663
-Don't you dare.
-Or what?

442
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:14,043
-Go ahead and see for yourself.
-Jeez, I'm trembling.

443
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,837
There's that temper of yours.

444
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,922
You agreed to give it a month.

445
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,759
Sure. Do as you please.

446
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,051
Keep buttering her up.

447
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,762
The only person I flatter is you.

448
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,768
Leaving the house
while on bad terms with you

449
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,979
affects my work throughout the day.
I can't focus.

450
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,320
Give me a wink.

451
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,531
-Why should I?
-I will, so smile back.

452
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,752
Not that bitter smile.

453
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:59,047
I'd like a genuine one
from my beautiful wife.

454
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:03,760
A smile from you
beats any supplements or vitamins.

455
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,179
-Don't exaggerate.
-Is that what you think?

456
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,222
It's the truth.

457
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,479
-My daughter, you're up.
-Hey.

458
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,564
Aren't you hungry?

459
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,235
-A little.
-Tough luck.

460
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,569
Gosh.

461
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,781
Slightly being hungry all the time
is how you watch your weight.

462
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,407
Patience is a virtue.

463
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,078
I'll pack some cherry tomatoes and nuts.

464
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,789
-Enjoy while studying.
-Sure.

465
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,916
Like mother, like daughter.

466
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,424
She must be back from Jeju Island.

467
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,885
-Yes.
-Did you talk to her?

468
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,428
Yes.

469
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,597
-What did she say?
-She gets it.

470
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,474
She backed off that easily?

471
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,392
Yes.

472
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:56,396
Enough with short answers. Elaborate.

473
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,649
How can she easily end it
when she's pregnant with your child?

474
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:02,944
Come on.

475
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,572
Because she's pregnant.

476
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,740
It makes more sense for her to cling on

477
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:08,825
since she's pregnant.

478
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,119
She's not that kind of woman.

479
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,583
Then what kind of woman
has a child with a married man?

480
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,836
Although, I'm still not sure
who started it.

481
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,508
Am I wrong?

482
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:29,345
Not being able to conceive
was why she got divorced.

483
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,390
That's why she only cares about the child.

484
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,268
I'm not her priority.

485
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,147
Does this upset you?

486
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,400
Of course not.

487
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,738
Since it's over between you,
don't mention my name to her.

488
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:49,449
I don't want people to know
she stole my man.

489
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,870
-It's humiliating.
-Don't worry.

490
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,040
-Can I trust you on this?
-Sure.

491
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,167
Look me in the face and say it.

492
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,255
It takes two to tango, you know.

493
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,674
She cut me off without hesitation

494
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,176
once she found out you knew.

495
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,721
Has the mighty Pan Sa-hyeon
fallen for a divorcée?

496
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,814
What about your socks?

497
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,946
You're completely out of it.

498
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,166
MANAGER

499
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,170
Yes, it's me.

500
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,964
Did you just get up?

501
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,091
Yes, I went to bed a little late.

502
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,593
The radio show writer
sent over some questions

503
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,346
so that you can avoid those
you don't want to answer.

504
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,848
Are there any
that are of a sensitive matter?

505
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,060
Not really, but I forwarded you the email.

506
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,688
-I'll check.
-Sure thing.

507
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,816
What's the writer's name?

508
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:08,569
Lee Si-eun.
She seems to be on the older side.

509
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,654
Got it.

510
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,874
HAE-RYUN

511
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,965
Yes?

512
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:32,010
It's me. You're still home, right?

513
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,805
-Yes.
-Can I come upstairs?

514
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,063
-Is Hyang-gi in bed?
-As if she'd sleep in.

515
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,481
She isn't coming out.

516
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,900
She went to the bookstore
to get some fresh air.

517
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,528
-How's the CSAT prep?
-I don't know.

518
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:53,364
I'm too embarrassed and guilty
to even ask.

519
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,284
There's no reason for you to feel guilty.

520
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:06,294
The moving company will come by later
to pick up my things.

521
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,588
Are you officially moving in with her?

522
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:11,090
No, I just needed a few things.

523
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:14,594
Take them with you.
Your clothes are in storage.

524
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,906
Head in first. I need to make a call.

525
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,324
Sure.

526
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,458
-It's me, Mother.
-Hi.

527
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,835
When are you going to meet that woman?

528
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,089
I'll have to wait until
Sa-hyeon lays the bridge for us.

529
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,049
He said he ended things yesterday.

530
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:56,385
Can't you ask for her number
and call her yourself?

531
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:00,473
-All right.
-You know this shouldn't be dragged out.

532
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,682
I'm aware of that.

533
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,768
Sa-hyeon told me that he'd sever contact

534
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:07,396
and asked me
to check on the baby in his place.

535
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,234
You can imagine where his heart lies.

536
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,778
I talked this over with his father,

537
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,822
but she'll be out of his mind in no time.

538
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:19,033
Can that be possible
when the baby is growing every day?

539
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,328
Exactly.
That's why you should get pregnant soon.

540
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,581
I'm definitely in no mood
to conceive a child,

541
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,001
but what can I do when I promised?

542
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,256
We'll make sure
to wrap things up on our end.

543
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,550
Have her move as soon as possible.

544
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,635
Sure.

545
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,609
Shouldn't you at least
text the children from time to time?

546
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,280
I doubt they'd like that.

547
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,782
Do you expect them
to treat you the same way?

548
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,368
It's called parental love.

549
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:06,038
Don't you care about
your children anymore?

550
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,040
Does falling in love do that to you?

551
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,836
All right, fine.
But they're at a sensitive age--

552
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,130
Yet you still pushed for the divorce!

553
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,720
Take your things with you
once and for all.

554
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,517
Please meet with my mother.

555
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:30,104
I have already told my parents about you.

556
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,984
I'll be more at ease
knowing you're in her care.

557
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:38,070
I won't have to come by as often that way.

558
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,739
I won't put you under any stress.

559
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,616
What did they say?

560
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,452
I bet they're appalled.

561
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,788
Not because of you, but because of me.

562
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,083
My mom isn't cold-hearted.

563
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:54,378
She claims that raising boys
made her lose her affectionate side,

564
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,757
but my parents are as good as your own.

565
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,093
If my mom had been alive,

566
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,137
she would have fainted from the news.

567
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,890
Don't only focus on one side of things.

568
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,101
You win some while losing some,

569
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,773
and lose some while winning some.

570
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,418
You brush your teeth often,
especially for a guy.

571
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,045
Yes, ever since I quit smoking.

572
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,093
Shouldn't the taste in your mouth
seem less unpleasant?

573
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,637
I brush my teeth whenever I want to smoke.

574
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,140
-They'll wear away.
-That reminds me.

575
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,810
Did you ask your mother-in-law
about the blind date?

576
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,938
Oh, that.
She doesn't seem interested right now.

577
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:57,441
Of course. It's too soon even for men.

578
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,735
Would one actually feel that way though?

579
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:03,447
When he lost a wife 20 years his senior
after a lifetime with her?

580
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,116
That depends on the marriage.

581
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,159
If they had a good one,

582
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:10,079
it's only normal to want to stay single.

583
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,290
I can't tell
if you're conservative or loyal.

584
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,584
I try to have common sense.
That's how I try to be.

585
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,175
The more I get to know him,
the better he seems.

586
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,531
I wonder what my daughter's hobbies are.

587
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:52,121
I should have at least learned her name.

588
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:55,458
Yu-sin, horseback riding has to be
the best physical exercise.

589
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,752
It's all I needed to lose belly fat.

590
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,463
What did I tell you?

591
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:04,675
If I had started sooner,
I'd have a killer body.

592
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,929
You actually do.

593
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,223
Not my legs though.

594
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,643
Still.

595
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,688
Do you know what
"getting rich in your sleep" means?

596
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,856
Yes.

597
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,776
Doing as I say is just that.

598
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:27,073
-But I didn't get rich.
-Keep following my lead.

599
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,241
I'd prefer something else though.

600
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,995
-A cake?
-No.

601
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,289
A purse?

602
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,416
A car.

603
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,503
The thing that you drive around?

604
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,550
-Do you want a new car?
-Yes.

605
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,598
Sure. Consider it
your next year's birthday gift.

606
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,518
-I'm only kidding.
-But maybe you somewhat meant it.

607
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,685
How did you know?

608
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,480
But I really am joking.

609
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,529
She grew up to be a fine young lady.

610
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:14,829
It'd be nice to
go horseback riding together.

611
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,667
-You've got everything?
-Yes.

612
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,380
Hello.

613
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,549
Hello.

614
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,219
Did you already go out there?

615
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,179
Yes.

616
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,515
-I'll see you again some other time.
-Sure.

617
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,981
-Wasn't it great, Hyang-gi?
-It was.

618
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,900
Please tell me we're eating out too.

619
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,402
Of course.

620
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,789
My gosh.

621
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,298
I thought you'd have already left.

622
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,091
There wasn't much to do today.

623
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:10,926
I had something to say.

624
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,099
You saw Dr. Shin?

625
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,727
-Yes.
-Where?

626
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,068
Did you perhaps skip lunch today?

627
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,820
Why would I?

628
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,907
Do you see him now?

629
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,284
No, it was only for a second.

630
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,369
How so?

631
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,080
Was he clearly visible?

632
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,291
No, not like that.

633
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,210
How was his hair?

634
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,428
You must have been seeing things.

635
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,888
That really wasn't the case.

636
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,974
I'm not some weak old lady, you know.

637
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,519
I'm much stronger than you are.

638
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,062
Why didn't you talk to him then?

639
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,980
Ask him why he was on the floor.

640
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:08,359
It was brief,
and I couldn't bring myself to talk.

641
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,152
There's no such thing as ghosts.

642
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,321
Besides, his soul rests at the temple.

643
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:16,200
Still, I'm too terrified
to work here anymore, so I quit.

644
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:17,493
You're quitting?

645
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,246
-Yes.
-Unbelievable.

646
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,624
How is that a reasonable excuse?

647
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,961
Why haven't I been able to spot him then?

648
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,088
Look for him. He must be around here.

649
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,881
But I was petrified.

650
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,093
I'll give you a raise.

651
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,808
-Beef tartare bibimbap.
-Me too.

652
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,185
Get something else, Mom.

653
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,521
Right. I'll have
the hot stone pot bibimbap.

654
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,730
Sure.

655
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,360
It's always nice to enjoy culture.

656
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,737
-Especially the movies.
-Right.

657
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:58,284
Your dad asked if you were
preparing for your CSAT.

658
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,706
Did he call?

659
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,710
No, he came by during the day
to move the rest of his stuff out.

660
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,464
Would you like his old study?
It's nice and spacious.

661
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,176
I'm good.
Let's just turn it into a closet.

662
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,097
You should use it as your study
so we can study there too.

663
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,974
Sure thing.

664
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,902
Look at it enjoying the carrots.

665
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,279
Where in Jeju did you like?

666
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,405
Everywhere.

667
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,198
I doubt you climbed Mount Halla.

668
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,076
Of course I couldn't.
Not on a three-day trip

669
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,120
where I spent the first and third
in flight.

670
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,332
-I bet you climbed it though.
-I did.

671
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,710
I'd love to go back there
with you sometime.

672
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,046
For about ten days?

673
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,173
A month-long stay would be nice.

674
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,716
Someday.

675
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,510
It could be years for all I know.

676
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,893
How about a one-day hiking trip then?

677
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,187
I'd love to try that in Korea.

678
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,481
Go with the ladies you went to Jeju with.

679
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,524
Is that not possible?

680
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,361
Even though it's a simple hiking trip?

681
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:20,866
Someone will hear you.

682
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:32,044
LAWYER PAN SA-HYEON

683
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:36,048
-Hello?
-I'll meet your mother.

684
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,927
Did you eat something today?

685
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,096
Some fruit.

686
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,306
Can I drop by?
I'm about to leave the office.

687
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,558
Please don't.

688
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,937
Ask her when and where,
and get back to me.

689
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,563
Any day will be fine.

690
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,734
-All right.
-Bye.

691
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,495
All right. But you'll
make the introduction and leave.

692
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,122
What will you talk about?

693
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,498
Don't worry.

694
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,792
I won't be cruel since she's pregnant.

695
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:15,254
Blood may be thicker than water
but not for me in this case.

696
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:18,173
Your actions led to
a lot of people shedding tears.

697
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,675
You didn't cry though.

698
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:21,009
Stop talking back.

699
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,138
You're right,

700
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:27,349
but thinking about my child
rejuvenates me.

701
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,601
Hye-ryung will soon be with child,

702
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:32,813
so you'll be overflowing with energy.

703
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,150
Don't grow any older
so that you can enjoy seeing them grow up.

704
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,236
I aged five years due to
this whole ordeal. Your father too.

705
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,697
They say how your children turn out
are at random

706
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:46,326
and any child makes your life hell
at least once.

707
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,036
It all started with Hye-ryung.

708
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,874
If only you had listened to us.

709
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,417
I know.

710
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,461
You haven't fully come to your senses yet.

711
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,046
There's no need to think that way.

712
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,799
In fact, my head is screwed on too right.

713
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,926
They all fell for that
silver tongue of yours.

714
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:07,473
Both Hye-ryung and the woman
I haven't met yet. What's her name?

715
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:10,267
Your son is an honest man.
That's my best trait.

716
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:14,104
I haven't been with many women
in my life. Less than five.

717
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,231
I'm a helpless romantic.

718
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:19,026
Was it your honesty
that led to Hye-ryung coughing up blood?

719
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,277
Be honest again and--

720
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,695
Mom, please.

721
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,573
You used the blood defense too many times.

722
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,493
Can you blame me?

723
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:31,914
Anyway, be like a mother to her.
I really need you to be.

724
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,707
I asked what her name was.

725
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,754
Your father must be here. Bye.

726
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:41,048
-Mom, meet her alone!
-Sure.

727
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,008
Who was that?

728
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,843
Byeol-hui's mom.

729
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:47,221
Byeol-hui's mom? What was it about?

730
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,644
Undress me.

731
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,773
Are you too tired to undo your buttons?

732
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,778
You've gotten old, haven't you?

733
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:05,739
Tell Sa-hyeon
to make an appointment with her soon.

734
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:07,658
She'll have to agree to it first.

735
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,451
But we're going to buy her a house.

736
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,538
And we'll tell her that when we meet.

737
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,457
-It's a suggestion.
-Even tomorrow would be fine.

738
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:18,418
If it were you,
could you easily agree to this meeting?

739
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,171
If I'm not guilty, yes.

740
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,384
She'd jump at the chance
if she wanted something.

741
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:27,844
Where are you going?

742
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,639
Don't you want honey water?

743
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,613
Are you upset about the hike?

744
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,079
Many people in Korea go hiking, you know.

745
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,292
If you run into someone you know,
you can say I'm a cousin.

746
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:01,295
It's better to be cautious.

747
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,590
We do nothing together
apart from horseback riding.

748
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:09,303
What do you mean? We dine often together.

749
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:12,889
I told you not to expect too much from me.

750
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,683
Dad must have left this.

751
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:43,689
I don't want it.

752
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,943
I'll use it to pay
for another month of classes.

753
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,364
You can keep taking extra classes.

754
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,408
You'll soon be in sixth grade now.

755
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,536
You should use that
to pay for your college tuition.

756
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:59,121
Save up.

757
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,331
Money did nothing wrong.

758
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,503
I'll find extra work.

759
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,803
Mom, is there a writer job
that I can work part-time?

760
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,097
I have money saved up.

761
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,724
Don't obsess over money.

762
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:27,941
If anyone's interested,
don't hesitate to date him.

763
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:31,903
That's wrong. I really think it is.

764
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,531
She's our mom.

765
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,452
What about Dad then?

766
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,579
What he did was wrong.

767
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:44,207
Does that mean Mom should retaliate
by doing the same thing?

768
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,878
Yes. She should show Dad
that she's capable of dating.

769
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,755
-Someone decent.
-That's enough.

770
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,466
Don't move me in a direction
I'm not willing to go.

771
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,844
I'll pray for a great man
to show himself to you.

772
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:59,097
What happens if that great guy
marries Mom?

773
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,224
What will happen to us?

774
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:06,229
You have me and I have you.

775
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,857
-We--
-I said that's enough.

776
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,651
I don't mind this at all.
I'm actually at ease.

777
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,362
I'm going to make it big.

778
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:17,199
There's nothing I can possibly want
more than your success.

779
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:20,786
It'll be my biggest joy
and will make me proud.

780
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,663
I'm also just grateful
that you're both healthy.

781
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,457
I thank God for that.

782
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:45,579
Are you there?

783
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,307
Sleep properly in bed.

784
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,726
What time is it?

785
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,853
It's 6:05 a.m.

786
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:56,107
Look at you, old man.
You don't sleep in anymore.

787
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:59,694
I was brought out of it.
I guess I felt your presence.

788
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:01,821
I'm thirsty.

789
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,915
Why crash here when you have a nice place?

790
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,341
Yours is just as nice.

791
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,802
Compared to yours, mine's like a hut.

792
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:26,680
I don't exactly own it though.

793
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,685
I drank until two in the morning.

794
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,062
-Were you at Maman?
-Yes.

795
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,273
What's for breakfast?

796
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,067
-A salad.
-Was it delivered?

797
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,319
Yes. It's not too bad.

798
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,363
As if any salad is.

799
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,073
When did you become a herbivore?

800
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,203
A salad won't do.

801
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,040
Can I get a change of clothes?

802
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:55,875
Will my suit fit you?

803
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,629
We're about the same size.
Something casual will do.

804
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:02,757
This place has gotten better.

805
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:05,468
They've been losing customers
to the Seocho hotel.

806
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,470
This is what I call a healthy competition.

807
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:11,307
Potato wedges remind me of Saint-Moritz.

808
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,892
The truffle burger there was delicious.

809
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,021
You know what's delicious, right?

810
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,355
Do you think I'm some animal?

811
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:20,775
I guess even animals know
what tastes good.

812
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,279
Let's spend Christmas in Saint-Moritz.

813
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,655
They're fully booked.

814
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,532
Money can solve everything.

815
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,618
The slopes in Korea
are too short and crowded.

816
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,662
I'm sick of long plane rides.

817
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:36,249
Since it's winter, it'll take 14 hours
with a layover in Vienna.

818
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,086
I hear flights to Europe
will only take hours in a few years.

819
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,755
We could grab lunch in Paris

820
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,256
and see a musical in London.

821
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,508
Nam Ga-bin is in a new musical.

822
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,344
I read the article too.

823
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,389
I bet you'll go to one of the shows.

824
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,350
-How did you know?
-I know you.

825
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,811
Of course I should go to congratulate her.

826
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,606
Isn't it cruel
after how you broke her heart?

827
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,067
The wise learn from heartaches

828
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,694
while a fool crumbles.

829
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:10,617
It's not easy to find
an appropriate woman to marry at your age.

830
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,452
To find one that clicks, I mean.

831
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:15,747
I mentioned this before,
but at least date someone.

832
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,625
Whose profile
do you have for me this time?

833
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:19,959
Are you interested?

834
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,381
I played golf with some friends recently

835
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:28,051
and the oldest one there
is a divorcé of three years.

836
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:31,596
Those years did a number on him.

837
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,891
This is the end for you too.

838
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:37,310
Your clock will stop in your mid-fifties.

839
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:41,523
Like Dad said, a man needs a woman
by his side at old age.

840
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,233
That friend showed me why.

841
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:47,779
Does that mean all women stay young?

842
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:49,739
They're good at looking after themselves.

843
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,283
I feel bad seeing you grow old alone.

844
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,660
It gets to me.

845
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:56,704
I'm grateful for your concern,
but many live alone these days.

846
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:00,708
The number of men and women
living alone will only grow.

847
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,335
But you're too much of a catch.

848
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:04,921
Why waste a perfectly good body
and let it rot?

849
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,715
Take your own advice
and get me a niece or a nephew.

850
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,718
Men can easily reproduce even at 60.

851
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,178
That's cruel on the child.

852
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,514
-Rather than a dad--
-It gets a grandpa.

853
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:19,102
I hated how Dad
was older than the other fathers.

854
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,562
You're going to marry, right?

855
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,480
After enjoying life a little longer.

856
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:24,274
For how long?

857
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:28,820
After I've had my share of fun,
I'll find someone 20 years…

858
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:30,697
Okay, 20 seems a little harsh.

859
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,825
I'll find someone
at least ten years younger than me.

860
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:36,453
That's why Nam Ga-bin won't do.

861
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:37,912
But you two click.

862
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,539
Yes, we click emotionally.

863
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:40,790
You're the worst.

864
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:44,043
And women love that.
They can't get enough of me.

865
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:47,088
You could be mistaken.
It's not you they're after.

866
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:49,424
But my background?

867
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:15,074
I made Pyeongan-styled dumplings.

868
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,202
Remember the housewarming party?

869
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:20,872
Let me know if you can't stomach it
and I'll prepare something else.

870
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:25,126
-Don't tell the chairman about this.
-Of course not.

871
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:32,008
What kind of gold-digger did he fall for?

872
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,789
Where are we headed?

873
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:04,791
Queen Hotel.

874
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:08,002
Shouldn't we meet
closer to your parents' place?

875
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,338
My mom had business in Seoul anyway.

876
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,676
Did you make do with fruits again?

877
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,094
I'm good.

878
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:18,513
Aren't you craving
spicy food like tteokbokki?

879
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:20,848
Eating too much spicy food
during pregnancy

880
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:23,101
can lead to the baby
having congenital fever.

881
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:25,687
Gosh. That can't happen.

882
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:28,982
I should look up food
you shouldn't eat as well.

883
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,484
The list is longer
than I expected it to be.

884
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,736
My mother craved meat the most

885
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,822
when she was pregnant with me.

886
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:38,866
What about you?
Do you know what your mother liked?

887
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:42,495
I never got to ask.

888
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,831
I don't think I was fussy though.

889
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:47,417
Your morning sickness
could point to a fussy kid.

890
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:51,421
Fussy or yielding,

891
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:53,506
I'll love it with all my heart.

892
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:59,846
Remind yourself to walk in the sun
during the day.

893
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,889
I hear it helps you sleep soundly.

894
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,267
I'm going to.

895
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,108
What is it?

896
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,027
Nothing.

897
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,696
I missed you, that's all.

898
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:23,911
How about Bada, as in "sea"?
For the baby's nickname.

899
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:28,625
In a dream, it came as a pig in the sea.

900
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:31,961
We also conceived it
when we were at Gangneung by the sea.

901
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:34,672
The waves crashed louder than usual.

902
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,591
Don't you agree?

903
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,888
It should have a heart
as big as the ocean.

904
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:45,350
Agreed.

905
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:53,066
Bada, we're on our way
to meet your grandma.

906
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:57,362
Once you're born, your grandma
will probably love you the most.

907
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:58,696
Look forward to it.

908
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,576
Don't I have a nice voice?

909
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:08,790
Meanwhile,
your mom's voice is clear and feminine.

910
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,878
Are you a boy or a girl?

911
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,384
-Do you want a daughter?
-Do you want a son?

912
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:22,261
I'd love to kill two birds with one stone,

913
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,638
but that's not the case.

914
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:25,473
That's the worst metaphor ever.

915
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,141
Okay, I take it back.

916
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:32,563
Forget I said that, Bada.

917
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,857
I'll only speak elegantly like your mom.

918
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:39,195
-Do you enjoy classical music?
-Yes.

919
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:41,489
My brother said Bach
is good for pregnancies.

920
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:48,996
BACH
"AIR ON THE G STRING"

921
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:01,426
I'm happy,

922
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:03,428
but I shouldn't be.

923
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:52,477
Does your mother know how old I am?

924
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:55,938
I didn't tell her to keep her unbiased.

925
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:57,857
She should see you for who you are.

926
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:02,403
I'll leave once I make the introduction.

927
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:03,863
My mother asked me to.

928
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:09,243
She's not one
to make people uncomfortable, so…

929
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,161
There she is.

930
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,050
This is my mother.

931
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:27,512
Nice to meet you.

932
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:30,890
Please sit.

933
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,318
An older woman again?

934
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:47,114
What would you like?

935
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,367
Anything except coffee.

936
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:51,953
Would red ginseng tea be too strong?

937
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:58,584
What's your name?

938
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:02,713
I haven't told her.

939
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,883
It's Song Won. Song is my last name.

940
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:11,681
She majored in Chinese
and works as a translator.

941
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:13,933
Many of her works have been published.

942
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:16,185
How are you feeling?

943
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:19,188
I'm good.

944
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,942
We're good here. You may go.

945
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:26,904
Sure.

946
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:37,999
I'll pay for that table over there.

947
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:45,423
How did you two meet?

948
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:47,592
Sa-hyeon hasn't told me much.

949
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,762
We met at a gym.

950
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,180
Please talk casually.

951
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:59,270
Also, I'm a little older than him.

952
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:01,022
You seem three or four years older.

953
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:05,902
Is there more of a gap?

954
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:11,699
My Korean age is 42.

955
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:20,124
But this is your first pregnancy?

956
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:29,884
What did your doctor say?

957
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:32,053
Is the baby all right?

958
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,306
For now, yes.

959
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,518
If only it was your second.

960
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:57,536
So, what are you going to do?

961
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:01,290
How did feelings form between you two?

962
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:03,834
Is what Sa-hyeon said true?

963
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:07,213
He said there wasn't
any kind of relationship.

964
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:12,426
We met from time to time
to talk about life.

965
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:16,097
I was more like a counselor.

966
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,057
In what aspect?

967
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:21,894
I doubt he had any issues.

968
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:26,941
You know how marriage is
in its early stages

969
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:29,026
when both parties try to compromise.

970
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,948
In the end, I guess it's all my fault.

971
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:35,992
Do you know about his wife's situation?

972
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:38,744
Yes.

973
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:43,374
Everyone's suffering because of my son.

974
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:48,462
Why haven't you got married?

975
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:50,673
You seem like a catch.

976
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:54,885
I actually was.

977
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,138
"Was"?

978
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,473
Yes.

979
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:04,228
I got divorced after five years

980
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:07,523
because I couldn't get pregnant.

981
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:10,568
Then…

982
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,797
How could this be?

983
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:41,932
Ms. Kim.

984
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:45,686
Ms. Kim!

985
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:47,563
What is it?

986
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:22,890
Is something wrong?

987
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:25,226
The helper said she's been seeing

988
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:27,103
Dr. Shin for the past two days.

989
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,021
If he found out…

990
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,565
It will be like you have another ally.

991
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:34,985
You can meet with her
and go out to have delicious food

992
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:36,862
once your morning sickness subsides.

993
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,072
I can do that.

994
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:39,365
You ingrate!

995
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:41,784
You have a perfectly beautiful wife,

996
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:44,870
yet you go and have an affair?
How could you?

997
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,331
-Here…
-We didn't order this.

998
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:48,833
It's from that gentleman.

999
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:51,836
I'm a fan.

1000
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:55,965
Thank you for the medicine, Mun-ho.

1001
01:08:56,715 --> 01:08:58,050
What are you still doing up?

1002
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:59,176
Listen to me, Pan Mun-ho.

1003
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,554
I'm going to be a guest
on a radio show today.

1004
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:02,847
Which one?

1005
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:05,432
Boo Hye-ryung's Love, Memories, and Music.

1006
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:10,521
