00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:49,215
EPISODE 4

2
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,550
What happened?

3
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,802
Are you offering condolences?

4
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,346
How could she die
during childbirth in this day and age?

5
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,681
An amniotic fluid embolism.

6
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,641
An amniotic fluid embolism?

7
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,811
Your flesh gets torn during childbirth.

8
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:06,149
Then the amniotic fluid enters
the bloodstream and clogs it.

9
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,943
There was nothing they could do.

10
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,533
MOXIBUSTION WITH MUGWORT

11
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,165
I can't believe this.
Is this even effective?

12
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,043
The area between your chest
and diaphragm can be an issue.

13
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,088
This area here.

14
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,965
But it'll get hot.

15
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,592
It'll just sting. That's all.

16
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,178
It's smaller than a grain of rice.
It won't burn you.

17
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,523
Her friend is here.

18
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,912
REST IN PEACE

19
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,947
Gosh! That's hot!

20
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,574
Come on. Be a man.

21
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,785
Forget it. As if this would fix anything.

22
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:41,703
Guys, help.

23
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,163
It's too hot.

24
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,080
Hurry.

25
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,541
Dad, you know Mom always knows best.

26
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:49,085
She's right.
Who else would do this for you?

27
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:50,044
But it's hot.

28
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,922
Come on.
I'll make U-ram get on top of you.

29
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:53,840
Hold on.

30
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,559
I should have counted my blessings.

31
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,744
-Hello.
-Hello.

32
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,996
Goodbye.

33
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,041
Is Dong-ma here too?

34
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,751
He just left.

35
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,629
This is Dong-ma's older brother.

36
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:36,257
We met before during Ga-bin's performance.
I was with Ms. Sa.

37
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,427
Right.

38
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,180
Are you here
to offer condolences to someone?

39
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,598
We weren't close,

40
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,475
but she was going to teach me Chinese.

41
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,352
Goodness. Do you mean Song Won?

42
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,064
Yes.

43
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,611
Can you turn on the lights?

44
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,143
-Is this all we have?
-Yes.

45
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,561
Should I look for more?

46
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,314
Forget it. I know we don't have
pre-made side dishes.

47
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,566
We always have them fresh.

48
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,195
Where did she go
and leave me behind to starve?

49
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,780
Her close friend passed away.

50
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,158
How old was she?

51
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,246
-Forty-two.
-She died too early.

52
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,374
Aren't you hungry?

53
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,583
Not really.

54
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,714
So you slept at Ji-a's last night?

55
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,342
What did you guys talk about?

56
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,428
Were you invited?

57
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,723
I was checking on Ji-a.

58
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,851
I was drunk, cold,
and too lazy to go home. That's why.

59
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,519
Did you sleep next to Pi-young?

60
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,645
No.

61
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,773
I didn't tell Pi-young the details.

62
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,942
I call her by her name.

63
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,193
You do?

64
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,654
Yes. We found out everything

65
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,032
during Hye-ryung's press conference.

66
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,658
When I was on her radio show,

67
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,827
she seemed like a nice person.

68
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,456
We don't show her any respect
since she doesn't deserve it.

69
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,666
Don't judge her
before getting to know her.

70
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,877
Everything she said was not true.

71
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,086
It's the opposite.

72
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,256
First, she agreed
to divorce her then-husband.

73
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,259
Once she got her share,
she had that press conference.

74
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,553
She got Cheongdam Villa and the alimony.

75
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,930
Since her in-laws are well-off,

76
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,932
they let her have everything.

77
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,602
She even hugged
and wished him well before parting.

78
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,936
-That woman.
-Really?

79
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,229
Yes.

80
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,901
You have no idea
how two-faced she is, do you?

81
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,281
And the baby?

82
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,700
Her in-laws will raise him.

83
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,620
I feel bad for him.

84
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,539
Won even passed away with her eyes open.

85
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,131
We'll be Bada's aunts
and give him so much love

86
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,342
though it won't be as great as Won's.

87
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,760
Thank you for saying that.

88
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,054
Give us time, and you'll realize

89
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,391
how close we were with Won.

90
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,522
We even visited her brother
in Jeju Island.

91
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,982
-Is that so?
-Jeong-bin won't feel

92
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,485
too lonely then.

93
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,946
Is that the baby's name?

94
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,657
Yes.

95
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,284
Pan Jeong-bin.

96
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,495
Did Hye-ryung stop by?

97
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,957
I think she stopped by
for a minute last night.

98
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,001
-Did you guys not see her?
-It's a funeral after all.

99
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,130
All the more reason
why she should have met with you.

100
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,521
This is why we should be kindhearted

101
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,648
and not sin.

102
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,360
Use this pain-relief patch for now.
An ambulance will come at 9 a.m.

103
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,570
Did you remove his photos?

104
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:26,821
Tell her to do it.

105
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,532
She just won't. She's so stubborn.

106
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,828
-There she comes.
-Yu-sin.

107
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:34,996
In here.

108
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,459
How are you feeling?
Are you feeling any better?

109
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,295
Why didn't you cook beforehand?

110
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,839
-Are you that ill?
-Did you really not know?

111
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,800
-Don't lie through your teeth.
-You can't even cook?

112
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:48,801
Are you blind?

113
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,387
Skipping a few meals is good
when you're sick.

114
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,722
It's not like I have indigestion.

115
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,349
Did you burn incense for Father yet?

116
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,060
-No.
-Hurry up.

117
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,022
As soon as I recover,
we'll do it at a temple.

118
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,107
Despite carrying out seven 49-day rites,

119
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,775
he still hasn't left yet.

120
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,778
Do you really think holding another ritual

121
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,197
will give him peace?

122
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,532
-So you'll live with his spirit?
-Don't you want that?

123
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,702
I thought you were still madly in love.

124
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,287
I'd be happy if I were you.

125
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,788
Listen to your elders.

126
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,874
You're talking about my husband here.

127
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:24,128
These days, it's wiser
to listen to those who are younger.

128
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,463
Don't make me laugh!

129
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,633
Is that why I'm bedridden like this?

130
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,178
Who do you think makes more sense?

131
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,223
Are you a monk? A shaman?
Have you been possessed?

132
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,183
Some families live with their ancestors.

133
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,728
Father obviously doesn't want to leave.

134
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,980
You should accept what can't be changed.

135
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,608
It's only right for us
to live with him now.

136
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,110
Though he might not be leaving
because of a grudge.

137
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,447
As the man of the house, you choose.

138
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,867
If you can't stand the heat,
you should get out of the kitchen.

139
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:01,207
Mother, did you give Father
that same glare at the movies?

140
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,127
You could even give
a healthy person a heart attack.

141
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,089
You look so frightening.

142
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,882
You'll be the death of me.

143
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,133
When you were away,

144
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,928
she tried to get rid of Father's portrait.

145
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,721
That's when she fell.

146
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,140
-Right?
-No.

147
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,475
I was there, you know?

148
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,228
-What?
-I was there, ma'am.

149
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:28,192
Yu-sin, we should invite his spirit in
even if it's just for Ji-a's sake.

150
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,653
And apologize to him.

151
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,946
For what?

152
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,324
Should I be sorry for crying myself
to sleep every night?

153
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,661
Then should I move his portrait here?

154
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,079
That would be best.

155
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,123
Get out.

156
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,376
Get out!

157
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:51,090
I hope to see the baby as well next time.

158
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:54,594
Okay. Thank you for your understanding.

159
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,222
Good luck on the…
What was it called again?

160
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,517
Prenatal care. I'll call you.

161
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,852
Okay.

162
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,118
Song Won?

163
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:22,413
Yes. I've known her for over 20 years
ever since university.

164
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,956
She's really kind hearted.

165
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,249
She's an interpreter.

166
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,168
She'll be a good teacher.

167
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:39,305
I'm sorry for asking,
but what about the alimony?

168
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,766
I just took

169
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,726
what they offered.

170
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,137
Mom and Dad,

171
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,473
I'm doing okay.

172
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,977
Dong-ma and I
are going to get married soon.

173
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,229
Are you watching over me?

174
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,690
Please do.

175
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,408
Mr. Seo Dong-ma.

176
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,785
Coming.

177
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,269
Did you get enough sleep?

178
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,231
I prepared the ingredients
yesterday evening.

179
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,649
It only took three hours.

180
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,400
So you woke up at 5 a.m.

181
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,903
I shouldn't have asked for breakfast.

182
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,447
Writing scripts
is exhausting and a headache.

183
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,450
Cooking is fun. It's stress-relieving.

184
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,576
I'm glad.

185
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,911
Where are we headed?

186
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:50,996
It's up to you.

187
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,375
Thankfully, it's breezy and nice today.

188
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,918
There's a park nearby.

189
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,045
I thought about my place
if it was too cold.

190
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,798
Eating outdoors is tastier.

191
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,717
Do you like the sea or the mountains?

192
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,719
Both. What about you, Mr. Seo?

193
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,012
Valleys over seas.

194
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,056
So you prefer mountains.

195
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,309
If you can't call me by my name,
give me an endearing nickname.

196
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,477
An endearing nickname?

197
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,773
Is it too cheesy?
A typical nickname will do.

198
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,316
I'll give it some thought.

199
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,986
Aren't you better with names?

200
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,571
You gave our show a nickname too.

201
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,072
Si-eun.

202
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,783
The name suits you.

203
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,288
How about adding "my dear" to my name?

204
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,998
"My dear Seo Ban"?

205
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,169
You're surprisingly funny at times.

206
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,422
I heard women like men who are humorous.

207
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,591
Men like humorous women too.

208
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,717
Not me.

209
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,510
Why not?

210
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,513
I prefer women
who give off a warm feeling.

211
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,472
Just like you, Si-eun.

212
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,059
You always see the good in me.

213
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,561
You should take a nap.

214
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,980
Do you want some music?

215
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:02,484
Sweetie, we'll be sending off
your mom today.

216
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,446
Goodness. Our poor grandson.

217
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,947
REST IN PEACE

218
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,011
I will raise Jeong-bin

219
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,722
with all my heart.

220
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,310
I wish you didn't have to leave.

221
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:23,524
I wish you could stay with us.

222
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,333
It's my friend's birthday today.

223
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,960
We're having breakfast together.

224
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,587
Is it Mr. Seo's birthday?

225
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,056
All this only took three hours?

226
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,851
Yes. The soup may be bland.

227
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,644
I don't eat salty food anyway.

228
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,896
Let's eat. Thank you for the meal.

229
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,231
I hope no one sees us.

230
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,609
They'll think it's a picnic.

231
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,861
On a winter morning?

232
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,654
November isn't winter.

233
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,159
It definitely feels like fall today.

234
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,787
You're right.
There are no clouds, and it's warm.

235
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,540
Even the sky is congratulating you.

236
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,711
-Congratulating who?
-My dear Seo Ban.

237
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,841
Hold on.

238
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,638
Let me take one from above.

239
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,809
Show me your photo as a kid.

240
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,144
After we eat.

241
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,738
It's a bit cold.

242
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,074
I'm not good with hot food.
This is perfect.

243
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,455
It's seasoned just right.

244
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,381
This seaweed soup
is much tastier than my housekeeper's.

245
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,092
Did she make some for your birthday?

246
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,510
She doesn't know when it is.

247
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,220
She sometimes makes seaweed soup.

248
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,764
How could she not know?
Didn't you hire her ages ago?

249
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,307
I just never told her.

250
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,276
I knew it.

251
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,863
-What do you mean?
-I knew you'd be a wonderful cook.

252
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,450
It's not just tasty. It draws you in.

253
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,952
I can feel your love.

254
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,537
This is only a small meal.

255
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,621
It's a feast.

256
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,087
WE OFFER OUR CONDOLENCES

257
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:51,797
Won…

258
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,429
SEJIN GYEONGGI FUNERAL HOME

259
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:03,058
WE OFFER OUR CONDOLENCES

260
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,801
SECRETARY YOO

261
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,512
-Yes?
-Hello, sir.

262
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,430
Yes?

263
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,100
-I couldn't find you at home.
-I'm outside.

264
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,645
Did my brother ask you to do something?

265
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,688
Yes. He told me to bring something to you.

266
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,607
Where are you? I'll go there right now.

267
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,942
I'm a bit far.

268
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,985
It'll take 10 to 20 minutes
if you're in Gangnam.

269
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,278
I'm at the South Pole.

270
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,614
-South Pole?
-Yes.

271
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,658
Is that the name of a restaurant?

272
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,284
I wanted to see the aurora borealis.

273
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,162
Hurry over. I'll be waiting.

274
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,164
-I'm sorry but--
-You can't come?

275
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,167
Mr. Seo asked me
to give this to you in person.

276
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,836
Why? I doubt he bought me a car.

277
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,464
I need to obey his commands.

278
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,594
You can be mischievous.

279
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,222
Ever since my mother died,

280
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,058
this is the best birthday meal I ever had.

281
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,519
Did your stepmother
never make you anything?

282
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:14,231
If you were me, would you have wanted
to have her food on your birthday?

283
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,816
I know my father is to blame

284
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,901
and that my stepmother cares about me.

285
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,319
But?

286
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,612
I feel uncomfortable.

287
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,198
I like things to be natural.

288
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,158
Look at how natural we are.

289
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,119
We've known each other
for half of our lifetime.

290
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,829
We began working together at 31.

291
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,206
But I had no idea. Only you recognized me.

292
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,000
We'd just say hi in the hallways.

293
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,085
How did you feel when we became a team?

294
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,169
I loved it.

295
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,714
But there was one thing.

296
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,259
I wanted to give you caviar,
but I couldn't just give it to you.

297
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,553
Is that why you gave out dozens of them?

298
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,180
Goodness.

299
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,852
Even the hotel breakfast coupons
and performance tickets?

300
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,607
In any case, I was happy to do it.

301
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,860
I'm truly touched.

302
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,863
What do you want? Just say the word.

303
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,698
-Gangneung.
-You want to go there?

304
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,074
Yes. Right now.

305
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,660
But today is a bit--

306
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,746
The Yeongdong Expressway
is empty right now.

307
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,664
We'll return before 4 p.m.

308
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,916
I told the kids
I'd be home after breakfast.

309
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,126
Let's all go together.

310
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,836
They'll like that.

311
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,379
Maybe some other time.

312
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:24,301
I'd love to play baseball with U-ram.
We could practice pitching.

313
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,218
Maybe next time?

314
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,971
Ji-a wanted to join too.

315
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,852
Do you brew your own coffee?

316
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,855
Only when my brother visits.
He has a luxurious taste.

317
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:40,650
Regardless of how luxurious it may be,
it definitely smells better.

318
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,653
Do you think about happiness
from time to time?

319
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:47,908
No one in this world
wishes to be miserable.

320
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,577
This is nice.

321
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,997
I'm happy. That's how I feel.

322
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,046
I've never had
breakfast outside like this.

323
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,965
I'm happy too.

324
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,760
Right. Show me your photo.

325
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:14,726
Goodness.

326
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,728
Do I look similar?

327
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,021
Pretty much.

328
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:19,898
When was this?

329
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,442
What about your fifth-grade photos?

330
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,821
There are none. My mother never took any.

331
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,240
She was always too depressed

332
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,992
to take photos of her son.

333
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,337
-Let's take one.
-I'm a mess right now.

334
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,183
-He wanted you to give this to me?
-Yes, sir.

335
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,269
Thank you. It must have been heavy.

336
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,646
I parked nearby. Goodbye, then.

337
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,482
Goodbye.

338
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,571
The Seo brothers
are so generous with things.

339
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,288
Yes?

340
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,664
I just gave it to him, sir.

341
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,208
-Who was he with?
-A woman.

342
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,293
Twenties? Thirties?

343
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,672
Maybe forties or fifties.

344
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,007
Not him. Her.

345
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,508
Yes, her.

346
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,968
-Is this a joke?
-No, sir.

347
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,138
Were they chatting or taking a walk?

348
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,973
-They were drinking coffee.
-Outside?

349
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,725
Yes. Homemade coffee.

350
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,145
Did she seem like a designer or something?
Was she dressed stylishly?

351
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,564
-No, sir.
-Then?

352
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,565
She was plain.

353
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:51,865
What is this? Is he dating
an ordinary, middle-aged woman?

354
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:57,245
U-ram said he was going
to marry someone like his mom.

355
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,164
I can guarantee that'll change.

356
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:00,874
Not for me.

357
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:08,381
I told him I'd marry a guy
similar to my dad.

358
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,260
My toenails are so long.

359
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,472
I don't grow as quickly as my nails do.

360
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,018
-What's wrong?
-Do you remember

361
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:23,230
how heartbroken I was
when my mother passed away?

362
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,398
But I'm doing better now.

363
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,943
You tried hard to move on.

364
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,194
You're right.

365
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,279
If you try hard enough,

366
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:35,408
you can endure and overcome anything.
But it's easier said than done.

367
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,786
I understand. Even studying is hard.

368
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,412
That's relatively easy.

369
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,413
Really?

370
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,999
You just need to memorize things.

371
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,962
Plus, getting bad grades
doesn't mean you've failed in life.

372
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,382
And being the top student
doesn't mean you'll succeed.

373
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,636
What do you think true success in life is?

374
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:58,181
Maybe I should have read more.
I'm drawing a blank.

375
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,516
Tell me your thoughts.

376
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:01,893
You see,

377
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,063
overcoming myself
is the hardest thing to do.

378
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,399
I still struggle with it.

379
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,693
-You're too modest.
-I'm serious.

380
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,944
Give me an example.

381
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,321
I want to look at someone's flaws

382
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,658
and be able to understand
and forgive them.

383
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,953
-But it's not easy.
-Do I have many flaws?

384
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,331
You're pretty much perfect.

385
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,417
I have a favor to ask.

386
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,754
Even if your mom and dad disappoint you,

387
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:33,758
I hope you won't be too hurt
and still grow up well.

388
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,137
Our problems are ours, not yours.

389
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,516
No matter how turbulent things get,

390
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,893
you must keep living your own life.

391
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:47,564
That's not right.
Family should come first before success.

392
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,857
It's a bit tricky.

393
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,736
Let's say I struggled to raise you,
so I abandoned you.

394
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,529
What would you do?

395
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,699
Would you cry and be sad all your life?

396
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:03,038
That might be the answer
if that would make me come back.

397
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,206
But that's not the case.

398
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,417
Why would you say such a thing?

399
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,710
This is only an example.

400
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,629
It's important to accept the situation.

401
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,382
"My mom left and abandoned me."

402
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,427
Instead of being in despair
and losing hope forever,

403
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:21,222
you should brush it off,
be brave, and move on.

404
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,974
Right.

405
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,726
But it's easier said than done.

406
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,855
This is why achieving
true success in life is difficult.

407
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,068
If it were easy,
everyone would have succeeded.

408
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,028
Do you understand me?

409
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:41,117
True success isn't
about gaining fame and fortune.

410
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,287
That must be Dad.

411
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,383
I need to tell her one day.

412
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,222
I'd like to spend
some time with you today.

413
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,391
Doing what? I'm pretty busy, you know?

414
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,475
Still.

415
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,520
I hope you'll make time for me.

416
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,108
Let's see. I haven't gone
to a bookstore in a long time.

417
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,025
Okay.

418
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,652
Mom already has plans today.

419
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:16,986
Okay.

420
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,239
You can park next to my car.

421
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,913
Let me get the door.

422
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,623
That's okay.

423
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,750
What do you mean?

424
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,086
We're friends, you know?

425
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,139
Put this in my car.

426
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,725
I don't want to explain it all to my kids.

427
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,059
And don't forget the cake.

428
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,317
I'll carry these things
to your front door.

429
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,111
Just put them inside the car.

430
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,864
They'd be happy to come down.

431
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,866
Park U-ram.

432
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,368
-Come on.
-Park Hyang--

433
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,829
You're so mischievous.

434
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,581
Put them inside.

435
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,359
Happy birthday.

436
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,826
What kind of flower is this?
I've never seen this before.

437
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,746
They're Chinese peonies.
Simply, just peonies.

438
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,081
-Do you know what they symbolize?
-What?

439
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,666
A prince's dignity.

440
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,461
Classy men deserve them.

441
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,633
Thank you for enjoying my plain food.

442
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,928
You're right. That wasn't just any food.

443
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,679
It was your heart.

444
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,765
It's your love for me.

445
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,602
-Aren't I right?
-You should go.

446
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,689
They're my favorite flowers too.

447
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,486
I'll put the cake in the freezer
and give you some to try later.

448
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,655
I'd like to apologize to your brother.

449
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,241
He sent it for you, but I took it instead.

450
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,660
Do you really want me to go?

451
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,801
-Should I get out?
-No.

452
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,345
Are you going home or elsewhere?

453
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,639
-Wherever you want me to go.
-Then go home.

454
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,475
I'm doing charity work in the evening.

455
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,061
-What a meaningful birthday.
-I'll text you afterward.

456
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,587
I've never seen a cake this huge before.

457
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,171
It looks so elegant.

458
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,845
MS. SA PI-YOUNG

459
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,435
Hello? I was about to call you.
Where should we meet?

460
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,771
I'll call you at 5 p.m.
once I get to your house.

461
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,898
That's okay. Just give me the address.

462
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,525
I already told the host
my license plate number.

463
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,735
I see.

464
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,820
-I'll see you soon.
-Is there a dress code?

465
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,822
-No.
-Okay.

466
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:44,087
I was about to call you.

467
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,089
You sound unwell.

468
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:49,050
My manager will get there
by 5 p.m. and call you.

469
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,510
Take her car.

470
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:53,054
-Are you hospitalized?
-No.

471
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,265
I'll just drive there.

472
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,852
Will you? The navigation
to my house can be a bit off sometimes.

473
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,771
And people turn at the wrong corner.

474
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,023
Tell me your building's name,
and I'll look for it.

475
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,150
I'll bring you some side dishes.

476
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,236
You know I rarely eat at home.

477
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,865
An exorcism to send him away?

478
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,867
No.

479
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:18,746
He could possess the shaman
and tell everyone what happened.

480
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,714
LET'S SEE WHICH ONE OF US WILL WIN

481
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:30,883
I'll hold as many rituals as possible.

482
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,760
I won't leave alone.

483
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,928
I refuse to.

484
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,416
Has that geezer settled here for good?

485
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,514
You should rest on a Sunday.

486
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,266
The same goes for you.

487
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,186
But you're doing a good deed.

488
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,440
What did you have for lunch?

489
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:29,901
Nothing.

490
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,111
Why not? You must be hungry.

491
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,322
I had a filling breakfast, so I'm okay.

492
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:38,034
Right. I'm sure he had a birthday meal.

493
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,452
Is it far away?

494
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,536
No.

495
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,122
There's no traffic despite being a Sunday.

496
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,792
It's congested on Saturdays
due to all the weddings.

497
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,043
We'll be there soon.

498
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,629
Is this some kind of charity
for underprivileged kids?

499
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:52,298
I don't know the details either.

500
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,384
RICE

501
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:09,732
Si-eun is the most softhearted
and forgiving person I've ever known.

502
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,610
She will forgive me
if I sincerely apologize.

503
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,031
I'll talk to her once I get better.

504
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,745
Ban?

505
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,665
Ban.

506
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,751
Ban.

507
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,506
They say you never know
what life has in store for you.

508
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,091
It's all thanks to Hae-ryun.

509
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,470
I should stop hating him.

510
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,852
Gosh, that's hot!

511
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,019
That's hot!

512
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,833
It's a bit chilly, isn't it?

513
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,001
No.

514
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,295
It feels chilly to me.

515
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,589
Maybe you're coming down with something.

516
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,848
You spent a hefty sum yesterday.

517
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:25,808
It was Mr. Seo.

518
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,853
You must have done something good
in your previous life.

519
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,063
Aren't you getting married soon too?

520
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,192
Yu-sin is hesitant
because of his daughter.

521
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,320
Time will solve everything.

522
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,989
Spend the night here.

523
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,240
I'm here.

524
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,285
-Come to the first floor.
-Okay.

525
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,670
I thought you were ill.

526
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,755
I'm not.

527
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,090
Then…

528
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,136
What's going on?

529
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,327
It's not your birthday.

530
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,621
-No, it's not.
-Then what's the occasion?

531
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,790
Is it just us two?

532
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,960
We're at the parking lot.

533
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,003
Come to the first-floor lounge.

534
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,923
-Are you done?
-Yes, ma'am.

535
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,303
This is a villa.

536
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,349
-Yes.
-Is this a private fundraiser?

537
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,976
We'll know once we get there.

538
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,435
I'm here as a guest too.

539
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,043
She told us that it was your birthday.

540
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:17,712
Did you know, Si-eun?

541
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:19,922
No.

542
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,425
-How did you know?
-A gut feeling.

543
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,053
She has supernatural powers.

544
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,433
This must have taken all day.

545
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,726
Did you call a caterer?

546
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,810
Yes.

547
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,439
Are there enough candles?

548
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,566
Should I take out any or add more?

549
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,900
That's enough.

550
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,364
You've been good to us.

551
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,867
You've treated us so well.
That's why I prepared this.

552
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,205
-I had no idea.
-Me too. I only received a call.

553
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,207
I didn't do much. It was nothing.

554
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,379
I've been on several shows,
and you're one-of-a-kind.

555
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,090
Men nowadays are so cheap.

556
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,468
-I agree.
-Okay. Blow them out.

557
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,469
Do you have a wish?

558
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,887
I'll turn off the lights.

559
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:23,861
I WISH I CAN SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH SI-EUN

560
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:27,782
I wish that I could marry him.

561
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,127
I wonder what you wished for. I'm curious.

562
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:41,837
Did you wish for one?

563
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,881
-Yes.
-I bet it's a unique one.

564
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:46,467
-It's an ordinary wish.
-Ordinary ones are the hardest.

565
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,097
You must all be famished.

566
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,057
Eat up.

567
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,822
You've prepared everything.

568
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,615
I tend to be thorough.

569
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,120
You even got expensive champagnes.

570
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,665
We should celebrate first.

571
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,126
-Happy birthday.
-I wish you a healthy life.

572
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,210
Thank you.

573
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,296
Why are you quiet?

574
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,674
You know I'm not that eloquent.

575
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,551
We're just wishing him well.

576
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,969
Let me talk instead.

577
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,680
Let's all be happy.

578
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,352
-Okay.
-I am.

579
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,652
-Did you drive here?
-I did.

580
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:49,530
I thought this was a fundraiser.
Who was behind this?

581
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,574
I just did as I was told.

582
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:54,577
I should have treated you all
since it was my birthday.

583
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,913
You've already done
more than enough in the past year.

584
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,708
Ask when my birthday is.

585
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,376
Gosh. I'm hungry.

586
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,836
Aren't you?

587
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:11,552
Men's hearts break the most

588
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,721
when losing their wives first.

589
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,560
Don't think about anything,
and just go to bed.

590
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,812
How could he possibly
not think of anything?

591
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,147
Can you please?

592
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,984
You should have let me in too.

593
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,986
I'm dressed so casually.

594
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:32,198
Me too. I heard there was no dress code.

595
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,575
You look great in anything.

596
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:35,784
I was left out.

597
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,578
I know you're too naive to play dumb.

598
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,871
He would have caught on.

599
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,169
-You're not offended are you?
-Of course not.

600
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,962
Surprises are always great.

601
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,089
She's giving you special treatment.

602
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,842
She's never planned such surprises for us.

603
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,719
I'll do better from now on.

604
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,306
The food is tasty.
Give me the number for the caterer.

605
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,307
Okay.

606
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,399
Here's your gift. It's not much.

607
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,859
Gosh.

608
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,159
I've never worn one before.

609
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,160
Let me.

610
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,037
This is my gift.

611
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,584
Return it if you don't like the scent.
I have the receipt.

612
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,504
I hope you didn't give this
because I smelled bad.

613
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:31,674
Of course not.
That's not why women wear perfumes, right?

614
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,468
Today is just…
I don't know if I should accept this.

615
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:36,887
We're showing our affection.

616
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,690
I'm hot right now. Maybe next time.

617
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,154
You should learn how to do it.

618
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,580
He can look it up online.

619
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,123
The scarf suits him.

620
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,500
You need a long neck for it to suit you.

621
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,670
Thank you. Starting from the morning,
I've been spoiled all day.

622
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,964
-Did you have seaweed soup?
-Yes.

623
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,091
I doubt you made it yourself.

624
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:18,387
-Was it your housekeeper?
-She's never made me that on my birthday.

625
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,680
-Goodness.
-Never?

626
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,724
-Never.
-That's not right.

627
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,267
She's worked for you for a long time.

628
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,395
I like that she doesn't care
about those things.

629
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:30,482
Does this mean we made a mistake today?

630
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,443
-I believe we did.
-No, I'm grateful.

631
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,778
Can you call your brother over?

632
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:35,988
Right. Call him.

633
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,830
This is my brother.

634
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:46,415
Goodness.

635
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,500
-Hello.
-Goodness.

636
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,919
Is that why you talked to me last time?

637
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,674
Can you call your brother over?

638
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,884
Right. Call him.

639
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:01,263
He's busy. After all, this is our team.
We're a family.

640
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,556
I agree.

641
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:09,146
Ms. Lee and I became friends.

642
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,484
Right. You guys are the same age.

643
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:16,528
Our age doesn't matter. We just clicked.

644
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,617
Do you not click well with us?

645
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,701
Do you agree with me?

646
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:29,875
Lee Si-eun.

647
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:31,669
Si-eun.

648
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:38,967
It turned out we had gone
to the same academy as kids.

649
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:41,929
-Really?
-Yes.

650
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,684
Let's go out officially starting today.

651
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,906
You guys suit each other.

652
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,369
Congratulations.

653
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,373
How did you two hide it?

654
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,670
You're impressive.

655
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,756
I'll call a chauffeur. Drop me off.

656
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,050
Okay.

657
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:24,930
Hello? I'm calling from Soo Villa
in Cheongdam-dong.

658
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:31,812
How long?

659
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:33,939
Okay.

660
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,613
Shouldn't you call one too?

661
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,241
Yes.

662
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,965
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

663
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,387
I'll treat you guys in a few days.

664
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,347
The driver is waiting.

665
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:38,003
Please head to Troa Apartment,
not Golden Park.

666
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,922
-Yes, sir.
-Are you taking a cab?

667
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,048
Yes.

668
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,510
You didn't have to tell them today.

669
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,595
The mood and the timing were just right.

670
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,055
The mood was nothing special.

671
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,642
They could have been offended
had they found out even later.

672
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:54,061
I'm just worried
we made it sound like a big deal.

673
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,078
Thank you.

674
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:54,162
Thank you.

675
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:55,872
Is it just me?

676
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,084
I feel comfortable

677
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,503
even when we're not talking.

678
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,349
-Keep the change.
-Thank you, sir.

679
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,479
-Call a cab.
-Go inside. It's chilly at night.

680
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,316
Okay. I know
you'll only leave once I go in.

681
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,650
That's not true.

682
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:31,992
Ms. Lee.

683
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:37,581
Did I do the right thing?

684
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:40,334
You did.

685
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,254
That's not good enough.

686
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,721
You should do that more often.

687
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,249
Hey, Hye-ryung.

688
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,210
-Are you showering?
-No.

689
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,295
I'm in front of your house.

690
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:16,842
You didn't drive here, did you?

691
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,593
I took a cab.

692
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,725
I bet you're just as baffled.

693
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,896
How could they hide it from us like that?

694
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,191
They went to the same academy.

695
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:36,152
Do you really believe that? I don't.

696
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:39,739
Neither of them is the type to lie.

697
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,367
I'm more disappointed
in Ms. Lee than Mr. Seo.

698
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:47,205
They say it's impossible to know
what goes on in someone's mind.

699
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,499
That's exactly how I feel about her.

700
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,126
I was pretty taken aback too.

701
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,335
What does that make me?

702
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,046
Gosh. I'm so embarrassed.

703
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,423
But Mr. Seo doesn't know.

704
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,884
Does this mean they're going out?

705
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,762
That's probably what he meant
when he said "official."

706
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:06,016
How could they
get into a relationship so quickly?

707
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:10,520
I can't believe
I was betrayed by her of all people.

708
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,938
Just be happy for them.

709
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,608
I'll do that in front of them.

710
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:19,404
But deep down, I'm truly offended.

711
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,782
That's life.

712
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:26,536
Nothing goes the way you want it to.

713
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,164
Do you think they'll get married?

714
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,625
Who knows?

715
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,001
They don't suit each other.

716
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,337
That's not important here.

717
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,173
We don't know what they will decide to do.

718
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:39,883
I'm speechless.

719
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,473
What is it?

720
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,476
-Hello.
-Hi.

721
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,062
Sorry. Did I wake you up?

722
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,188
No.

723
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,733
This is why
you shouldn't drink anything before bed.

724
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:34,562
Too drunk to let yourself in?

725
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:43,613
Who did you drink with?

726
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,949
Nothing good comes out of drinking.

727
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:47,033
Ban.

728
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,539
-It's not right.
-What isn't?

729
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,249
I heard you're dating an old woman.

730
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:01,631
I visited Dad yesterday.

731
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,884
He hates it, but he finally accepted her.

732
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:05,969
Ga-bin.

733
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:11,099
Although he hates it,
he decided to accept her as family.

734
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:15,311
-And?
-Is this a serious relationship?

735
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,730
Why must I answer that?

736
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,815
We're family. We're brothers.

737
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:19,941
She's a good friend.

738
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,234
Are you friends or lovers?

739
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:22,861
Both.

740
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:25,196
You should make Dad proud.

741
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,159
You should date someone
who would make Chairman Seo

742
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,536
happy and proud.

743
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:38,418
When Secretary Yoo
told me about her, I couldn't believe it.

744
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:41,129
I knew that was why
he gave that cake to me in person

745
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,048
when he could have just left it at home.

746
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:45,091
Ban, reconsider this.

747
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,761
End it before she grows on you.

748
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,012
Dad would be upset.

749
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,180
Must I

750
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,975
care about him and try to please him?

751
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:56,478
You have no idea

752
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:00,023
how highly he regards you.

753
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,234
-I thought you knew.
-Either sleep or go home.

754
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,448
Don't you know
why he gave in after less than a week?

755
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,701
Because of my competence.

756
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:14,913
That's one thing he acknowledges.

757
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:16,915
It's okay. He allowed your marriage.

758
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,292
He won't like
his second daughter-in-law either.

759
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,293
Is she a divorcée?

760
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,380
Am I right? Where are you going?

761
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,549
To get coffee.

762
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:27,801
You were awake?

763
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,014
-I think you're right.
-About what?

764
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:37,393
I just went into Mom's room
to ask if I could have a popsicle.

765
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,910
I've never seen that kind of look before.

766
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,954
Did she seem extremely happy?

767
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,248
-Yes.
-That's all that matters.

768
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,125
Could she really be dating Mr. Seo?

769
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:04,963
I assumed he would be
more interested in Hye-ryung.

770
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:06,756
-Mom's lucky.
-Are you happy?

771
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,467
What kind of daughter
wouldn't want her mom to be happy?

772
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,388
Have some before you go.

773
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:17,517
-The screams.
-The screams?

774
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,977
I can't get those screams

775
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:23,189
out of my head.

776
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,399
Did you watch a horror movie?

777
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,615
Maybe I can sleep it off.

778
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,117
Try to sleep.

779
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,243
What about you?

780
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:40,415
Should we check on Sa-hyeon?
To see if he's sleeping or not.

781
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:42,500
He barely slept for days,
so he must be asleep.

782
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,961
Can't we find someone who can breastfeed?

783
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,464
That's impossible in this day and age.

784
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,382
We could ask the hospital.

785
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,343
Maybe one of the mothers there
could share their milk.

786
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,970
We'd be willing to pay.

787
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:58,266
Even mothers who can breastfeed
opt for powdered formulas nowadays.

788
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:01,644
Don't you know why I rarely get sick?

789
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,856
It's all thanks to my mother's milk.

790
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,862
Are you sure there's no more?

791
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,575
-What do you mean?
-Your breasts.

792
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,452
Are you sure there's no more milk?

793
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:19,996
In the past,
there were old women who breastfed.

794
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,333
Are you stupid or have you gone insane?

795
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,293
I haven't gone insane.

796
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,713
My milk dried up ages ago.

797
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:30,381
Those women are still young.

798
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:31,674
You're also still young.

799
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,343
But I didn't give birth.

800
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:36,179
That only pertains
to old women who have given birth.

801
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,600
Since he has lost his mom,

802
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,603
there's no one to breastfeed him.

803
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,314
24 HOUR NURSERY

804
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,442
-I can carry him.
-It's okay.

805
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:51,986
He's uncomfortable.

806
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:01,079
Babies know what's comfortable
and what isn't.

807
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:02,288
That's true.

808
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:05,250
Sweetie, we're going home now.

809
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,709
That's right.

810
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,968
If your mom was still alive,

811
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:18,888
we would have been ecstatic right now.

812
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,433
You heard, right?

813
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:05,727
-Mr. Park Jun-ho will take his place.
-Yes.

814
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:07,770
Was he too uncomfortable and wanted out?

815
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:10,565
He denied it.
He's not the type to be like that either.

816
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:14,360
You're right. I was taken aback yesterday.

817
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,240
How do you feel? Does he treat you well?

818
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:30,335
-Hello.
-Hey. We have a new engineer.

819
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,719
Perhaps, Cicada is right.

820
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,764
You should kill
your enemies with kindness.

821
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:04,887
Director Shin.

822
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:09,142
I know you're resentful and hurt.
But please forgive me.

823
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,643
I was wrong.

824
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,020
You understand me, right?

825
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,984
I must have been crazy.

826
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,322
I must have gone insane.

827
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:26,075
Look at you lying through your teeth.

828
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:30,163
But what can we do?
You can't come back to life.

829
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:33,082
It'll be too lonely for me.
I refuse to go alone.

830
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,292
For decades,

831
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:39,964
I devoted my life to you.

832
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,011
You were just pretending.

833
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,180
I'm sorry.

834
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:49,891
I deserve to die.

835
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:51,017
Then die.

836
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:53,102
I'll welcome you with open arms.

837
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:58,357
However, you were the only man
I had in my entire life.

838
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,110
That's not easy to do.

839
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:06,991
All of my friends said
there was no one like me.

840
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:10,787
We lived together for decades.

841
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,999
We were together for almost 40 years

842
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,085
if we include the time
we spent having our affair.

843
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:20,546
Please be merciful.

844
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,341
Please forgive me.

845
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:41,859
I just received this.

846
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:08,469
She went to the swimming pool.

847
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:09,595
By herself?

848
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:12,139
Yes. She said swimming
was good for her back.

849
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:14,517
And her condition has improved greatly.

850
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,743
Hello?

851
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:36,122
I'm at Gangnam Hotel for a swim.

852
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:37,248
I see.

853
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:38,332
Let me teach you.

854
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:39,584
I know how to swim.

855
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,377
Still. Are you coming?

856
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,296
Ms. Sa and Hye-ryung will be waiting.

857
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,131
-Yarbo Cafe?
-Yes.

858
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:46,841
-Okay.
-Bye.

859
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,578
Isn't that Mr. Seo?

860
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:40,037
Goodness. He's totally into me.

861
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,773
How did you feel to see me
get ahead of myself?

862
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:50,524
Do you not feel the need to answer?

863
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:51,942
It was something unexpected.

864
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,486
My house is nearby.

865
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:56,489
I have some good wine
that would be a pity to have by myself.

866
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:57,740
Are you hurt?

867
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,034
Can you remove your mask?
I can't hear well.

868
01:08:00,117 --> 01:08:00,951
Hello?

869
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:03,204
He must've been asleep.
I thought he was swimming.

870
01:08:03,287 --> 01:08:05,623
I'll come here tomorrow again
when I'm sober.

871
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:08,209
Will you make me dinner?

872
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:09,960
This is the scariest part.

873
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:11,253
Scream if you're scared.

874
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:14,799
-I must have been easygoing and friendly.
-Yes, you were.

875
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:16,467
-Hold on.
-What is it?

876
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:19,136
-Yes?
-I'm Seo Dong-ma, Seo Ban's brother.

877
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,388
I had something to say,
so I came to your station.

878
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:22,431
Hello.

879
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,308
The bride and the groom
will walk down the aisle.

880
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:27,895
Please applaud as they walk down.

881
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:30,564
-What's going on?
-Goodness.

882
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:37,029
