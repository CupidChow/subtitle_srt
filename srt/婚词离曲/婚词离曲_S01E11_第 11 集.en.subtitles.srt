00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,016
EPISODE 11

2
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,100
Yu-sin.

3
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,435
Yes?

4
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:04,147
What was the happiest moment in your life?

5
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:09,110
I'm not sure. I can't pick one.

6
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,197
-Were there many times?
-Yes.

7
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,116
You must be a happy man, Yu-sin.

8
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,536
How about you, young lady?

9
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,749
You're the first person to call me that.

10
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,834
It's common here.

11
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,878
When were you the happiest?

12
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,674
When I got into UCLA?

13
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,552
-That's a surprise.
-Why?

14
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,014
I thought you were happy-go-lucky.
You look like one.

15
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,849
I am, Doctor.

16
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,143
"Doctor"?

17
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,744
Are you interested in horseback riding?

18
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,372
Maybe if you teach me.

19
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,961
Horseback riding is a skill you must have
in the entertainment industry,

20
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,005
as well as swimming, driving,

21
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,466
golfing, and dancing.

22
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,510
Can you dance?

23
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,805
Didn't you say you don't enjoy it?

24
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:19,722
No, Doctor.

25
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,766
"Doctor"?

26
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,854
I'll give you a free pass this time.

27
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,231
Let's go to a club.

28
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,984
-I'm curious about Korean clubs.
-Maybe next time.

29
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,570
It's better to go with you
than with anyone else.

30
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,532
Yu-sin,

31
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,535
your wife isn't your first love, is she?

32
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,413
No.

33
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,499
Then who was your first love?

34
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,543
I think I'm blessed

35
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,171
since I'm growing old with my first love.

36
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,423
So your wife is your first love.

37
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,134
It's my mom.

38
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,139
The one who raised me.
Not my biological mom.

39
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,352
This reminds me
of those ludicrous Korean dramas.

40
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,111
We downed this bottle so quickly.

41
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:19,032
How could you love your stepmom?

42
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:22,452
I mean, you can love her as a mom.

43
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,079
But your first love?

44
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,790
I don't think that's right.

45
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,460
It's similar to how daughters
want to marry their dads.

46
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,714
Does your wife know
that her mother-in-law is your first love?

47
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,008
It doesn't matter if she knows.

48
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,843
What's important is

49
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:43,056
that we're all happily living together
as a family.

50
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,521
What about your biological mom?

51
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,318
Remember how I lost my brother
when I was seven?

52
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,986
I also lost my mom back then.

53
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:02,075
I don't think they'll ever feel lonely.

54
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,120
They were very close when they were alive,

55
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,998
and they left together as well.

56
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,096
We all have a painful past,

57
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,390
isn't it, Yu-sin?

58
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,559
Does that mean you have one as well?

59
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,778
You can tell me anything.

60
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,823
I'm a psychiatrist, after all.

61
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,659
That's true,

62
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,161
but this isn't your office.

63
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:53,126
Psychoanalyze yourself as a doctor.

64
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,586
How would you describe yourself?

65
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,592
We categorize people
into Clusters A, B, or C.

66
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:05,263
Cluster A consists of schizophrenics.

67
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,267
Cluster B consists of dramatic people.

68
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,228
They have a strong sense of narcissism

69
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,314
and an antisocial personality disorder.

70
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,900
And Cluster C consists of individuals
with dependent personality disorder

71
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,153
or avoidant personality disorder.

72
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,487
I belong to none of them.

73
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,655
Me neither.

74
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,576
I'm not in Cluster A or Cluster B.

75
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,661
-Or Cluster C.
-You're in Cluster B.

76
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,748
You're slightly narcissistic.

77
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,421
It's not a bad thing.
Women need a bit of narcissism.

78
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,007
If you don't belong
in any of those groups,

79
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,509
then what kind of person are you?

80
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,138
My opinion of myself

81
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,474
may be different from those of others.

82
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,809
Stop dodging the question.

83
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,811
I'm not.

84
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,689
Tell me how you feel.

85
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,026
Socrates said, "Know thyself."

86
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,947
Since you're a psychiatrist,
I'm sure you have a clear grasp

87
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,283
of who you are.

88
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,993
Aren't I friendly?

89
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,956
I'd say I've lived a fairly ethical life,

90
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,876
and I like everything
to be black and white.

91
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,170
And take time to know me better.

92
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,174
Are you interested?

93
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,845
What about you?

94
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,182
Older brothers always listen
to their sisters.

95
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,484
I'll drop you home.

96
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,445
We drank a lot today.

97
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,157
-Are you okay?
-Not really.

98
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,200
Do you want medicine?

99
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,703
I can handle it.

100
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,214
Think about it.

101
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,300
He didn't even flinch
when I told him that my joints hurt.

102
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,720
But he rushed Dongmi to the vet
when he saw that her leg was swollen.

103
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,849
He took her to Dr. Cho, not just any vet.
Does that make sense?

104
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,392
Of course not.

105
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,103
That's how he's been treating me
for decades.

106
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,729
How could he?

107
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,565
It's more than enough to write a book.

108
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:24,652
Not once did he remember my birthday!
He says I spend too much money!

109
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,195
That's what money is for.

110
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,906
He says he's the one earning,
and I'm the one spending.

111
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,533
But you're his wife.

112
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,786
I do all sorts of things for him,
such as running errands and cooking.

113
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,121
I might as well charge him.

114
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:38,541
Exactly. Charge him for taking care
of him around-the-clock.

115
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,793
Five million a month
would be 60 million a year,

116
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,003
or 600 million a decade.

117
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,337
It's been 41 years.

118
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,174
Six times four is twenty-four.
It's almost three billion won.

119
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,468
How could a dog be more important than me?

120
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,606
I'm sleepy.

121
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,322
I'll never forget about tonight.

122
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,827
-What's on your mind?
-What you just said.

123
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,499
Yes?

124
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,211
Good night, Mother.

125
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,795
-Sure.
-Goodness.

126
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:26,881
It's warm.

127
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,382
Shall I turn on the humidifier?

128
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,302
No thanks.
I don't feel refreshed in the morning.

129
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,429
I could bring a wet towel and--

130
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,516
Is it our neighbor?

131
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,601
Where's Ye-jeong?

132
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,394
She's getting ready for bed.

133
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,022
You can take off your coat.

134
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:45,858
Did you have dinner?

135
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:47,610
Well…

136
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,781
-You didn't?
-I had a little bit at a funeral.

137
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,367
What? Who passed away?

138
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,869
It's a long story.
Just tell your mom to come out.

139
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,206
Mom! Dad's here!

140
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,083
I'll set the table.

141
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,752
Don't. We're going home right away.

142
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,462
She made tasty blue crab soup.

143
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,966
And she doesn't care
whether her husband ate or not.

144
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,636
Why are you here?

145
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,264
I stopped by on my way home
from a funeral.

146
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,433
Who passed away?

147
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,851
Mr. Park's mother.

148
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,687
Which Mr. Park?

149
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,855
You don't know all of my acquaintances.

150
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,149
Go get changed.

151
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,861
You should go home. You must be tired.

152
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,905
Let me tend to them for a few days.

153
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,491
Father, would you like honey tea
or some fruit?

154
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,369
-Neither.
-Give him some cold water.

155
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,204
So that he'll get a grip.

156
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,331
-Cold water?
-Have some ice cubes

157
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,916
if you're boiling inside.

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,711
Don't bother the kids. Let's go.

159
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,755
-I'm not bothering you, am I?
-Of course not.

160
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,925
-You should spend the night here too.
-What for?

161
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,011
He can't sleep if he's away from home.

162
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,304
You should, Father.

163
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,976
I bet no one loves their dog
as much as he does.

164
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,563
Dongmi's leg was slightly swollen.

165
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,649
His face turned pale.
He even skipped breakfast

166
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,152
-and rushed over to Dr. Cho.
-Goodness.

167
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,196
Did she get treated? What did Dr. Cho say?

168
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,033
So that's why Mom's upset.

169
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:21,162
That she'll get better in time.
And he gave her medicine for her joints.

170
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,166
Good.

171
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,085
There's no one as compassionate as you.

172
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,212
Dongmi is lucky to have met him.

173
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,466
You bet. She's even more spoiled now.

174
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,010
She's treated better than most people.

175
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,095
Right?

176
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,891
-Let's go.
-You can go on your own.

177
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,856
You should spend the night here too.

178
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,067
-Like this?
-You can wear my clothes.

179
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,694
He's right.
Have breakfast before you leave.

180
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,405
Honey.

181
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,911
Ye-jeong, fix me a meal! I'm hungry!

182
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:06,540
Hye-ryung.

183
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,793
-Please reheat the stew.
-Okay.

184
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:27,186
My goodness.
Get up and change your clothes.

185
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,649
One minute.

186
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,239
Excuse me.

187
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,628
Are you home?

188
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,589
When will you be back?

189
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,550
Why Singapore?

190
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,052
I thought we'd eat out together.

191
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,597
Okay.

192
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,520
You said you wouldn't drink.

193
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,699
Are you feeling nauseous?

194
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,911
-Let's sleep.
-Take a shower first.

195
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,872
Wash me.

196
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,665
Walk there, and I'll bathe you.

197
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,418
Bring a wet towel.

198
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,254
-Are you a baby?
-For tonight, yes.

199
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,797
-I'm your son.
-How silly.

200
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,509
-Why did you drink?
-He wanted to drink.

201
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,052
And I felt bad for him.

202
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,847
-Why did you feel bad?
-I had my reasons.

203
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,098
It's a long story.

204
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,225
Come here.

205
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,871
Why are you here?

206
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,041
I told you,
I dropped by after the funeral.

207
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,376
"Funeral," my foot.

208
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:20,424
Let's act and age gracefully.

209
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,593
Let's not show them this side.

210
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,095
Why not? Did I do something wrong?

211
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,889
Why are you jealous of a dog?

212
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,643
Jealous? Put yourself in my shoes.

213
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,978
-Should I get a dog too?
-Sure.

214
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,898
And should I dote on the dog
more than you, Mun-ho?

215
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,818
Don't talk to your respectable husband
like that.

216
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,654
Then, act like one.

217
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,156
Don't act lowly
and expect to be treated well.

218
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,576
It's all thanks to me
that you can live in luxury.

219
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,454
No, it's not.
It's all thanks to your father.

220
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,914
It was your father's land.

221
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,542
Whatever. We'll leave
first thing in the morning.

222
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,418
-Go on your own.
-Stop being stubborn.

223
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,670
It's my choice.

224
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,384
Did you think I'd be happy
to see you this late?

225
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,803
Shouldn't you go see Dongmi?

226
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,764
This is unbelievable.

227
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,476
Don't you have any self-esteem?

228
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,061
Why are you jealous of her?

229
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:17,398
I don't want to speak with you.
I can't be bothered to.

230
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,276
A thousand words won't cut it.

231
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,861
You can't change yourself.

232
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,574
You have no idea how lucky you are.

233
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,951
I guess I don't.

234
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,245
Do you think I'm lucky?

235
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,665
You've broken my heart so many times.

236
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,253
I mean less than a dog to you. Understood?

237
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,715
Go. You should to give Dongmi
her breakfast tomorrow.

238
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,800
You shouldn't let that poor thing starve.

239
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,968
There's Jun-jae.

240
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,095
Was she the one who took Dongmi
to the vet?

241
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,432
You should feed her yourself.

242
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:55,144
You received my everything,
but you're devoted to your dog.

243
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,730
What do you mean, "devoted"?

244
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,482
I share my bedroom with you, not her.

245
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,027
You might as well sleep together
and lick each other.

246
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,486
That's enough.

247
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,740
I wouldn't be like this
had you not taken it this far.

248
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,201
Why did you have to crawl over here
and rub it in like that?

249
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,661
"Crawl over here"?

250
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,248
I came here in a car, in a Benz L-Class.

251
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,168
Then take the Benz L-Class
and go back home.

252
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,754
Was it that big of a mistake?

253
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,632
She's also a part of our family.

254
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:28,135
If we're both family,
why did you neglect me

255
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,221
and rush over to the vet for her?

256
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,474
Was she dying or something?

257
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,893
She was trembling.

258
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,395
You're making my blood boil.
Stop talking to me.

259
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,108
Gosh, working out did wear me out.

260
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,402
I'll be sleeping soundly tonight.

261
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,863
ELENA

262
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,995
What's that for? Are you sick?

263
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,163
No.

264
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,499
Don't lie. Are you ill?

265
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,544
I never thought I was stressed,
but my body begged to differ.

266
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,922
These lactobacillus pills
will rejuvenate me.

267
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,924
You should cut down on work.

268
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,969
One program is enough,
but you're too greedy.

269
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,596
This is good for women.

270
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,108
-Let's get a dog.
-Raising dogs is a lot of work.

271
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,275
But we don't have any kids.

272
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,528
There are more families with dogs
than those without now.

273
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,114
It'll develop separation anxiety
from being home alone.

274
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,074
-And who'll take care of it?
-I will.

275
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,202
I'll bathe and clean up its mess.
I can take great care of it.

276
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,370
You can just adore it.

277
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,747
You'll take care of a dog instead of me?

278
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,752
-Okay.
-And I won't allow you to spoil a dog

279
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,379
like your father does.

280
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:49,049
He dotes on Dongmi
more than he does on his wife.

281
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,759
She's too kind.

282
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,892
Scratch my back, will you?

283
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,190
I see you still care about me.

284
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,987
I was worried you'd badmouth me

285
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,947
to your daughter-in-law.

286
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,284
You knew it'd do you no good.

287
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:22,624
Go watch some TV if you're bored.
Stop disturbing my sleep.

288
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,259
That tickles.

289
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,889
-What are you doing?
-Putting these socks on you.

290
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,850
-Let go!
-Come on!

291
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,477
Stay still.

292
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,605
-Gosh.
-Stop it!

293
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,198
Don't be mad. Come on.

294
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,577
-I won't do it again.
-What do you mean?

295
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,831
Of course, you always come before the dog.

296
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,875
Your actions don't back that up.

297
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,794
I was inconsiderate.

298
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,134
Should I put these on for you?

299
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,352
What should we tell the kids then?

300
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,604
NAM GA-BIN MUSICALS

301
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,651
NAM GA-BIN, A RISING STAR

VIDEOS

303
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,576
I have grown older…

304
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,272
Yu-sin.

305
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,107
-Yes?
-We're here.

306
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,780
-I'll be back soon.
-Okay.

307
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,325
It's okay. Go straight home.

308
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,892
Will you be okay?

309
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,228
Yes.

310
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,907
I hope there are no intruders.

311
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,994
Didn't you change the password?

312
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,666
-How do you do that?
-Let me check inside first.

313
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,620
You're safe, so go to bed.
I'll change the password tomorrow.

314
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,081
Thank you again for today.

315
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,041
Do you have food in the fridge?

316
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,145
Have some tangerines.

317
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,605
They'll rejuvenate you and prevent colds.

318
00:21:58,775 --> 00:21:59,985
Should I peel one for you?

319
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,990
-You should go home now.
-I'll call you tomorrow.

320
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,826
What time?

321
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,662
When would you like me to?

322
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,002
Yu-sin.

323
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,423
-Yes?
-It's my first time

324
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,051
being all alone, away from home.

325
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,311
Are you scared?

326
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,900
But I can't stay with you.

327
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,611
Lock the door.

328
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,032
Can you put your jacket over me?

329
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,711
You should sleep in your bedroom,
not here.

330
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,426
You should go.

331
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,095
All right.

332
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,270
Don't come out to the balcony again.
You'll catch a cold.

333
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,816
-Why aren't you answering me?
-I'm going to come out.

334
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,235
Listen to me. I'm older than you.

335
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,904
Fine.

336
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,661
Don't look at the world
so pessimistically.

337
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,915
If you look at it from a different angle…

338
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,584
Why are you still up? It's past 2 a.m.

339
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,379
Hey. I'm monitoring a performance.

340
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:08,673
It won't take long.

341
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,759
-A musical?
-Yes.

342
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,221
Well, you can say that.

343
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,570
-Do your best.
-Okay.

344
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,869
By the way,
you will make them breakfast, right?

345
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:40,997
Fine.

346
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,729
Are you up?

347
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,037
Hey, both of them left.

348
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,038
Really?

349
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,653
Good morning.

350
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,655
Good morning.

351
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,119
Aren't your muscles sore?

352
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,372
Just a bit.

353
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,046
-What kind of tea is that?
-It's burdock tea.

354
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,507
-Would you like some?
-Sure.

355
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,186
-It doesn't taste good.
-But it's good for you.

356
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:27,812
It is.

357
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,362
Not bad. It's savory.

358
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,906
-Ms. Song Won?
-Coming.

359
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,929
All right.

360
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,212
-Come and eat.
-Yes, ma'am.

361
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:37,173
What is today's menu?

362
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:42,011
-Red bean porridge?
-Yes.

363
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,515
You're so diligent.

364
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:48,059
You're second to none.

365
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,438
You like glutinous rice balls, right?
I added a lot.

366
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,940
I hope your blood sugar levels skyrocket.

367
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,777
I know you need to boil
and sift the beans to make this.

368
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,698
I saw my mother making it once,
and it was very time-consuming.

369
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,366
You know I tend to be quick.

370
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,868
Even still…

371
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,997
Is that your breakfast?

372
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,168
Red bean porridge makes me nauseous
after I got sick because of it once.

373
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,420
So you made this just for me?

374
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:19,048
It wasn't hard to make.
Just time-consuming.

375
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,258
Eat up. It'll get cold.

376
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,929
I should cut down
on carbohydrates, though.

377
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,932
You're on medication anyway.

378
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:31,644
Eating good food and relieving stress
is healthier for you.

379
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:35,273
That's true. Stress is the root
of all illnesses.

380
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,941
Tell me about it.

381
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,700
It's good.

382
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,579
I'll make mung bean porridge tomorrow

383
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:50,789
for breakfast.

384
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,457
That sounds nice.

385
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,335
Porridge is good for breakfast.
It's easy to digest.

386
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:59,047
I know, but it requires
a lot of effort to make.

387
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,841
I just need to stir it slowly.

388
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,929
Is there anything you'd like to have?

389
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:08,389
No, you've given me
more than enough already.

390
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,891
Still.

391
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:11,768
What is it?

392
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,605
Your heart. That's all that I need.

393
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,694
But you already have it.

394
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,489
-Is it not enough?
-No, it isn't.

395
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,075
I'm a greedy girl.

396
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,952
Goodness.

397
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:35,208
Dad must've drunk,
judging by this dried pollack soup.

398
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,584
Yes. Call him over.

399
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,046
Coming.

400
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,388
-Mom, I want milk.
-No cold milk for breakfast.

401
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:51,933
Milk is dubbed the complete food.
It's packed with calcium too.

402
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,854
Have spinach instead.
Vegetables have more calcium than milk.

403
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,397
-Really?
-Yes.

404
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,732
Winter spinach is delicious.

405
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:03,945
I like it in gimbap, but not on its own.

406
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,910
There's not much I can eat here.

407
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,245
I'm not complaining though.

408
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,248
-Of course, you are.
-I'm just saying.

409
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,668
I should just mix the soup
with the rice like him.

410
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:21,087
Dried pollack soup and eggs
are nutritious.

411
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,715
There's kimchi, stir-fried mushrooms,
and jangjorim.

412
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,342
They're all scrumptious and nutritious.

413
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,552
Sure.

414
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,453
Honey, today's soup
is exceptionally delicious.

415
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,456
-Is there more?
-Yes.

416
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,832
Pack me some for lunch.

417
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,501
It tastes better because you're hungover.

418
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,254
You should drink less.
You're in your mid-forties now.

419
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:08,217
Your wonderful bowl of soup
made me feel all better.

420
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,511
Have something warm for lunch.

421
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,013
Use an insulated lunch box.

422
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,098
Of course, I'll do that, but…

423
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,393
There aren't many side dishes either.

424
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,187
I want everything here.

425
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,315
Are all of my dishes that delicious?

426
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,734
Yes. You're just perfect.

427
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,069
You're skilled, beautiful…

428
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,613
-And kind?
-No doubt about it.

429
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,784
I'm always eager to cook
because you compliment my food.

430
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,244
You should do the same.

431
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,956
Of all the moms I know,
you're the best. Period.

432
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,999
-You're the best daughter too.
-And me?

433
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,669
-You're the best husband.
-The best dad.

434
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,400
Your father-in-law wanted me
to go home with him.

435
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,569
I'm sorry. I was meaning to stay
for a few days and feed you two.

436
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,156
Father.

437
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:26,462
Throw out your chest
and pull your body up slowly.

438
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,465
Okay. One.

439
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,637
Welcome.

440
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:36,723
What would you like?

441
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,307
-Soft tofu stew, please.
-Okay.

442
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,105
I ordered the same dish.

443
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,735
My friends came over yesterday
and ate all the meat.

444
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,612
Oh, no. Did they come empty-handed?

445
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,239
They brought cake and wine.

446
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,449
Do you like wine?

447
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,492
I enjoy a few glasses.

448
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,413
-Did you make the dressing yourself?
-Of course.

449
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,666
Maybe I should give it a try.
What's the recipe?

450
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,418
It's quite simple.

451
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:08,171
Adding mayonnaise or fruit
would make it taste better,

452
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,797
but I just enjoy the bland taste.

453
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,174
Tell me your recipe.

454
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,720
You're not a weekend couple, are you?

455
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,766
-No. She's just busy working.
-I see.

456
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,186
Shall I give you some?
Would you like to taste it?

457
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,063
That's barely enough for you.

458
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,564
I also have soft tofu stew.

459
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,402
-Ma'am, can I get a plate?
-Sure.

460
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,987
Thank you.

461
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,655
Aren't I causing you trouble?

462
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,991
You're supposed to share food.

463
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,119
Should I move to your table?

464
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,621
Sure.

465
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,000
Thank you.

466
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,472
It's refreshing.

467
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:00,515
It's good.

468
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,977
Can I ask where you are from?

469
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,438
-I'm from Seoul.
-I was born in Daejeon.

470
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,398
I moved to Seoul in high school.

471
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,652
I ate lots of vegetables growing up,
so I'm not picky.

472
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,198
We're the opposite.
I used to be a picky eater as a kid.

473
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,325
I thought so.

474
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,244
Do I seem picky?

475
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,870
Not at all.

476
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,290
People from rich families are picky
about their food. That's what I meant.

477
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,418
My family was ordinary.

478
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,588
May I ask how many siblings you have?
I have one older brother.

479
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,715
Of course. I have an older brother too.

480
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,218
I see. We're both the youngest.

481
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,388
I used to hate greens.

482
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,391
But I started eating them to be healthier,
and they grew on me.

483
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,642
Right?

484
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:52,233
-Did you peel the tomatoes?
-Yes.

485
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,861
It's much better.
I like the texture as well.

486
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:58,197
I bet your wife loves you
because you're not picky.

487
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,365
She does.

488
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,450
Your food is here.

489
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,620
It's hot. Be careful.

490
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,248
-You wanted half a bowl, right?
-Yes, thank you.

491
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,666
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

492
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,089
I should have half a bowl as well.

493
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,887
Eat first. I like to take my time
since it's hot.

494
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,389
What? I can't eat hot dishes as well.

495
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,059
-Earthen pots make it worse.
-Right?

496
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,190
Can you tell me your salad recipe?

497
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,027
I use whatever vegetables I have.

498
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,781
Avocados, tomatoes…

499
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,701
-Welcome.
-Bell peppers, arugula…

500
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:46,621
Beets are good as well. As for the sauce…

501
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,041
I'll just text it to you.

502
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,834
Okay.

503
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,965
I don't have a business card.

504
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,014
-Give me your number.
-Okay.

505
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:11,979
I'm Pan Sa-hyeon.

506
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,109
You heard my name earlier, right?

507
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,070
Or do you not remember?

508
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,280
I do. Your trainer said your name.

509
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,991
You have a one-syllable first name.

510
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,117
Yes.

511
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,620
Two stir-fried spicy pork, please.

512
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:28,829
Okay.

513
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,421
Use this.

514
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,173
Thank you.

515
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,518
Ji-a, Dad's going to work.

516
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:56,023
Well, I think we're around the same age.

517
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,149
Drop the honorifics.

518
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,652
I'm not that young.

519
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,028
How old do I look?

520
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,490
Late twenties or early thirties.

521
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,409
I'm 32 years old.

522
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,953
Add ten more years, and that's my age.

523
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:12,915
Don't joke around.

524
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,210
I'm serious. I'm 42 years old.

525
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:19,755
What? What's your secret?

526
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,841
No way. You're joking, right?

527
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,386
-Why would I pretend to be older?
-Are you serious?

528
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,850
Gosh. Then should I call you Ms. Song?

529
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,685
Are you a culinary teacher?

530
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,395
No, I'm not.

531
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,397
Your stew won't taste good
if it gets cold.

532
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,440
Right.

533
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,695
I like getting older.

534
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:47,533
-Why?
-Because I can feel myself maturing

535
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,118
in various aspects.

536
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,832
You seem to be very patient.

537
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,419
Don't you give more than you take?

538
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,338
The elderly always say

539
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,298
that it's better that way.

540
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,385
Don't you think it's better
than taking more from others?

541
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:09,847
It is. But it's easier said than done,
to be honest.

542
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,390
It's not that complicated.

543
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,477
How could she be such an angel?

544
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,354
DEAR WIFE

545
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,984
It's my wife. Let me take this.

546
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,069
Sure.

547
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,781
-Hello?
-Honey, what do I do?

548
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,575
-What's wrong?
-There's a lump on the roof of my mouth.

549
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,285
What if I have oral cancer?

550
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:36,123
-Okay. I'll be right there.
-Hurry!

551
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,169
I'm sorry, but my wife needs me now.

552
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,212
You should hurry.

553
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,422
Okay. I'm sorry.

554
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,737
Your breakfast is here.

555
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,345
Oh, my.

556
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,684
It's dried pollack soup.
It'll help ease your hangover.

557
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,645
Don't wash the lunch box.
I'll pick it up in the evening.

558
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,368
-Hello?
-Yu-sin. Look at the balcony.

559
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,040
Go inside. It's cold.

560
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,627
-You should've rung the doorbell.
-You'll catch a cold. Go on.

561
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,712
Talk inside.

562
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,635
I have a meeting with the agency,
so I'll come home late.

563
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,262
I need to buy some things too.

564
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,764
My dinner appointment
will end around 8 p.m.

565
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,350
-Okay.
-How do you feel? Nauseous?

566
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,352
I was, but not anymore.

567
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,146
You should eat now.

568
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,272
Thank you, Doctor.

569
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,900
What was the point in us
drinking last night?

570
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,028
We finished the entire whiskey
so we'd drop the honorifics.

571
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:31,071
I can't help it when I feel touched.

572
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,239
Should I do this daily?

573
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,452
-I'll get going.
-Bye, Yu-sin.

574
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:37,495
Bye.

575
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,969
-Are you washing up?
-I'm pooping.

576
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,515
All that he does is eat and poop.

577
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:01,352
-Yu-sin's family is coming for dinner.
-Okay.

578
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:11,362
I bet he'll be farting
on his deathbed as well.

579
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,701
Feel the roof of your mouth
with your tongue.

580
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,997
-Do you feel any lumps?
-No.

581
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,961
See? What should I do?

582
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,128
Let me see.

583
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,090
There's a small lump around my uvula.

584
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:33,342
Let's get a checkup first.
Let me get changed.

585
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,719
You don't have time to get changed.

586
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,305
Call the hospital immediately.
You're a VIP there.

587
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,890
My dad is, not me.

588
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,102
-Then tell him right now.
-Do you want him to worry?

589
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,604
Of course, he should! This is serious!

590
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,494
MOM

591
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,130
-Yes?
-Are you busy?

592
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,298
Why?

593
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,508
I was just curious

594
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,970
-if things were going well for you.
-Everything's fine.

595
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:22,141
-What about Ji-a?
-Both she and Yu-sin are doing well.

596
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,102
-Okay.
-Bye.

597
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,653
-Grandma!
-Hello.

598
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,447
Goodness.

599
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,826
What's all that?
Did you go grocery shopping?

600
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:42,911
Yes.

601
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,707
Hello, Ji-a.

602
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,628
What? Why are you bowing?

603
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,880
Because you're the oldest family member.

604
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:57,217
What's more important
is that I'm your grandpa.

605
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,639
Be more thorough, will you?

606
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,725
I thought kids just had to study hard.

607
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,770
Who said that?
So are you the top student in your class?

608
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,397
No, but I'm doing my best.

609
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,025
Imagine life without Mom and Dad.

610
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:16,153
Do you think you'll be fed
and your laundry will be done

611
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,613
if studying is all you do?

612
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,740
You should take more responsibility.

613
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,367
Besides, you're not a kid anymore.

614
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,577
Elementary students are still kids.

615
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,455
-Look at your size.
-I'm on the shorter side.

616
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:28,499
The tall kids are over 160 centimeters.

617
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,793
I meant your build, not your height.

618
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,879
To be honest…

619
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:36,215
About what?

620
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,884
How do I put this? Jealousy?

621
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,469
I think you hate me sometimes.

622
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,346
Don't be so dramatic.

623
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:45,516
Every time Mom and Dad aren't home,
you make me do chores.

624
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,893
At times, I feel like your slave.

625
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,229
Did you brush my hair or clean my shoes?

626
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,898
How could you say that?
I'm cleaning as well.

627
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:56,276
Am I to clean four rooms, the kitchen,
and the living room by myself?

628
00:44:56,902 --> 00:45:00,364
I even folded the laundry.
And it's such a hassle to do that.

629
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:03,701
And why would I hate you?

630
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,911
Because you think Mom and Dad
love me more.

631
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,287
Is that what you think?

632
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:14,044
You're right. It can't be helped
that their love for me and you

633
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,088
is similar but different.

634
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,383
You're the youngest, a late child,
and have a great personality.

635
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,427
You're a bit lazy, though.

636
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,345
Aren't you upset about it?

637
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,972
I'm not. Do you know why?

638
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,849
Because you're an angel?

639
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,809
No, because I love you too.

640
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,311
-Really?
-Yes, I do.

641
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,189
-I feel proud of you a lot of times.
-Like when?

642
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:37,067
Despite being the youngest,
you're surprisingly considerate.

643
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:40,904
How do you feel about me?

644
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,824
I feel the same way.
I can't live without you.

645
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,827
Don't change even after you get married.

646
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,372
I won't. Same goes for you.

647
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,041
-Women don't change.
-My friend's sister did.

648
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,376
Is he a late child too?

649
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,963
Yes. His oldest sister is 26 years old.

650
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:01,049
After she got married, she took
all the good things from his house.

651
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,721
Look at you.

652
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,517
He only gets chatty and laughs
when Ji-a is around.

653
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,438
-You bought chicken?
-Yes, for spicy braised chicken.

654
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,232
Goodness. Yu-sin had some yesterday.

655
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,986
I know. I want to learn your recipe.

656
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:23,697
And Yu-sin has dinner plans tonight.

657
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,325
-He can't come?
-No.

658
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:31,330
I just eyeball the ingredients.

659
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,165
That's what I want to learn.

660
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,542
Now, just boil it. That's it.

661
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:39,630
There must be some details
that make yours different.

662
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,381
If anything, it's just my touch.

663
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,176
She doesn't want to let me know.

664
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,972
Gosh. Just go watch some TV.

665
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,516
You're not a housewife.

666
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,935
Don't walk on eggshells
around your in-laws.

667
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,228
I'm not.

668
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,856
-How about seasoning?
-Add adequate amounts.

669
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,692
Wait. Shouldn't you add sugar first?

670
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,530
Right.

671
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,159
It shouldn't be too sweet.

672
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,705
I'll take over from now on. You can stop.

673
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:16,959
Here.

674
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:23,257
Just drizzle the sesame oil like this.
That tastes better.

675
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,098
I'm sorry.

676
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,688
Right.

677
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:45,696
CALLS

678
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:53,036
SONG WON

679
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,789
MS. SONG WON

680
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:01,211
This is Pan Sa-hyeon. I was in a hurry
and forgot to pay for the soft tofu…

681
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,679
I forgot to pay for my food. I'm sorry.

682
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,056
Tomorrow's breakfast is on me.

683
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,033
MS. SONG WON

684
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:33,785
She'll understand, right?
It was a mistake.

685
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,125
Yesterday,

686
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:43,629
Yu-sin said he could never get sick
of this dish.

687
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:46,506
Pi-young bought the groceries.

688
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,217
There's no soup, though.

689
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,470
Don't bother. This is enough.

690
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,767
Eat up, Princess.
You said you were hungry.

691
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,936
Okay. Thank you for the meal.

692
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,730
-Your mom did everything.
-Not at all.

693
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:05,359
Parboiling squid and wrapping it
in green onions is a lot of work.

694
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:09,154
-Please stop calling me "Princess."
-Why not?

695
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:13,283
What if I end up thinking of myself
as a real princess?

696
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,915
You're our one and only princess.

697
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:24,962
This is strange. Could it be
because I'm having it two days in a row?

698
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,798
-What's wrong? Is it not tasty?
-A bit.

699
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,843
As they say,
things never go the way we wanted.

700
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,513
We wanted to feed you something good.

701
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,973
It's not bad, Grandma.

702
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,600
Not bad isn't enough.

703
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,561
You should have a great dinner
when you're here.

704
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,563
Sleep over.

705
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:47,109
I promise I'll cook you
something delicious tomorrow morning.

706
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:50,278
-You should.
-I can't sleep if I'm not in my bed.

707
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,114
You slept well during your vacation.

708
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,282
That's true.

709
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,788
You must be sad that we sold off
the house in the US.

710
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,666
I am, but it can't be helped.

711
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:05,711
We rarely went there.
It was a waste paying the taxes.

712
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,964
Oh, dear. This is a failure.
It's not seasoned right.

713
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:14,302
Don't eat this.
I'll have to season it again tomorrow.

714
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,973
Have some salted pollack roe
and oysters instead.

715
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:20,350
Pi-young bought some fresh ones.

716
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:28,525
I'm sorry, but we're having
a gathering after work.

717
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,402
You can sleep first.

718
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,489
Okay.

719
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,916
Is Ms. Song upset?

720
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,048
She's not the type to get upset.

721
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,392
MS. SONG WON

722
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:07,564
The number is switched off.
You'll be directed to voicemail.

723
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:21,119
-Goodness, you're good at everything.
-You have great pronunciation.

724
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,496
You're an all-rounder.

725
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,831
What does that mean, Grandpa?

726
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:35,884
I'm on my way.

727
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,264
You're getting prettier and smarter

728
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,933
-every day.
-Mother.

729
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,977
I'm taking some of the fruit you have.

730
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,480
We should eat them
while they're still fresh.

731
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:53,193
Sure. Your father-in-law's former patients
are still sending us fruit.

732
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:55,946
-Put this on.
-Okay.

733
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,656
Goodness. Are you leaving?

734
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,909
You must be tired.
She wears you out every time she visits.

735
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:03,829
Is he a shoe or something?
How would I wear him out?

736
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,958
Girls are certainly different.

737
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:12,462
Yu-sin would barely answer my questions
when he was a kid.

738
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:15,715
Not to me.
We talked about all sorts of things.

739
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,384
-Is that so?
-Yes.

740
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:21,346
You were too busy with work
to chat with him.

741
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:23,098
That's true.

742
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:26,768
You took great care of him at all times.

743
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,937
Thanks to you, I could focus on work.

744
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,273
-You should rest now.
-Okay.

745
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,777
Let's all go skiing
before the winter's over.

746
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,782
Why don't you make time
for a two-night trip at least?

747
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:44,661
-I'm starting a new program.
-Then we can go without you.

748
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,664
Yu-sin can handle Ji-a alone.

749
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,417
She's all grown up now.

750
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:15,692
Why would I tell you my recipe?
What a sly fox you are.

751
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:21,656
That little…

752
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:27,454
This is your mom's spicy braised chicken.
I brought some for you.

753
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,633
She made this?

754
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,469
No.

755
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:51,853
PI-YOUNG

756
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,357
MOTHER-IN-LAW

757
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,580
Ji-a, call Grandma and tell her
that I'm driving.

758
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:11,498
Okay.

759
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,627
PI-YOUNG

760
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:23,385
-Hey, why did you take--
-Grandma, it's me.

761
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:26,263
-Hey.
-Mom's driving right now.

762
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:30,225
Okay. Tell her to call me
once she gets home.

763
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:31,309
Okay.

764
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,984
How rude. She didn't even ask me.

765
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:41,695
Aren't you going to sleep?

766
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,658
You can go to bed first.
I need to clean the kitchen.

767
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,702
Why don't you leave that
to the housekeeper?

768
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,496
Let her do her job.
I have something to take care of.

769
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,220
What were you up to?

770
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,597
I surfed the Internet
and organized my schedule.

771
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,269
You should get a TV first.

772
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,398
-Did you wash it?
-No, I don't have any detergent.

773
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,568
I changed the password.

774
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,696
I searched the internet
and found a tutorial.

775
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,198
Good, then.

776
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,078
-You're leaving already?
-Yes, you changed it.

777
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:39,210
Wait. I just didn't want
to inconvenience you.

778
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,588
I should do what I can.

779
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,632
-Good for you.
-It's your license plate number.

780
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:49,012
-Why would you tell me that?
-I don't want any misunderstandings.

781
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,221
What do you mean?

782
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,018
It doesn't matter who changed it.
It's not a big deal.

783
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,653
Would you like to see me off
instead of looking down from the balcony?

784
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:12,744
Come out. I'll wait by the elevator.

785
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,429
Did you have dinner?

786
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,723
Yes, with Gyeong-hui,
my dad's friend's daughter.

787
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,476
You had a busy day again.

788
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:37,852
You bet.

789
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,814
She brought me around
to teach me how to do things.

790
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,941
I'm going to the US tomorrow.

791
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,779
I have so many things I need.

792
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:53,660
-You're leaving when you just grew on me?
-Did I?

793
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:55,829
I guess it's just me.

794
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:58,623
-When will you be back?
-Next Tuesday.

795
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:00,834
Do you want to walk?

796
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:02,585
Let me put this in the car.

797
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:06,631
Does your wife know about me?

798
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:09,300
No. There's no need to tell her.

799
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:12,512
But I ate the lunch
she had packed for you.

800
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:16,391
Don't think about who the food is for.
Just enjoy it.

801
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:20,395
That's how you show respect
for the person who made it.

802
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,858
Anyway, I felt so grateful
while eating it.

803
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:28,403
Both to you, who brought it,
and your wife.

804
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:29,904
Although I've never met her.

805
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,824
-I got over my hangover.
-She's a good woman.

806
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:36,578
She'll love it if I tell her
that I fed a poor little lamb.

807
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,664
No one has ever taken pity on me.

808
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:43,376
You came to Korea alone during the winter,
hoping to succeed.

809
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:47,005
It tugged at my heartstrings.
You wouldn't know that expression.

810
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,633
My paternal grandparents were from Honam.

811
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:51,759
I know it very well.

812
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:02,812
-Will you buy me a gift?
-What should I buy?

813
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,355
What do you like?

814
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:05,857
People.

815
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:09,277
-Male or female?
-Both.

816
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,279
You can be honest with me.

817
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:14,741
I mean it. I'm popular among men too.

818
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:15,992
My colleagues love me.

819
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,328
But I can't buy people.

820
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:21,456
I'll buy you a doll.
A boy doll or a girl doll?

821
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,048
Why did you wear heels at night?

822
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,300
I didn't want to look too short.

823
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,972
Goodness. You're trying so hard.

824
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:40,475
Grab my arm. Don't trip again.

825
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,019
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

826
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:51,986
I realized earlier in the car that
there are so many restaurants in Korea.

827
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:53,780
That's how it is here.

828
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,950
I could easily gain weight in Seoul.

829
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,495
Aren't you going to learn Pilates?

830
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:02,205
Is your equestrian center far?

831
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:05,667
It's in Bundang.
With no traffic, it takes 30 minutes.

832
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,127
I bet you look cool on a horse.
I want to see it.

833
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:11,548
Buy some riding uniforms
while you're back in the US.

834
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,466
-It's much cheaper there.
-Okay.

835
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,178
Do you recognize this smell?

836
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,683
-Have you had baked sweet potatoes before?
-No.

837
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:27,564
It's over there.

838
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:31,526
-How much?
-Three for 5,000 won.

839
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:32,819
Three, please.

840
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,659
-Here you go. It's hot.
-Okay.

841
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,786
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

842
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:46,666
It smells fantastic!

843
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,877
Kids in Korea these days say "totally."

844
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:52,213
-"Totally fantastic"?
-Yes.

845
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,216
-I totally love it.
-Love what?

846
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,760
Having baked sweet potatoes

847
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,054
for the first time
on a winter night in Seoul,

848
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,306
and walking with you.

849
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,392
But I'm taking this home.

850
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,562
Fine, then.

851
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:12,442
Should we eat on a bench?
Or take it home if you're cold.

852
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:14,235
The bench.

853
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,906
Let me. Your nails will get dirty.

854
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,829
A snack for the stray cats.

855
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:29,500
Are you sure it's not a feast for mice?

856
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,712
There aren't many mice here.

857
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:34,422
I know there's a bunch in the US.

858
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:38,384
You're so sweet.
You're a good husband and dad, right?

859
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:39,719
They rarely complain.

860
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,929
Are all Korean men like you?

861
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:46,059
-What did the dramas show you?
-There were many bad guys there too.

862
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:52,690
You've heard about my first love.
Now, it's your turn.

863
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:54,609
Don't you have a boyfriend?

864
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:57,570
Not right now.
If I did, he would've come too.

865
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:00,323
When did you have
your first serious relationship?

866
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:02,075
I've never had one,

867
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:04,952
not even an exhaustingly
demanding relationship.

868
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:09,082
Speaking from experience,
lukewarm relationships aren't that great.

869
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,792
But everything has meaning.

870
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,629
Why is your stepmom your first love?

871
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:18,800
She was the most beautiful woman
in my eyes when I was little.

872
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,636
She was like an angel.

873
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,263
-Is she pretty?
-Yes. She still is.

874
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,474
How do you feel about her now?

875
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,977
She's like a friend and an older sister.

876
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,605
I call her Ms. Kim in a friendly way.

877
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,024
How does she feel about you?

878
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:37,777
Probably the same way I do.

879
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:42,240
A reliable son and a younger brother.

880
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,659
A mischievous little brother.

881
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:45,952
What's important is,

882
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:49,205
nothing has changed
throughout the decades.

883
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:53,918
She always listens intently to what I say.

884
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:56,546
She's never been annoyed by me, I think.

885
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:59,132
Did you ever want to marry her as a kid?

886
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,552
Is this Truth or Dare?

887
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:03,720
I'm just asking.

888
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,349
She and my dad got married
less than two years

889
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:09,976
after my birth mother passed away.

890
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,146
I didn't know back then.

891
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:16,607
But I think they had
feelings for each other

892
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:18,943
even back when my mother was alive.

893
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:22,029
Here.

894
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:27,827
It's so good.

895
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:31,664
You're not eating?

896
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:35,293
I'm full. I had too much for dinner.

897
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:38,212
They say you never know
what the future holds.

898
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,632
-What if you don't return?
-Is that what you want?

899
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,092
No.

900
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:46,095
Do you want me to come back?

901
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:52,268
Whether you're here or in the US,
you should do what you want.

902
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,234
You must be thirsty
since there's no water.

903
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:01,944
I was enjoying it.

904
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,654
You could get indigestion again.

905
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:05,531
Wash your hands at my place.

906
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,908
I have wet wipes in my car.

907
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,411
It's cold. Get in the car for a bit.

908
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,303
-Guess what this is.
-A gift?

909
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:28,805
-Yes.
-Cookies.

910
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,767
-You can't get out until you get it right.
-Chocolate?

911
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:33,935
-Candy?
-No.

912
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:35,520
A cake. Bread.

913
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:38,648
Put your seat belt on.

914
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,266
Let me sniff it.

915
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:24,045
-Who the hell are you?
-I'll wait until you change your mind.

916
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:26,172
How did you know I'm a fortune-teller?

917
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,840
So this is about Nam Ga-bin?

918
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,717
She's perfect for you.

919
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,427
I won't be shackled at this age.

920
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,054
This is Nam Ga-bin.

921
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:36,349
Remember how I offered
to treat you to a meal before the seminar?

922
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:37,975
Do you have a date in mind?

923
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:41,312
-Any day will be fine.
-Why isn't she calling me back?

924
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:43,481
I'm sure she's back home now.

925
01:05:43,564 --> 01:05:45,232
That ungrateful wench.

926
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,361
She couldn't have married Yu-sin
if it wasn't for me.

927
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:49,862
Don't you think Pi-young…

928
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:52,949
Don't you also feel like she belittles me?

929
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:54,784
-Why barely?
-I couldn't sleep.

930
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:56,953
-Were you excited?
-I have something to say.

931
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:59,455
Could you please come back here?

932
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:01,457
-Why not?
-I see you as a woman.

933
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,834
-Let's go anywhere.
-Heaven or hell?

934
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:08,923
