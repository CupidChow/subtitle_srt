1
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,435
-Hello.
-Water.

2
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:01,895
Where's the water?

3
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,521
Over there.

4
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,274
EPISODE 5

5
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,905
The hairtail soup…

6
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,824
Do you get sick just by thinking about it?

7
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,871
What a bad boy.

8
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,250
Wait. It may not be a boy.

9
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,502
It could be a girl.

10
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,713
-Let's go.
-Do you feel better now?

11
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:29,714
Are you okay?

12
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,352
Hello?

13
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,563
Is this Ms. Lee Si-eun?

14
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,857
Yes.

15
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,568
This is Nam Ga-bin.

16
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,488
Yes.

17
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,074
I heard you got into a fender bender.

18
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,450
Are you okay?

19
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,660
I am.

20
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,829
I'd like to meet you in person.

21
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,956
I think it's only right.

22
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:07,794
So you can see how old I look
and justify your actions?

23
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,337
Would you prefer not to?

24
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,423
What did Hae-ryun say?
Did he put you up to this?

25
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,468
No. This is my idea.

26
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,389
If you're uncomfortable,

27
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,393
-I'll hang up.
-Where do you want to meet?

28
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,938
Do you know a cafe called Deung
across from the Gangnam Department Store?

29
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,064
I do.

30
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,777
I'll eat anything you can't stomach.

31
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,864
Wait. Would the smell bother you?

32
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,575
Full-course dinners don't usually have
a strong smell.

33
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,326
You were always beautiful,

34
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,370
but today, you're exceptional.

35
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,041
You're the first woman
to exude such an aura.

36
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,254
What about me?

37
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:56,467
You've always looked lovely to me.

38
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,177
Really?

39
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,848
We've seen each other do everything
except for sleep.

40
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:06,477
We haven't seen each other singing
or dancing either.

41
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,938
Do you want me to show you?
Let's go to a karaoke.

42
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,192
If not, I'd be happy to sing for you
in the car.

43
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,820
I'll sing traditional Korean songs

44
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,488
or even do the funky chicken.

45
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,324
I am curious.

46
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,910
I'd like to see that.

47
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,927
I thought you liked rough hands.

48
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,931
I just wanted to get a good look

49
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,141
to see if our baby's hands
will resemble yours.

50
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,270
Then I should show you my feet too.

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,655
I love you.

52
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,159
I said, I love you.

53
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,044
I wanted to tell you last time,

54
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,047
but the words just didn't come out.

55
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,298
Thank you.

56
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,802
I heard most men are embarrassed
to say that.

57
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,512
But it's the truth.

58
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,597
They're embarrassed
because they don't mean it.

59
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,019
What about you? Do you love me?

60
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,023
There are times

61
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:38,278
when you can feel their love
but still want confirmation.

62
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,196
I'll think of you often.

63
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,991
Perhaps, always.

64
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,744
When I go to bed and when I wake up.

65
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,665
Let's decide on a time.

66
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,168
When we go to bed and when we wake up…

67
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,131
Then maybe we might be able
to read each other's thoughts

68
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,591
with our hearts.

69
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,232
I can't feel anything right now.

70
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,693
That's because I'm right in front of you.

71
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,531
Can I sit beside you?

72
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,621
I want to sit next to you today.

73
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,417
If I could,

74
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,128
I'd treat her to a delicious meal
right now.

75
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,965
I hope she'll safely carry
our precious grandchild.

76
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,468
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, sir?

77
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,679
-Do you argue with your wife?
-Of course, sir.

78
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,557
-How do you reconcile?
-I let it run its course.

79
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,018
The old saying is true.

80
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:56,230
They say couples should always sleep
in the same bed even after a fight.

81
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,982
That's right.

82
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,027
What a shame that we sleep
in separate beds.

83
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,283
You must have visited China often.

84
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,243
Of course.

85
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,872
-I haven't even been to Beijing.
-Really?

86
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,832
After passing the bar exam,

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,752
I worked like a dog.

88
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:23,007
Only after joining my friend's law firm
did I finally get to live life.

89
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:27,053
Then I got a gym membership, met you,

90
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,138
and had Bada.

91
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,352
Can I hold your hand?

92
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,736
-Doesn't my face look gaunt?
-You look haggard.

93
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,821
Caress me.

94
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,372
I wanted to make you laugh,

95
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,874
but I can't think of anything.

96
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,835
I'm drawing a blank.

97
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,589
I won't be able to caress
your growing belly.

98
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,760
I won't be able to make you laugh

99
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,473
or let Bada hear me laugh.

100
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,103
Since I'm the youngest kid in my family,

101
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,564
I could act like a baby if I wanted.

102
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,112
Don't you want to see that?

103
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,325
I'll use my imagination.

104
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,412
To be frank, I have something to confess.

105
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,499
It may make you want to slap me.

106
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,544
That night

107
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,046
when you got drunk,

108
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,509
I kissed you.

109
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:50,720
On my lips?

110
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,307
-Your forehead.
-Don't lie.

111
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,518
When I was passed out?

112
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,563
No. It was right before that.

113
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,736
Then why can't I remember it?

114
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:11,365
Do you remember putting
the muffler around my neck?

115
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,210
Stay in place just like that.

116
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,254
-What are you going to do?
-I'm going to disappear.

117
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:30,676
I haven't had such a good time in a while.

118
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,846
My hands are warm too.

119
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,099
Thank you.

120
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,520
How do I look right now…

121
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,815
standing here?

122
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,734
Like Daddy-Long-Legs.

123
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:48,945
I mean…

124
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,280
an oppa.

125
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,389
I couldn't help myself.

126
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,017
This may sound like an excuse,

127
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,479
but you just looked too lovely in my eyes.

128
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,658
In retrospect,

129
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,620
I've had feelings for you
ever since we first met.

130
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,374
Excuse me.

131
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,256
-Enjoy your food.
-Thank you.

132
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,300
Are you offended?

133
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,515
It's a yes if this makes me nauseous.

134
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,132
I'm going to cheat on him at least once.

135
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,010
That'll help me forgive him and move on.

136
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,557
I'm doing well.

137
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,310
I'll visit you for Christmas.

138
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,771
Goodbye.

139
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,442
It's my sister-in-law.

140
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,751
I'm not doing this as a formality.

141
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,086
I want to put this on you.

142
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,595
This is how I feel.

143
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:25,184
I had wanted to get a massive one,
but it would've been too heavy.

144
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,055
It fits me perfectly.

145
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,644
But I didn't get you anything.

146
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:14,150
That baby is my gift.
I bet it has grown big already.

147
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:24,243
I told the sales clerk that you had
a similar size, and it was a size seven.

148
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,911
Thank you.

149
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,374
I'll wear it and keep it safe.

150
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,879
I didn't buy my wedding ring myself.

151
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,424
But I spent my own money on this.

152
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,970
You always give me joy.

153
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:02,364
Couldn't you have come out
with an umbrella since it's raining?

154
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,201
Was it that hard to come out to the yard?

155
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,640
Get lost.

156
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,061
-"Get lost"?
-Unless you want a good beating.

157
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,481
I'm speechless.

158
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,733
You should know when to stop.

159
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,568
You're one to talk.

160
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,695
Look how brazen you are.

161
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,448
Gosh, my back.

162
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,660
My back.

163
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:51,914
Gosh, it hurts.

164
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,176
You're as strong as an ox.

165
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,597
You could have broken my hip.

166
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,060
Had the weather been colder,
it would have snowed.

167
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,105
Do you like the snow?

168
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,607
Only when I'm not driving.

169
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,320
Is the sky crying for us?

170
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:29,326
When my brother had his first blind date
in college…

171
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,830
He takes after our mom,
so he has thin, straight hair.

172
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,666
-Does he have weak, flat hair?
-Yes.

173
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:39,503
He blow-dried his hair
to make it less flat, but it didn't work.

174
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,714
Straight hair easily flattens.

175
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,007
Exactly.

176
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:47,386
Our housekeeper told him
that he should use a straightener,

177
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,388
so he let her do his hair.

178
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,558
While straightening his forelock,
she burned his forehead.

179
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,228
He immediately got a burn.

180
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,356
It was right in the center,
so he couldn't even use a Band-Aid.

181
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,818
He couldn't just apply ointment
or wear a hat.

182
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,154
It could've turned into a blister.

183
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,239
Right. He ended up not going.

184
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,450
He must've been bummed out.

185
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:13,329
His friend went in his place,
and apparently, she was gorgeous.

186
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,664
He was jealous and upset.

187
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,541
Did those two end up dating?

188
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,126
I don't know about that.

189
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,130
How is his relationship with his wife?

190
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:27,635
They're neither passionate
nor indifferent to each other.

191
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,428
They look comfortable.

192
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,348
Passion and pain go hand in hand.

193
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,809
Perhaps that's better than being in pain.

194
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:40,147
Are you like that?
Do you prefer a bland relationship?

195
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,273
I'm not sure.

196
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:46,236
I want a relationship
that doesn't end in regret.

197
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,115
What do you think lies
at the end of our journey?

198
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,202
I will pine for you always.

199
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:57,373
When I open my eyes tomorrow,
I'll already be missing you.

200
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,042
I'll miss you

201
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,670
and want to chat with you.

202
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,439
It stopped raining.

203
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,037
Whenever you need to see the doctor,

204
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,956
make sure you go with my mom.

205
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,543
I'll tell her to keep you company, okay?

206
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,504
And one more thing.

207
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,924
I want to be there when you give birth.

208
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,969
Call me immediately
when you get contractions.

209
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:56,181
Even if the sky falls down,
I'll be by your side.

210
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,226
I won't leave you to suffer alone.

211
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,936
I'll hold your hand.

212
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,606
We need to welcome Bada together.

213
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,122
I'll walk you to the door.

214
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,002
Let's just say our goodbyes here.

215
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,470
Do you still have the gloves I bought you?

216
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,931
Of course.

217
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:48,233
I carry them at all times
and wear them when I'm cold.

218
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,988
What about the muffler I gave you?

219
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:57,034
Of course, I still have it.
Should I send a photo of it tomorrow?

220
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,039
I have a favor.

221
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,834
Don't change your number.

222
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,629
Even though I won't call you,

223
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,090
knowing it will give me
a sense of comfort.

224
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,931
Bada.

225
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,434
Don't give your mom a hard time

226
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,561
but be a good baby.

227
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:30,025
I hope she'll be able to stomach
nutritious food soon.

228
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,402
I will always be…

229
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:38,659
by you and your mom's side.

230
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:33,088
Promise me you'll stay healthy
until we meet again.

231
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,799
And don't forget me.

232
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,172
I'm going to be okay.

233
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,134
I'm going to be okay.

234
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,511
I'm going to be okay.

235
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,183
This is going to end happily
no matter what.

236
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,019
I won't cry.

237
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,156
I love that you're here.

238
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,325
I don't feel anxious
when I come home late.

239
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,411
Why didn't you drink more?
Wasn't this gathering long overdue?

240
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,538
Everyone wanted to

241
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,749
except for him.

242
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,834
Why not?

243
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:19,004
You should've enjoyed yourselves
and relieved some stress.

244
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,590
I'm almost done anyway.

245
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,885
Yun-cheol ruined it for me.

246
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,181
You just let him help you
with the meat slices.

247
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,434
You're a sensitive type.
Did you not notice?

248
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,687
The meat slices were sticky,

249
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,315
so he held them down with his chopsticks.

250
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,108
-What's wrong with that?
-What?

251
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,443
He was just helping.

252
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,614
He should've tended to his own wife,
not mine.

253
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,288
-That offended you?
-How could it not?

254
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,624
He just helped me pick a slice of meat.

255
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,543
He was just being considerate.
No, he was being polite.

256
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,712
Then you should've lent a hand beforehand.

257
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,090
You're right.

258
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,216
I was busy chatting.

259
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,510
So your hands were free.

260
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,762
You could've helped me while chatting.

261
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,014
-Don't smile at me.
-Are you taking it out on me?

262
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,392
If I were you, I wouldn't have eaten it
since he touched it.

263
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,144
How could I not?

264
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,523
How could I not eat it
just because he touched it?

265
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:23,026
He's not a stranger.
How could I do that to your friend?

266
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,778
You could have left it on your plate.

267
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:30,117
Did it make you happy?
You ate another slice right after.

268
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,371
You could've divorced me

269
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,164
-had I done what he did.
-You bet.

270
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,375
This isn't like you.

271
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,836
-I can understand him.
-Right?

272
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,631
Imagine him doing the same thing
for another woman. Would you be happy?

273
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,883
I'd just think that he's being polite.

274
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,095
Fine. During our next gathering,

275
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:54,099
I'll watch my friends' wives eat
and immediately lend a hand

276
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,309
if they need help.

277
00:23:58,937 --> 00:23:59,771
I take it back.

278
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,982
-What if it happens again?
-Like you said,

279
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,985
I'll just put it on my plate.
It won't happen again.

280
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:10,115
Korean men are awfully considerate
toward other women

281
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,367
and not their wives.

282
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,536
-Right?
-Not me.

283
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,747
I didn't know you could get jealous.

284
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,499
I'm a man too.

285
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,626
A man's jealousy is more terrifying.

286
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,718
-I hated you back there.
-Did you, now?

287
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,137
-If I had it my way--
-If you had it your way?

288
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,265
"You bastard. Take care of your own wife."

289
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,311
I wanted to say that.
She didn't look too happy either.

290
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,396
We locked eyes.

291
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:44,191
She looked unhappy.
They could be arguing right now.

292
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,901
I was too busy listening to you.

293
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,777
Speaking of which,

294
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,113
you should just be a housewife.

295
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,949
I bet those men at your workplace
drool all over you.

296
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,159
Of course.

297
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,538
Where are you going?

298
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,042
To the study.

299
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,627
I'm writing a resignation letter.

300
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,128
It's for your resignation.

301
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,797
Wait.

302
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,384
Do you want to write it yourself?

303
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,346
Never. It's not like that at all.

304
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:17,515
I had you by my side,
so I was just busy eating.

305
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,484
I'm getting dizzy.

306
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,444
Don't you like riding airplanes?

307
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,487
Let me down.

308
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,785
I'm getting dizzy.

309
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,788
Let me down.

310
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,665
How about upside down?

311
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,542
Let me down.

312
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,885
Laugh while you still can.

313
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,765
Did you listen to our show?

314
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,686
-I have no time to slack off.
-What about the news?

315
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,730
Nam Ga-bin's seeing someone.

316
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,941
-Was she on your show?
-Yes.

317
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,531
She wants me to know.
She's trying to stir up jealousy.

318
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,867
I will get married and show him.

319
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,209
GET READY

320
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,682
Watch me raise a happy family, Dong-ma,

321
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,852
while you struggle to settle down
and age helplessly.

322
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,980
Thank you.

323
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,959
-Guess who I saw?
-No one.

324
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,338
-Nam Ga-bin.
-Seriously? Where?

325
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,757
-You know Deung, right? The brunch cafe.
-Yes.

326
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,300
I saw her on my way out.

327
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:18,386
I wanted to ask for her autograph,
but I was too shy.

328
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,222
I just got off at Gangnam Station.

329
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,476
What a shame.
I just got in my boyfriend's car.

330
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,282
Hello.

331
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,410
-Hello.
-I'm a fan.

332
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,163
-May I ask for your autograph?
-Sure.

333
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,808
Hello.

334
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,697
Did you have breakfast?

335
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,657
Yes.

336
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,494
They serve a variety of beverages here.

337
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,912
A latte, please.

338
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,647
Do you have today off?

339
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,149
I have to step out for a bit.

340
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,651
Stay home if it's not important.

341
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,529
If they're groceries,
I can buy them on my way home.

342
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,907
It's an important gathering.

343
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,424
Excuse me.

344
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,060
-Black tea, please.
-Sure.

345
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,857
First of all,

346
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,236
I'd like to apologize.

347
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:25,740
But then again, I don't deserve
to say anything to you.

348
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,034
How did it begin?

349
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,577
I understand

350
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,747
that you could know each other
due to your professions.

351
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,999
But just as acquaintances.

352
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,919
But you've torn our family apart.

353
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,217
I didn't see this coming either.

354
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,595
I was a part-time lecturer
during the first semester.

355
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,514
-This year?
-Yes.

356
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,395
So, you like my husband.

357
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,440
I just can't wrap my head around it.

358
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,777
I could understand
if you were an average person.

359
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,447
But why would a celebrity
fall for a married man?

360
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,409
You're right.

361
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,703
But regardless--

362
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:12,996
You were attracted to him?

363
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,457
-Who first?
-My feelings…

364
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:19,836
just grew naturally.

365
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,172
Do you think it's natural
to fall for a married man?

366
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,468
I know this won't make it any better,

367
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,429
but I'm sorry.

368
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,235
Does he talk about his kids
every now and then?

369
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,653
These days…

370
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,159
Drink.

371
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,244
He may not show it,

372
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,581
-but he's in pain.
-How exactly?

373
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,877
I know he isn't, so don't cover for him.

374
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,881
What do you want to hear from me?

375
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,426
I won't curse at you.

376
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,261
I've just accepted it.

377
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:30,031
-I'm his daughter.
-Hyang-gi.

378
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,617
I was dying to see
whom Dad had cheated with.

379
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,161
To see what kind of a tramp
he abandoned his family for

380
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,205
and forced his wife
into getting a divorce.

381
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,499
I can see why, now.

382
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,211
-Keep your voice down.
-Why him?

383
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,798
Why would you, of all people, fall…

384
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,175
for a married man?

385
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,761
Did you not consider his family?

386
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,513
My brother is only in fifth grade.

387
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,264
Did you not consider

388
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,642
the pain and shock we'd be in?

389
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,646
What did your parents say?
Are they pleased?

390
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:06,109
Are they proud that
their daughter is a homewrecker?

391
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,319
-Hyang-gi.
-It's common decency.

392
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,988
Marriage is for two single people

393
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,699
and a father's duty is to love
and take care of his family.

394
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,786
And yet, you like our dad?
Do you love him?

395
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,289
Answer me if you're shameless.

396
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,167
When is your wedding? Invite us.

397
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,378
Let us sprinkle some petals over you two.

398
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,798
Are you upset?

399
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,011
Is anything I said not true?

400
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:47,108
I relied on him a lot.

401
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,237
Then he grew on me.

402
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,073
Him, of all people?

403
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,575
Yes.

404
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,412
I was emotionally unstable.

405
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:02,540
I had ended a four-year relationship…

406
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,544
and was still in pain.

407
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,087
Did he comfort you?

408
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,091
Did his comforting words cause you
to develop feelings for him?

409
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,802
After being hurt
by a man with loose morals,

410
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:21,100
I was attracted to his warm
and compassionate personality.

411
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:27,607
In the beginning, I was just grateful.

412
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,320
Are you getting married?

413
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,869
I'm sorry.

414
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,875
I was selfish.
I was only concerned about my pain.

415
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,129
It wasn't an easy decision.

416
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,217
I haven't told my parents yet.

417
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,552
Do you think
they'll give you their blessing?

418
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,100
Are you confident
that you won't regret this?

419
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,353
Do you think you'll have a long
and happy marriage?

420
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,646
For now, yes.

421
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,068
But of course, I'll have to try my best.

422
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,529
Do you think I didn't?

423
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,454
I know this is ridiculous,

424
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,209
but please be understanding.

425
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,211
You're asking for too much.

426
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,630
You want my understanding?

427
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,842
Do you have more to say?

428
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,720
It's your life.

429
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,683
I didn't introduce you to each other.

430
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,352
I can't give you my blessing.

431
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,771
But I don't want to curse at you either.

432
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,572
I hope we won't see each other ever again.

433
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,941
-I'm going for a walk.
-Is there a lot on your mind?

434
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,151
A bit.

435
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,158
-Hello?
-You picked up right away.

436
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,993
-Are you feeling better?
-Yes.

437
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,786
I should send flowers daily.

438
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,788
-You sent flowers?
-Yes.

439
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:51,042
-Aren't you home?
-Almost. I just got off the elevator.

440
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,585
I see them.

441
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,297
I'll call you when I'm inside.

442
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,381
Okay.

443
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,437
-Yes?
-Thank you. They're so pretty.

444
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,690
A grown woman like you
shouldn't be out by yourself.

445
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,610
-I thought it was the flowers.
-Can we meet?

446
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:20,071
I only have my phone.
I'm in my neighborhood.

447
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,240
Take a cab. I'll come down.

448
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,512
Can you ask your dad
for musical actress Nam Ga-bin's address?

449
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,889
I'll tell you later.

450
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,809
Yes, right now.

451
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,355
I've been casted.

452
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,274
-In a drama?
-A movie.

453
00:37:56,816 --> 00:38:00,027
It's a small but important role.
I'm the lead actor's first love.

454
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,612
-Is it confirmed?
-Yes.

455
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,447
The director said I'm perfect.

456
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,034
His name is Namgung Hyeok.
They've begun filming.

457
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:11,205
-When will you start?
-Around Christmas.

458
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,041
You must've known
and bought those flowers.

459
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,793
Yes. They're congratulatory flowers.

460
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,674
Your time in Korea paid off.

461
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,801
You've reaped the fruit of your labor.

462
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,219
Yes.

463
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,305
This is only the beginning.

464
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,933
Can't we have dinner together?

465
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,188
Let's have a grand celebration tomorrow
at Sky Hotel.

466
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,316
UNIT 501, VARCITY APARTMENT BUILDING 910
126 YUHUI-RO

467
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:16,937
Doors are opening.

468
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,457
What brings you here?
How did you know this address?

469
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,758
Can I not come here?

470
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,517
Let go!

471
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,729
I have to see Nam Ga-bin!

472
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,443
Why won't you let me talk to her?

473
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,530
What are you so afraid of?
I thought you were shameless?

474
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:08,823
Let's talk at home.

475
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,575
Hyang-gi, this isn't right!

476
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,202
Then what's right?

477
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,829
Don't cross the line!

478
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,499
Look who's talking.
How dare you expect that from me?

479
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,089
Don't let others see you like this.

480
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,091
What about you?

481
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,969
Were you so lovely and respectable?

482
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,139
Let go of me!

483
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,350
I said, let go!

484
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,126
Wear your seatbelt.

485
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,971
I would have killed myself
if it wasn't for Mom.

486
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,819
To be honest,
I'm ashamed of myself as well.

487
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,572
So I thought about it one sleepless night.

488
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,617
At first…

489
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:39,038
I'd eat the food your mom made,

490
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,666
wear the clothes she ironed,
and meet that woman.

491
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,252
I just felt happy.

492
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:50,132
Like back in the day when I'd meet
your mom after having my mom's food.

493
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:57,306
Then I started to get butterflies
in my stomach,

494
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,807
and wanted to be with her more.

495
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:02,478
You'll understand once you fall in love.

496
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:07,525
When you live under the same roof
with someone for decades,

497
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,903
such feelings disappear.

498
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:15,157
It's no different to how children feel
about their parents.

499
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,953
She's just someone I'm grateful for.

500
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,957
It felt like I was on a date
while living with my family.

501
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:29,338
At first, I didn't feel any guilt.
Then we came this far.

502
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,882
It wasn't intended.

503
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,094
Had the feeling not been mutual,
it would've ended there.

504
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,180
I tried to stop myself,

505
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:41,016
but I failed due to my lack of restraint.

506
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,644
You know this already.

507
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,693
Can't you force yourself to understand?

508
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,612
I know I'm in the wrong.

509
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:57,533
It's shameless of me, but I beg you.

510
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:04,415
Time doesn't only change your appearance

511
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,834
but also your heart.

512
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:11,338
The air around us grows leaves on trees.

513
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,799
In spring, flowers bloom.

514
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:17,386
In summer, the trees are evergreen.

515
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,097
In fall, the once fresh leaves

516
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:24,518
change color and fall in the wind.

517
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,729
Only the bare branches are left behind.

518
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:30,524
Then there are evergreens that boast
green leaves even in frigid winters.

519
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:33,277
Just like those trees,

520
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,239
there are many couples that remain
happily married.

521
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,991
However…

522
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:43,746
your mom and I were unhappy.
We were broadleaf trees

523
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,497
if we were to compare.

524
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,751
I'm being candid with you.

525
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:53,672
I tormented myself,
wondering if I was truly this worthless.

526
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,216
But I couldn't help it.

527
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,219
Even if I ended it with her,

528
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:04,558
I'll always be remembered
as a pathetic father

529
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,936
who betrayed his own family.

530
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,860
What can I do to make you feel better?

531
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,099
Let me massage you.

532
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:48,352
-It's okay.
-Come on. Scoot over.

533
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,480
You have a knot.

534
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,816
I should return the kindness.

535
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:57,277
-That feels amazing.
-I'm still useful, you know?

536
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,570
Don't be ridiculous.

537
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,951
Why isn't Yu-sin home yet?
Did he go out for a long walk?

538
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:07,371
He just put on a puffer jacket and left.

539
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:10,165
Given his stamina,
he won't be satisfied with a short walk.

540
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,209
You should thank me.

541
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:15,379
I taught him well and raised him
as an upright man.

542
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,881
Many men these days lie to their wives.

543
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,050
I can see that.

544
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:23,345
Instead of gambling, drinking, or women,
he loves to work out.

545
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:26,223
But he doesn't overdo it.

546
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,600
He works out just enough.

547
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:32,229
Thanks to that, he has a young body
compared to his age.

548
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,817
Speak of the devil.

549
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:40,404
-My gosh.
-The knot's still there.

550
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,619
What is this sight?

551
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:49,872
-Your roles have changed.
-You're right.

552
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,957
There's a knot in her shoulder.

553
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,751
Have you been walking all this time?

554
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,671
I was tired when I got to Gangnam Park,
so I took a cab home.

555
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:01,049
-I'm famished.
-I'll make you roast beef.

556
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,259
Roast beef?

557
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,721
You two are such meat-lovers.

558
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,641
Let me.

559
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:12,978
Bye.

560
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,240
Hyang-gi.

561
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:35,250
What did you say? Evergreens?
Broadleaf trees?

562
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:38,587
How dare you glamorize your affair?

563
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,924
I'm enduring this pain as well.
What more do you expect?

564
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:44,968
Do you want me to kneel?

565
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,137
Will begging make you feel better?

566
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,182
This is a filthy world
full of filthy humans!

567
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:53,060
Love is always portrayed
as something beautiful,

568
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,144
but that's wrong.

569
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,772
I will never fall in love!

570
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,318
How could he betray us like this?

571
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,861
What is truth?

572
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,447
Truth is unchanging.
I was destined to be his daughter?

573
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:08,784
To hell with it. It's useless!

574
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:12,788
Who said such ties last forever?

575
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,333
He broke it off so easily.

576
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,459
He abandoned us

577
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:21,088
and fell head over heels
for a young, pretty, and talented woman.

578
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,714
He left us in a heartbeat!

579
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,218
He was terrified I'd do something to her.

580
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:28,887
He was worried I'd harm her,

581
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,390
so he dragged me out of there
like he would a dog.

582
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:43,819
He left us battered and anguished.

583
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,404
I can barely sleep at night.

584
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:48,115
I can't even focus on my studies.

585
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,453
That stranger he only just met

586
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,456
must have been awfully precious to him.

587
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,294
-What kind of bastard drags his daughter--
-"Bastard"?

588
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,549
Do you want me to be honest?

589
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,970
-Even that's a compliment.
-How dare you?

590
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:20,689
Park Hae-ryun,
you must be out of your mind.

591
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,150
How dare you?

592
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,153
Call Nam Ga-bin.

593
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:30,824
I was courteous enough
to let her off the hook.

594
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,369
Let her see this side of you!

595
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:37,122
Show her your true colors!

596
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,431
You have the gall
to raise your hand at her

597
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:57,184
after everything you did?

598
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,393
Think about her!

599
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:03,190
You ripped her heart into pieces.

600
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:05,275
Have you forgotten everything?

601
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:09,655
We were so happy when she was born.

602
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,325
Is this all you got?

603
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:19,539
Haven't you done enough already?

604
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:31,301
Tell her to come here or just get out.

605
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,471
You disgust me.

606
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:38,392
Don't you dare come back again.

607
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,312
I don't even want
to hear your voice anymore.

608
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:46,608
Don't you even dare come to my funeral.

609
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:49,444
We're done for!

610
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:26,940
Mom…

611
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:50,589
We're going to be late.

612
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,180
What's that?

613
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,640
-What?
-That muffler.

614
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,184
It's cold out.

615
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,441
-What is it?
-It's dowdy.

616
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:13,028
No, it's not. It's wool.

617
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,959
-Did she get it for you?
-No.

618
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:33,048
Right. I doubt she'd try to win him back
with something that cheap-looking.

619
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,842
How much was it?

620
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,469
Around 30,000 won.

621
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:40,847
It's tacky.
It'll make you look shabby as well.

622
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,853
Hello, sir.

623
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,399
When?

624
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:52,818
Sounds great.

625
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,363
You can pick who to invite.

626
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,448
Okay.

627
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:03,870
Remember when I told you
about General Nami's previous life?

628
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,288
Do you remember that?

629
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:12,087
I must have mistreated your dad
in our previous lives.

630
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:13,964
I must have been evil.

631
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:17,342
In Catholicism, they say
you only have yourself to blame.

632
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,886
That could be true.

633
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,306
So, you're to blame?

634
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,560
Are you saying he cheated on you
because of your shortcomings?

635
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,229
I could have been that way
in my previous life.

636
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,647
That's absurd.

637
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,859
Does thinking that way bring you peace?

638
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:37,112
If I could be happy by being mad at him,
I'd do that.

639
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,906
But it reaps nothing.

640
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:43,577
If that's the case,
then we should change our attitude.

641
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:48,999
What were you going to do
once you saw her?

642
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,917
I wanted to hear her thoughts.

643
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,587
I couldn't understand why
she fell for a married man.

644
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,171
I know love has no boundaries,

645
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:57,090
but I just can't wrap my head around it.

646
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:58,884
It's Nam Ga-bin, of all people.

647
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,846
How could someone who radiates
on stage do such a thing?

648
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,640
Was that the only reason
why you went there?

649
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,392
I didn't go there with a purpose.

650
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:12,522
I just wanted to tell her our story
and see if she'd still choose him.

651
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,901
I wanted her to know his true colors.

652
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:19,362
He probably only showed his good side
just like he did to us.

653
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:23,325
Let's say she had a change of heart
and ended it with him.

654
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,410
Then what about your dad?

655
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,456
Even if he comes back,

656
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,334
we won't ever be the same.

657
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:33,960
That's impossible.

658
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,838
He will no longer be respected

659
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,423
or loved by us.

660
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,927
Do you think we'll be happy

661
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,054
if we watched him grow old and lonely?

662
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,891
We may be happy that he's miserable
for a brief moment.

663
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:52,646
Let's just accept it.

664
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,440
I know it's easier said than done,

665
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:58,151
but we should at least try.

666
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:02,948
I know how tough and confusing
this must be for you.

667
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:08,036
The once doting father
fell in love with another woman.

668
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:11,790
With one of my favorite celebrities.

669
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:16,211
I know. You must be dumbstruck
and devastated.

670
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:19,464
Husband and wife meet as two strangers.

671
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:22,384
If they part ways,
they just end up being strangers again.

672
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:26,388
But children are destined to be a part
of their lives. They're the bloodline.

673
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:30,350
I understand that this world
may seem filthy and pathetic.

674
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,726
I do.

675
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:36,106
But you see, we're all the same.

676
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:41,111
It shouldn't be
"Frailty, thy name is woman,"

677
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:45,323
but "Frailty, thy name is human."

678
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,742
Humans are strong, yet contradictory.

679
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,037
But when we're weak,
we can be the frailest of all.

680
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:58,211
To help myself endure this,
I thought of all the books I've read.

681
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,131
In the end…

682
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:05,385
I believe I reaped what I sowed.

683
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:09,597
Aren't peaches your favorite fruit?

684
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:13,727
To grow peaches,
you should plant a peach seed.

685
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:17,939
You can't plant a pumpkin seed
and expect peaches to grow.

686
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,859
It's the same thing.

687
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:26,448
To reap the fruit of happiness,
you need to plant the right seeds.

688
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:31,036
I guess none of us did that.

689
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:37,375
If you hurt someone
the same way they hurt you,

690
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:40,670
you'll be no different from them.

691
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:45,175
I failed to control myself earlier
and humiliated myself.

692
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:46,676
You did nothing wrong.

693
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,847
God told us to love our enemies.

694
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,684
We may not be able to love him,

695
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,896
but we shouldn't hate him
for what he's done.

696
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:03,318
We shouldn't blame anyone
and just move on.

697
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:07,822
Filling ourselves with hatred
and resentment won't do us any good.

698
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:11,785
It'll only make us angrier and exhausted.

699
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:20,085
Let's focus on our lives from now on.

700
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:24,047
Let's not waste any time and emotion.

701
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,801
We create our own lives.

702
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,719
It's up to us

703
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:33,098
whether to plant flower seeds
or seeds of tears and grief.

704
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,599
Let's choose the former.

705
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:38,019
Let's plant seeds of happiness.

706
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,814
I've let go of it now.

707
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:46,069
Nam Ga-bin couldn't drink a single sip
in front of me.

708
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:49,614
A part of me felt sorry for her.

709
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:50,824
Are you a saint?

710
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:53,326
It all depends on attitude.

711
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,703
Here's a well-known example.

712
00:56:56,704 --> 00:57:00,416
Some people say a glass is half empty,

713
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:03,586
while others say it's half full.

714
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:09,259
No one has a perfect life.

715
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:15,265
Isn't it better for me to be healthy
without your dad

716
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:18,476
than to get sick while living happily
with him?

717
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,148
I feel the same way.

718
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:27,902
Rather than seeing my children in pain
while living with their dad,

719
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:31,239
I'd rather live a healthy life
with you two.

720
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:34,492
I'd be much happier that way.

721
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,620
It'd be nice for both you and U-ram

722
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:41,166
to become wealthy, successful individuals.

723
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,294
But I'd rather you become individuals

724
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:49,549
who refuse to be swayed
and are able to control your emotions.

725
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:52,677
That's much harder to do
and is much more impressive.

726
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,304
Not everyone can do that.

727
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,432
And I'll try harder as well.

728
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:59,726
You're already like that.

729
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,858
Don't let him find out.

730
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:14,782
-Did you behave? Did you have fun?
-I did.

731
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,336
Did you scold her?

732
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:30,173
No. Something upsetting happened.

733
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:31,966
What was it?

734
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:24,477
I want to know you

735
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:31,109
All to myself

736
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:38,408
I want to have you

737
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:44,998
All to myself

738
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,603
I heard you met my wife.

739
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:11,274
She must have been furious with you.

740
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:14,402
No. She wasn't what I expected.

741
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,947
-She was kind.
-You see,

742
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:20,783
I gave up everything for you.

743
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,952
If you want to end this,

744
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,580
I have no choice
but to respect your decision.

745
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,791
They say like knows like.

746
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,919
You're a woman too.

747
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,422
I'm a bad father

748
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,675
and a worthless husband.

749
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,971
I don't resent anyone.

750
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,599
It's all my fault.

751
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,852
I'll do as you say.

752
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:49,145
I'm more to blame.

753
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,898
Do you want to go back?

754
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:57,028
Even if you end things with me,
I'll never go back.

755
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:58,863
There's no turning back now.

756
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,707
You're the only one…

757
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,502
I have.

758
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:14,003
Likewise.

759
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:44,742
Honey?

760
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:07,306
Honey, will you greet me?

761
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,644
Have you forgiven me?

762
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,105
Are you up, ma'am?

763
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:22,989
I don't think it's a bad idea
for your mother to live with us.

764
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:25,992
Tell her that. She won't feel lonely here.

765
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,910
She takes great care of Ji-a.

766
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:30,580
Thanks to her, we can go on dates

767
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:33,207
without having to hurry back home.

768
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:38,129
She wants you to live here
even after you sell the house.

769
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:40,381
I'd love that. I'd have company here.

770
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:42,717
I'm more at ease with you
than I am with my own mother.

771
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,801
My gosh.

772
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,387
-I really am.
-Ji-a.

773
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:50,183
I should spend my time taking care of Ji-a
and take up charity.

774
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,351
Let's go.

775
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:27,845
It's been a while.
What would you like to do today?

776
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:31,057
-Young Master!
-Hello.

777
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,350
Take off your coat.

778
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,352
-We'll get your hair shampooed.
-Okay.

779
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:40,900
The gentleman from before
already paid for your drinks.

780
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,944
You should've asked us first.

781
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:45,655
He's one of our VIP customers. I'm sorry.

782
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:02,004
Do you remember me?

783
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:04,715
I do.

784
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:14,308
What if I barely get to see you
once you become famous?

785
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:16,811
I'm only shooting three scenes.

786
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:20,690
It happens. Some wake up in the morning
and realize they're famous.

787
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:22,692
Are you for it or against it?

788
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:26,028
It's important to achieve your dream.

789
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:29,031
Doing that will bring you happiness.

790
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:33,661
I'm already happy.
Success doesn't always lead to happiness.

791
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:46,632
A Mi.

792
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:48,843
Coming.

793
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:51,512
BEYOND LOVE

794
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:52,722
Hold on. Yes. There.

795
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:54,140
-Hello.
-Stop.

796
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,558
-Hello.
-Hello.

797
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:58,144
-More to the left.
-Yes, sir.

798
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:00,938
-Got it? Thank you.
-Yes.

799
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:19,040
RADIO STATION

800
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:21,250
-No way. It's Joo Bin!
-Joo Bin!

801
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:22,585
-No way!
-Joo Bin!

802
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:24,629
You're so handsome!

803
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:25,588
Marry me!

804
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:27,840
He's so handsome.
I've never seen him in person.

805
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:36,098
-Are you nervous?
-Slightly.

806
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:39,352
If you make a blooper,
you can do another take.

807
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:47,526
He's so charismatic.

808
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,488
Rumor has it that he's well-mannered.

809
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,115
Check out that aura.

810
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:55,910
Thank goodness, it's warm today.

811
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:58,371
Yesterday was freezing cold.

812
01:05:58,454 --> 01:05:59,538
-Let's begin.
-Okay.

813
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:00,998
Please be quiet.

814
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:03,918
Ready.

815
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:39,578
Again.

816
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:47,795
What brand is that jacket?

817
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:49,714
That color is rare.

818
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:51,841
I didn't buy it.

819
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:53,592
It was a gift.

820
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,762
Isn't it for men?

821
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,265
-Michelle.
-Coming.

822
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:03,769
My boyfriend gave it to me
so I could wear it on set.

823
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,957
How did this happen?

824
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:28,502
While horseback riding.
There was a heater.

825
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:32,089
You should've been more careful.
You can't buy it here.

826
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:34,884
-It's on the inside.
-Still.

827
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,094
We can't even fix this.

828
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:47,688
Yes, right here. Get ready.
Are we good to go?

829
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:48,814
Let's begin.

830
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:24,934
Do you have plans for Christmas?

831
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:25,851
No.

832
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:27,853
Please, just cut to the chase.

833
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,438
You must have plans for dinner.

834
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:30,773
I'd be willing to cancel it.

835
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:34,568
What show are they filming?

836
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:39,323
What do you mean?

837
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:41,992
-Everything comes to an end.
-Not now.

838
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:44,578
Ji-a's father is having an affair.

839
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:52,837
-Have this instead.
-Thank you, Mother.

840
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:11,063
