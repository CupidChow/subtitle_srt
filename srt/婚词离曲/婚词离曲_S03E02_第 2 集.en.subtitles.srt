00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,259
EPISODE 2

2
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,894
The number you dialed cannot be reached…

3
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,121
Aren't you cold, sir?

4
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,206
No, I'm not.

5
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,750
You must be healthy.

6
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,164
Where are you going?

7
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,415
To church.

8
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,085
Are you that lazy
to help out with breakfast?

9
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,590
What are you looking at?

10
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,390
They say death comes knocking
when you act out of the ordinary.

11
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,439
My father passed away.

12
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,194
Wait.

13
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,697
Then shouldn't you head to the airport?

14
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:45,206
VACANT

15
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,207
Thank you.

16
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,293
You can keep the change.

17
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,420
You can keep the change.

18
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,421
Thank you.

19
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,024
Hi there.

20
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,491
Hello.

21
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,872
A spirit was here. You know that, right?

22
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,207
His presence is strong.

23
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,754
Get lost this instant!

24
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,088
Shut it.

25
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,466
Yes, ma'am.

26
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,097
You're going to a shrine
in Bulsan-dong, right?

27
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,350
Hey.

28
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,396
Ji-a?

29
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,094
You look soft and weak.

30
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,430
Get a hold of yourself.

31
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,695
What brings you by, sweetie?

32
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,284
Are you alone?

33
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,206
That's not very ladylike.

34
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,708
Son, let's go golfing.

35
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,673
-Get ready.
-Ji-a, are you mimicking your grandpa?

36
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,803
Hey, where's your mom?

37
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:58,983
Kim Dong-mi!

38
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,076
You're the reason I…

39
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,745
You're the reason I…

40
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,538
Ji-a.

41
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,978
Ji-a!

42
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,980
I suffered a wrongful death!

43
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,775
And it was all because of her!

44
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,151
Let me go!

45
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,158
You can't hide, you b****!

46
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,835
Ji-a, what are you doing?

47
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,091
Come to your senses, Ji-a!

48
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,135
I could have lived longer.

49
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,846
Sir, that's not true.

50
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,931
Come with me! I won't go alone!

51
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,517
I'm scared!

52
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,228
I feel too enraged and wronged!

53
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,898
Oh, no! Help me!

54
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,903
Sir!

55
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,196
Sir!

56
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:33,619
Ji-a! It's me, your grandma!
Please come to your senses!

57
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,829
Help me take

58
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:36,747
my revenge.

59
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,261
Ji-a.

60
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,473
Ji-a!

61
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,620
Should we call the hospital?

62
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,913
Or 911?

63
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,221
Hello?

64
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,806
Pi-young, Ji-a is here. Did you know?

65
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,351
She went there?

66
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,686
Yes. And she attacked Dongchimi…

67
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,523
She attacked Ms. Kim.

68
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,441
She attacked her?

69
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,902
Yes. It's a long story. Please hurry.

70
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,410
Hello.

71
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,831
Yes. I know it's a bit early,

72
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,583
but I have good news.

73
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,003
Our grandchild was just born.

74
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,549
We don't know
whether it's a boy or a girl.

75
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,343
She just gave birth in the delivery room.

76
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,844
We're on our way there.

77
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,682
Song Yuan asked us to call you
once the baby was born

78
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,517
since she knew you'd be worried sick.

79
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,436
Thank you.

80
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,522
Okay.

81
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,694
It took some time
since it was her first delivery,

82
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,112
but she'll recover well.

83
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:35,241
Don't you worry.
We'll take good care of her.

84
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,034
Did you hear that?

85
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,873
He's looking at me.

86
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,709
Goodness. You're right.

87
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,759
Are all his fingers and toes--

88
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:54,927
They're all there.

89
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,682
My baby.

90
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,644
I'm sure it was tough for you too.

91
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,275
Help her with breastfeeding.

92
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,568
Yes, ma'am.

93
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,452
Doctor.

94
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,206
-I can't…
-Are you having trouble breathing?

95
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,961
Yes. What should I do? What…

96
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:40,973
Intubation!

97
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,141
-Check her BP!
-Okay!

98
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,245
Ma'am!

99
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,344
Ma'am!

100
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,018
Ma'am!

101
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,946
MS. SONG WON

102
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,808
She refused to go
to a postpartum care center.

103
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,561
We'll be here for her.

104
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,397
Could you bring some seaweed soup for her?

105
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,566
I heard jokbal was good for childbirth.

106
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,527
Okay. Bye.

107
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,237
-Did you do number two?
-No.

108
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,322
I couldn't stop peeing.

109
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,574
I realized that
I hadn't peed even once today.

110
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,328
Goodness. You must have been feeling
very tense and nervous.

111
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,454
You're a good husband.

112
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,706
Go check on her.

113
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,042
Wait here. Don't call.

114
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,502
Can't we text?

115
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,963
I'm dying to know.

116
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,507
-Right. We should buy flowers.
-You're right.

117
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,591
Get Mr. Choi to do it.

118
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,884
Okay.

119
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,389
Is it a boy or a girl?

120
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,224
My parents are dying to know.

121
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,353
It's a boy.

122
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,021
-It's a boy!
-Yes!

123
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,860
Congratulations, Dad.

124
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,654
You too. I've been waiting
all my life for this day.

125
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,491
How is the mother?

126
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,453
Is something wrong?

127
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,087
I'm afraid
her condition suddenly worsened.

128
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,633
She passed away.

129
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,680
She passed…

130
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,848
Worsened?

131
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,852
-She passed away?
-Is that what you said?

132
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,520
Yes.

133
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,648
What is she talking about?

134
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,026
She passed away?

135
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,278
Yes.

136
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,034
Then…

137
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,496
Would you like to see her
for the last time?

138
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,790
Last time?

139
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,292
I'm sorry.

140
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,169
I did the best I could but…

141
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,134
Doctor.

142
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,594
I can't…

143
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,598
What happened?

144
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,860
No…

145
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,261
MS. SONG WON

146
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,702
Doctor, you need to do CPR on her.

147
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,662
-She's still warm.
-We already did.

148
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,040
Touch her. She's still warm.

149
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,834
She's looking at me. Can't you see?

150
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,589
Doctor.

151
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,551
Please. She's not dead yet.

152
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,095
Please hurry.

153
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,183
Song Yuan. Won!

154
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,225
Honey!

155
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,019
Doctor!

156
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,604
Don't just stand there.

157
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,191
Please save her. Please.

158
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,526
It was an amniotic fluid embolism.
Nothing could be done.

159
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,904
-What was that?
-The fluid entered her blood--

160
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:55,616
I don't care! Stop rambling
and perform surgery on her!

161
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,536
Don't you dare touch her.

162
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,122
We'll take Ms. Song to the morgue now.

163
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,415
Don't be absurd.

164
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,250
You can't take her.
I'll do everything I can!

165
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,755
What about the defibrillator?

166
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,673
I understand how you feel but--

167
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,925
No, you don't.

168
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,803
You don't.

169
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,022
Won, please.

170
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,149
It's me.

171
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,027
You should see Bada, right?

172
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,320
He's your precious son.

173
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,739
You can't leave him behind.

174
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,074
Our baby…

175
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,805
How can I live without you?

176
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,058
I can't live without you.

177
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,398
Please…

178
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,487
Sir, we need to move her.

179
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,574
I won't allow you to take her.

180
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,575
Never.

181
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,144
Did you not know that she was gone?

182
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,897
I was washing my hair and…

183
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,566
We slept in my bed last night.

184
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,443
It's understandable.

185
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,320
Don't just sit there. Make some coffee.

186
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,572
Or should I?

187
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,824
It's okay.

188
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,452
Pi-young.

189
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,121
My father passed away.

190
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,833
My Korean dad. My biological one.

191
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,586
I wanted to go to church
to pray for him, so I left.

192
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,423
But the elevator must have been broken
because it wouldn't budge.

193
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,967
I took it on my way up here.

194
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,009
No way.

195
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,345
I'm getting goosebumps.

196
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,889
And then?

197
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,685
On my way down
the emergency stairs, I saw her.

198
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,354
She looked exactly like her photos,
so I recognized her.

199
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,149
I even called her by name,

200
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,612
but she didn't even look back
and continued up the stairs.

201
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:24,700
Do you know what she said to me
after ringing the doorbell?

202
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,451
"You look soft and weak."

203
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,370
"Get a hold of yourself."

204
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,248
That's not how kids talk.

205
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,251
She seemed like
a completely different person.

206
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,128
Then she came inside and--

207
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,296
I think she was possessed.

208
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,632
It's her grandfather.

209
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,846
She's possessed by her grandfather?

210
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,018
I don't think your father has left yet.

211
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,313
You see,
I cry myself to sleep every night.

212
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,398
He wants me to hate him.

213
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,066
You cry every night?

214
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,609
We were together for decades.

215
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,239
I acted fine in front of you all,

216
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,201
but he only just passed away.

217
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,080
I always cry myself to sleep.

218
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:16,710
They say the dead can't move on
if you keep mourning them.

219
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,129
But I can't help it.

220
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,548
WHAT A FANTASTIC ACTRESS

221
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,593
What should we do?

222
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,179
Let's wait until she wakes up
and see how she's doing.

223
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,347
An exorcism will do.

224
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,308
Will you do it yourself?

225
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,350
Of course not.

226
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,478
I know many monks who specialize in that.

227
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,441
We need to talk.

228
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,862
WE NEED TO TALK IN PRIVATE

229
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,450
I need to force myself
to stop thinking about him.

230
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,829
I'll visit a big temple
and hold another ritual for him.

231
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,460
Didn't you say you did the same
after dreaming of your mother?

232
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,378
-Did I?
-You did.

233
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,005
You were little, so you must not remember.

234
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,883
How could he forget such a thing?

235
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,719
-Stay out of this.
-You need all the help you can get.

236
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,888
-This is serious.
-You're mourning your father.

237
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,598
Why don't you focus on that?

238
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,393
What should I do?

239
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,729
Don't worry. Yu-sin is a psychiatrist.

240
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,815
But you can't treat someone
who's possessed.

241
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,067
Just go to church
if you're going to nitpick.

242
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,570
They say those who pretend to be nice
are "eviler" than those who are blunt.

243
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,740
You should receive a checkup for dementia.

244
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,075
It's "more evil".

245
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,078
I'm sure this is temporary.

246
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,455
Seeing how she's asleep
proves that she's okay.

247
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,834
She once said she had seen him once.

248
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,963
She was half asleep,
so I thought she was dreaming.

249
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,881
Was I wrong?

250
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,884
Pi-young, let's go to church and pray.

251
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,971
-Temples won't help right now.
-We need to eat to live.

252
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,557
Let's have breakfast first.
It won't take long.

253
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,350
They say onlookers can't empathize.

254
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,103
How could you be hungry right now?

255
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,106
It wasn't for me.

256
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,691
I know you won't starve.

257
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,738
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

258
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,198
Are you awake?

259
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,995
Lie down a bit longer.

260
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,083
What happened?

261
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,227
-Oh, no.
-Song Yuan.

262
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,857
You should have done everything you could.

263
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,901
Goodness.

264
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:50,030
What should we do?

265
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,948
What about your baby?

266
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,033
Won.

267
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:57,120
I never got the chance
to call you by name.

268
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,289
You couldn't even
close your eyes in peace.

269
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,626
You have a baby boy.

270
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,503
As his mother, shouldn't you raise him?

271
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,678
My heart breaks for the baby.

272
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,891
He'll never see his mother's face.

273
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,394
And you never got to hold him.

274
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,315
You'll never rest in peace.

275
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,193
Oh, dear.

276
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,612
Sa-hyeon.

277
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,281
Is there really no way?

278
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,825
Don't just sit here and watch.

279
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,327
Do something.

280
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,288
How could this happen to us?

281
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,582
This isn't right.

282
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,834
How could God do this to us?

283
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,544
How could this happen?

284
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,674
My heart breaks.

285
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,842
It's torn to pieces.

286
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,178
Oh, no…

287
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,767
You know what?

288
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:07,107
I think Yu-sin's father
died because of Ms. Kim

289
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,442
although I've never met him.

290
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,112
You see,

291
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,407
Ji-a spoke as if she was him.

292
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,117
She charged at Ms. Kim and said,

293
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,576
"You're the reason I died."

294
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,495
-Really?
-Yes.

295
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,289
It was terrifying.

296
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,668
Ms. Kim turned pale
and started to tremble.

297
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,715
Ji-a seemed extremely strong for her age.

298
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,427
I think she's responsible for his death.

299
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,638
She says he's trying to make her hate him,

300
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,558
but I definitely heard "wrongful death".

301
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,559
Are you serious?

302
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,810
I saw…

303
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,563
I wasn't the only witness.

304
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,606
All three of us were there.

305
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,899
Ask Yu-sin yourself.

306
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,402
He said he could have lived longer

307
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,154
and wanted to take revenge.

308
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,074
I'm sure she did something.

309
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,035
If not…

310
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:06,624
He went into cardiac arrest
at the movie theater.

311
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:10,086
You weren't there.
You heard that from Ms. Kim herself.

312
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,005
We need to look into this.

313
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,216
Yu-sin wouldn't allow it.

314
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,260
He'll be humiliated.

315
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,386
Let's do it in secret.

316
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,597
Should I do it since you're busy?

317
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,475
I'll do it.

318
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,935
You've heard
of private investigators, right?

319
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,898
What will happen to Ji-a then?

320
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,109
THE BABIES ARE SLEEPING.
PLEASE DO NOT KNOCK.

321
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,846
Look at him.

322
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,183
He looks exactly like

323
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,478
his father and his grandpa.

324
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,730
Bada, how could this be?

325
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,109
Goodness. You poor thing.

326
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,277
I'm your grandpa.

327
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,076
Your mom may not be here.

328
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,829
But you have me,

329
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,373
your grandma,

330
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:29,958
your uncle,

331
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,210
your dad,

332
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,296
and two cousins.

333
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,184
She might get worked up
if she sees me again.

334
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,704
I've never called you Dad,

335
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,749
and I never got the chance to either.

336
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,711
I'm sorry.

337
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,131
You passed away

338
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,009
before I could make you proud.

339
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,719
Have you

340
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,097
ever thought of me?

341
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,267
I thought of you often.

342
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,102
I was curious.

343
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,396
I wanted to meet with you.

344
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,190
BUT THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE

345
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,900
Anyway…

346
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,736
I hope you rest in peace.

347
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,205
PARK HAE-RYUN

348
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:55,960
Yes?

349
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,296
If you can't come here,
text me the address.

350
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,298
Time is of the essence.

351
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:01,800
What did you say?

352
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,968
I said time is of the essence.

353
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,137
I must see an acupuncturist.

354
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,639
I'm in the parking lot.

355
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:09,868
How bad is it?

356
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,954
Is it pretty bad?

357
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,417
-Let me see.
-What for?

358
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,586
Then why did you call me?

359
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,421
Because I need to get treated.

360
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,132
And I remembered the acupuncturist.

361
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,258
You can't enunciate?

362
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,844
I'm frustrated as well. And I'm in pain.

363
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,470
I was so shocked when it happened.

364
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,725
Did you have breakfast?

365
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,477
They say getting acupuncture is tough.

366
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,354
You should eat something.

367
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,279
Don't you have anything?

368
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,492
It's hard for me to chew.

369
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,912
Do you feel pain anywhere else?

370
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:54,954
Well…

371
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,457
I looked it up,

372
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,501
and I think
I have peripheral facial palsy.

373
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,878
What was that?

374
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:05,465
Peripheral facial palsy.

375
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:08,676
REST IN PEACE

376
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,482
Yes?

377
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,777
It's the second VIP room.

378
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,115
Our eldest son is here.

379
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,541
Didn't you say your friend
ran an oriental medicine clinic?

380
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,293
-He died.
-He died?

381
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,920
Yes. A few days ago.

382
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,004
Why?

383
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,257
I doubt it was due to an illness.
Was it a car accident?

384
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,717
-He fell off a horse.
-What?

385
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,552
He fell off a horse.

386
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,555
It happened during horseback riding.

387
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,559
He passed away
after being in a coma for months.

388
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,902
What a clingy, old geezer.

389
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,821
He even haunts me from his grave.

390
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:13,533
What did I do? Choke him? Smack his chest?

391
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,576
Why is he blaming me for his death?

392
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,790
What if Fish Head and Pi-young
collude together

393
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,500
and tell Yu-sin

394
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,252
to hypnotize me?

395
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,548
Then I'll just pretend as if it worked.

396
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,049
They can't hypnotize me.

397
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:33,136
Thank God it was Ji-a who was possessed.

398
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,096
She scared me to death.

399
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,144
I'll play dumb until the end.

400
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,200
That geezer is obviously into me.

401
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,289
Think of your age.

402
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,633
My goodness.

403
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,094
Are you okay?

404
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,681
Are you? Did you burn yourself?

405
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,559
Goodness.

406
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,395
-What?
-What?

407
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,149
This is a flipper.

408
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,234
Why is this here? Geez.

409
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,862
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

410
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:35,031
You scraped your palm.

411
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,283
-Let's go to a pharmacy.
-I'm fine.

412
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,578
Come on.
I'm sure you scraped your knee too.

413
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,498
You fell quite hard.

414
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,710
Here. Wipe your hands.

415
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:50,963
Wait.

416
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,510
Let me. I'll throw it away for you.

417
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:58,846
You can grab onto me.

418
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,807
I'm fine.

419
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:06,979
I run a pretty big roast duck restaurant
near the intersection at Gangnam Station.

420
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,190
How about you come with me and--

421
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,028
Old man. Don't mind me
and go about your day.

422
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,534
I'm only 65 years old. I'm no old man.

423
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,663
Ma'am.

424
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:35,424
She's obviously had surgery,
but she still looks old from behind.

425
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,137
What did you just say?

426
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,471
MEDICAL RECORDS LIBRARY
PHARMACY

427

ORIENTAL MEDICINE CLINIC

428
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,073
DIRECTOR AN DAE-JONG

429
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,116
Let's see.

430
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,502
Okay. And it happened this morning?

431
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,631
-Yes.
-Did you have any symptoms before?

432
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,300
-Such as paralysis.
-No.

433
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,093
Any worries?

434
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,888
Acute stress could be a cause as well.

435
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:25,808
He was dumped.

436
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,061
A close friend betrayed him.

437
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,608
How long do I need
to receive acupuncture treatment?

438
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,652
Not for long since you came right away.

439
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,198
But you'll have to take medication too.

440
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,407
I trust you, Doctor.

441
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,843
If you're not hungry,
let's get your wedding dress fitted.

442
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,347
It'll take at least a month.

443
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,516
Let's choose our rings
and the venue today as well.

444
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,353
What if your parents--

445
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,437
This isn't about them.

446
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,398
To Antoi in Cheongdam-dong.

447
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,691
Yes, sir.

448
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,654
-My mother called, didn't she?
-Yes, sir.

449
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,113
Don't tell her everything.

450
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,323
But she asked.

451
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,953
Are you not smart enough
to come up with other answers?

452
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,749
I have to go to work.

453
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,628
Thank you.

454
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,774
How's Ji-a?

455
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,902
How can she be okay?

456
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,905
She needs to wake up first.

457
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,700
She did toss and turn,
but she's sleeping too much.

458
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,911
We need to meet tonight.

459
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,086
Lee Si-eun. We once met.

460
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,927
I doubt we met through a blind date.

461
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,555
Did we live in the same neighborhood?

462
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:35,521
What if Mr. Seo and Ms. Lee stayed behind
and had a nice chat yesterday?

463
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,859
So what? She's no match for me.

464
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,531
Hello.

465
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,575
I heard your manager
hurt her neck yesterday.

466
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,368
And the car was wrecked.

467
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,413
Yes. She needs to wear
a cast for a month or so.

468
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,875
Did you drink a lot last night

469
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,585
with Mr. Seo?

470
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,673
I waited for a bit then left.

471
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,633
It was getting late.

472
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,762
-So you didn't see him again?
-No.

473
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,975
He was away for less than 40 minutes.

474
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,018
I see.

475
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,188
I feel bad since he spent a lot of money.

476
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,815
Next time, it'll be my treat.

477
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,487
Did Ji-a get hurt?

478
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,155
I haven't spoken with Pi-young.

479
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,502
MR. SEO

480
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,632
Let's go to Y.O.U.
What time works for you?

481
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,884
Six o'clock? Seven o'clock?

482
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,221
Seven o'clock.

483
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,769
Hello.

484
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,771
Did Ji-a get hurt last night?

485
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,231
It's a long story.

486
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,443
That can actually happen in real life?

487
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,029
I'm still dubious
since I didn't see it myself.

488
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:11,659
So did she say something
while she was possessed?

489
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,286
I'm not sure. I don't know the details.

490
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,163
She was asleep, and I had to work.

491
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,250
Her grandpa cherished her a lot.

492
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,919
He must not be able to move on.

493
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:26,257
Then don't you think
his wife should've been possessed instead?

494
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,401
Do you know him?

495
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,319
He's my friend's ex-husband.

496
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:51,031
Ex-husband? He's good-looking.
Why did they get a divorce?

497
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,575
Because he was a cheater.

498
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,607
Focus on me.

499
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:28,068
I was wondering if my close friend
has given birth yet. She's expecting.

500
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,737
She would have called if she did.

501
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,905
You're close friends.

502
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,825
I've been pretty occupied lately.

503
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,454
She'll understand.

504
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,541
She rarely turns her phone off.

505
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,752
Maybe she gave birth.

506
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,962
If you're tired,
should we get the rings later?

507
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,006
That's okay.

508
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,217
We have things to do tomorrow.

509
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,343
What will be your wedding gift?

510
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,552
Will we live with your parents?

511
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,262
-Are you hesitant?
-I mean…

512
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,598
I grew up as an only child.

513
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,019
But do you think they'll allow that?

514
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,689
My father has been
conservative all his life.

515
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,652
Should I sell my house in Yangpyeong

516
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,654
and get a proper wedding gift?

517
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,322
The best gift…

518
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,158
is giving them a grandchild.

519
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,245
Let's have a baby first.

520
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,332
We won't be able
to get married if I don't get pregnant.

521
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,501
Are you going to pressure me?

522
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,966
Having no kids could be our fate.

523
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:33,926
We could adopt one.

524
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:35,970
Or find a surrogate.

525
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,306
Cancel the dress.

526
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,183
I'm joking.

527
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:44,019
You're not.
Knowing you, you could really do that.

528
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,606
Spend your entire life with me,

529
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,525
and you'll know what I'm really like.

530
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,694
I'm sure I'll surprise you.

531
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,612
You're never sincere.

532
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,781
But I'm always sincere in love.

533
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:56,907
Right?

534
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,577
When will you smile?

535
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,664
You're still bitter about the past, right?

536
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:08,252
Through our marriage,
I'll get rid of all hurt and distrust…

537
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,130
Maybe not the latter.

538
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,715
Do you trust me?

539
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,594
Drink your tea.

540
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,096
Please use honorifics
when we're with my parents.

541
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,390
It may be suffocating at first.

542
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:22,558
Your mom too?

543
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,727
Everyone becomes like my dad with time.

544
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,520
Except for me.

545
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,105
This is our last story.

546
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:31,692
To my dear listeners, especially women,

547
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:36,864
grab a glass of beer and brace yourselves
before listening to this story.

548
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,949
"When I was young,

549
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:42,369
I've heard that a husband's love
for his wife lasts only three years."

550
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,413
"But in my situation,

551
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:47,499
my husband left home
to live with another woman

552
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,127
only two years and four months
after getting married."

553
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,463
"I declined his request for divorce

554
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,839
solely for our daughter."

555
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:57,760
"He ended it and came back
once my daughter was in kindergarten."

556
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,763
"I thought he had
finally come to his senses."

557
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,514
"Then we had our second child."

558
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,892
"But when our second child was four,

559
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,727
he met someone else and left again."

560
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,981
"One good thing was that
he wired us money."

561
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:15,402
"Two years ago,
his girlfriend contacted me."

562
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:19,156
"He was bedridden and paralyzed
after a brain hemorrhage surgery."

563
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,283
"And of course, she left him."

564
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,452
"She packed up
and moved out of their house."

565
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,204
"I can't reach her."

566
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:29,875
"I fed, bathed, and helped
my disabled husband exercise

567
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,794
while raising our daughters."

568
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:35,339
"I think about how exhausting my life is
several times a day."

569
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,174
"What should I do?"

570
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:41,637
"Every time
I became enraged and exhausted,

571
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,973
I comforted myself
by thinking this was my fate

572
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,017
and that he was still a dad to our girls."

573
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,602
"But I can't do it anymore."

574
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,688
"But I can't just abandon my husband."

575
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:55,484
"He's not completely disabled,
so I can't admit him to a sanatorium."

576
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,236
"With the money I received

577
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,571
from fostering children
and from my husband,

578
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,408
I was able to provide for my children."

579
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,496
If I was her,
I'd send him to a sanatorium.

580
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,498
Why would I take care of him?

581
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,792
But he regularly sent her money.

582
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,962
You can't just feign ignorance
and not help out.

583
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,256
There must be a god.

584
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:18,882
He was punished.

585
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,802
Is it a punishment or fate?

586
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,012
It's a punishment from god.

587
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,015
What would you do?

588
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:30,769
A disabled husband at home
will only slow you down at work.

589
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,397
And the kids should be old enough too.

590
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,859
That's my current situation.

591
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:38,652
My husband's face is paralyzed.

592
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:40,070
-No way.
-Facial palsy?

593
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,407
-When?
-Really?

594
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,242
He called me early in the morning,

595
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:48,412
so I took him to get acupuncture,
at an oriental medicine clinic.

596
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:49,872
He called you?

597
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:52,207
It's safe to say
he and Ga-bin are over now.

598
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,834
So? Does he want to reconcile?

599
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:54,918
Of course not.

600
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,795
Are you going to nurse him?

601
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,672
Just make Ga-bin do it.

602
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,260
So that she can see him in his state
and get even more turned off.

603
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,056
I would have done that.

604
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,558
Will you keep driving him?

605
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,560
It was just for today. He's not a baby.

606
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,270
How do you feel deep down?

607
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,856
Relieved? Happy?

608
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,358
-Worried?
-I don't know.

609
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,818
How could you not know?

610
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,654
It breaks your heart, and you pity him.

611
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,199
-That's not true.
-Si-eun.

612
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,492
Weren't you put off by him?

613
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,784
Of course, I was.

614
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,953
But look at you now. You're wavering.

615
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,247
-Let's be honest. He was my husband.
-Honestly,

616
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,790
You'll get back together soon.

617
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,668
-I won't allow it.
-Don't get ahead of yourself.

618
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:37,753
It wasn't a stroke.

619
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:41,089
And he can cook for himself.

620
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,134
Don't mind him and just ignore him.

621
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,677
She's right.

622
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:46,762
All right.

623
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:50,474
God probably punished him temporarily
so he'd learn his lesson.

624
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,434
He needs to.

625
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,148
I heard it's difficult to eat,
and you spill everything.

626
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,943
You're right. I bet it's tough.

627
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,331
I just wanted to go there.

628
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,208
Do you have a headache or anything?

629
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:19,670
No.

630
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,048
Do you still dream of Grandpa these days?

631
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,258
Not really.

632
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,344
Dinner's ready.

633
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,182
Hey.

634
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,392
You're going out?

635
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,394
Yes. Another sudden meet-up.

636
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,771
Reheat the soup and the fish.

637
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:38,939
U-ram will be home soon.

638
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,233
Okay.

639
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,029
I'm glad you bought that coat.

640
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,698
-It really suits you.
-Really?

641
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,701
-It wasn't expensive, but it's nice.
-You're right.

642
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:53,120
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

643
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,213
Hey.

644
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,595
Which hospital?

645
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,222
Is it bad?

646
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,142
Just the face?

647
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,436
Okay.

648
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,525
Do you want some wine?

649
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:24,776
If you're having some.

650
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,866
Let's have dinner with Ban on Sunday.

651
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:33,118
Doesn't he golf on the weekends?

652
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:35,203
Even if he does, he'll be done by dinner.

653
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,667
By the way, shouldn't you go to work?
Your father might fire you.

654
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,337
-Are you worried I can't provide for you?
-I can make a living too.

655
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:47,215
It's all for the best.
We're planning our wedding together.

656
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,259
I feel bad about it.

657
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,638
In life, there are times
when you meet unexpected obstacles.

658
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,098
-We can overcome it together.
-Your life was peachy all along.

659
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,433
Not work-wise though.

660
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,352
Really?

661
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:02,773
Professor Park…

662
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,984
He's being treated for facial palsy.

663
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,487
You know what that is, right?

664
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,323
I'm sure he doesn't want you to know.

665
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,741
It's treatable.

666
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,493
I'm going to be punished.

667
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,119
It's his personality and fate.

668
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:20,123
To be honest, I played a part too.

669
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,418
Not all who get dumped are like him.

670
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,088
You've never been dumped before.

671
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,923
Our breakup was painful for me too.

672
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,808
Are you mad at me again?

673
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,105
Let's go to a hotel.

674
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,315
Your house has bad energy.

675
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,401
People will talk
even before we get married.

676
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,069
Will you be okay alone?

677
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,905
Let's find a house first.

678
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,970
I came ten minutes early too.

679
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,099
Did you stop by your house?

680
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,309
I had to make dinner for my kids.

681
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,278
I ordered for you

682
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,612
since I know what you like.

683
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,578
Look. I thought about it.

684
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,831
I think you're mistaking me
for someone else.

685
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:45,667
That could be the case
if you changed your name.

686
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,044
Then maybe that woman
and I share the same name.

687
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,880
I'm not demented.

688
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:52,799
I have no recollection of you.

689
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,050
I changed my name.

690
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,219
You said we didn't go to the same school.

691
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,264
Here's your appetizer.

692
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,266
Thank you.

693
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:07,022
What was your previous name?

694
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,736
Didn't you go to Daechi Art Academy?

695
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,072
Yes, in elementary school.

696
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:18,408
And you quit
during the start of winter break.

697
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,701
You were in fifth grade.

698
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,287
Did I?

699
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,290
I went to several academies back then.

700
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,169
-Did you go there, Mr. Seo?
-Drop the honorifics.

701
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:31,046
This is all too sudden.

702
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,006
And surreal too.

703
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:34,132
Seo Dong-min.

704
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:40,305
I'm hurt. You were so nice to me.

705
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,724
I was?

706
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:45,519
How?

707
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:49,105
Aren't you hungry?
You don't like cold bread.

708
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,825
You quit ten days

709
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,451
after I enrolled there.

710
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,620
You have such a good memory.

711
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,498
Only when it's about you.

712
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,585
You were a talented artist.

713
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:13,755
I thought you'd study art.

714
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,925
It was average for a kid
who studied there for three years.

715
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,177
How long did you go there?

716
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:21,096
Just for that winter break.

717
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:26,268
I wasn't that good. Not that I'm good
at anything in particular.

718
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:28,728
You're good at golf.

719
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,650
-I never told you that.
-You didn't have to.

720
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:34,943
I heard from others.

721
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,404
And you're fit to play golf.

722
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:42,075
And you ran into Ms. Sa
at the golf club several times.

723
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:43,577
Were you interested in me?

724
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:47,247
It'd be weird if I was.

725
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:51,293
Why? It's not weird
to be interested in others.

726
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:54,588
Yet you're usually indifferent
towards others.

727
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,299
After everything I just said?

728
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,885
Old memories tend to be more vivid.

729
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:04,389
They're only vivid to me
and you have no memory of me.

730
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:07,183
We drew together six times while sitting

731
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:09,102
side by side.

732
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,272
Side by side?

733
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,402
You should have told me this sooner.

734
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,154
I'm hurt.

735
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:24,409
I just thought I'd watch you from afar.

736
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:26,995
I feel bad now that I know everything.

737
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:28,038
Are you offended?

738
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,165
This is nothing to be offended about.

739
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,293
You must have been quiet
back then as well.

740
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,503
I would have remembered
had you been mischievous.

741
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,466
You live an efficient life.

742
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,386
You don't waste your energy
and only say what's necessary.

743
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,313
You were bright and friendly.

744
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,564
Especially to me.

745
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:57,150
Or maybe it was just me who felt that way.

746
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:58,985
That may be true

747
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,655
if I had the same disposition as I do now.

748
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,198
You were 161cm tall.

749
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:06,409
People often thought
you were in middle school.

750
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,164
Why did you change your name?

751
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,750
Seo Dong-min…

752
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:17,337
I like Seo Ban more.

753
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,756
It suits who you are now better.

754
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:20,924
My mother

755
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,803
didn't want my half-brother and I
to share the same name.

756
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:29,933
But we're close to the point he comes
to my place whenever he gets kicked out.

757
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,518
Who put in the effort?

758
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:35,522
Him. Unlike me,
he's friendly and compliant.

759
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,524
So he grew on me.

760
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:38,692
We met when I was in college.

761
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,902
-What's the age gap?
-Fifteen years.

762
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,822
He may be young, but he is
much better than me in many ways.

763
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:46,032
You are a decent guy yourself, Mr. Seo.

764
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:48,743
Call me by my name.

765
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,207
Did I do that in the past?

766
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,458
Of course.

767
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,585
Your old name is too unfamiliar.

768
00:54:58,628 --> 00:54:59,796
Ban.

769
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,173
Si-eun.

770
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,051
This is nice.

771
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,638
Don't you agree?

772
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,517
I'm still a bit bewildered.

773
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:15,937
On my first day at the academy,

774
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,023
you offered a piece of chocolate to me.

775
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:21,651
It was the tastiest piece
of chocolate I had ever had.

776
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,237
I didn't even like chocolate before that.

777
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:28,116
Is there anything you gave me, Mr. Seo?

778
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,659
Is it that awkward to call me by my name?

779
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:30,577
Yes.

780
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,495
A bit.

781
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:34,914
I understand.

782
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,542
I don't care how you address me.

783
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:39,711
I only care about your heart.

784
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,153
Isn't she home yet?

785
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:07,447
We had tea together before we left.

786
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,115
Her phone was off,
so I thought she'd be home.

787
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,117
-She came then went out.
-Will she be late?

788
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,285
I didn't ask.

789
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,246
My fans sent these to my agency.

790
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,790
Is today your birthday?

791
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:20,043
No. They always send me gifts.
Put them in the freezer.

792
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,461
Okay.

793
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,796
Where's U-ram?

794
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:25,090
Showering. You didn't eat yet, right?

795
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,299
How did you know?

796
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:29,135
I didn't, but I'm not hungry.
I had enough tea.

797
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,645
Food is tastier with the company.

798
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,648
Cakes are tasty even if I eat them alone.

799
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,316
Do you have your mom's skinny genes?

800
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:44,317
I do gain weight.

801
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,405
It must be tough to study
and work part-time.

802
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,282
Everyone in their youth struggles.

803
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,077
I struggled a lot during my divorce.

804
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,955
-Do you have a boyfriend?
-No.

805
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,290
-Why not?
-No reason.

806
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,669
Dating in your twenties
and thirties is different.

807
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,255
You should experience
everything others do.

808
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,882
-What's your goal in life?
-Treating my mom well.

809
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,968
Gosh. She must feel reassured.

810
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:13,304
-What about you?
-Your goals change as you age.

811
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:16,933
I learned not to lose hope
even when times are tough.

812
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:21,229
If you stay strong and endure it,
you'll find new hope and courage.

813
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:24,649
Remember how chaotic it was
when the media reported my divorce?

814
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:29,195
Now that I've stayed strong,
I've found peace once again.

815
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,822
You'll remarry, right?

816
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:33,700
It'd be a pity if you stayed single
and worked all your life.

817
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,829
I guess your mom hasn't told you yet.

818
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,875
-Do you have a boyfriend?
-Not yet.

819
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,046
Maybe she's visiting your dad.

820
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:48,673
Was she empty-handed?

821
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:49,883
Yes.

822
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:53,136
Did my dad call her?

823
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:56,556
U-ram.

824
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:00,518
Hello.

825
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,812
-Have some cake.
-Okay.

826
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:03,980
She's running late.

827
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:06,649
I should go.

828
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,860
I heard Mr. Seo gave you
a lot of pocket money when you visited.

829
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,361
-Yes.
-How did you spend it?

830
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:13,156
On good food and books too.

831
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,325
What kind of person is Mr. Seo?

832
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,579
He's a good, charming man.

833
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:20,914
How is he charming?

834
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,916
He's a bit unique. Right?

835
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,250
Yes.

836
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:31,049
Then why hasn't he gotten married?
I heard he's still a bachelor.

837
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:32,300
Beats me.

838
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,443
-Are you running late?
-Are you working tomorrow?

839
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:54,155
-Yes.
-I have work in the morning.

840
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,574
-I'll stop by in the afternoon.
-Okay.

841
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,160
-Don't let her sleep alone.
-I won't for the time being.

842
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:01,079
Can't you show me more respect

843
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:02,288
and use honorifics?

844
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,541
Is that even important right now?

845
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:08,378
Mr. Seo.

846
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,630
I heard you live in Golden Park.

847
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:11,714
I do.

848
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,968
Could you give me a house tour today?

849
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,557
I love myself so much.

850
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,586
My heart breaks every time I think

851
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,421
about the baby.

852
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:52,839
I don't think

853
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,009
I'll ever forget…

854
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:00,638
how she passed away with her eyes open.

855
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:02,890
Me neither.

856
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,601
She won't be at peace.

857
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,394
Let us…

858
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:11,190
bid her a good farewell.

859
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,943
You were born in the spring, right?

860
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:16,446
What do you not know?

861
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:17,905
Your heart.

862
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:22,702
At times, we don't even know
what our hearts want.

863
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,120
Don't you want to know my birthdate?

864
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,748
When is it?

865
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,834
I can't get used to it.

866
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:31,002
To what?

867
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:33,129
Talking to you like this of all people.

868
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,174
If Ms. Sa and the others find out…

869
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:37,925
I bet you'll tell her right away.

870
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:39,636
Don't you want that?

871
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:41,971
I don't mind.

872
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,976
It's best I don't tell her.

873
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,729
-Why not?
-People will talk.

874
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,273
It's not like
we got to know each other by accident.

875
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:54,025
And people like to speculate.

876
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:55,610
That won't change anything.

877
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:02,075
My birthday is in two days. Sunday.

878
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:04,118
You're kidding, right?

879
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,953
It'd be nice if you invited me over.

880
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:08,665
Let's have dinner with the kids.

881
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,668
I'll book someplace nice
that they'll like.

882
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:14,253
You're always supposed
to treat others on your birthday.

883
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:17,507
It'll be my treat.
The kids will be confused.

884
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:18,800
U-ram likes me.

885
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,218
How do you know?

886
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:22,428
I can feel it. I met Hyang-gi too.

887
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,931
Still, they're quite busy.

888
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,099
Just ask them.

889
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:28,851
How can they say no if I ask them?

890
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:34,065
You don't need to go
inside the complex. I'll get off here.

891
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,367
Which building?

892
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,703
That one. Building 1109.

893
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,465
Thanks.

894
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:03,428
I was happy to meet
a fellow academy student

895
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:04,721
although it was brief.

896
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:07,932
What is it?

897
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:09,392
This feels surreal for me too.

898
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:11,060
I couldn't sleep last night.

899
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:15,523
Wait.

900
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,628
How could a gentleman like you
still be single?

901
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,298
Get in. It's cold.

902
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:41,549
I hope I wasn't pushy.

903
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,342
I had a good time.

904
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:47,138
The 12-year-old girl
who had big eyes and smiled often

905
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:48,556
is in front of me right now.

906
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,266
Don't embarrass me.

907
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:52,143
I'm in my fifties now,

908
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,228
and you played dumb all along.

909
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,148
You said the results
are what matters, right?

910
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:58,983
I've learned

911
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:01,611
that no one should guarantee
anything about the future.

912
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:02,653
I won't do that.

913
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:14,207
You should go.
I don't like being watched from behind.

914
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:16,667
Okay.

915
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:25,843
Si-eun.

916
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,013
Can I text you once I get home?

917
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:07,802
Were you with Dad?

918
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:08,803
No.

919
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:11,639
Hye-ryung came by.

920
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,225
Why?

921
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:16,519
She brought cakes and cookies
she received from her fans.

922
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,189
Did you talk to Dad?

923
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:24,110
-Yes.
-You should have told me.

924
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:31,742
Is he okay?

925
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:35,079
I guess.

926
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,039
Does he complain to you?

927
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:39,333
It's silly to pretend like he's okay.

928
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:42,753
Promise me you won't waver no matter what.

929
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:44,630
Okay.

930
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,215
I did the laundry.

931
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,427
Thanks, Hyang-gi.

932
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:25,504
SEUNG-A

933
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:31,385
Hey, Seung-a. It's been a while.

934
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:33,220
Where are you? Home?

935
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:35,640
Not yet.

936
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:39,185
It seems like Sa-hyeon
lost someone in his family.

937
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:41,854
He's in mourning?

938
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,315
I went to Sejin Funeral Hall
this afternoon

939
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:46,567
because of a colleague and saw him there.

940
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:47,735
Only I saw him.

941
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:50,613
There's no way his parents passed away.

942
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,406
Who knows?

943
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:55,826
It seemed like
he had lost a family member.

944
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:56,994
Based on his clothes.

945
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,163
I'll check.

946
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:00,206
Okay.

947
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,880
HYE-RYUNG

948
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,224
Ji-a, I'm--

949
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,393
What we have is special, right?

950
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:03,561
I guess so.

951
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:05,855
Don't you think
Hye-ryung would be the best?

952
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:08,941
Why would she want
to get back together with Sa-hyeon?

953
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:12,278
Sa-hyeon, I bet you were elated
when I agreed on our divorce.

954
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:14,905
I know you hid your true feelings from me.

955
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:16,907
-Are you crazy?
-What do you mean?

956
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:19,285
-What right do you have?
-I'm your future daughter-in-law.

957
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:21,370
I love the layout.

958
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:22,830
It smells nice too.

959
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:25,833
It'd be nice to listen to music,
have some wine, and enjoy the scenery.

960
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:28,502
I'll prepare the wine.
What time do you want to come?

961
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,171
What is it that you don't have?

962
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:31,756
A woman.

963
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,883
Care to do something nice
tomorrow evening?

964
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:35,926
-Where should I go?
-I'll tell you tomorrow.

965
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:38,763
A Mi.

966
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:40,347
Ms. Sa Pi-young.

967
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:41,557
Yes?

968
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:48,564
