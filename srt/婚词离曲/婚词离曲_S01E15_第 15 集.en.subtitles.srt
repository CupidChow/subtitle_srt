00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,558
EPISODE 15

2
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,518
You see,

3
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,230
I've become a fan of yours.

4
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,359
I'll see you next week.

5
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,496
Why don't you have some tea

6
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:21,831
at my house?

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,418
May I?

8
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,965
No, I should just go. You need to rest.

9
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,280
Go inside. The wind is chilly.

10
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,877
Let me get in. May I drive?

11
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,004
Sure.

12
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,401
I'm really not hungry.

13
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,945
Do you not trust me driving?

14
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,363
That's not it.

15
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,618
-I know this neighborhood well.
-Right.

16
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,663
This car is like you.

17
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,081
It's so gentle.

18
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,876
I bet when people are with you,

19
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,378
they never get irritated or angry.

20
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,796
Not always.

21
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,313
I come here for a walk often
with a cap on.

22
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,781
Have a seat here.

23
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,410
-Are you cold?
-No, it's cool.

24
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,579
You're my special fan.

25
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,414
Excuse my appearance.

26
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,625
I like this casual look better.

27
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,295
Right now, you're my special audience,

28
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,255
and I'm a musical actress.

29
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,261
Come to think of it

30
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,890
This is just my illusion

31
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:47,936
I'm just ecstatic

32
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:52,190
About meeting you

33
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:59,155
Someone once told me
I still look like a girl

34
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,825
Every time I think of you

35
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:09,249
I can't help but blush

36
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:13,086
Even if people say

37
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,549
That I look like a fool

38
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,097
It's okay

39
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,308
Because

40
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:36,025
I love you

41
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:41,698
I love you

42
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,026
He's such a pure and sweet scholar.

43
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,527
He deserves respect.

44
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:28,870
You

45
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,293
That was very moving.

46
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,423
He's so pure-hearted.

47
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,972
You're quite athletic.
You also have good balance.

48
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,601
-I want to run soon.
-Master the sitting trot first.

49
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,062
-Should I come here every day?
-Do you have time?

50
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,731
Of course. I don't work nine to five.
I can come early.

51
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,609
Your butt will chafe
if you ride every day.

52
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,079
Good. Good job.

53
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,260
Masun, how have you been?

54
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,141
Hello.

55
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,644
Hello.

56
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,943
She's my cousin from the US.

57
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,611
He's also a member.

58
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,113
Hello.

59
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,365
Gosh, you're just as good-looking as him.

60
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,829
-Did you ride horses in the US?
-No.

61
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,873
She got frightened once as a kid.
She's quite timid.

62
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,960
-Masun.
-That's her name?

63
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,462
Yes. She has a very kind soul.

64
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,631
Right, Masun?

65
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,383
Animals do take after their owners.

66
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,346
-Goodbye, then.
-Goodbye.

67
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,944
There's a good restaurant nearby
that sells snacks.

68
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,487
Do you eat snacks too?

69
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,030
Of course.

70
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,033
OTTOK TTEOKBOKKI

71
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,579
-One roll of gimbapâ€¦
-And tteokbokki.

72
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,999
-And a bowl of udon, please.
-Sure.

73
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,086
I love that I won't gain weight
thanks to horse riding.

74
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,256
Can you feel your body relaxing more?

75
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,507
Yes.

76
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,843
Was that man a doctor too?

77
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,220
-How did you know?
-Just an impression.

78
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,306
Does horse riding purify one's soul?

79
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,308
Isn't my soul pure enough?

80
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,478
Truly pure people
don't say that about themselves.

81
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,064
Fine. My soul is tainted to the bone.

82
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,738
He's an oriental doctor.

83
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:13,659
Oriental doctors enjoy horseback riding
to receive the good energy horses radiate.

84
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,711
During the shooting,
they give us gimbap and burgers

85
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,797
since there are many staff members
and we're filming all day.

86
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,591
Isn't it tiring?

87
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,801
Not really. I'm still young. It's fun.

88
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,722
You can't tell how old the models are
just by their faces.

89
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,975
But those who eat gimbap and burgers
are in their thirties.

90
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,187
-Models in their twenties don't.
-Why not? They must be hungry.

91
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,649
They just eat the fruit they brought
or drink coffee.

92
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,156
-Do you not like it?
-I do. It's delicious.

93
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,370
Ms. Kim makes the best gimbap.

94
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,665
She uses fermented kimchi.

95
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,751
Your first love?

96
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,211
That was ages ago.

97
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,467
What should I do?

98
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,386
What's wrong?

99
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,930
I have a breakfast appointment tomorrow.

100
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,975
-I'm afraid I can't go swimming with you.
-Okay.

101
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,477
-Thank you so much.
-What is that?

102
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,105
I ordered some tasty
soy sauce marinated crab.

103
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,940
I love that side dish!

104
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:33,072
Right. You should have salty side dishes
with a huge bowl of rice.

105
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,535
Gosh, you've improved.

106
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,373
Two. You're doing well.

107
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,334
One. Move your arms back.

108
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,212
Look over there. Okay. Do this.

109
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,215
One, two.

110
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,858
That was so refreshing.

111
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,818
I'm just pleasantly tired.

112
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:14,530
Pi-young should take up swimming too
before it's too late.

113
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,991
Your age doesn't matter
when it comes to swimming.

114
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,827
There's no use in doing it
when you're already saggy.

115
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,330
She should start watching her figure
like you do.

116
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,042
Maybe I should just drag her here.

117
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,879
Don't do that.
She already has a hectic schedule.

118
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,423
She can always make time.
Ji-a can come as well.

119
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,635
She could get sick
if she exhausts herself too much.

120
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,762
After all, she's not a housewife.

121
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,890
Swimming is best
for shaping your body, though.

122
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,893
You also have to be born
with a good figure.

123
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,687
My friends said I was gorgeous
when we were in our twenties.

124
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:51,275
You're right. People would glance at you
whenever we went swimming.

125
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,485
Do you remember that?

126
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:56,155
Of course. And you still have
such a beautiful figure,

127
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:57,823
for your age.

128
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,493
"For your age"?

129
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,794
May I ask how old you are?

130
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,838
I'll be 60 soon. Happy?

131
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,781
Is there something on my face?

132
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,579
He always stares at handsome men.

133
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,498
Oh, I see.

134
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,295
Isn't your sister so pretty?

135
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,801
-Did her first birthday pass?
-Next month.

136
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,932
May I hold your baby?

137
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,142
Of course.

138
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,071
Hi, baby.

139
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,465
Say bye to him.

140
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,801
-Bye.
-Let's go.

141
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,086
XIEXIAN

142
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,385
Hello.

143
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,095
Hi, it's Xiexian.

144
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,180
Hi.

145
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,015
Are you done working out?

146
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,100
Yes. I just came home.

147
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,520
Can you come down for a minute?

148
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,105
Goodness. Are you here?

149
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,106
Yes.

150
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,275
I'll come down.

151
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,869
Going down.

152
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,306
-Hi.
-Hi.

153
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,934
I came to give you this.

154
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,562
I didn't buy it myself.

155
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,647
My client gave it to me
for winning the case.

156
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,691
Oh, my.

157
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,068
Have some when you can't sleep.

158
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,988
It's twice as expensive as Uperth Ten.

159
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:28,033
Then you should just keep it.
I can't appreciate good wine anyway.

160
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,743
I have another bottle.

161
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,829
But it'll be a waste.

162
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:36,375
By the way, where's my book?
The one with your gratitude.

163
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,169
Oh, I never got the chance
to give it to you.

164
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,214
You could've called me anytime.
I'm just one call away.

165
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,092
-I'll bring it right now.
-Wait.

166
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,220
Do you know how to open a wine bottle?

167
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,805
I've never done it.

168
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,683
Then you won't be able to do it.
Let me open it for you.

169
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,059
Will you?

170
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,609
I didn't get to clean the house today.

171
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,944
It's already tidy.

172
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,447
It's because I live alone.
Have a seat, please.

173
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,073
Do you have a wine opener?

174
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,491
Probably.

175
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,500
-Are you trying to memorize it?
-Yes.

176
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,672
Call me whenever you want to have some.

177
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,717
Once you open a bottle,
the taste will change.

178
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,511
And it'll take you days
to finish a bottle by yourself.

179
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,058
-Let me get some cheese.
-I don't think we need any.

180
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,643
But stillâ€¦

181
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,394
Let's try it first.

182
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,731
All right.

183
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,959
I don't know much about wine,
but it's easy on the throat.

184
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,543
I think it's aged well.

185
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,550
I think it's better without the cheese.

186
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,808
You should've had it with your wife.

187
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:20,354
She doesn't enjoy drinking at home.
She says there's no mood.

188
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,231
Did you guys talk it out that day?

189
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,443
I didn't want to be
the only one suffering.

190
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,112
Can't you see what I've become?

191
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:31,115
Do I seem fine to you right now?

192
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,035
You've lived a prosperous life
thanks to me.

193
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,704
Why are you going this far?

194
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,958
You've tormented me enough.

195
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,210
You shouldn't have bothered me
from the get-go.

196
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,754
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

197
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,633
Do you think saying sorry will cut it
after hurting my feelings?

198
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,415
I won't comment on your makeup again.
You can do whatever you want.

199
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,003
I only said that because I cared for you.

200
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,796
But the way I said it was wrong.

201
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,548
You've changed.

202
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,883
No, I haven't.

203
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,594
You're not the Sa-hyeon I used to know.
Admit it.

204
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:38,098
-We can't always stay the same.
-Why not? I haven't changed.

205
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,185
Su-mi's husband treats her even better
after getting married.

206
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,979
Then go live with him.

207
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,982
I'm sure they have their own problems.

208
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,568
-You don't even let me sleep on your arm.
-I will.

209
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,446
Only if I nudge? Or beg?

210
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,031
Then what do you want me to do?

211
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,659
How can I make you feel better?

212
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,911
I don't know.

213
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,580
I was already hungry and angry,
but you made it worse.

214
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,416
-Would you like some ramyeon?
-You're craving it, aren't you?

215
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,253
Let's go to Happy Dinner.
There's no traffic now.

216
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,882
You probably had dinner already.
You even had a drink.

217
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,759
You reek of makgeolli.

218
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:20,182
How could you drink
when I've been starving?

219
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,433
I was upset.

220
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,895
I didn't eat with my colleagues
and came home early on purpose.

221
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,522
What do you want me to do?

222
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,065
Nothing.

223
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,997
You want to hit me, don't you?

224
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:46,917
That's enough.

225
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,546
Hit me.

226
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,884
You don't have to put up with me.

227
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,720
We shouldn't live together
if we fell out of love.

228
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,639
We didn't fall out of love.

229
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,058
Were we like this when we were newlyweds?

230
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,184
Don't talk so rashly.

231
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,146
Then was it not rash of you
to throw my teddy bear like that?

232
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,282
Where are you going?

233
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:20,951
Get a divorce!

234
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,829
Fine, let's do it!

235
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,352
We haven't talked to each other
ever since.

236
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,314
Until now?

237
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,316
Yes.

238
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:56,111
This is wrong. You should talk it out
as soon as possible.

239
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,529
It'll only make things worse.

240
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,448
But there's nothing I can do.

241
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,700
I've done everything,
but she's still mad at me.

242
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,036
It could've been because she was hungry.

243
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:08,123
We get irritated too when we're hungry
and the food isn't served quickly.

244
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,833
Then what should I have done?

245
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,295
You should've stopped her
when she was heading to the bedroom.

246
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:18,091
If you'd stopped her and kneeled,
she would have forgiven you.

247
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,138
You should put your ego aside.

248
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,809
At times, we act like babies
and throw tantrums

249
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,145
in front of the ones we love.

250
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,274
When that happens, one of you should yield

251
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:38,612
and try your utmost best
to talk it out until it works.

252
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,507
It's not too late.

253
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,777
Could we have dinner together tomorrow?

254
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,070
Sure.

255
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,338
Mini.

256
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,715
Yes?

257
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,259
-Turn off the TV.
-Turning off the TV.

258
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,058
Mini.

259
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,351
Yes?

260
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,353
Isn't Dong-mi pretty?

261
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,734
I'm sorry, but I don't understand.

262
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,784
He's getting worse and worse.

263
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,665
Good work, everyone.

264
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,960
You were right on the clock once again.

265
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,260
Can you guys wait
at the first-floor lounge?

266
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,054
I have some gifts for you.

267
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,306
Sure.

268
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,397
Perhaps, he'll give us
tickets to some performance.

269
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,024
Probably.

270
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,735
Seeing how happy you are,
you guys must've reconciled.

271
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,528
-We did.
-Was it a lovers' quarrel?

272
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,155
This time, it lasted quite a bit.

273
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,658
In the beginning,
neither side wants to give in.

274
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,619
It's been three years already.

275
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,205
I guess he totally yielded to you.

276
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,664
Of course. He has no choice.

277
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,501
It's not easy to make Hye-ryung give in.

278
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,253
You should give in now and then.

279
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,590
If you don't,
he might fall out of love with you.

280
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,633
Here he comes.

281
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,228
You three can share.

282
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,646
-What is it?
-Caviar.

283
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,857
-Caviar?
-Goodness. The whole box?

284
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,651
-There should be 30 jars.
-Goodness.

285
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,319
Is it okay for us to take it?

286
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,613
Do you think it was a bribe
from a celebrity?

287
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,324
-I brought it from home.
-Did you buy it for us?

288
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:32,202
It was a gift, but I don't enjoy caviar.

289
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,995
And I'm too lazy to eat it.

290
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,957
Still, that person gave it to you
as a gift.

291
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,125
Was it 7 p.m. on 27th?

292
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,336
Yes. That's the only time available.
They're fully booked.

293
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,421
-And there's a dress code.
-Okay.

294
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,842
Thank you, Mr. Seo.

295
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,386
-Me too.
-Me too.

296
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,905
How much is it per jar?

297
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,494
Let's get something to drink. I'm thirsty.

298
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,832
He must be from a wealthy family.

299
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:22,002
He's handsome and well-educated.

300
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,421
Electronic Engineering?

301
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,505
Yes.

302
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,967
Let's make him drink a lot the day
after tomorrow and find out about him.

303
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,387
To do that,
we'll have to drink a lot as well.

304
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,847
What's stopping us?

305
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,392
I wonder if he's just pretentious

306
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,477
or if his first love broke his heart.

307
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,354
I want to know about his story.

308
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,149
-Why?
-Because we're a team.

309
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,235
You should leave no stone unturned.

310
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,488
I don't know about that.
But I won't stop you guys.

311
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:13,094
I thought Ji-a was being rude
and hitting my butt.

312
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,473
I wasn't hitting your butt.
I was caressing it.

313
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,809
It wasn't a caress. You hit it.

314
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,604
-This is hitting.
-That hurts.

315
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,606
I'm sorry.

316
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,034
I can see that my wife splurged today.

317
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,994
Was it 50,000 won per spoon?

318
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,664
-They were a gift.
-Not a bribe?

319
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,749
They were from our executive manager.

320
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,834
-Seo Ban?
-Yes.

321
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,878
-To you only?
-No, the three of us.

322
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:50,298
Why? Caviar is expensive.
He should've kept it for himself.

323
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,676
He got it as a gift,
but he doesn't like the taste.

324
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,470
I guess he has a tacky taste.

325
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,889
Caviar is delicious.

326
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,478
You came home quite early today
for a change.

327
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,397
-I'll be honest.
-Okay.

328
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,901
I don't want to work. I want to stay home
and spend time with you all day.

329
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,027
Can I do that?

330
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,280
Yes.

331
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,624
I forgot to give you this yesterday.

332
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,836
-The book you translated?
-Yes.

333
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,963
I'll read it at home.

334
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,882
You signed it, right?

335
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,385
-No.
-Why not?

336
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,387
Because I'm not the author.

337
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,847
But you translated it.

338
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:43,184
Sign this and give it back.
No, sign it right now.

339
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,647
-There's some left for Dad, right?
-Of course.

340
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,109
It's like we're eating money right now.

341
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,069
Does it suit your taste?

342
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,529
It tastes very enticing.

343
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,823
How accurate.

344
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,243
I can't believe
I get to have my fill of precious caviar.

345
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,462
You know in the wintertime,
Hokkaido is covered in snow.

346
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,255
Yes, there's snow everywhere.

347
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,798
My wife and I were in Otaru

348
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:17,510
and saw a long queue
in front of this one restaurant.

349
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,680
We looked it up,
and it was a famous steak restaurant.

350
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,182
So we got in line.

351
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,142
It was such a small restaurant.

352
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:27,729
It had a perpendicular open kitchen
and could only fit ten customers.

353
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:31,441
The table turnover time was
more than 40 minutes.

354
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,693
Right. You'd have to order,
wait for the foodâ€¦

355
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,153
And eat.

356
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:39,115
After about 30 to 40 minutes in the snow,
our feet were freezing.

357
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,994
So we all stamped our feet
and looked into the window

358
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,622
as if we were at a zoo.

359
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,707
We were waiting for them to finish eating.

360
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:52,003
After some time, we just couldn't leave
because of the time we had waited.

361
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,254
I understand.

362
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:58,802
We finally entered after shivering
in the cold for an hour and 40 minutes.

363
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,179
Was it tasty?

364
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,139
It was so-so.

365
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,184
Right. We didn't look at the window
once we sat down.

366
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,937
We knew people were looking.
We didn't want to meet their eyes.

367
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,900
-I've never been to Otaru.
-Then Sapporo?

368
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:16,194
Yes, Sapporo and Hakodate.

369
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,113
Excuse me.

370
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,246
This is crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e with avocado and uni.

371
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,206
Break the caramel
and have it with the uni.

372
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,791
Okay. Thank you.

373
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:44,055
This place has splendid dishes.

374
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,807
You're quite an epicure.

375
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,894
My colleagues and clients
would bring me to these places.

376
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:11,040
That restaurant sold more than just steak.

377
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:14,127
They also had udon and uni dishes.

378
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,712
Then there was this woman.

379
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:20,633
I couldn't tell whether she was Japanese,
Chinese, or Korean by her looks.

380
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,345
She'd slowly place some udon noodles
on her spoon

381
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,556
and blow on them before eating them

382
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,641
when people were standing outside,
shivering.

383
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,101
I hated her.

384
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,271
Many women eat like that.

385
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,107
I shouldn't do that anymore.

386
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,902
I mean, people were shivering in the cold.

387
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:42,989
So was she before coming in.
She could have been more considerate.

388
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:46,534
Does eating udon with a spoon
make it taste better?

389
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:01,132
-Are you okay?
-I drank just enough.

390
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:17,607
MAYBE HE'S GOING TO SAY
WE SHOULD STOP MEETING

391
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,405
This wasn't an early birthday meal for me,
was it?

392
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,740
No.

393
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,538
You knowâ€¦

394
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,793
Are we saying goodbye today?

395
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,127
Not at all.

396
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,840
Thanks to you, my wife and I
reconciled yesterday.

397
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,467
If you do as I say, you'll be just fine.

398
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,428
I'm a fellow female
and have been married before.

399
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,433
Lately,

400
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,812
I've been thinking about relationships.

401
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,775
And I don't want us to have
any kind of relationship.

402
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,696
Not lovers,

403
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,574
not parents and children,

404
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,119
married couples, friends,

405
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,080
or siblings.

406
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,333
I want us to be just
Song Yuan and Xiexian.

407
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:24,674
I've learned that all relationships
are bound to break eventually.

408
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,053
I don't want what we have to end.

409
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,390
I want us to continue with what we have.

410
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:38,104
Let's be the closest we can get
without defining what we have.

411
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:41,357
When one of us is sick or in trouble,
let's be the first ones

412
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,401
to reach out and help.

413
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,612
I know I can do that.

414
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:50,867
Your brother lives on Jeju Island,
so you only have your friends in Seoul.

415
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,621
But I'm not saying that I pity you.

416
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,081
I want us to be as close as possible.

417
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,084
What we have may not be defined,

418
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:04,672
but I want to chat with you,
have a meal together,

419
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,966
and also hear your advice.

420
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,888
I want to grow old with you like that.

421
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,520
I hope I'm not burdening you.

422
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,731
I'm not asking to have a relationship.

423
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,028
Right.

424
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,453
Why am I getting emotional?

425
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:47,215
I might run to you
if I go through something upsetting.

426
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,092
Can I do that?

427
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,135
You can.

428
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,099
Call me anytime when you need my help.

429
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:59,018
For example, if the sewer is leaking
or your furniture breaks.

430
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,395
Can you fix them?

431
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,063
No. I should call for help.

432
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,274
But it's better than doing it by yourself.

433
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,903
Thank you.

434
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,156
I feel reassured.

435
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,118
Let me know if anyone bothers you.

436
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:16,911
And what will you do?

437
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,371
I'm a lawyer.

438
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:22,083
I'll be able to take care of it
no matter what.

439
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,253
I can't sleep
because my neighbor upstairs is too noisy.

440
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,296
Okay.

441
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,175
No. I was just joking.

442
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,139
Give me some. You might black out again.

443
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,810
You don't want to go through it
ever again?

444
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,854
I didn't mean it that way.

445
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,939
I could travel anywhere with you
on my back.

446
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,740
Don't forget about our promise today.

447
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:57,744
We won't define our relationship,
but we'll stay as close as possible

448
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,245
and open up to each other.

449
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,520
-Hello, Mother.
-Are you home?

450
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,355
No. Not yet.

451
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,358
-Not yet?
-I'm practicing drums.

452
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,070
You're coming over
the day after tomorrow, right?

453
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:33,988
Why?

454
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,865
It's your father-in-law's birthday.

455
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:37,784
Oh, no.

456
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,704
Did you forget?

457
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:46,542
I'm sorry. I've only been checking
my schedule from day to day.

458
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,169
Of course I'll go.

459
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,214
I know you air pre-recorded files
on the weekends.

460
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,882
But I called in case you forgot.

461
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,425
I see.

462
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,969
-Okay. Good night.
-Good night.

463
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,225
I have to go golfing. What do I do?

464
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,561
Shouldn't you go to bed?

465
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,357
Yes, I should wash up first.

466
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:23,079
Did something happen today?

467
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,290
It's about Director Park Min.

468
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,167
Yes?

469
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,628
He graduated from marriage.

470
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,964
Goodness. Why?

471
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:36,759
They seemed happy. Who brought it up?

472
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,013
Is Director Park seeing someone?

473
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,307
Of course not. He'll be 80 soon.

474
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,601
His wife wanted it.

475
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,606
What is your take on it?

476
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,485
I'm not sure.
I've never really thought about it.

477
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,072
-Must I?
-Let's play Truth or Dare.

478
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,365
About graduating?

479
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,368
Do you have any interest in doing that?

480
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:07,331
If it were me, I would just end it.

481
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,251
-You'd rather get a divorce?
-Yes.

482
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:16,174
I've never thought of divorcing you.

483
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,885
-Really?
-What about you?

484
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,219
Likewise.

485
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,766
Let's age lovingly together.

486
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,479
-But there's a problem.
-What?

487
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,899
I'm the only one aging.

488
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:36,277
You, on the other hand,
are getting younger by the day.

489
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,990
Please. I have been aging as well.

490
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:44,160
It's just that you love me so much
that you don't notice it.

491
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,795
Today's date will be special.

492
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,757
Come to Dongil-daero 27-gil.
Call me when you arrive.

493
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,383
Will 6:30 p.m. be okay?

494
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,399
Ji-a.

495
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,902
-Five more minutes, Dad.
-Okay.

496
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,863
Isn't it your mother's birthday today?

497
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,492
-Is it?
-What?

498
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,371
Are you really her daughter?
The only daughter, at that?

499
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:32,124
I guess it's true that you drift apart
if you live far away.

500
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,168
My life is just so hectic.

501
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,878
Then you didn't send her any gift?

502
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:37,964
No.

503
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,427
I'll give her a call. You should as well.

504
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,348
She must be upset.

505
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,392
We don't even live in the same country.

506
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,393
Exactly.

507
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,104
You don't even live in the same country,

508
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,648
so you should've remembered
her birthday at least.

509
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,024
Fine.

510
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:02,238
Ji-a, let's call your grandma
in the Philippines on the way.

511
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,115
-It's her birthday.
-Okay.

512
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,798
Have a good birthday.

513
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,683
Honey, I'm here. There are many shops.

514
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,644
-Come to the second floor.
-Is there a restaurant?

515
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,896
I'm at a foot massage shop.

516
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,816
-"Foot massage shop"?
-Come up first.

517
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,571
Hello. This way, please.

518
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,165
You have ingrown toenails.

519
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:58,044
-He's my husband.
-Hello.

520
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,837
He has toenail problems.

521
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,756
I see.

522
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,386
-Isn't it refreshing?
-It is.

523
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,558
It's your father's birthday tomorrow.

524
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,019
Let's sleep in and go there for lunch.

525
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,937
My sister-in-law will make breakfast.

526
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,189
I can't go.

527
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,609
I have to go golfing.

528
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,694
How could you when you knew that--

529
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,988
I didn't know. I forgot.

530
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,741
How could you forget his birthday?

531
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:35,581
Even if you're breaking up,
there's no point in pointing fingers.

532
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,125
Why hurt each other more
if you're going to break up?

533
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,295
It's best to end things amicably.

534
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,757
Even more so
if you're not going to get a divorce.

535
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,926
If she's not the type to easily give in,

536
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:50,054
don't expect it from her,
and just yield to her.

537
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,807
I'm sure she will gradually change.

538
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,731
Then what should we do?

539
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,818
Say that you promised to golf
with another married couple.

540
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,655
Say that they're your VIP clients,
so you can't bail on them.

541
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,407
-And?
-He'll understand.

542
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,242
He owns a country club.

543
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:14,203
Let's go on Sunday. I'll send a cake
and some flowers tomorrow.

544
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,250
Can't you excuse yourself early?

545
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,378
Tell them it's his birthday,
and let's have dinner in Daejeon.

546
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,046
I can't do that.

547
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,219
Please? I'll get on the wrong side
of them if I do.

548
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,016
When will you call them?

549
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,937
-Later.
-You're the best.

550
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,611
Goodness. Good night,

551
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,407
my daughter.

552
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:56,036
You're much better than most people.

553
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,920
-Should I take out all the meat?
-Just enough for the soup.

554
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,925
-Jun-jae.
-Yes?

555
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:13,929
They say women lose their cooking skills
when they turn 60.

556
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,681
But isn't my palate still excellent?

557
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:18,058
You're right. You're very accurate.

558
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,811
I think you'll be still good
even when you turn 70.

559
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,397
Who knows what will happen in the future?

560
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,358
Isn't your older daughter-in-law
coming in the morning?

561
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,695
She has her job, I have mine.

562
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,697
And think in her shoes.

563
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,741
It's so burdening and exhausting

564
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:37,369
to come here early in the morning
and cook for your father-in-law.

565
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,537
That's true.

566
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,167
You really are the best mother-in-law.

567
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,420
That's not true. Times have changed.

568
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,923
SA-HYEON

569
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,050
-It's your younger son.
-Okay.

570
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,639
-Yes?
-You're not sleeping yet, right?

571
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,933
Of course not.
I'll be sleeping past midnight.

572
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,976
I have to prepare seaweed soup.

573
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,271
What time are you coming tomorrow?
I haven't seen you in ages.

574
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,107
Mom. I'm sorry.

575
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,359
Why?

576
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,945
I forgot I had to go golfing
with my client tomorrow.

577
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,572
-At our club?
-No, in Yongin.

578
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,408
Goodness. Then you won't be here
until later in the evening.

579
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,369
I'm having dinner with them.

580
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,621
Will Hye-ryung be coming here alone?

581
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,164
I'm taking her with me.

582
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,960
We'll come on Sunday.

583
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:29,755
I'm sorry, Mom.

584
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,341
Your dad's going to feel down.

585
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,428
It must be his age.
He feels upset often nowadays.

586
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,222
I'll cheer him up when I get there.

587
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:40,849
Okay.

588
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,269
Mom, don't overwork yourself tonight.

589
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,440
Bye.

590
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,791
-Did you call her?
-Yes.

591
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:06,959
What did she say?

592
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:08,877
She just said, "Okay."

593
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:11,714
How does this look?

594
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,341
-Did you get a new one?
-No, it's sponsored.

595
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,637
-They all suit you.
-I do look good in anything.

596
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,644
Hello.

597
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,401
Ms. Nam!

598
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,946
My aunt is a fan of yours,
and she wants your autograph.

599
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:39,950
Hello.

600
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,453
Oh, hello.

601
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,663
Come by my office after class.

602
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:46,832
Okay.

603
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:49,877
Sit down.

604
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,718
Why do you address lecturers that way?

605
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:02,348
Explain to me when and to whom

606
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,767
you should address people that way.

607
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,394
You used the honorifics,
so you should know.

608
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,273
To lecturers.

609
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:14,109
Who told you to address lecturers
that way?

610
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,446
That online site
you guys have blind faith in?

611
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,824
After all, it's an abbreviation.

612
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,951
Young people like to abbreviate words.

613
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:26,372
But you address some as "Professor"
and others as "Miss" or "Mister."

614
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,291
Are you discriminating against lecturers?

615
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,085
They studied just like us.

616
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,171
They teach and give you
knowledge and wisdom.

617
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,758
At hospitals and universities,

618
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:41,387
fellow professors, doctors, and nurses

619
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,765
address each other like so
for convenience.

620
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,602
One would address their colleagues
who are younger

621
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,063
but have the same or higher rank that way

622
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,191
since it'd be uncomfortable

623
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,443
to address them more formally.

624
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,529
Are the lecturers in the same rank as you?

625
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:03,784
Then? Do you teach them
although they're older than you?

626
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:09,832
As a university student,
shouldn't you know better?

627
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,418
Did you learn to discriminate?

628
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:16,171
-I'm sorry.
-Address people properly.

629
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,840
This is important.

630
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,802
How would you feel
if you became a lecturer,

631
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:25,180
but your students addressed you as Miss?

632
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,724
I apologize.

633
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:33,021
You may leave.

634
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:40,946
Have a seat, please.

635
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,451
Did you scold her?

636
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:48,370
-Do you drink black tea?
-Yes, I do.

637
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,956
Wait. You don't have to make tea for me.

638
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,749
I wanted some for myself anyway.

639
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,752
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, FATHER
HYE-RYUNG

640
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,547
Hye-ryung sure is generous.

641
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,591
A career woman is different indeed.

642
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:08,056
Why are you so quiet?

643
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,225
You should reply when I say something.

644
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,353
I just don't want to agree with you.

645
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:17,441
Are you saying you don't like me,
or Hye-ryung?

646
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:21,111
Hye-ryung? For not eating with us
on my birthday?

647
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,822
It's not her fault.

648
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:27,075
Sa-hyeon had an appointment
with his client. It can't be helped.

649
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,495
Do you not know your own son?

650
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,080
Do you think he'd go golfing
on his father's birthday?

651
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,666
Hye-ryungâ€¦

652
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,337
Never mind. Forget it.

653
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,838
You're saying it was her appointment?

654
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:43,342
She forgot her father-in-law's birthday.
Good going for her.

655
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,511
-Elaborate.
-I can't be bothered.

656
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,095
Then why did you even mention it?

657
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,850
Finish your sentence.

658
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:56,939
Listen. Don't let your students
address you improperly.

659
00:46:57,022 --> 00:47:00,150
-Should I scold them?
-They should know it's wrong.

660
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:04,404
If we don't correct them, they'll do that
even after they find a job.

661
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,949
It's better for them to be scolded now
than later.

662
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,286
In universities,
we need to teach them not only knowledge,

663
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,122
but also common courtesy.

664
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,544
I know that people are becoming
ruder and ruder as time goes by,

665
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,170
but they should know what's wrong.

666
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,840
-Okay.
-"Ms. Kim," "Ms. Lee."

667
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,134
We're neither their friends nor juniors.

668
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:32,140
This is serious.
Do I look old-fashioned to you?

669
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:35,269
No. You're right.

670
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,897
They don't need to offend others
by addressing them improperly.

671
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,233
What our elders used to say is true.

672
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,487
"If you love your child, discipline them.
If you don't, let them be."

673
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:50,450
You're right.
We ought to teach them principles.

674
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,787
We shouldn't be swayed by social trends.

675
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,122
Exactly.

676
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,501
It healed perfectly without a scar.

677
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:02,754
Yes, thanks to you
driving me to the hospital on time.

678
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,591
Let me take this.

679
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:08,093
-Okay.
-My speakers are broken.

680
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:13,807
Hello? Hello, sir.

681
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,686
The left speaker wasn't working.

682
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,314
Yes, I plugged in the cable correctly.

683
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:23,400
It hasn't been working at all
since yesterday evening.

684
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,568
It won't even turn on.

685
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:27,863
Yes.

686
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,324
When can you come?

687
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,700
Don't.

688
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,830
I have to find another repairman?

689
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,751
Then I'll call you back later.

690
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,003
Goodbye.

691
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,548
-Your speakers are broken?
-Yes.

692
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,716
What's the brand?

693
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:51,303
Dugel. The company that imported it
closed down.

694
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:54,431
So I just called a repair company.

695
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,809
The repair fee could be as high
as two million won.

696
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:02,022
They said so. They will check,
but it'll be over 1.5 million won.

697
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,399
I can fix it.

698
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,777
Invite Jin-a as well
and make us some ramyeon.

699
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,278
Or just laver and instant rice.

700
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:11,990
-Do you mean that?
-I used to be crazy about speakers.

701
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,535
It's easy to get ripped off
when you get speakers fixed.

702
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,747
I'm not a great cook,
so I'll call a catering service.

703
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,625
I'll be happy
with a single roll of gimbap.

704
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,627
Gimbap Eutteum sells good gimbap.

705
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,671
And I'm sure Jin-a only needs some drinks.

706
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,089
I have a variety.

707
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:30,801
-Do you drink alone?
-My dad loves to drink.

708
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:34,221
When he emigrated to Spain,
he gave me all of his collection.

709
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:38,725
Liquor, Kaoliang liquor, cognac, whiskey,
wine, and more.

710
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,310
I'll give you a few.

711
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:43,230
I'll end up drinking them all.

712
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,357
Ask Jin-a when she'll be available.

713
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:58,954
Come in.

714
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,291
I thought you were U-ram.

715
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,420
Did you move the dumbbell?
Your mom doesn't know where it is.

716
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,088
I probably threw it away.

717
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,298
You did? Why?

718
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,300
Maybe it's in the utility room.

719
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,386
Check the veranda.

720
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,638
I found it.

721
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,978
You're going to work out? At this hour?

722
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,896
To prevent frozen shoulder.

723
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,608
Right. Jae-in's mom is suffering
from frozen shoulder lately.

724
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:35,198
Don't overwork yourself all of a sudden.

725
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,116
I won't.

726
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,148
PARK HAE-RYUN, HEAD OF DEPARTMENT

727
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,233
Hello.

728
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:13,111
I've arrived at your apartment block.
Is Jin-a there?

729
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,655
She said she'll be here soon. Come up.

730
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,657
Or should I come down?

731
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,702
I'll go up. What's the unit number?

732
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,290
Okay. See you soon.

733
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,988
It's open.

734
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:00,992
Welcome.

735
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:08,375
Jin-a is never on time.
She's always ten to twenty minutes late.

736
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,336
Cut her some slack today
since it's my house.

737
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,089
Sure. You're the host.

738
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:19,928
I got this pu'er tea as a gift.
My friend said it's pretty high-quality.

739
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:20,971
You love tea, soâ€¦

740
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:22,722
You should just keep it.

741
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:26,601
I do have some at home,
but my wife and I prefer coffee.

742
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:41,700
The juniors always arrive last.
I guess that's how things are in Korea.

743
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:43,326
I'm sorry.

744
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,996
You left on time,
but there's always a traffic jam, right?

745
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,122
Exactly.

746
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,000
-Here.
-I told you not to bring anything.

747
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:52,335
It's for me. It's meat.

748
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,045
I thought you preferred raw fish.

749
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:56,798
My oriental doctor told me
not to eat fish anymore.

750
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:59,801
I have the physiological type of soeum,
so beef is better.

751
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,219
That's an expensive type.

752
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,556
Gosh, that's exactly what my husband said.

753
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,100
You brought a lot.

754
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,187
Hey. It's been a while.

755
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,941
How did you know? Seriously?

756
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,111
No way. Okay.

757
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:20,447
I'll be right there then. Okay.

758
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:26,536
That was my friend from high school.
Last week, she moved here.

759
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:30,040
She was tending her plants in the veranda
and saw me come in here.

760
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:32,167
-She lives across from here.
-Gosh.

761
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,169
Let me just go there and say hi.

762
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:35,128
Sure.

763
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,757
-You better hurry.
-I will.

764
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,641
-Aren't you hungry?
-No, I'm okay.

765
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,809
You should eat first. Take your time.

766
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,772
-Let me wash my hands.
-Okay.

767
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:26,930
Professor Park,
which would you like, wine or whisky?

768
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:30,850
I don't mind, but Jin-a prefers wine
to go with her meat.

769
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,018
Okay.

770
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:38,733
I'll open it. Just put it on the table.

771
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,531
You'll eat raw fish, right?

772
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,533
There are so many dishes.

773
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:50,120
Let's just have meat. Keep the fish
and make jeon with it later.

774
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:53,873
I'm truly a terrible cook,
so that won't be possible.

775
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,250
Should I do it for you?

776
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,591
You must help out your wife
around the house.

777
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:06,970
I grew up helping my mom.
My parents had no daughters.

778
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:08,430
I see.

779
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,435
It smells nice.

780
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,484
-May I take a look at the bottles?
-Sure.

781
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:32,537
Feel free to take any of the bottles.
I won't drink them anyway.

782
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,456
Doesn't your family visit?

783
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:38,460
They do, but my dad doesn't drink much
since he's older now.

784
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,461
He can't.

785
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,588
How often do you visit Spain?

786
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,758
I went there twice,
but I stopped going at some point.

787
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,636
Whenever I had free time,
I'd travel elsewhere.

788
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:54,893
That's not all. There are twice as many
at my house in Yangpyeong.

789
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,020
You have a house in Yangpyeong?

790
00:55:57,103 --> 00:56:00,648
My parents had it built
as if they'd live there forever.

791
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,068
Then they emigrated
with their sibling's family.

792
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,451
Let me.

793
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,667
Here?

794
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:21,377
Yes.

795
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,801
I'm bad at grilling meat. What do I do?

796
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:30,720
-I'll do it.
-Do you know how to?

797
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,264
I always grill the meat
when my family goes camping,

798
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,725
You should be careful
not to cook them too dry.

799
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:57,789
You can take the first bite.

800
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,890
What's taking Jin-a so long?

801
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,560
She can't be having dinner there, right?

802
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,395
I'll call her.

803
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:24,482
She should grill the meat
if she bought it for herself.

804
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,734
Jin-a, why aren't you here yet?

805
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:29,904
Okay.

806
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:34,659
-She said she'll be here soon.
-That could mean an hour.

807
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,913
I bet it's not easy to manage both houses.

808
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,624
The person who watches the house
lives nearby.

809
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,042
Cheers.

810
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:48,423
You should invite us over often.

811
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:50,633
I hope my speakers break down more often.

812
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:53,553
-What? Did they break down?
-Yes.

813
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,055
That's why he came to fix them.

814
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:01,603
Then what am I? An accessory?
His assistant technician?

815
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:04,189
Just drink. Who cares?

816
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:06,691
Just enjoy this moment
with those you like.

817
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:07,609
He's right.

818
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:10,487
This moment

819
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:17,202
Nothing is as sly as your tongue.

820
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:20,705
It knows what's good and tasty
way too well.

821
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:27,295
Our dear Professor Park
is good at grilling meat.

822
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,255
So that's why you came late.

823
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:33,760
How can I possibly admit that
if that's true?

824
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,272
It's so good.

825
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:50,318
Anything made by someone else is good.

826
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,904
-Don't you cook?
-What?

827
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:55,406
Didn't my husband tell you

828
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:59,536
that his mother cooks all of our meals?

829
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:01,454
He never told me that.

830
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,541
I guess he didn't want people
to think less of me.

831
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:07,544
I'm not siding with my friend,
but Seung-jae is a wonderful man.

832
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:12,882
Goodness. Speaking of "wonderful,"
you are wonderful too.

833
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:16,553
His wife is lucky to have met him.

834
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,930
Or perhaps, she snatched him.

835
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,474
He's so upright.

836
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,478
He is mild-mannered
and respected by everyone at school.

837
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:29,816
My husband told me
he has never had problems with women.

838
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,902
That's not easy to do.

839
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,988
It is for me. It depends on the person.

840
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:38,199
He's in the top one percent
when it comes to good character.

841
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,702
Eat up.
You're about to give me indigestion.

842
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,131
I definitely understand.

843
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,134
Thanks to a man
who was nothing more than an animal,

844
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,678
my heart is still torn to this day.

845
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:04,142
Goodness, you're so funny.

846
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:16,487
Goodness, you didn't need to bring that.

847
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:20,241
Come on. Wine and cheese go hand in hand.

848
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:22,785
I prefer having good wine by itself.

849
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:29,250
Your house looks refined and tidy
since you live alone.

850
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,502
So there are five people under your roof?

851
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:34,088
Yes. There's no point in cleaning up.

852
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:37,300
I don't even think about cleaning up now.
I've given up.

853
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:40,511
At times,

854
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:43,264
I think I only have sons
as a punishment for the sins

855
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,266
I committed in my previous life.

856
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,643
It's only temporary.

857
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:49,103
They'll mature and be good to you,
just like I did.

858
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:53,650
I have utter respect for housewives.

859
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,276
It's not an easy job at all.

860
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,528
Here.

861
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:05,828
-Let me.
-No, it's okay.

862
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:08,206
You shouldn't fill your own glass.

863
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:18,049
How much can you drink?

864
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:22,220
It depends on my mood and the atmosphere.

865
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,222
How about when you're in a good mood?

866
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:27,850
It's my family.

867
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:31,229
I always get nervous when they call.

868
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:40,238
Yes, Mother.

869
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:44,325
Oh, no.

870
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,747
Their dad's not home yet?

871
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,958
I'll be right there.

872
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,920
-What's wrong?
-My second son's got a nosebleed.

873
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:57,255
And it won't stop.

874
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:02,343
I'm afraid I have to excuse myself.
I'm sorry.

875
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:07,223
Mother, call 911 first.

876
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:01,611
It's burnt.

877
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,571
Will it take some time?

878
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:06,949
Yes. About two hours?

879
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:10,828
Did you assemble this yourself?

880
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,122
You didn't, right?

881
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,375
The movers did it for me
when I moved here.

882
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:20,963
They made a mess with the cables.

883
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,256
That's why it broke.

884
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,178
Professor.

885
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:35,853
Could you

886
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,065
hold me for a moment?

887
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:15,685
How he feels about me
differs from how he feels about his wife.

888
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:17,770
Back in the day,
it would've been worth a kiss.

889
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:18,729
Go ahead.

890
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,317
I bet he'll be blown away
by my beauty today.

891
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:24,694
My gosh, Si-eun!

892
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:26,529
You look amazing today.

893
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:28,072
I hardly recognized you.

894
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:30,575
-You should put it in figures.
-I won't.

895
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:33,452
How much do you have to love someone
to want to marry them?

896
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,204
I want to hold your hand

897
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:38,791
and touch your face
as well as the line of your jaw.

898
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:39,917
I wish to feel them.

899
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:41,586
Don't date just anyone, though.

900
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:43,963
-Women must always be careful.
-Okay.

901
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:44,881
Come on!

902
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,676
-Put me down.
-Do you love me?

903
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:50,136
I asked you.

904
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,346
I wish I had met you sooner.

905
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:57,143
Please protect my dignity.

906
01:04:57,226 --> 01:05:02,189
