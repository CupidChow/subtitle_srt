EPISODE 13

2
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,020
It feels like yesterday
when we all came here together.

3
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,107
You may as well enjoy your time here.

4
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,323
I guess it's just not my day.

5
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,460
Dad saw a photo of you.

6
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,337
He said you look haggard
and is worried about you.

7
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,839
-You should eat more.
-I am eating.

8
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,175
You're eating much less now.

9
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:36,137
-I feel good and light.
-Even I think you look haggard.

10
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,848
That's okay as long as my soul looks fine.

11
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,893
What about my soul? Does it look okay?

12
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:49,943
Mr. Seo.

13
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,445
Hello.

14
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,494
I see you're here with your mother-in-law.

15
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,955
-I am.
-This is my younger brother.

16
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,666
-Biological?
-Yes.

17
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,460
Goodness. I didn't know you had a brother.

18
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,337
She's Ms. Sa, my colleague.

19
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,923
Hello. I'm Seo Dong-ma.

20
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,637
Come to think of it,
you do kind of look alike.

21
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,515
Goodness. Hello.

22
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,642
-Fancy seeing you here.
-Likewise.

23
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,227
They're brothers.

24
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,062
She's my mother-in-law.

25
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,523
I see. Hello.

26
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,317
You're both so handsome.

27
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,444
Shouldn't you get going?

28
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,405
-Is it just you two?
-Yes.

29
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,283
-See you next time.
-Goodbye.

30
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,166
-Mr. Seo.
-Yes?

31
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,584
I got divorced.

32
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,936
Why tell him?

33
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,815
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
He would have found out eventually.

34
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,358
Maybe she's joking.

35
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,860
Who jokes about that?

36
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,237
She's not much of a joker.

37
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,990
And yet, they're golfing together?

38
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,241
She's a second wife.

39
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,243
So she's not his real mother.

40
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,664
People could mistake her
for Ms. Sa's aunt or sister.

41
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:32,170
-I should tell the chairman that I'm here.
-Does he not know?

42
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,254
No.

43
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,049
He'll probably come running.

44
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,261
Isn't that him?

45
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,599
Goodness, speak of the devil.

46
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,230
Mun-ho.

47
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,315
Hey.

48
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,901
-Hello.
-Hello.

49
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,195
-Are you here with your family?
-Daughter-in-law.

50
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,573
-Hello.
-Hello.

51
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,908
It's been a while.

52
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,743
We met at the funeral last year.

53
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:08,039
Right. I'm sorry I couldn't greet you
properly because of everything.

54
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,541
Don't worry about it. Sit down.

55
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,253
Enjoy your time here
and see you next time.

56
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,255
Okay.

57
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,341
Thank you for the green tea.

58
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,426
My pleasure.

59
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,844
You look well.

60
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,806
-Take good care of her.
-Okay.

61
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,767
I'll pay for your drinks.

62
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,228
-It's okay.
-Really?

63
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,855
-Goodbye then.
-Goodbye.

64
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,315
-See you around.
-Yes, ma'am.

65
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,740
Honey, you want orangeade, right?

66
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,033
Yes.

67
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,160
-Two glasses.
-Okay.

68
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,797
You were so cold.

69
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,718
She was taken aback
because you were acting so differently.

70
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,219
They have a great relationship.

71
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,514
After Song Yuan gives birth,

72
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,350
I'll tell Coach Choi to teach her
how to play golf.

73
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,353
-Who'll take care of the baby?
-She has us.

74
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,314
About Hye-ryungâ€¦

75
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:19,235
I somehow feel like we were duped.
She never wanted a baby.

76
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,156
A woman can't get pregnant
whenever she wishes.

77
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,075
It happens in good time.
She needs God's blessing.

78
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:31,039
I wonder why God blessed
Song Yuan with a child?

79
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,208
Every now and then
I think about what Sa-hyeon said.

80
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,845
We can go in now.

81
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,442
-Let's go to Daejeon.
-Now?

82
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,612
-You don't want to watch the movie?
-Yes.

83
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,238
-Why?
-I'll tell you later.

84
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:51,953
Over there.

85
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,253
You don't need to prepare dinner for us.
We already ate.

86
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,007
You may be full, but he must be hungry.
After all, he's a full-grown man.

87
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,051
I'm not hungry. It ate a lot.

88
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,223
-Are you tired?
-It's fine. I just golfed today.

89
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,475
That producer you work with.

90
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,810
Ms. Sa?

91
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:19,230
Yes. She came to golf
with her mother-in-law.

92
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,524
It was nice to see them get along.

93
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,025
What do you think?

94
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:28,197
You have no interest in us.
You haven't asked about it.

95
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,365
You got matching rings?

96
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,451
Yes. It's been a while.

97
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,828
You've been doing
everything she wants these days.

98
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,414
She's been doing what I want.

99
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,249
-It was your idea?
-Yes.

100
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,461
-Why?
-Stop asking so many questions.

101
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,046
If Byeol-hui and Hae-ri were here,

102
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,340
they would've called that a lame reply.

103
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,425
I just wanted one.

104
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,720
Doesn't this ring make her look younger
than those huge ones

105
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,513
she used to wear?

106
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,973
Yes.

107
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,519
So what brings you two here?

108
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,938
They probably just wanted to visit us.

109
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,149
They don't need a reason to come here.

110
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,110
I'll divorce you.

111
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,865
I'll sign the papers.

112
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,076
Why all of a sudden?

113
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,662
Weren't you going to give it another try?

114
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,122
Aren't you glad?

115
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,334
Are you getting a divorce for her sake?

116
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,502
No.

117
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,171
It's because of him.

118
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,215
Did you say something?

119
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,050
No.

120
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,470
That woman, Song Won, must have
a big belly now.

121
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,639
Yes.

122
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,183
Did you say she was due next month?

123
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,144
Either next month
or the beginning of June.

124
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,272
Is that what you fought about?
Did you argue?

125
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,442
No. We were at the movies today,

126
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,611
and a pregnant woman passed us by.

127
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:54,867
And I saw him gazing at her
without even realizing it.

128
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,412
That broke my heart.

129
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,168
Get the papers ready by tomorrow.

130
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,004
You should be there when the baby is born

131
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,549
and be its father without shame.

132
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,761
Is that really the reason?

133
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,304
Yes.

134
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,224
What else could there be?

135
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,690
Do it before I change my mind.

136
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,900
I know the baby is the only thing
on your mind.

137
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,487
I can see that you're trying
not to show it with all your might.

138
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,364
Won't you regret it?

139
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,366
I shouldn't.

140
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:46,502
Is there anything you want to say?
I'm sure you're genuinely happy inside.

141
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,339
You desperately wanted a divorce.

142
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,175
He wasn't adamant about it.

143
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,013
-He had no other choice.
-You heard it too.

144
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:58,723
Right here.

145
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,851
He said he loved her.

146
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,146
That was also because
he felt responsible for the baby.

147
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,941
It doesn't matter.
Just like how I'm being considerate

148
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,654
of him and your grandchild,

149
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,908
I'd like to ask the same from you.

150
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,119
Eventually,

151
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,706
everyone in the country will know

152
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,667
that I'm divorced.

153
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,338
I have great pride in myself.

154
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,133
And I got married during my heyday.

155
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,184
I understand.

156
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,604
We'll give you enough money.

157
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,398
We'll register your current house
under your name.

158
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,736
I want a different house.

159
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,281
I won't be able to live there by myself.

160
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,534
Sure, then. Look for a new place.

161
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:04,622
Could you get me a place
at Cheongdam Villa?

162
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:09,418
Cheongdam Villa? It sounds familiar.

163
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,629
I have my fair share of hardcore fans.

164
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,465
-That place has good security.
-Okay.

165
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:17,468
Only conglomerates live there.

166
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,470
Don't be ridiculous.

167
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,556
They live in houses
located in Hanchung-dong.

168
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,892
Their kids and the new rich live there.

169
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,560
-You think it's a waste?
-Okay.

170
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,145
Check if any are on the market.

171
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,275
Are you calling a realtor?

172
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,736
I can just look it up.

173
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,697
Would a house be enough?

174
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,326
I don't have any money saved up.

175
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,915
The property tax and maintenance cost
will amount to a hefty sum.

176
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,800
She's been working all this time.

177
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,137
She couldn't have spent it all
on housekeeping, so where did it all go?

178
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,847
And her job pays well.

179
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,559
I'm sure she has her own nest egg.
She just wants some alimony.

180
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:12,440
I heard the price of a luxury villa
is on a par with that of a small building.

181
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,943
She deserves that much.
We ought to give her what she wants.

182
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,487
We have enough money for that.

183
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,407
I know women tend to be fickle,

184
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,909
but she had vehemently refused
to divorce him.

185
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,871
But after seeing a pregnant woman,
she had a change of heart?

186
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,915
She may seem cold-hearted,
but she's kind at heart.

187
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:35,212
And I'm sure it was painful to live
with someone who didn't love her anymore.

188
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,922
It's not like she lacks anything.

189
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,175
I should let her know right now.

190
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,801
-Song Yuan?
-Yes.

191
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,431
Are you that happy?

192
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,685
I'll just visit her tomorrow.

193
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,562
Good thinking. It's late already.

194
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,647
Her due date is just around the corner.

195
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,859
I was frustrated,

196
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,820
but Sa-hyeon is the father after all.

197
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:03,157
He promised not to see his own baby.

198
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,534
That's ludicrous.

199
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,578
I pity Sa-hyeon too.

200
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,248
But my heart breaks for Song Yuan.

201
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,584
And the baby too.

202
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,628
Would it be odd to remarry right away?

203
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:19,340
Probably. They'll take care of it.

204
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,009
Sa-hyeon will be too excited to sleep.

205
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,637
I wonder what Hye-ryung's family
in Canada will say.

206
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,766
What if they fly over here
and cause a scene?

207
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,937
Why would they?
We agreed to pay her handsomely.

208
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,023
For parents, it's not about the money.

209
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,901
They must be upset and heartbroken.

210
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,194
They must hate Sa-hyeon.

211
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,655
She could meet someone better.

212
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:47,117
Many divorced stars
get married to bachelors.

213
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,661
That'd be great.

214
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,372
We'd be relieved as well.

215
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,167
Shouldn't you at least thank me?

216
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,505
How could I?

217
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,591
Is that because you're sorry?

218
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,554
Yes.

219
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,473
And to my parents as well.

220
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,809
Because I'm taking their money?

221
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,769
Is that it?

222
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,438
-No.
-Don't lie.

223
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,191
They're suffering because of me.

224
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,822
-I'm a terrible son.
-They'll be elated once the baby is born.

225
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,448
What is it?

226
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,786
The baby's gender.

227
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,954
I don't know.

228
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,295
You must want to call her, so go ahead.

229
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:40,963
Tell her.

230
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,595
Let her know.

231
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,187
Hello, Ms. Sa.

232
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,231
I hope it's not too late.

233
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,358
It's only 9 p.m.

234
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,404
-Are you out?
-Yes. Can you come out?

235
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,780
Ms. Lee is coming too.

236
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,456
Of course.

237
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,718
The phone is turned off.
Your call will be directed toâ€¦

238
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,511
I stopped by your house.

239
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,347
You must be out. The lights were off.

240
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,766
Please call me as soon as you get this.

241
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,197
How do I look?

242
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,827
-Elegant?
-I've never seen you like this.

243
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,912
This is new.

244
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,956
I do drink every now and then.

245
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,083
I called Hye-ryung too.

246
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,127
You only drank with us.

247
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,461
You never drank alone.

248
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,255
Right.

249
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,509
I tried to dress up nicely,

250
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,469
but I still look shabby.

251
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,514
That's fine. You don't live
to impress others.

252
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,105
Please give us two new glasses.

253
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,525
Si-eun, order some appetizers.

254
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:10,029
-This is fine.
-I know you like fruit.

255
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,488
Let's wait for Hye-ryung.

256
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,283
There she is.

257
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,415
You should've invited Mr. Seo too.

258
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,376
Do you think he'd come?

259
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,211
He'd come if you called him.

260
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,756
I saw him today at your golf club.

261
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,134
-I see.
-I thought he was an only child,

262
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,427
but I was wrong.

263
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,805
He was golfing with his younger sibling.

264
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,308
-A sister?
-A handsome brother.

265
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,562
Their parents must be good-looking.

266
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,356
Ms. Sa, did you score a hole-in-one today?

267
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,652
Or else, why would a perfect wife
call us out this late for drinks?

268
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,654
Is your husband on a business trip?

269
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:58,410
This perfect wife has resigned.

270
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,873
Are you protesting something at home?

271
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,500
We're in our cooling-off period.

272
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,544
Knock it off.

273
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,922
Are you not shocked?

274
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,717
I'm being serious.

275
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,726
Order your favorite wine.

276
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,686
Tonight's on me.

277
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,747
Let's finish this first.

278
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,915
Are you serious?

279
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:50,254
-Why?
-My husband also cheated on me.

280
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,630
That can't be.

281
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,676
I don't believe it.
How could Dr. Shin do such a thing?

282
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,554
Exactly.

283
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,818
You shouldn't think lightly
of other people's problems

284
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,362
or think that it won't happen to you.

285
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:21,577
Si-eun, men don't cheat
because of a reason.

286
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,246
Are you serious?

287
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,666
The cooling-off period will end soon.

288
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,002
What about Ji-a? Does she know?

289
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,045
Not yet.

290
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,258
Did he bring up the divorce?

291
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,553
Then just sweep it under the rug
just this once.

292
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,346
I witnessed it with my own eyes.

293
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,473
How could I?

294
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,852
It won't be easy, but do it for Ji-a.

295
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:51,315
I wanted to let it slide for our kids.

296
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,692
I said I'd give him another chance.

297
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,737
But he was determined to leave.

298
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,238
I just don't get men.

299
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,992
All women are the same.

300
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,077
No one's special.

301
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,580
All men are the same as well.

302
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,838
I decided

303
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,507
to get a divorce today.

304
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,677
He has an illegitimate child.

305
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,679
-Your husband?
-Yes.

306
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,640
-Is it a son?
-I don't know yet.

307
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,350
The baby's due next month.

308
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,691
-Do your in-laws know?
-Of course.

309
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:40,572
They're earnestly waiting
for the due date.

310
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:44,243
The world is ridiculous.

311
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,372
-Did he come clean?
-He got caught.

312
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,374
How did it happen?

313
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,919
Are you adamant about the divorce?

314
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,587
Do you know what's funnier?

315
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,631
She's ten years older than him

316
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,175
and nine years older than me.

317
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,637
What's wrong with us?

318
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,056
Should we blame ourselves

319
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,725
or those men?

320
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,769
I'm truly baffled.

321
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,481
At times, I wonder if I'm to blame.

322
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:18,110
Then I think no, I lack nothing.

323
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,445
I wonder if this is my fate.

324
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,031
It was a living hell.

325
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,910
I couldn't tell anyone.
It was eating me up.

326
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:32,040
I tried to let it slide,
but it was impossible.

327
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,043
I understand your situation
since a baby is involved.

328
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:39,006
But, for you, it's best to
forgive and move on.

329
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,758
He was one-of-a-kind.

330
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,262
Exactly. That's why it's even more
difficult to forgive him.

331
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:50,934
He was truly a wonderful husband
and a father.

332
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,145
-So how could he?
-It was a mistake.

333
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,689
But a serious one.

334
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:59,192
Not all misdeeds can be
considered a mistake.

335
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,236
In retrospect,

336
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,657
it may not be the best decision
as a mother.

337
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,076
After all, we're not perfect either.

338
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,455
That's how we are.
We shouldn't expect perfection.

339
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,874
I thought I was a perfect wife.

340
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:17,961
But he got a woman
nine years older than me pregnant.

341
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,838
-Is she pretty?
-She's over 40.

342
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,757
How pretty could she be?

343
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,593
She's just average.

344
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:29,848
I just don't get it.
Both of you lack nothing.

345
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,266
Is it because you didn't want a baby?

346
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,934
It did boil down to that.

347
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,978
We have a son and a daughter.

348
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,356
They all have excuses.

349
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,319
Just like how death is inevitable,
I guess all men are inevitably cheaters.

350
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,739
I agree. They're just wired that way.

351
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:49,284
They say experience
is the mother of wisdom.

352
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,413
Take Mr. Seo for example.
He doesn't date anyone.

353
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,833
-Married men are worse.
-Who knows?

354
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,543
You can tell by his face.

355
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,047
Your facial expression changes
when you're in a relationship.

356
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,132
You have sparkling eyes
and a different aura.

357
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,511
Mr. Seo seems uninterested in women.

358
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,388
He spent his weekend golfing
with his brother.

359
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,475
Maybe he was in a traumatic relationship.

360
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,477
Just like how there are playgirls,

361
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,604
there are also playboys.

362
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,148
Some women are elegant,

363
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,400
and some men are like Mr. Seo.

364
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,529
And it's impossible to tell

365
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,656
until you experience it yourself.

366
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,450
They all wear masks
when in a relationship.

367
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,660
Tell me about it.

368
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:36,581
My husband was obsessively clean,

369
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,584
so I never thought he'd cheat on me.

370
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,378
I guess this is just our fate.

371
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,006
Some women are blessed
with loyal husbands.

372
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:45,966
I know one.

373
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,467
Who knows what he's like?

374
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,596
Will you really not reconsider
your decision?

375
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,141
I've thought about this numerous times.

376
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:01,273
The phone is turned off.
Your call will be directed to voice mail.

377
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:26,006
There's a reason why you two
can easily decide to get a divorce.

378
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,382
What do you mean?

379
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:28,425
Don't you get it?

380
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,594
You're young.

381
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,889
You still have time to meet someone new.

382
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,224
And you're competent.

383
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,893
You're competent too.

384
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,188
Fifty-one is still a young age.

385
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:44,024
We don't always have it easy.

386
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:48,278
Thinking about everyone finding out
and the hardships I'll go through

387
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,198
already gives me a headache.

388
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,785
Many celebrities have gotten a divorce.

389
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,831
Men will soon start hitting on you.

390
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:05,795
If your husband doesn't get remarried
and still wants to get back with you,

391
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,089
you should do that.

392
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,218
How could he not remarry

393
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,470
when that young girl
is head over heels for him?

394
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:16,264
I would let him back if I were you.

395
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,392
He's competent and handsome.

396
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:23,396
I bet your husband will
come back to you with his child.

397
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,482
I'm not holding my breath.

398
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:31,238
If I thought that he'd come back,
I wouldn't have made this decision.

399
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,823
You never know what the future holds.

400
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:37,202
We had no idea we'd be talking

401
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,205
about such things a year ago.

402
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,875
Next year,

403
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,545
we could be celebrating your remarriage.

404
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:52,300
-Maybe yours?
-Or yours.

405
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,727
-Shouldn't you leave?
-I'm sleeping over.

406
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,108
I'll give you a massage.

407
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,652
It's because of work, right?

408
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,616
-It's because I'm old.
-Dad's turning 80 soon,

409
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,869
but he's still alive and well.
He's always been healthy.

410
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,663
-It's because of your work.
-And you?

411
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:22,831
I don't have any.

412
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,960
-What do you think?
-You always have an ulterior motive.

413
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,045
You're not sincere with people.

414
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,132
That's true.

415
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,009
This may sound like an excuse,

416
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,553
but I'm a businessman.

417
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,389
I need to read people's thoughts.

418
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:41,391
-It gets lonely.
-Are you?

419
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,311
-Or do you mean me?
-Keep that up,

420
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,314
and you'll be left
with only those who are sly.

421
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,565
Like me?

422
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,234
Do you think I treat you that way?

423
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:54,904
Be half as nice to women as you are to me.

424
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,157
Not materialistically,
but with your heart.

425
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,491
I can assure you.

426
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:02,287
That will be impossible in this life.

427
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:08,043
To celebrate being single againâ€¦

428
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,004
What was her name again?

429
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,840
Let's go watch Nam Ga-bin's performance.

430
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,719
We should go before it ends.

431
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,679
It's ending next week.

432
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,809
Did you already watch it?

433
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,102
No, she didn't.

434
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,814
Invite Hyang-gi too.

435
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,652
Or would she not want to hang out
with old women like us?

436
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:39,699
There's something I haven't told you.

437
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,869
Promise me you'll keep it a secret.

438
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:47,415
-Of course.
-I heard Ga-bin said that she was

439
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,586
-seeing someone when she was on our show.
-Right.

440
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,172
It's my ex-husband.

441
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:02,138
Did you know about this?

442
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,600
Are you serious?

443
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,940
They said they were getting married
right after the Lunar New Year.

444
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:15,527
I haven't heard from them.
They must have postponed it.

445
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,321
Did she appear on our show

446
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,490
not knowing who you were?

447
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,744
Thanks to her appearing on the show,

448
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,163
we found out about each other.

449
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,542
He had kept his mouth shut

450
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,629
and didn't even mention her name

451
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:37,465
because he was afraid I'd hurt her.

452
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,092
What about Hyang-gi?

453
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:42,220
She knows everything
and she's accepted it.

454
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:46,558
Gosh, that's just shocking.
I'm at a loss for words.

455
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,352
Were you home alone last night?

456
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,437
With the housekeeper.

457
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,274
Does Mom drink often?

458
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:55,984
No.

459
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,452
I've gone swimming with Dad.

460
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:17,338
Hello. I asked around for your number.

461
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,215
I want to talk to you.

462
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,844
I have something to discuss with you.
Sincerely, A Mi.

463
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,515
-I need to make a call.
-Sure.

464
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,559
Could you get me some coffee?

465
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,898
Have you had dinner yet?

466
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,693
What's Dad doing?

467
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,487
I'm at the salon.

468
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:44,032
We're airing a pre-recorded episode
since it's the weekend.

469
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,658
But I have a shoot.

470
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,041
Mom, don't worry and listen
to what I'm about to tell you.

471
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,127
News articles about me
will be released soon.

472
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,379
I'm getting divorced.

473
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,970
Sa-hyeon is at fault here,

474
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,681
but I'm also partly to blame.

475
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,559
There's a problem with my uterus.

476
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,772
So it's difficult for me to get pregnant.

477
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,736
Getting treatment
won't guarantee anything.

478
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,822
I don't want to go through that.

479
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,202
My in-laws don't know.

480
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,916
They just think I'm divorcing him
because of other reasons.

481
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,213
Please let Dad know

482
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,882
and make sure he doesn't worry too much.

483
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,428
Don't worry about me.

484
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,556
You know how strong I am.

485
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,342
EXTERNAL CALL

486
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,637
What brings you here?

487
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,140
Are you going to keep me out here?

488
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,391
I came alone.

489
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:37,854
OPEN

490
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,827
I've missed you so much.

491
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,376
Tomorrow,

492
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,755
we're going to court. She wants a divorce.

493
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,426
-Really. She wants a divorce.
-What did you say to her?

494
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:11,220
Nothing. She brought it up first.

495
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:16,059
Let's get married as soon as possible
once the papers are filed.

496
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,439
It must have been tough on your own.

497
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,445
Look how big you've gotten.

498
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,885
I'm sorry to bother you on your day off.

499
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,890
One Americano, please.

500
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,266
Milk tea for me.

501
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,105
I didn't know you were busy.

502
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:06,442
I'll just cut to the chase.

503
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,905
I was wondering
if you would ever change your mind.

504
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,199
You could have asked via phone or text.

505
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,536
Are you worried I might?

506
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,831
Don't worry. I always stand by my word.

507
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:23,209
Did you send your mother off well?

508
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,628
It must have been hard for you.

509
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,297
You think that's the
only reason I had a hard time?

510
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,050
I doubt you know the meaning of "ojirap"

511
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,552
since you were born in the US.

512
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,887
No, I was born here.

513
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,518
It means it's none of your concern.

514
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:52,905
I'm quite an honest person.
I want to be honest with you from now on.

515
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,908
I love him.

516
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,785
And that won't ever change.

517
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,454
Then why did you lie?

518
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:05,418
Yu-sin said that would be for the best.

519
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:08,171
How so?

520
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:16,095
I suffered just as much
as you did, Pi-young.

521
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,182
We're not close enough
to call each other on a first name basis.

522
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,225
Do you want me to console you?

523
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:25,146
I know it's not right for me to call you
by your first name, butâ€¦

524
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,440
You dated a married man.

525
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,067
Was that right?

526
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,488
-I'm sorry.
-If you can't fix your mistake,

527
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,782
"I'm sorry," won't cut it.

528
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,494
What you did hurt me

529
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,663
and you're trying to squirm
your way out with those two words.

530
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:46,751
-That's being irresponsible and brazen.
-You're right.

531
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,506
I know you're seeing
red and can't understand me.

532
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,760
But I don't hate you.

533
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:59,180
Because you're not
the victim in this story. I am.

534
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:03,726
Someone with a sound mind
wouldn't hate their victim.

535
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:08,397
I can swear too
and do even worse than that.

536
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,108
-Go ahead.
-Are you taunting me?

537
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,361
Not at all.
If you swear at me, I'll listen.

538
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,780
If you hit me, I'll just take it.

539
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:20,785
Yu-sin said you were a good person,

540
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:24,914
and I can see that.

541
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:29,043
Did he say it was okay to betray me
since I'm a good person?

542
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,545
It wasn't easy for him either.

543
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:34,048
Problem solved.
Now, you just need to be happy together.

544
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,717
My parents taught me better than this.

545
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,389
-I had no idea this would happen.
-I don't want your life story.

546
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,850
-Are you justifying yourself?
-Are you sure

547
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:47,353
you won't have a change of heart?

548
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,730
Who knows?

549
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:54,026
You just said you had no idea
things would pan out this way.

550
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,320
Could you address me by my first name

551
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,780
instead of calling me "you"?

552
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,825
As if we'd see each other again.
Do you seriously think we would?

553
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,451
If you're okay with it,

554
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:06,956
may I stay with him at his house?

555
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,669
-Just get married.
-He has no plans to do that right now.

556
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,590
He says he needs time.

557
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,759
We've never even been on a trip

558
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,972
or spent the entire day together.

559
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,185
I want to live under the same roof as him.

560
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,354
You don't need my permission to do that.
I don't live there anymore.

561
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:34,358
I have a strong desire for food
or materialistic things,

562
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:39,363
but they're incomparable
to my desire for love.

563
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,659
You love him that much?

564
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,871
I do.

565
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:50,791
I don't care what you guys do whether
it's living together or getting married.

566
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,211
I'll take that as a yes.

567
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,545
Did he tell you to ask me?

568
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:58,090
No. We rarely meet these days.

569
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,761
He's been quite depressed.

570
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,766
I heard his stepmother was his first love.

571
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,687
Didn't you know?

572
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,481
Did he not tell you?

573
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,363
Judging by the way she treated me,

574
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,949
it looked like she was jealous.

575
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,619
When she yanked my hair,
it hurt for an entire week.

576
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:30,456
Not only did she yank my hair,
but she twisted it as well.

577
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,458
She was so strong.

578
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,313
You're leaving?

579
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,359
We're done talking here,
and I gave you my answer.

580
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,445
-Right.
-I'm not a saint.

581
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:02,989
I'm holding back.

582
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,533
I'll do anything you say.

583
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,868
What if I tell you to break up with him?

584
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,377
I hope you live
happily ever after with him.

585
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,088
I understand what you mean,

586
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,801
but he's not that flirtatious.

587
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,555
He has great manners

588
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,974
and is upright.

589
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,687
That's why I fell in love with him first.

590
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,733
And he was swayed by my feelings.

591
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,694
I'm truly sorry.

592
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,363
I was wrong.

593
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:49,410
I'll live my entire life in repentance.

594
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,211
Did you hear about
how I met my biological father?

595
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,007
You probably won't believe it.

596
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,885
It's too surreal for me too.

597
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,219
Does this concern me?

598
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,640
I guess I missed having company.

599
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:17,688
Lately, I haven't been meeting anyone.
I've just been boxing.

600
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,363
Hey, Ji-a.

601
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,907
I'm out right now.

602
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,911
I'll be home soon. Okay.

603
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,956
I'm curious about Ji-a
and would love to meet her.

604
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,625
Don't cross the line.

605
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:41,087
Don't hesitate to call me if you're sick.

606
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,882
I can make porridge for you.

607
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,717
I'll take care of you.

608
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,136
I mean it.

609
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:56,018
Nothing beats youth or innocence.

610
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,646
I had neither. It must have felt new.

611
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:14,537
He sure is different from most men.

612
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,789
We were taken aback too.

613
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:21,043
Maybe she was just being rash.

614
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:24,088
Not at all. She called us on our way here.

615
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:28,050
She said she found a place
she could move into right away

616
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,553
and asked if we could sign the contract.

617
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:33,389
She said she'd leave right away
once we made the payment.

618
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,182
-Really?
-Yes.

619
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:39,145
It'll be uncomfortable living together
when you're splitting.

620
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,146
That's right.

621
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,315
Tomorrow, they'll hand over
their divorce papers,

622
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,900
and I'll buy her that house.

623
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,735
We'll finish everything in a day.

624
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,446
So relax.

625
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:53,701
-Your baby brought us luck.
-Precognitive dreams must be powerful.

626
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,369
Of course.

627
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,456
Shouldn't we get you some new furniture?

628
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,041
-Let's go shopping.
-Right now?

629
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,169
Are you not feeling well?

630
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,755
No. It's just too sudden.

631
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,090
I know it is sudden.

632
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,217
But give it a day,
and you'll be just fine.

633
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,721
This may sound wrong,
but I was too excited to sleep last night.

634
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,890
It felt like things
were finally going right.

635
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,310
Hye-ryung may be a bit prickly,

636
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,811
but she sure is decisive.

637
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:25,065
I doubt she had a change of heart

638
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,818
simply because he gazed
at a pregnant lady.

639
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,403
That was probably just an excuse.

640
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,655
Maybe someone around her
showed interest in her,

641
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,533
so she probably saw no point
in living with a distant husband.

642
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,119
And perhaps

643
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,955
she might realize that
this was a losing game.

644
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,958
Whatever it may have been,
it was a wise decision.

645
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:46,045
I never imagined
things would pan out this way.

646
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:48,172
-Neither did we.
-My grandchild.

647
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,759
Are you listening, my lucky grandchild?

648
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,348
Are you okay with walking?

649
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,058
Walking is good for easy labor.

650
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:00,518
Is that right?

651
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,270
She must be hungry. What are you craving?

652
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,036
Welcome.

653
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,957
-Should we check out the couch first?
-Sure.

654
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,626
A baby is on the way. It's our grandchild.

655
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,254
This couch is good for people with kids.

656
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,718
-It's nice and comfortable.
-It's popular.

657
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,679
It's perfect for pregnant women. Sit.

658
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,389
Go on. He wants to buy one for you.

659
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,856
-Be careful.
-Be careful.

660
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,235
How is it?

661
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,778
Is this the moving company?

662
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,239
I'd like to ask about your price.

663
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,952
Not the entire family. Just me.

664
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,300
You're so silly.

665
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,028
This is good.

666
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,491
You should get new curtains.
Change up the house.

667
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,286
Hello, would you like
to browse these curtains?

668
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:45,748
This material is permeable
and lets in light.

669
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,125
It's our best product.

670
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:52,254
I'm going to move in with him
no matter what Yu-sin says.

671
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:57,509
He refuses to eat any of the side dishes.

672
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,511
I had to throw them out last week.

673
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,681
He only drinks alcohol and eats ramyeon.

674
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,101
He's lost so much weight.

675
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,812
What if he gets seriously ill?

676
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:12,524
We should take care of his health
whether we like him or not.

677
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:13,525
Don't you think so?

678
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:18,155
Just because of Yu-sinâ€¦

679
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,288
No wonder he's not hungry at all.

680
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,834
AUNT SEO-RI

681
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,800
-Hello?
-It's me.

682
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,177
-Hello.
-How are you doing?

683
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:44,139
-I'm getting by.
-The living must go on.

684
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:48,519
Pi-young, congratulate me.
I'm getting married.

685
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,231
Goodness, are you serious?

686
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:54,566
-Why wouldn't I be?
-With who?

687
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,568
Can you come over next month?

688
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,196
I should. I'll do a pre-recording.

689
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,115
Don't be shocked.

690
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:04,535
He's 20 years younger than me.

691
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:07,413
-Goodness.
-He's a sexy Filipino.

692
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:10,874
He cherishes me deeply.

693
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,668
He's Filipino?

694
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,921
Yes. He runs a small travel agency.

695
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:18,549
Seo-ri, I love you.

696
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,677
Did you hear that? He loves me.

697
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:26,014
That's the only Korean he knows.

698
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,474
Is he a bachelor?

699
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,561
He was married twice,
but he's pretty much a bachelor.

700
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,729
He divorced in less than a year
for both marriages.

701
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:37,901
Aunt, I think you should reconsider this
and not act rashly.

702
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,862
Are you trying to ruin my day?

703
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,322
You sure take after your mom.

704
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:47,411
To be frank, she's the reason why
I couldn't get married all this time.

705
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,470
Who were you drinking with?

706
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,555
You'll get sick.

707
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,392
You're the only woman for me.

708
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:14,605
I guess you're right.
Everyone else is gone.

709
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,210
She gave me permission.

710
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,714
-Who?
-Ji-a's mom.

711
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:42,257
I met her today.

712
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,511
She said she won't change her mind.

713
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:48,347
Still, this isn't right.

714
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,974
Why not? She said it's over.

715
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,770
And you're not going
to live here by yourself.

716
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:57,606
You said you'd marry me.

717
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,817
I don't want to be alone anymore.

718
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,196
-I'll come by often.
-My neighbors recognized me.

719
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,697
They saw me in a newspaper ad.

720
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,451
Whether it's work or success,

721
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,662
nothing matters if you're not by my side.

722
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,914
I feel the happiest when I'm with you.

723
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,874
And my mom doesn't call me anymore.

724
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:20,003
Move in when Ji-a
is old enough to accept this.

725
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:23,257
But Pi-young said she didn't mind at all.

726
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,385
-She didn't mean that in a good way.
-Whatever it may beâ€¦

727
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:38,397
What?

728
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:52,744
-Did you call her over?
-She told me I could live here.

729
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,247
Who? Ji-a's mom?

730
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:57,374
-Yes.
-Don't lie.

731
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:00,877
You can check with her.
I just met her today.

732
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,671
-Do you want to call her?
-Leave.

733
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:04,423
Get out, or I'll kick you out.

734
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,509
I'm going to stay.

735
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,012
You littleâ€¦

736
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,681
Use your words. This isn't you.

737
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,560
Do you think that's possible?
Do you think she'd listen?

738
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,062
Did you hear what she said?
"I'm going to stay"?

739
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,024
How dare she run her mouth?

740
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:26,361
Gosh.

741
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,995
Leave while I'm still being nice.

742
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,040
Did you not hear me?

743
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,043
That's enough. I'm tired.

744
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,544
Are you allowing this?

745
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,548
No. Make her leave!

746
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,133
This is why I should be here.

747
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,011
How dare you come here?

748
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,597
You two can stay here.
I'll go to Seongbuk-dong.

749
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,141
It was sold last week.
They're moving in next month.

750
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:58,435
They're going to renovate the place.

751
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,104
Damn it.

752
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,908
-Hey!
-My name is Mi.

753
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,076
I'm A Mi.

754
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,952
I don't care what your name is.

755
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,329
You're not welcome here!

756
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,081
We're going to get married.

757
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,416
Let me be your daughter-in-law.

758
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,460
I don't want you to be my daughter-in-law.

759
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,003
Pi-young is the only one.

760
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,546
It's over for them.

761
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,801
She and Yu-sin have split up.

762
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:33,136
You and I will never be family.

763
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,388
Get out this instant!

764
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,807
Yu-sin.

765
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,769
How dare you put on a show?

766
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,736
Get up.

767
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,263
-Hello.
-Pi-young.

768
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,434
I'm at Yu-sin's place--

769
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,856
-Hello?
-Hello.

770
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,149
Did you let her come here?

771
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:30,235
I don't want to get involved.
It's their problem.

772
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,237
Will you just sit and watch?

773
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,615
You two aren't completely over.
You have Ji-a.

774
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,659
She said you allowed her to move in.

775
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,703
-I never said she couldn't.
-Why not?

776
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,456
Yu-sin will take care of it.

777
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,458
It's their problem.

778
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,918
And to be frank, I feel sorry for her.

779
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,755
What do you mean? Are you a saint?

780
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,340
He's bound to get married again.

781
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:54,217
-Sooner or later--
-Whatever!

782
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:55,510
Damn it.

783
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:00,474
What will you do?

784
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,603
I'll do my best.

785
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,398
Do what? To whom?

786
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,900
To you, Mother.

787
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:11,943
I may have been raised abroad,

788
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:15,071
but I watched how my mom treated
my grandma. I can do well.

789
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,948
I know how to be a daughter-in-law.

790
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,327
A daughter-in-law?

791
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,370
Please let me stay.

792
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:27,542
I can't stand to be alone anymore.

793
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,880
I find myself relying on alcohol.

794
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:36,009
Goodness. She's also an alcoholic?

795
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,558
Fine, stay here.

796
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,186
You'll be wanting to leave in no time.

797
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,271
Let's see how well you live

798
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,607
with your old first love
and your mistress.

799
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,902
You've made your bed.

800
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,572
-Mom.
-Yes?

801
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:58,824
May I come in?

802
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,201
Sure.

803
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,626
Are you hungry?

804
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:13,713
No. I think I'll be fine for tonight.

805
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,636
Dad must have eaten a lot too.

806
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,638
No, he said he was on a diet.

807
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,225
He looked thinner than last week.

808
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:29,062
Ji-a. Your great-aunt is getting married.

809
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:31,231
-Really?
-With a Filipino.

810
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:34,192
-He's 20 years younger than her.
-She's amazing!

811
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,236
Marriage isn't always peachy.

812
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:41,074
I'm going to respect your decision
even if you decide not to get married.

813
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:45,245
Why? Didn't you say
that you were glad you got married?

814
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:48,540
When you win some, you lose some.

815
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:53,753
I'm happy and thankful to have you.

816
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,881
But if I didn't get married,

817
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:59,175
I could have done more in society.

818
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:05,599
In any case, you need
to take responsibility for your decisions.

819
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,435
We'll just watch
and support you from behind.

820
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:12,439
So I hope you do the same for us.

821
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:16,693
I will. That's what I'm doing these days.

822
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:20,822
I put myself in your shoes,

823
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,701
and I think you'll be heartbroken
for at least a year.

824
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:28,371
I think of Grandma all the time too.

825
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:35,545
Could you get me a can of beer?

826
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,297
-I feel hot.
-Is it in the fridge?

827
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,174
Yes.

828
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,937
-Mom.
-Yes?

829
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:56,191
Maybe Dad's marriage fell through.

830
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,404
If not, why are they so quiet?

831
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,406
Maybe they postponed it.

832
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,992
They were preparing to get married
after the Lunar New Year.

833
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,621
All I hear about Nam Ga-bin
is her musical performance.

834
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:13,249
Maybe no news is good news.
Perhaps, they called it off.

835
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:17,754
-I doubt it.
-What will you do if that's the case?

836
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:18,755
What do you mean?

837
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:22,509
I know how soft-hearted you are.
I think you'll take him back.

838
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,345
Your dad isn't the type
to let go of his pride.

839
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:28,723
What if he does
and asks for your forgiveness?

840
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,475
That won't ever happen.

841
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,353
Even if it did, we can't go back.

842
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:34,854
Okay then.

843
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,609
Are we having stir-fried potatoes?

844
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:42,028
No, it's for the stew.

845
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,072
Doenjang stew with potatoes and zucchini.

846
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,825
Then two potatoes would be
more than enough.

847
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,036
You're sharp.

848
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,497
-You should cook today.
-How?

849
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,874
You always say that.

850
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,669
If you like something,
you should know how to make it too.

851
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,337
-Right?
-Yes.

852
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:03,383
There will be
many bachelors in the future,

853
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,760
and they won't have anyone
to cook for them.

854
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:08,054
So you should learn how to cook.

855
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,232
I bet you won't last ten days.

856
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:30,660
Ma'am, you don't need to come
for the time being.

857
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,579
You'll still get paid.

858
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,590
Where is she?

859
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:46,634
In the room.

860
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:54,893
WHY ARE YOU COMING OUT OF THERE?

861
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:57,062
Why were you in there?

862
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,313
I was unpacking.

863
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,273
Use that room.

864
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:02,734
Go on!

865
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,238
I'm not a child,
and I'll soon be his wife.

866
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,866
Not yet. Who knows what will happen?

867
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:12,911
How could I possibly sleep
in Ji-a's room? Right?

868
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,250
It doesn't matter
which room she sleeps in.

869
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,886
You won't get your way.

870
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,185
Aren't you coming?

871
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:39,604
Coming.

872
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:48,196
Get the lettuce and cucumber and
wash them. Julienne the carrots.

873
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,906
-Do you have the tool?
-I don't know.

874
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:08,550
Isn't that sea bream?

875
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:15,849
I use drinking water when I wash the rice.

876
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:19,185
Dry rice will soak up the water.
I don't want it to smell.

877
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:27,819
They sell assorted vegetables at shops.
Some are pre-washed too.

878
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,654
You just need to rinse them once.

879
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:36,453
That fish is tasty,
but the bones are too sturdy.

880
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,122
If one gets stuck in your throat,
you're done for.

881
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,676
A close friend of mine
has a brother who lives in Jeju.

882
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:55,138
He said you should avoid
eating black hairtail.

883
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,557
I'll tell you why later.

884
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:02,562
All that knowledge
must make you crave a lot of food.

885
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:06,441
You're right. I love eating.

886
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,069
Is this funny to you?

887
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:16,659
You should ask Yu-sin
for psychological counseling.

888
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:19,370
Right. Hold on.

889
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,669
How could he possibly have fallen for her?

890
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:34,010
Song Yuan should stay
with us until her due date.

891
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,221
Yes, I agree.

892
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:40,141
Should we tell
Byeol-hui's family while we're at it?

893
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:43,937
Tell them tomorrow.
They're probably having dinner.

894
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,482
They may not welcome the idea
of Song Yuan being their in-law.

895
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:50,944
Why not? She's much better than Hye-ryung.

896
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,112
Song Yuan is eight years older.

897
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:56,115
Gosh, they'll get used to it in no time.

898
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,576
Byeol-hui's mom is easygoing,

899
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,203
and so is Song Yuan.

900
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:03,164
Tell her to come out!

901
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:05,792
A Mi?

902
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,087
-Is she not there?
-She's not in there?

903
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:11,756
Where is she?

904
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:14,467
Youâ€¦

905
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,518
She told me to wait. Where did she go?

906
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:25,186
Call her.

907
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:29,691
Let her be. Maybe she's taking a walk
and looking around the neighborhood.

908
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:32,151
When I told her to wash the lettuce?

909
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,195
She's slacking off.

910
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:35,488
Let's wait for now.

911
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:38,491
You can't just assume that.

912
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,701
Just call her.

913
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,298
She left her phone at home.

914
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,956
-That one.
-Okay.

915
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,085
How many candles do you want?

916
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,211
-None.
-Okay.

917
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,668
-You bought a cake?
-Yes.

918
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,294
-Is it your birthday?
-No.

919
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:15,546
Then? Didn't I tell you
to wash the lettuce?

920
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,006
Let's celebrate our first day.

921
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,883
-What do you mean?
-We're now a family.

922
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,973
Don't say anything to her.

923
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:28,601
Are you going to interfere every time?

924
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,984
No one here likes cake.
You should have asked.

925
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,194
It was my money.

926
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:40,154
Did it really take you an hour?

927
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:43,408
I couldn't buy just any cake.
This store sells the tastiest cakes.

928
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,493
I got lost because I left my phone.

929
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:48,705
Don't you dare
slack off like that ever again.

930
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:49,831
Scoop the rice.

931
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,211
I'll do the dishes.

932
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:57,964
You have a dishwasher.

933
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,215
Who doesn't have one?

934
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:01,134
I didn't.

935
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,805
Who told you to talk back like that?

936
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:09,267
You asked if there was anyone
who didn't have a dishwasher.

937
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,393
It was a question.

938
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:26,492
Mother, would you like to give a speech?

939
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:29,495
You go ahead.

940
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:32,498
Yu-sin.

941
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:35,960
Let's not cause a ruckus

942
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,296
and just live in harmony.

943
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,381
Okay.

944
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:49,974
Aren't you eating?

945
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,525
It's good.

946
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,153
Isn't it?

947
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:04,530
Yes.

948
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:12,538
Was she happy?

949
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,711
I'm sure you met her.

950
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,174
She has mixed feelings.

951
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:27,428
Is her belly big?

952
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,097
-Yes.
-How does it feel?

953
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:32,141
To be a dad.

954
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,564
I think it'll finally sink in
once the baby is born.

955
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:47,990
Yu-sin.

956
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:51,577
Let's do something new.

957
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,761
We've never taken a bath together.

958
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:17,353
I swear I'll have her
run away within a month.

959
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,439
Doesn't it feel good?

960
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:22,775
Yes.

961
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:24,735
Yu-sin.

962
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:30,616
Putting aside our issues,
I really like Pi-young.

963
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:32,410
She's charming.

964
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:36,247
She's elegant and admirable in many ways.

965
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:38,749
I told her

966
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:43,421
to call me if she ever got sick.
I told her I'd take care of her.

967
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:47,592
-What did she say?
-It may take some time,

968
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:51,679
but she will eventually
understand my sincerity.

969
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:56,851
Then we'll be on good terms
like those families abroad.

970
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:59,937
If we become close,
Ji-a will open up to me as well.

971
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:02,982
So don't you worry

972
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:07,278
and just focus on treating your patients.

973
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:12,116
I have nothing to fear
if I have your love.

974
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:43,898
Breakfast.

975
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,327
What time did you get up to make these?

976
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:58,579
It didn't take long.

977
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,790
I set the timer
for the rice cooker last night.

978
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:03,334
The seasoned beans, jangjorim,
and stir-fried anchovies

979
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:05,002
are from your mother.

980
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:07,171
I only made
the tofu stew with pollack roe.

981
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,803
It's slightly salty.

982
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:15,346
No, it's not.

983
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:21,769
Invite me over when the baby is born.

984
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,063
I'm curious.

985
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:29,235
Will she not like that?

986
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,823
I doubt it. She'll appreciate it.

987
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:35,366
Have you thought of a name?

988
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,285
Not yet. Father will name the baby.

989
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,499
I did well, right?

990
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:46,460
My decision.

991
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:51,340
I kind of like the new me.

992
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,343
I wasâ€¦

993
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,763
a lousy husband.

994
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,015
I'm not sure about that.

995
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,893
Speaking about the past and regrettingâ€¦

996
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:05,980
No, I don't regret it.

997
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,190
It's all in the past.

998
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:10,985
But it was me who encouraged you
to hire a personal trainer.

999
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:28,669
SEOUL GANGNAM FAMILY COURT

1000
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:46,103
FLOWERS

1001
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,807
-Are you playing games with me?
-Of course.

1002
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,350
Can you buy me a latte?

1003
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:51,187
Mr. Seo. How about a cocktail?

1004
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,272
-Meet your future sister-in-law.
-Hello.

1005
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,858
It's nice to see you again
as a future family member.

1006
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:57,401
-Same here.
-Really?

1007
01:09:57,484 --> 01:09:58,903
Have I ever lied to you?

1008
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:02,281
You must have been an angel
in your past life.

1009
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:05,451
A lot of married couples
get back together after getting a divorce.

1010
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:07,786
You know what wake-up calls are, right?

1011
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,748
Well, I'm only here
to see my two princesses.

1012
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:12,166
Don't you want me to stay?

1013
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:16,253
Sir, could I hold
a press conference tomorrow?

1014
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:18,214
It saddens me to deliver the newsâ€¦

1015
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:20,674
I got a divroce.

1016
01:10:29,433 --> 01:10:34,146
