00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,674
EPISODE 12

2
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:51,926
Eighth floor.

3
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,217
Come home soon.
It's dangerous to be out late.

4
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,134
Okay.

5
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,182
She's not a young girl.
You don't need to worry.

6
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,892
Plus, she has a car.

7
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,648
Does Pi-young have a distant relative?

8
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,109
-Pi-young?
-Yes.

9
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,443
No. Why?

10
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,029
I stopped by to give Ji-a her gift today.

11
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,490
-Did you see her?
-Just for a minute.

12
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,618
She was going to the library
with her friends.

13
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:03,081
The housekeeper said Pi-young went
to say hello to her future in-laws.

14
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:07,085
I asked her if someone
in the family was getting married,

15
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,337
but she was hesitant to answer.

16
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,507
I called you earlier today
because I was curious.

17
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,016
She can't be getting married, can she?

18
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,602
-That's ridiculous. Of course not.
-Then?

19
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,438
She's close with Ms. Lee.
Maybe they're visiting her in-laws.

20
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,731
But still.

21
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,484
Why would she go there?
She's not related to her.

22
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,990
Ms. Lee is marrying her colleague.

23
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,200
Oh, could that be why?

24
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,997
But the housekeeper was a bit strange.

25
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,292
Women tend to have
the weirdest imaginations.

26
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,669
I'm basing this on what I heard.

27
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,254
Didn't you invite Ji-a for a meal?

28
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,964
You should text her.

29
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,051
She's at a sensitive age
and she seemed busy.

30
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:05,059
I'll put this in your room.

31
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,945
I would love to.

32
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,488
Me too.

33
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,160
I'll think about it.

34
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,955
What's there to think about

35
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,458
when his future wife wants to move in?

36
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,045
-Your grandpa wants you guys to move in.
-He's lonely.

37
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,964
But you could feel uncomfortable
about that, right?

38
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,469
You may not be allowed to sleep in,

39
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,763
and he could nag you.

40
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,265
He's too busy to nitpick about things.

41
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:48,353
And even if he does,
they should listen to their elders.

42
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,896
Even if they agree with that

43
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,315
it never feels good to be nagged at.

44
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,568
People need to socialize.

45
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,195
No one can live alone.

46
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,490
Your maternal grandpa
used to say that often.

47
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,160
When COVID-19 was at its peak,

48
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,038
my friend went to the airport
to visit her aunt in the States.

49
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,540
But the vast airport
was pretty much empty.

50
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,918
Incheon International Airport
is a wonderful place,

51
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,379
but the lack of people
made it seem desolate.

52
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,547
She didn't feel too great.

53
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,926
That's when she realized
what beautiful beings people are.

54
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,720
No matter how great
and beautiful a house is,

55
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,223
it's meaningless if no one lives there.

56
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,518
It may be uncomfortable to live together,

57
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,852
but I think it'll be good.

58
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,146
Ji-a will probably like it as well.

59
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,399
-Are you for it too?
-Yes.

60
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,360
Do you not want to?

61
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,238
That's not why. It doesn't matter to me.

62
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,492
Will you really be okay?

63
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,369
I'm not that difficult to live with.

64
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,165
Had I known this would happen,

65
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,210
I would've introduced you
to my mom sooner.

66
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,338
I regret it.

67
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,968
She should've at least met
her future daughter-in-law.

68
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,388
When I heard the news,

69
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,515
my heart sank.

70
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,769
I thought she had collapsed
due to shock after finding out about me.

71
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,530
Drink slowly.

72
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,871
Neither of us has a mom now.

73
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,752
You're all I have,

74
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,296
and I'll be devoted to you.

75
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,634
You still have your father and brother.

76
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,636
Thank you

77
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,639
for being willing to move in.

78
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,851
Your father was generous enough
to take us in.

79
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,102
Am I still not trustworthy?

80
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,106
I trust you. I have confidence in you.

81
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,942
Will you give me a lot of love?

82
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,612
I'll give you 80 percent
of the love you give me.

83
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,781
I'm going to love you

84
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,452
with all my heart.

85
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,079
So brace yourself.

86
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,371
Okay.

87
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,214
Your father looked amazing

88
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,965
despite his age.

89
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,968
I hope you age the same way.

90
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,347
-I will, as long as you don't worry me.
-Of course not.

91
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,775
Stay strong, Director Seo.

92
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,861
As long as you're with me.

93
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,656
Sa-hyeon must be happy

94
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,575
that you cut down on work
and spend more time at home.

95
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,286
Now that I have more time,
he's the one who's busy.

96
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,664
Men should always be busy.

97
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,835
Jeong-bin can tell the difference.

98
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:03,172
He looks happier
when he's wearing a cotton diaper.

99
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,467
He sure does.
He knows what's more comfortable.

100
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,849
It would be wonderful if you got pregnant
and gave birth to a daughter next year.

101
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,600
Jeong-bin would have a sister.

102
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,685
She's right.

103
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,773
You'll be in your mid-thirties next year.
You should hurry.

104
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,818
You should give birth when you're young
so you can recover quickly.

105
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:27,822
A child would be delighted
to have a young and healthy mother.

106
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,451
I have an abnormal uterus.

107
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,373
They said getting pregnant
will be difficult.

108
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,127
Who said that? The doctor?
Did you get a checkup?

109
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,628
I did.

110
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,671
When?

111
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,715
Get a second opinion.
Maybe it's a misdiagnosis.

112
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,592
I saw the photos.

113
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,552
I have Jeong-bin.

114
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,720
Does Sa-hyeon know?

115
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,181
No. It's nothing important.

116
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,743
I'd love to! That'd be great.

117
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:14,785
How so?

118
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,829
I'd be living with Hyang-gi
and everyone else.

119
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,791
I won't need to wait for you
to come home, and she can help me study.

120
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,710
Will you keep treating U-ram as a friend?

121
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,545
Of course.

122
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,048
But you'll be cousins.

123
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,591
And you're five months older.

124
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,551
Does that change things?

125
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,137
He'll have to treat me with more respect.

126
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,847
Do you think he'd want to?

127
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,433
What can he do?
I'm five months his senior.

128
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,894
Danchu!

129
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,313
I'm so excited!

130
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,775
Don't act too happy
when you see Grandpa next week.

131
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,693
He's still in mourning.

132
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,363
I'm not that slow-witted.

133
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,950
How was Director Seo feeling today?

134
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,495
Hey.

135
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:05,127
Do you think Hye-ryung
was aware of her condition early on?

136
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,004
Perhaps.

137
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,512
That means she divorced because she knew
she couldn't get pregnant.

138
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,389
She acted like she was doing us a favor

139
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:20,476
and made sure
we gave her everything she wanted.

140
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,727
So what?

141
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,106
It doesn't matter
since they're back together now.

142
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,482
I get it now.

143
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,901
She knew she couldn't get pregnant.

144
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,821
That's why
she's fallen in love with Jeong-bin

145
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,407
despite not being his birth mom.

146
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,247
There was something else
that I found strange.

147
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,874
The way she talked sounded familiar.

148
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,419
Turns out, it was similar to Song Yuan's.

149
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,129
I thought the same thing.

150
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,759
Then do you think…

151
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,345
You think so too, right?

152
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,058
That can't be.

153
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,396
What are you thinking?

154
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,776
That's impossible.

155
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,947
Let's go to bed.

156
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,950
What if I'm right?

157
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,455
She never mentioned
her condition until now.

158
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,457
It isn't like her.

159
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,044
She mentioned it as if it was nothing.

160
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,379
Don't you agree? That's not like her.

161
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,762
Can't we ask for help?

162
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,597
Ask who?

163
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,891
A shaman. A gifted one.

164
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,602
There aren't any these days.

165
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,313
We live in the age of science.

166
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,565
This has nothing to do with science.

167
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,071
We both noticed
that she had suddenly changed.

168
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,656
We find it odd.

169
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,991
First, I thought
she was just being capricious.

170
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,244
But even still,
what about her way of speaking?

171
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,621
Of all people,

172
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,415
she sounds exactly like Song Yuan.

173
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,670
She never ate in the past,
but she has a great appetite now.

174
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,796
Exactly.

175
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,465
What if it's really true?

176
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,676
It reaped a good result, though.
They got back together.

177
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,014
At first, she immediately refused
to get back together with him.

178
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,267
Could that be why Sa-hyeon fell for her

179
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,104
after ignoring her all this time?

180
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,564
Maybe he felt something spiritually.

181
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,151
I'm getting goosebumps.

182
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,904
But why are you only getting them
on your arms?

183
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,327
I have them too.

184
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,690
-Do we still have some sweet potatoes?
-Yes, sir.

185
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,191
I'd like that instead.

186
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,903
And the ice cream Pi-young brought.

187
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,405
Yes, sir.

188
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,389
Please clean the table.

189
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,113
Is that what you're having?

190
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,450
Yes.

191
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,204
This is the only food I can eat.

192
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,622
Ban called.

193
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,624
He says he'll move in.

194
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,668
-Really?
-Yes.

195
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,545
I see.

196
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,595
That looks good.

197
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:25,763
Have a bite.

198
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,023
They were smart to bring such food.

199
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:39,401
Rather, they were wise and considerate.

200
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,571
They were considerate of you.

201
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,536
Young women always expect
to be catered to.

202
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,539
Being older doesn't always make you wiser

203
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,292
just like how being young
doesn't always make you inconsiderate.

204
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:59,463
I hope no one will say
I don't live up to my age.

205
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,715
That would be absurd.

206
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,926
You're the head of SF Group.

207
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,263
Be friendly to Ban's family
once they move in.

208
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,098
You seem so cold

209
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,684
when you're quiet.

210
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,477
Speak for yourself.

211
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:17,398
Don't make the kids
walk on eggshells around you.

212
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,411
How's Mother doing?

213
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,538
She has her ups and downs,

214
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,999
but she hasn't done
anything unusual lately.

215
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,126
She's keeping herself occupied.

216
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,629
Why did you buy Ji-a such an expensive bag
and even put money inside?

217
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,423
The money is from Yu-sin.

218
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,509
He wants to have a meal with her
before she starts school.

219
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,136
I'll tell her.

220
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,848
I heard you visited
your future in-laws yesterday.

221
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,850
Your housekeeper must've heard you wrong.

222
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,022
It's true. I'm getting married.

223
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,523
No way. Really?

224
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,610
-Yes.
-Congratulations.

225
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,571
I wonder who it is.

226
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,489
I don't think that's any of your concern.

227
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,910
Right. I was just curious.

228
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,037
Are you driving?

229
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,580
-Yes.
-Let's hang up then.

230
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,498
Okay. Bye, Pi-young.

231
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,547
Danchu.

232
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,509
Unbelievable.

233
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,392
I've been keeping myself busy lately,
so my mind doesn't wander. I like it.

234
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:39,146
If I could sing,
I would've auditioned for a musical.

235
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,481
But I'm a lost cause.

236
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,108
No one can have everything.

237
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,986
I'll grow old alone.

238
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,615
Let's talk again in ten years.
You have so many avid male fans.

239
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,492
And that's all they are.

240
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,870
Hye-ryung looked better
in her recent wedding photos

241
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,622
than in her previous ones.

242
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,916
You know,

243
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:03,754
I became teary-eyed while singing
as they walked down the aisle.

244
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:04,797
What for?

245
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,841
When they were walking down,

246
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,805
her face overlapped with Song Won's.

247
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,683
I just couldn't stop myself from crying.

248
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,477
I could barely sing.

249
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,771
How did the groom look?

250
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,481
He was happy.

251
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,899
What a bastard.

252
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:28,612
How could he be so brazen
in front of you of all people?

253
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,949
I truly miss Jeong-bin,
but I won't go to see him.

254
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,411
I don't like
his grandparents anymore either.

255
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:40,541
In any case, Jeong-bin is growing
day by day and needs a mom.

256
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,502
Hye-ryung of all women
could be the best fit.

257
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,879
She may favor her own child
if she has one.

258
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,190
Does this mean
you and Yu-sin will finally get married?

259
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,484
He was reluctant because of Ji-a.

260
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,154
But now that Pi-young's getting married,
he won't feel sorry anymore.

261
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,155
I'm happy for you.

262
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,323
Being patient goes a long way.

263
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,117
It depends on the situation.

264
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,785
Your cooking skills improved.

265
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,911
I agree.

266
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,875
Being a wife suits you better
than being an actress.

267
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,918
I'd love to cook for Ji-a one day.

268
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,881
You're more open
since you've lived abroad.

269
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:32,342
Yu-sin's ex-wife
is an incredible woman. I admire her.

270
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,635
Is she a stay-at-home wife?

271
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,597
To be honest,

272
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,310
I didn't think it was right
to gossip about her.

273
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,021
But she's the producer
of Boo Hye-ryung's music show.

274
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,356
Does that mean…

275
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,693
You guys probably met on that show.

276
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,238
Talk about an entwined fate.

277
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,034
Ms. Lee probably told her
everything about me.

278
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,453
Did she say anything about me?

279
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,206
We're not exactly close.

280
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,628
Hold on.

281
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:12,257
Is Ms. Lee Professor Park's ex-wife?

282
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,885
-You're right.
-She's getting married too.

283
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,096
With someone else
other than Professor Park?

284
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,724
Yes. I heard it was her colleague.

285
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:24,228
Goodness. I thought they would
get back together immediately.

286
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,649
Maybe divorced women
have men wrapped around their fingers

287
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,609
since they know them well.

288
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,862
I can't believe it.
She didn't seem to be the type.

289
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,240
Never judge a book by its cover.

290
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,826
It's my treat as your sister.

291
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,078
What sister?

292
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,413
Don't you like sausage bread?

293
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,755
I'm five months older.

294
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,715
It doesn't matter. We're the same age.

295
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,260
We'll be cousins soon.

296
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,138
We need to straighten this out
in front of the adults.

297
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,180
We can't be friends.

298
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,307
It'll hurt my pride to be nagged at.

299
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,477
-Eat up.
-But still.

300
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,646
I don't think it's right.

301
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,148
What do you mean?

302
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,232
You're my sister now?

303
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,276
Once we live together.

304
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,201
We'll take care of Danchu together.
Wouldn't that be great?

305
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,870
It would be.

306
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,289
What else?

307
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,792
I don't know. We'll see.

308
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,397
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

309
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,405
I feel like a queen.

310
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,407
Let's do this often.

311
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,827
When we went to visit
our father-in-law yesterday,

312
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,330
I could tell that he was despondent.

313
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,915
Of course.

314
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:12,169
As men grow old, they need their wives
to take care of them.

315
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,631
Given his age,
I don't think he'll remarry.

316
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,549
Who knows?

317
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,594
If he wanted to,
he wouldn't have asked us to move in.

318
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,721
His late wife was quite young too,

319
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,474
so it'll be hard to find one
who meets his expectations.

320
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,976
Plus, he's handsome and successful.

321
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,980
I had no idea SF Electronics
owned Min General Hospital too.

322
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,191
Mr. Seo sure is tight-lipped.

323
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:39,196
Most men would have loved
to brag about their status.

324
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:44,117
By the way, do you think
we'll really need three housekeepers?

325
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:45,786
No.

326
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,872
You and I can take turns cooking.

327
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,167
-We just need someone who can clean.
-Right.

328
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:56,088
The other two can work
at the hospital or the company cafeteria.

329
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,214
Right.

330
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,885
Ms. Choi doesn't seem like a pushover.

331
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,428
I agree.

332
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,306
Ms. Yu Jeong-ae?

333
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,432
Yes.

334
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,102
I heard you refused to take any medicine.

335
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,271
Take it unless you want to stay here.

336
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,481
At least I'd get to see you every day.

337
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,235
It won't upset your stomach.

338
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,779
You must not like them.

339
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:24,032
I become groggy and irritated
whenever I take it.

340
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,158
How do you feel now?

341
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,661
I feel great whenever I see you.

342
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,955
You need to take it.

343
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,624
-You can see me when you're healthy too.
-Right.

344
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,298
I told you not to come here.

345
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,429
-I don't feel well.
-In what way?

346
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:49,391
I'm nauseous and dizzy.

347
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,273
I don't have time to joke around.

348
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,152
-You have ten minutes.
-Pi-young is getting married.

349
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,864
-She is?
-Yes. We talked over the phone.

350
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,199
-She was joking.
-She wasn't.

351
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:09,870
I asked who the man was,
and she said it was none of my concern.

352
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:14,583
Seeing how she visited her future in-laws,
the wedding must be around the corner.

353
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,254
Dr. Shin.

354
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,298
I feel so light.

355
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,966
Massages are addictive.

356
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,011
I think I'm already addicted.

357
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,263
It's a healthy addiction.

358
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:29,765
But expensive.

359
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,808
You should enjoy the luxuries of life.

360
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,435
You definitely deserve to.

361
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:38,273
My parents should have seen me
living like this before passing away.

362
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:42,152
Given their age, they might have wanted me
to grow old with Hae-ryun.

363
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:45,030
Perhaps. For your children's sake.

364
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:50,202
I knew Mr. Seo had a big heart,
but he still surprised me.

365
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,454
He's very considerate of my kids.

366
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,540
Aren't you more grateful for that
than his feelings toward you?

367
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,877
I should treat him well.

368
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,799
Both brothers are family-oriented.

369
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,467
They're just like their father.

370
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,261
Our father-in-law may have remarried once,

371
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,014
but he thinks the world of his boys.

372
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:15,435
It must have broken his heart
whenever he saw his eldest son.

373
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:21,399
Now that we'll be living together,
they can talk it out and reconcile.

374
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,068
And it's up to us.

375
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,656
This was a huge decision for Mr. Seo.

376
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,367
It sounded like
he pretty much cut ties with his father.

377
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,913
He must have healed a lot through loving
and receiving love from you.

378
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,415
And he must feel more settled now.

379
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,668
Plus, he must feel sorry for his father.

380
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,754
Things must be hard for him
to ask us to move in with him.

381
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,631
I'm glad our kids are up for it.

382
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,259
I agree. Ji-a is delighted.

383
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,011
She must have been quite lonely all along

384
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,847
although she never showed it.

385
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,016
-We'll shampoo your hair now.
-Okay.

386
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,787
-Are you leaving now?
-Yes.

387
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,165
Please buy some shepherd's purse tomorrow.
They're in season.

388
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,457
Okay.

389
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:28,091
Since I need to stop by the organic mart,
I'll come by 10:30 a.m.

390
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,551
Okay.

391
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,684
Is it true

392
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,021
-that you're getting married?
-Yes.

393
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,315
-With who?
-Why does it concern you?

394
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,900
-A colleague?
-No.

395
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,569
I'm the one getting married.
It's none of your business.

396
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,155
You can get married, but I'm taking Ji-a.

397
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,865
I have custody of her.

398
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,950
Not anymore. You're getting married.

399
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,327
She needs her real dad.

400
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,245
-Shouldn't you marry A Mi too?
-I won't.

401
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,788
Maybe not for now.

402
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,207
I'll file a lawsuit if I have to.

403
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:05,295
I gave up on any division of property
and alimony to get custody of Ji-a.

404
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,923
Then you can take your share now.
I'll give it to you.

405
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,009
It may be your second marriage,
but having a lot of money won't hurt.

406
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,719
For both his and your sakes.

407
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,597
Were you always this low?

408
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,766
I'll know everything
once I file the lawsuit.

409
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,309
What does that punk do?

410
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,268
"Punk"?

411
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,605
If you hire five attorneys, I'll hire ten.

412
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,733
And if you hire ten, I'll hire twenty
from Park and Ji Law Firm.

413
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,193
Will you squander all your money?

414
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,403
If you're done, just go.

415
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,989
-What about Ji-a?
-What?

416
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,491
Does she like him?

417
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,117
-Yes.
-Why isn't she home?

418
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,119
-She's at her friend's.
-Is this why you took custody of her?

419
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,454
So she'd have a stepdad?

420
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:40,830
Not all stepdads are terrible.

421
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,375
You must've landed a nice one.

422
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,293
-Watch what you say.
-Brag about him.

423
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,337
Are you sure you're
a mental health professional?

424
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,173
I didn't know this before,
but you sure love men.

425
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,092
It takes one to know one, right?

426
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,010
That's rich coming from you.

427
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,932
Get out. You're not welcome here.

428
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,017
The housekeeper
won't let you in ever again.

429
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,818
I will never let my daughter
be raised by a stepdad!

430
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,571
Don't you know me?
I won't let you raise her either.

431
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,662
Who in the world is she marrying?

432
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,746
I'm curious too.

433
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,373
What did Yu-sin say?

434
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:33,300
Tell her not to call her father back
even if there's a missed call.

435
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,468
-Tell her to turn it off.
-Got it.

436
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:40,849
And this…

437
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,104
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Ji-a, is your phone off?

438
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,025
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached--

439
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,803
You're really enjoying it.

440
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,474
I suddenly had a craving for bibimbap.

441
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,892
I'm glad we had the ingredients.

442
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,477
You must have been famished.

443
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,605
Not really, but I still have an appetite.

444
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,190
Don't I eat well these days?

445
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,274
Yes.

446
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,902
You were always worried
about gaining weight.

447
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,945
I haven't gained any weight.

448
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,531
I must have a fast metabolism.

449
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,203
Taking care of the baby must exhaust you.

450
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,497
It's not like
she does it for hours on end.

451
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,125
She's not with him all day long.

452
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,419
Jeong-bin might be awake.

453
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,462
He would cry.

454
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,588
Still.

455
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,256
Let me.

456
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,511
He could have rolled over.

457
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,680
Come on. They need to be
at least five months old to do that.

458
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,307
Who knows?

459
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,394
I think Jeong-bin will be a quick learner.

460
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,064
Do you adore him that much?

461
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,273
Do you not?

462
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,775
Of course, I do.

463
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,693
Have some water too.

464
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:16,861
Okay.

465
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,380
I think I'm right.

466
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,177
Don't you agree?

467
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,012
Even her palate has changed.

468
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,974
She has Song Yuan's taste.

469
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,393
Right?

470
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,686
I don't know.

471
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,062
You do know.

472
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,315
Hye-ryung never liked seasoned vegetables.

473
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,693
She liked bread, cereal, and meat.

474
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,737
She only had salad

475
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,323
and stayed away
from seasoned vegetables and kimchi.

476
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,493
Can you empathize with me now?

477
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,870
Call Si-eun right now.

478
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,037
I doubt she'll tell me.

479
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,289
Just try.

480
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,126
-Is she not picking up?
-The line is busy.

481
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,795
She's probably on the phone with that guy.

482
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,173
Why haven't they gotten married yet?
Maybe they split.

483
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,716
It's because of the funeral.

484
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,967
Whose funeral?

485
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:21,885
The chairman's wife.

486
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,387
Her future mother-in-law?

487
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,098
Your dad isn't too happy.

488
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:31,394
What will you do
if he asks you to live with him?

489
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,149
He has AM.

490
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,859
Yes, but AM isn't her daughter.

491
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,028
You're his first priority.

492
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,614
Everyone knows how much he loves you.

493
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,408
He may not want to marry AM
because of you.

494
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,743
It doesn't matter.

495
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,370
Your opinion matters.

496
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,456
He might file a lawsuit.

497
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,793
Will he really go that far?

498
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,212
Does he think he can own me?

499
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,173
-Don't worry about it.
-I can't help it.

500
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,841
I thought my opinion mattered.

501
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,804
Maybe Si-eun's fiancé
introduced a friend of his to her.

502
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,305
Try calling again.

503
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,060
She's not calling back.

504
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,521
I doubt she's still on the phone.

505
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,952
She's not picking up.

506
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,833
She won't pick up my calls anymore.

507
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,795
I can't stop by today.

508
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,131
I heard my father's home,
so I'm on my way.

509
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,634
-Being alone will be rough for him.
-Right.

510
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,011
Are you feeling unwell?

511
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:47,971
No.

512
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,264
Is something wrong?

513
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,642
Say it before I turn my car around.

514
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,228
My ex-husband stopped by.

515
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,856
He's going to sue me.

516
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,274
He doesn't want you to get married?

517
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,651
-For Ji-a.
-That's absurd.

518
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,907
We're home.

519
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,620
-Keep the change.
-Thank you.

520
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,790
I'll meet with him. Give me his number.

521
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,584
-What will you do?
-Fix the situation.

522
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,752
I don't mind the lawsuit.

523
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,005
I'm worried about the commotion.

524
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,798
He can get pretty stubborn.

525
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,258
Just like everyone else.

526
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:28,553
I don't want to put you
in a tight spot at work

527
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,347
-or in front of your father.
-Don't worry about that.

528
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,186
He asked me who I was marrying,
but I didn't tell him.

529
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,898
I don't care if you tell him.
Give me his number.

530
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,025
Okay.

531
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,319
If anything happens, tell me right away.

532
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,739
I finally feel a bit relieved.
It had been bothering me.

533
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,658
Women should always be carefree.
Do you know why?

534
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,577
Why?

535
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,578
If not, they'll age.

536
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,748
I'm not happy to hear that at all.
It actually worries me.

537
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,626
Will you leave me once I get all wrinkly?

538
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,545
I'll eat my hat if I do.
I'll actually help you look younger.

539
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,880
But what if I age?

540
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:04,964
It doesn't matter.

541
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,926
If you get too stressed,
I'll even sacrifice my skin for you.

542
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,970
Rest up. Don't worry about a thing.

543
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,096
Okay.

544
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,223
I love you.

545
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,100
What?

546
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,978
I didn't hear that. What did you say?

547
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,396
Then never mind.

548
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,066
I just said you should hurry home.

549
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,693
Mr. Kim, to Ji-a's.

550
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,195
I love you.

551
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,365
I'll call you when I get home.

552
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,574
Okay.

553
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,791
Did you meet Pi-young?

554
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,837
Have some honey water.

555
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,342
Why did you drink?

556
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,761
Are you upset that she's getting married?

557
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,766
Go sleep in your room.

558
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,024
POSSESSION

559
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,095
What I said came true.

560
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,348
Remember what I said?

561
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,351
When I was opposing your marriage,

562
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,519
I said your mom

563
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,689
would have a heart attack and collapse.

564
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,568
That's exactly what happened.

565
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:54,866
She was very healthy
apart from her high blood pressure.

566
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,200
Calm down, Dad.

567
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,704
-How am I supposed to live?
-You have me.

568
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:05,084
Do you think you can help me
scratch my back when I need it?

569
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,502
I will

570
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,921
so call me anytime.

571
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,174
I'll rush over even when I'm out drinking.

572
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,473
You miss her too, right?

573
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,231
U-ram's mother

574
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,276
is getting married
to her colleague, an engineer.

575
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,989
Why are you doing this?

576
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:13,444
My lady, your breakfast is served.

577
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,992
Just mine? Let's eat together.

578
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,202
I'll have the leftovers.

579
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,453
Don't be ridiculous.

580
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:25,998
It looks delicious.

581
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,710
Don't tell me you made this yourself.

582
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,421
Why are you surprised?
It was a piece of cake.

583
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,054
Is it too mild? You haven't been
drinking it strong lately.

584
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,556
It's perfect.

585
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,774
-There's egg and pollack roe.
-Yes.

586
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:52,900
It's so good.

587
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,193
Can I have the other one?

588
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,319
Sure.

589
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,370
I know I made this, but it's tasty.

590
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,205
This is a new recipe.

591
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,957
It's my own special recipe.

592
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,669
You're the best.
You're good at everything.

593
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,255
But it's not even my birthday.

594
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,549
You cut down on work.

595
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,759
Take it as a token
of my love and gratitude.

596
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,553
Thank you for your appreciation.

597
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,943
Mr. Shin Yu-sin said he knew you.

598
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,904
-Is he in the meeting room?
-Yes.

599
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,447
-Bring him in.
-Okay.

600
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:50,541
We need to know how much wealth he has
and the environment Ji-a will be in.

601
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,211
But the most crucial part
is what she wants.

602
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,632
I've heard about Ji-a often.
How's your relationship?

603
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,634
We were very close prior to the divorce.

604
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,595
Right. We went skiing together recently.

605
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,139
She and my girlfriend
don't have any issues.

606
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,266
They even shared a bedroom.

607
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:08,935
They get along well.

608
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,020
That's favorable.

609
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:15,691
Did Ms. Sa refuse
to relinquish custody of Ji-a?

610
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,276
Yes.

611
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,906
First, I think you should have
a heart-to-heart talk with one another.

612
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:24,700
Personally, I'd like
to dissuade you from filing a lawsuit.

613
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,662
Not only do the two parties
get hurt during the process,

614
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,081
but their children get hurt the most.

615
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,876
As her father,

616
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,754
I won't allow a stranger to raise her.

617
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,130
I understand.

618
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,968
But I'm sure
her mother feels the same way.

619
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,177
I won't get married.

620
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,138
Plus, I'm well-off and can provide
a good environment for her.

621
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,682
Her grandma will be there too.

622
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,434
You should do your best
to persuade Ms. Sa.

623
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,437
Filing a lawsuit
should be your very last resort.

624
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,815
I didn't know this before,
but she's headstrong.

625
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:59,193
And that's why I had no choice
but to sign the divorce papers.

626
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,446
That's not why you got divorced.

627
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,200
Right. I made a mistake.

628
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,995
But we're in the same boat.

629
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,999
Hye-ryung and I got back together.

630
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:19,380
Let's look into Ji-a's stepdad and find
any reasons for disqualification.

631
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:23,050
After that, we can decide
whether to talk it out or file a lawsuit.

632
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,261
He must definitely be lacking in some way.

633
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,221
That's why she hasn't told me about him.

634
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,433
I'm sorry. I thought I had turned it off.

635
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:39,025
Did Hye-ryung tell you anything?

636
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:43,154
No. After the producer changed,
they don't seem to meet that often.

637
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,948
She's cut down on work a lot

638
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,950
and doesn't go out often.

639
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,453
-She's taking care of the baby.
-Right.

640
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,957
Could you ask her about it?

641
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,175
Basement first floor.

642
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,189
Hello, I'm Seo Dong-ma, Pi-young's fiancé.

643
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,357
I'd like to talk.

644
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,078
Hello?

645
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,830
-Hello.
-Is this Dr. Shin Yu-sin?

646
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,374
Yes.

647
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,462
I'm Seo Dong-ma. It's nice to meet you.

648
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,258
Do you have time later today?
We should talk in person.

649
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,010
Let's meet at 7 p.m.

650
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,345
You can pick the spot.

651
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:52,014
Class Hotel.
I'll text you once I reserve a table.

652
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:53,641
Sure.

653
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,128
I can't marry you.

654
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,131
Get lost!

655
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,654
Is his mouth all better now?

656
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,948
I hope so.

657
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:31,447
Why did they cheat in the first place
if they loved their kids that much?

658
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,574
They should've devoted themselves.

659
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:34,950
Exactly.

660
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,036
Where are the sofas?

661
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:37,995
On the third floor.

662
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,748
Can we speak to Park Hyang-gi,
the new intern?

663
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:44,001
She's tending to her customers.
She's in the sofa corner.

664
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,863
She's incredible.

665
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,449
You must be so proud of her.

666
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,118
You must feel the same way about Ji-a.

667
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:22,206
I looked up "possession",

668
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,501
and apparently,
people who are possessed lose weight.

669
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:29,088
No wonder she doesn't gain any
despite her big appetite.

670
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,966
You should look into it.

671
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,803
Should I tell her to see a shaman
since we think she's possessed?

672
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,680
We can invite the shaman over.

673
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:40,558
Tell her we'll pay her handsomely.

674
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,142
I'd be relieved if we're wrong,

675
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,519
but what if we're right?

676
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,104
Should we perform an exorcism?

677
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:48,399
She needs to go there herself for that.

678
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:52,820
Plus, what if she returns to her own self
and refuses to live with Sa-hyeon?

679
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,617
Let's give it some time.

680
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,953
Getting possessed isn't that easy.

681
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:04,582
Based on my research, it could cause
bigger issues in the future.

682
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,918
Recommend a bed frame for us.

683
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,170
I would pick this one.

684
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,924
It's easy to manage
and has a modern design.

685
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,843
It'll go along well with your furniture.

686
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,637
I'll get the same one then.
You don't mind, right?

687
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,099
Having a different bed frame
in every room looks messier.

688
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,350
What about the mattress?

689
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,187
INTRODUCING THE HOSPITAL DIRECTOR

690
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,983
DIRECTOR SHIN YU-SIN

691
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,534
-Did you make a reservation.
-Under "Shin Yu-sin".

692
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,535
He's waiting inside.

693
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,218
Let me take your coat.

694
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,702
My name is Seo Dong-ma.

695
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,164
SEO DONG-MA

696
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,541
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

697
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,128
He's young for an executive director.
Does his father own the company?

698
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,257
Could he be a divorcé?

699
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,677
Even still.

700
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,553
Beverages are on the back.

701
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:45,015
This is my first time here.
Please pick what to order.

702
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,617
Should I order instead?

703
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,250
Will a simple dish suffice?

704
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,420
-How about wine?
-Malt whiskey, please.

705
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,879
Single malt whiskey?

706
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,131
Over here.

707
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,763
How did they meet?

708
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,438
If I may ask, how old are you?

709
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,606
-I turned 36.
-In Korean age?

710
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,275
I'm 37 in Korean age.

711
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,902
Have you been married before?

712
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,028
No, I haven't.

713
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:44,575
WHAT… IS HE INSANE?
HE COULD HAVE FOUND SOMEONE BETTER.

714
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,536
Doesn't SF Group
own Min General Hospital too?

715
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:48,704
Correct.

716
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,665
Let's cut to the chase.

717
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,502
I heard you wanted custody of Ji-a.

718
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,379
-Yes.
-Why?

719
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,798
What do you mean? She's my daughter too.

720
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:03,886
It's best for a child to live
with both of her parents.

721
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:08,557
But if not, isn't living with her mom
better for her emotional stability?

722
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,975
Especially for girls.

723
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,104
-Pi-young…
-"Pi-young"?

724
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,148
…isn't lacking as a mother.

725
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,525
Rather, she's just perfect.

726
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,904
I disagree. A perfect mom wouldn't remarry
and drag her kid with her.

727
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,322
What's wrong with remarriage?

728
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,699
I believe your late father
remarried as well.

729
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:26,825
Did you look into me?

730
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,243
Pi-young told me.

731
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,787
I'm a neuropsychiatrist.

732
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,789
-What did you major in?
-Management.

733
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,250
This is your first marriage and you have
no experience in raising a child.

734
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:38,504
You're not her real dad
and not much older than her either.

735
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,380
None of this is right.

736
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,382
Don't you think 23 years is a big gap?

737
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,760
Many become parents at 20.

738
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,888
What are you worried about?

739
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:52,059
Watch me, and you'll realize
that I am qualified to be a dad.

740
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,853
That won't happen.
I will raise my own daughter.

741
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,063
She's Pi-young's too.

742
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,523
Have you changed her diapers?

743
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:00,609
Have you fed her or stayed up all night
tending to her when she was ill?

744
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:01,944
Being a parent is not easy.

745
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:05,906
I'm well aware that it's not,
and I'm prepared for it.

746
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,577
Please don't cut me off.
We have more than enough time to talk.

747
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,096
You're prepared?

748
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,683
I'm sure it wasn't voluntary.
You had no choice.

749
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,977
Please don't jump to conclusions.

750
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:39,481
I never force myself to do anything.
I need to be up for it.

751
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,567
Even kids only eat when they want to.

752
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,861
Look at him. Not only does he look sly,
but he talks that way too.

753
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,280
I've accepted her as my daughter.

754
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,657
It was natural.

755
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,493
She's already grown on me. I adore her.

756
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,667
-Please.
-You go ahead.

757
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:06,216
She's fallen head over heels
for a little boy.

758
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:11,179
Both Pi-young and I
stand firm in our decision.

759
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,765
Ji-a will live with us.

760
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,852
I'm her biological father.
I have the right to raise her.

761
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:19,271
Who do you think the court will choose?

762
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,523
-Her mom.
-Who's marrying a young man?

763
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,649
Thirty-seven isn't young.

764
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,484
Have you ever given birth to a child?

765
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,861
Have you?

766
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,821
It's a figure of speech.

767
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:30,574
Are you trying to nitpick
and argue with me?

768
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:31,825
What an impudent asshole.

769
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:33,702
Only women can give birth.

770
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,746
That's why a father's love
cannot be equal.

771
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:39,750
Like I said,
I am ready to devote myself to Ji-a.

772
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,295
But I have no say
if she wants to live with you.

773
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:46,381
We should hear what she wants first.

774
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,843
We shouldn't make the decision ourselves.

775
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,947
I'll only have one drink
since I'm still mourning.

776
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,867
My mother suddenly passed away last month.

777
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,371
How old was she?

778
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:18,789
Exactly 60.

779
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,123
You must be distraught.

780
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,167
And the wedding?

781
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,835
It'll be after the 49-day rite.

782
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,546
It's because of the funeral.

783
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,881
Whose funeral?

784
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,091
The chairman's wife.

785
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,051
It's him.

786
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:34,262
-Is Engineer Seo Ban your brother?
-Yes.

787
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:41,186
Did he introduce you to Pi-young?
Or did Ms. Lee?

788
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:42,104
No.

789
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,398
-Then how did you two meet?
-It happened naturally.

790
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,400
This bastard.

791
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,069
-Is your father okay with it?
-Yes.

792
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,948
I just don't get it. Si-eun…

793
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,909
I'm used to calling her that.

794
00:49:56,451 --> 00:50:00,872
Both daughters-in-law are divorced.
I believe your brother is a bachelor too.

795
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:04,543
I don't get how your father was okay
with that. They're not that young.

796
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:05,794
And Pi-young is older than you.

797
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:07,504
My parents trust me

798
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,756
and that's why I respect them.

799
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,467
Though my mom has passed away.

800
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:18,056
You do know Ms. Lee and Pi-young
are close, right?

801
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,058
They'll make our house livelier.

802
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:21,977
The kids will love it too.

803
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,437
It's no problem.

804
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,554
INCOMING CALL
MS. LEE SI-EUN

805
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:01,767
Hey.

806
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,935
Has he called yet?

807
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,353
Not yet.

808
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:08,607
I'll be straightforward.
Who had feelings first?

809
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,524
I did.

810
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,860
Why?

811
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:14,946
It's natural for men
to be attracted to young, pretty women.

812
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,824
Like they say, we all have
our own image of a perfect woman.

813
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,618
And she's perfect for me.

814
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,542
Young women are all the same.

815
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,170
You get tired of them acting like a baby.

816
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,254
At least I did.

817
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,343
I don't understand you either.

818
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,012
As a woman and an individual,

819
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:42,265
Pi-young is an admirable
and charming person.

820
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,100
I wonder why you fell for someone else.

821
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,811
That's a rhetorical question, right?

822
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:52,984
What's with them?
Are they helplessly in love or something?

823
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:56,404
-It's getting late.
-Are you honest?

824
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,447
Yes.

825
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:01,076
Men especially want their own kids,
not someone else's.

826
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,869
She said she'll give birth again.

827
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,287
Did she say that?

828
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,915
We talked about it.

829
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:11,461
I told her it was possible
to give birth past 40.

830
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:15,173
But I'm already happy
and grateful for having Ji-a.

831
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:20,470
I've learned that you could form a bond
with someone after a short time.

832
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,763
That's not love.

833
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:25,225
Nowadays, not having biological parents
isn't that big of a deal.

834
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,812
Some parents and their kids
even harm each other.

835
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:32,107
I don't believe love can only
be formed through experience.

836
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,277
I'm going to be a good
and respectable dad.

837
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,321
Anything is possible if you work hard.

838
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,825
No one knows what'll happen

839
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:43,493
in the future.

840
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:47,956
I know that you've done some things
that you aren't proud of.

841
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,792
And you, Executive Director Seo?
That's your name, right?

842
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:51,710
Yes.

843
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,336
Have you lived an honest life?

844
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,464
There are things I regret and lack.

845
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,217
But I've never disappointed Ji-a.

846
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,887
And I don't ever plan to either.

847
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:08,852
Let's meet again
after hearing what she wants.

848
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,617
Where's your car?

849
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,455
Is that it?

850
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,418
Goodbye. Next time, I'll reserve a place.

851
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,371
Are you going home, sir?

852
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:11,247
No.

853
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,007
Did he burp?

854
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,092
Yes.

855
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,053
-Want anything?
-I brushed my teeth.

856
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:26,972
Fine, I won't eat either.

857
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,684
What do you crave? Beer?

858
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,978
I would die for some ramyeon.

859
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,604
You can have it every now and then.

860
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,407
Is Ms. Sa getting married?

861
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:48,618
Who told you?

862
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,372
Dr. Shin. Who is she marrying?

863
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,582
Prince Charming.

864
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,626
Come on. Don't joke around.

865
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,044
I'm not.

866
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,797
He's the second son of SF Electronics.

867
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,341
The eldest son is Engineer Seo Ban.

868
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,427
You mean…

869
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,289
Let's go there.

870
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,958
SSANGDAE
SALTED BARBECUE

871
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,169
Park somewhere nearby.

872
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:45,050
No way.
Reality can be more dramatic at times.

873
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:46,551
Look at us.

874
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:48,053
I guess it's game over.

875
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,512
-What game?
-What?

876
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,347
I'll tell you later.

877
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:54,392
I don't want soggy noodles.

878
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,810
They're too hard right now.

879
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,145
I like them that way.

880
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:03,234
There must have been a traffic jam.

881
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,987
Yes. It was especially awful today.

882
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,615
You should have told Mr. Choi
to take these upstairs.

883
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:11,534
I haven't seen Jun-jae in ages.
Is she doing well?

884
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,078
Of course.

885
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:16,706
Does she not want to see Jeong-bin?

886
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,170
-She saw his photos.
-What did she say?

887
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,089
She said he was handsome

888
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,424
and looked like he could become a general.

889
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:35,141
Your dad will understand
once you tell him how you feel.

890
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,813
Is Danchu housebroken?

891
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,356
It still makes mistakes.

892
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:43,233
It's only a puppy.

893
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:44,901
Have you ever had a dog before?

894
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,237
-Yes.
-Mainly large breeds.

895
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,947
I heard you wanted to give Danchu to me.

896
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,074
So that I'd be comforted.

897
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:55,370
Thank you. That almost made me cry.

898
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:01,126
You should go.
Your father will be waiting.

899
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:04,295
-He was crying when I went home yesterday.
-Oh, dear.

900
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:06,798
I had thought he was staying strong.

901
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:17,809
Move.

902
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,813
Are you sleeping here?

903
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:25,733
Mother.

904
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:26,901
Don't call me.

905
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,279
-Why?
-I'm scared.

906
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,082
What are you scared of?

907
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,252
Mother?

908
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:47,589
Mother.

909
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,592
Please don't hit me!

910
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,013
Thank you.

911
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,022
-What?
-Yu-sin, come quick.

912
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,523
Something's wrong with Mother.

913
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:07,650
Again?

914
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,861
This time, it's real. Hurry.

915
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,363
What's that puppy?

916
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,949
It's Ji-a's. Danchu.

917
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,034
And?

918
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,789
I brought it here in advance
to lighten the mood.

919
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,125
-"Danchu"?
-Yes.

920
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,877
What an adorable dog.

921
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:30,256
Did Ji-a agree to it?
You got her permission, right?

922
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,966
She didn't tell me the reason.

923
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,428
She just kept begging me not to hit her.

924
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,933
I told you something was off.

925
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:58,576
Shouldn't she be admitted?

926
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,037
We'll see.

927
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,914
She's getting worse.

928
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,542
She needs to be treated soon.

929
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,170
MOTHER

930
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,550
-Hello?
-I'm at the door.

931
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:56,718
Open it.

932
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:58,511
You're here?

933
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,847
I didn't want
to ring the doorbell this early.

934
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:06,769
Did something happen at home?

935
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:10,732
Don't send Ji-a to the academy today.
I had a nightmare.

936
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:15,445
What kind?

937
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:20,325
Some man whose face
I couldn't see kidnapped her.

938
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:23,286
Is she asleep?

939
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:35,214
I tossed and turned.
I barely had any sleep after that.

940
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,175
Do you want some hot milk?

941
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:39,052
No, sit down.

942
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:45,475
Did you fight with Yu-sin?

943
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:49,729
-Why do you ask?
-I was sleeping in the living room.

944
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,023
Then he came and started bad-mouthing you.

945
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,317
What did he say?

946
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,069
Did he drink?

947
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:58,071
Yes. He was drunk.

948
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:03,368
Anyway, be careful today.
And don't let Ji-a leave the house.

949
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:05,495
You know my dreams come true at times.

950
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,246
So he cursed about me?

951
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,999
What about A Mi? Did she not say anything?

952
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,209
No.

953
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,557
Yu-sin, Mother isn't home.

954
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:29,227
Her phone's off.

955
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:31,479
Maybe she's at Ji-a's.

956
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:34,774
Call the maintenance office.
Maybe she's taking a walk.

957
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,496
INCOMING CALL
A MI

958
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:56,796
-Hello?
-Pi-young, is Mother there?

959
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,256
Yes, she is.

960
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,591
When did she get there?

961
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,636
-About an hour ago.
-What did she say?

962
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,388
Don't ask. I'm not in the mood.

963
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,765
We'll go there. Don't let her leave.

964
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,688
Shouldn't we call the hospital?

965
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,690
And will you go in your pajamas?

966
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,074
Good dog.

967
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,411
Is that tasty?

968
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,503
INCOMING CALL
DAD

01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:42,717
Yes?

970
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:46,429
Call Pi-young and ask
if she's willing to cook me breakfast.

971
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:48,514
Right now? You're going there?

972
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:51,225
-Yes.
-That'd be rude. But why?

973
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,685
Just ask her.

974
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:06,783
Delicious rice will begin cooking.

975
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,912
INCOMING CALL
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SEO

976
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:17,210
-Hello?
-Are you up?

977
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,295
-Yes.
-My father asked

978
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:22,256
if you'd be willing
to cook him breakfast there.

979
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,759
Goodness. Here?

980
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:27,595
Yes. I told him it'd be rude of him.

981
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:29,180
I wonder why he wants to go.

982
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,849
I'll have breakfast ready.
Tell him to come.

983
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,185
-You too, right?
-Of course.

984
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,812
-Okay.
-Bye.

985
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:40,900
Mother.

986
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,653
-Mother.
-Yes?

987
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:47,824
May I come in?

988
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,408
Yes. I'm brushing my teeth.

989
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,119
Mother, I need your help.

990
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:53,996
My future father-in-law is coming.

991
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,290
"Future father-in-law"?

992
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:59,252
He's having breakfast here.
Please wake Ji-a up too.

993
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,431
-Come visit me at the hospital.
-Are you not well?

994
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:36,974
Maybe I'm terminally ill.

995
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:40,519
-My goodness!
-Who is it from?

996
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,063
Ms. Nam Ga-bin.

997
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:47,068
-What do you mean she's flirty?
-Are you on speakerphone?

998
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:48,986
-That's right.
-What do you mean?

999
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,822
-I'm so nervous for you.
-I'm just an old bride.

1000
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:54,200
They must be insane.
Are they in their right minds?

1001
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:57,328
I sent a car just now.
Just bring your pajamas and come.

1002
01:05:57,411 --> 01:05:59,288
Are we moving in before Mom?

1003
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:02,083
Now they're barging into this house
to take everything.

1004
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:05,086
Jeong-bin, what should we do
with your mom?

1005
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:07,880
Wait. Are you saying we're the same?
That's not true at all.

1006
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,341
You want me to die from eating this.

1007
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:13,511
-Does that mean I'm going to die too?
-That's how I killed my husband.

1008
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,640
Please welcome the groom and the bride.

1009
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:22,478
