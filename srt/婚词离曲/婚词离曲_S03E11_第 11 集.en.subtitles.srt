EPISODE 11

2
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,263
Mr. Seo's a little drunk and would
rather not go home to an empty house.

3
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,766
He asked if he could sleep on the couch.

4
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,351
-Sure thing.
-He's been wanting to come over.

5
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,812
We should have invited him sooner.

6
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,064
Things were too hectic.

7
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,523
He can sleep in my room.

8
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,484
Is it clean? Doesn't it smell?

9
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,569
It's not like I drink or smoke, you know.

10
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,071
I feel lighter.

11
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,074
Babies need to be older
to come here, right?

12
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,742
Of course.

13
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,870
I'd like to take a walk.

14
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,955
I haven't been able to recently.

15
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,305
Not having winter

16
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:41,100
-would be such a loss.
-You're right.

17
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,853
They say that Hawaii is like paradise,

18
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,480
but I don't want to live there.

19
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,357
Me neither. It'd be boring.

20
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,819
I believe that winter
is the queen of seasons.

21
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:51,986
It has its charms.

22
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,364
Snow always has you in awe.

23
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:58,451
Ice, frost,

24
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,788
the sun glistening on the snow,

25
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,958
and the cold breeze.

26
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,461
What about Jeong-bin?

27
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,506
Which will you teach him first?
Skiing or skating?

28
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,508
He'll learn to ride my shoulders first.

29
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,512
Rather than just registering our marriage,

30
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,849
let's have another wedding
and renew our vows.

31
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,100
That's what I wanted too.

32
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,647
I can see more stars than usual today.

33
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,359
That makes me feel grateful.

34
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,491
I've been at ease lately, you know.

35
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,953
Thanks to you, I found inner peace.

36
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,081
I'm grateful for this moment

37
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,208
and also for tonight.

38
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,878
Please stay by my side
for decades to come.

39
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,553
Maybe he just went home.

40
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,013
Maybe.

41
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,224
I hope he didn't fall asleep in his car.

42
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,434
He could have.

43
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,897
Hello?

44
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,024
Where are you?
I thought you were coming up.

45
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,483
I'm on my way.

46
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,068
Sure.

47
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:17,113
Mom, sleep in my room
and let him have yours.

48
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,406
So he can wash up easily.

49
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,408
But he doesn't have a change of clothes.

50
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,576
Still.

51
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,828
He just wants to get some sleep
on the couch.

52
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,622
He's not a stray puppy, you know.

53
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,207
Then I'll set him up in the study.

54
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,085
It's too late

55
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,922
to go see Jeong-bin, right?

56
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,299
As if.
Besides, it's not some stranger's house.

57
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,717
It's your home too now.

58
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,352
Welcome. There are lots
of pretty things here.

59
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,728
Please take your time.

60
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,733
This and this, please.

61
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,280
-What about this?
-It's pretty.

62
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,282
Maybe he's waiting to sober up a little.

63
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,494
He went out with some friends
and had quite a lot to drink.

64
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,912
Should I make honey water?

65
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,956
I bet you'll make it super sweet,
just the way you like it.

66
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,958
Honey water is meant to be sweet.

67
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:17,924
It's open.

68
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,557
-What's all this?
-Hello.

69
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,059
Sorry for the late-night intrusion.

70
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,060
Welcome.

71
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,937
This is how we live.

72
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,856
It's nice and cozy.

73
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,234
It's just as I imagined.

74
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,111
Would you like some water? Or honey water?

75
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,445
Water is fine.

76
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,200
You didn't have to.
Is this why you were late?

77
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,535
No wonder it took you ages.

78
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,997
-I couldn't come empty-handed.
-Of course you can.

79
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,085
This is a lot to carry.

80
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,089
U-ram, what do you think these are for?

81
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,132
Snacking.

82
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,553
Would it simply be just snacks?

83
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,097
Minus the ice cream.

84
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,933
All food has its purpose.

85
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,186
I doubt they will help you lose weight.

86
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,815
I get it. They're for emergencies.

87
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,985
-No?
-You're right.

88
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,030
Why would we need
an emergency food supply?

89
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,949
For emergencies
like earthquakes and other things.

90
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,953
You're right. Does that mean
we shouldn't eat these?

91
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,288
No, go ahead.

92
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,165
I'd like some ice cream.

93
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,458
What should I start with?

94
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,085
The kids only had some fried chicken
for dinner, you see.

95
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,546
-It's a good thing I came by then.
-Yes.

96
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,299
-We have an unoccupied study.
-Should I come by every day?

97
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,842
Yes.

98
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,719
What kind of daughter-in-law do you want?

99
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:45,928
You know I'm the one
getting married, right?

100
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,265
Since you're in your mid-thirties,

101
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,893
eight years your junior would be perfect.

102
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:56,397
Women over 25 used to be considered old.

103
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,108
Backgrounds are just as important.

104
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,069
Did she major in mass communication?

105
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,196
-Yes.
-Any siblings?

106
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,114
-An only child.
-So she's the only daughter?

107
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,366
-Right.
-Her parents must be young.

108
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,702
They passed away.

109
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,123
-Both of them?
-Yes.

110
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,418
This is why one needs to be off
to a good start.

111
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,546
Your future sister-in-law
lost both her parents too.

112
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,216
But it's possible
since their youngest daughter is 50.

113
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,926
Why did they pass away so early?

114
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,886
Her father died in a car accident
when she was young

115
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:27,929
and her mother died recently.

116
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,306
Goodness. She must still be grieving.

117
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,892
It's just her now,
so you should hurry with the wedding.

118
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,227
Is she willing to move in?

119
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,437
If you guys allow it.

120
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,689
We'd be more than grateful.

121
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,525
Let us meet her tomorrow if possible.

122
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,737
Wait, I have dinner plans.

123
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,656
Would breakfast be too difficult?

124
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:52,370
You have your flaws, Dad.
No one's perfect.

125
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,372
Of course.

126
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,459
-Is something wrong?
-Only by conventional standards.

127
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,669
Don't tell me she's old.

128
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,050
-She is!
-She's beautiful though.

129
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,718
As if that matters.

130
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,095
You're one to talk.

131
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,681
Would you have married Mom
if she were ugly?

132
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,269
-How old is she?
-She's Ga-bin's age.

133
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,856
I see that you're a fool.

134
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,983
Nam Ga-bin's age
is why I disapproved of her.

135
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:25,111
-But you still accepted her.
-So you want me to once again?

136
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,363
Over my dead body.

137
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,032
No wonder you weren't confident enough
to bring her home.

138
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,159
Damn it.

139
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,953
She has a daughter.

140
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,790
And she is Ms. Lee's co-worker.

141
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,709
They're friends.

142
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,804
What did you just say? She has a child?

143
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:52,930
She starts middle school.

144
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,725
Is she a divorcée or a widow?

145
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,809
A divorcée.

146
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,440
You're both out of your minds.

147
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,359
Does your brother know?

148
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,695
-Yes.
-You played me then.

149
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,114
-It's not like that.
-How is it not?

150
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,200
You're both helping the other get married

151
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,076
making me a fool in the process.

152
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,578
I thought you'd understand.

153
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,830
-As if!
-That's her only flaw.

154
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,915
It's not just a flaw.

155
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,875
It disqualifies her.

156
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,460
I'm marrying her no matter what.

157
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,170
You know how I am.

158
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,131
And you know me as well.

159
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,635
Do as you please and I'll do the same.

160
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,969
What will our employees think?

161
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,263
What about your mother?
She has so many expectations.

162
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,058
What will she say when she hears
you're marrying a 41-year-old divorcée

163
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:37,975
with a kid?

164
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,602
That's how life is.

165
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,480
There are more things we can't control.

166
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,066
Mom told me that many times.

167
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,984
This isn't what I planned.

168
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,695
It's not like I wanted to fall
for a divorcée in her forties.

169
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,156
-Don't talk your way out of this.
-That's not it.

170
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,658
I'm persuading you.

171
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,828
Kids cause trouble at least once in life.

172
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,790
-Says who?
-It's what I heard.

173
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,544
Not even you were the perfect son.

174
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,587
-I was more than--
-I'm the one marrying.

175
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,716
Why do you and Mom need to like her
when it's me who's marrying her?

176
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,134
Besides, age is only a number these days.

177
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,137
Money can buy one's youth back.

178
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,140
All the money your mother spent
didn't turn her 20 again.

179
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,977
There will only be one outcome,
so just accept it.

180
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,896
Sleep early. I'd hate to see you
in a bad shape tomorrow.

181
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,649
-As if I could sleep.
-I haven't been married before,

182
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,150
but I dated enough women.

183
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,318
More than I can count.

184
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,445
I now want to settle down
with the right woman.

185
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,114
There's nothing "right" about her.

186
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,198
Her name's Sa Pi-young.

187
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,535
I don't care what her name is.
There's no way I'd approve of her.

188
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,704
You'll give your mother a heart attack!

189
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,955
Over this little thing?

190
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,249
Have you forgotten
how she gave birth to you?

191
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,918
She had to go through
ten hours of contractions.

192
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,587
It's the same for any first child.

193
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,089
Besides, children bring
enough joy to parents

194
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,049
in their first ten years

195
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,927
although terrible twos
and hateful eights are a thing.

196
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,889
I believe that I have given you two
more joy than you could ask for.

197
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,308
Don't you agree?

198
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,854
All I did to upset you was marry late.

199
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,274
I would've loved to have fallen
for someone young too,

200
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,984
but it's a twist of fate.

201
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,945
What can I do when my heart and soul
yearn for Sa Pi-young?

202
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,655
-You brat!
-Dad!

203
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,493
Our employees will think less of you.

204
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,872
Is this how you betray us
after how we raised you?

205
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,751
Don't we all
at least betray one person in our lives?

206
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,837
Take you for example.
You betrayed Ban and his mother.

207
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,009
So accept this reality
and don't lose sleep over it.

208
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:38,638
There's no way
you could logically persuade me anyway.

209
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:44,977
Your wife is arriving soon.

210
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,701
That sobered me up.

211
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,828
Being tipsy would help you sleep better.

212
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,206
It's not easy to sleep
somewhere that's not home.

213
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,624
I'm happy, that's all.

214
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:13,089
Half of the fried chicken
was barely enough, so thank you.

215
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,591
You should enjoy late-night snacks
from time to time.

216
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:16,967
It's unhealthy.

217
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,677
-It's a stress reliever.
-Exactly.

218
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,013
You had at least
two-thirds of the chicken.

219
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,599
Whatever. It hardly filled me.

220
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:24,767
Kids, brush your teeth.

221
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,269
You can use a new toothbrush.

222
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,146
It's not like I can give you my pajamas.

223
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,400
That's all right. Sleeping in my clothes
for one night won't kill me.

224
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,444
I'll head home early
and change into fresh clothes.

225
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,824
Can't I get a tour of the house
before I sleep?

226
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,535
What you see is everything.
Are you sure you're not tired?

227
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,328
I'll probably sleep well

228
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:46,956
but I don't want to.

229
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,126
Then, don't. We can talk all night.

230
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,878
-Sure.
-Tomorrow's not the weekend.

231
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,006
-You have classes.
-I guess I can't skip them.

232
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,093
Missing a few classes won't kill you,

233
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,261
but you will regret it.

234
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,013
But no regrets will come from
going to class.

235
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,307
-Sure.
-Tonight's been a blast.

236
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,725
Then I'm glad.

237
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,978
I was worried I'd be intruding.

238
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,021
You're part of the family now.

239
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,649
Thank you for thinking that way.

240
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,775
It's true though.

241
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,611
Did your mom tell you that
we'll be shopping for furniture?

242
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,696
Yes.

243
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,366
Pick what you want.
Your rooms are fairly big.

244
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,870
That's enough.

245
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,746
But leftovers are a sin.

246
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,791
It's okay in my household.
Actually, you're praised for it.

247
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:32,835
Sure.

248
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,630
Mom, the house feels whole again.

249
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,175
I came by.

250
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,969
-Sorry to intrude so late.
-As if.

251
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,345
We hardly consider this as late.

252
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,140
He fell asleep after his bath.

253
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,267
-Did you see a movie?
-We went to a sauna.

254
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,603
I don't get why people like them.

255
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,942
We agreed to get back together.

256
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,361
Really?

257
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,617
One thing led to another,
and sparks went off again.

258
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,995
This just seems right
no matter how I think about it.

259
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,747
You made the right call.

260
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,042
Hold on a second.
We should pop a bottle of champagne.

261
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,794
Please. You'll wake the baby.

262
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,380
I'll make sure
it only gently bubbles over.

263
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,007
Thank you, Hye-ryung.

264
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,344
We promise to do right by you two.

265
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:26,096
He won't disappoint you ever again.

266
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,265
You brat.

267
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,935
That reminds me. How is Bada doing?

268
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,895
She's pregnant again.

269
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,647
It's odd, you know.

270
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,234
She's always quiet and alone,
but she's pregnant again.

271
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:43,614
It's true what they say about
the shy ones being more brazen.

272
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:47,117
Anyway, I hope you go back
to cherishing one another.

273
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,160
Sure thing.

274
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,578
Why aren't you asleep?

275
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,040
-Are you here for Danchu?
-Yes.

276
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,630
Go to bed. It's not going anywhere.

277
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,676
-Are you going to sleep out here?
-Yes.

278
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,553
Puppies cry when left alone.

279
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,388
You'll sleep out here every day?

280
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,474
-For the time being.
-We'll take turns.

281
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,892
You'll roll off the couch.

282
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,144
No way. At this age?

283
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,854
Besides, it wouldn't even hurt.

284
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,482
This brings back memories.

285
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,569
Back when I first
started elementary school,

286
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,280
my dad got me a puppy.

287
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,240
The Yorkshire Terrier in your photos?

288
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,950
Yes, her name was Mimi.

289
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,954
My dad was the one who slept on the couch.

290
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,582
I came outside
after waking up one morning…

291
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,334
We had a fireplace, you see.

292
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:41,213
Mimi must have found our house
relaxing and warm

293
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:45,050
because I saw her sleeping on her back
with her legs out straight.

294
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,471
If I had a phone that could take photos,
I would have taken one.

295
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,100
-Grandpa must have loved dogs too.
-He did.

296
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,227
I don't get people who don't like dogs.

297
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,190
Isn't it cute? Look at its angelic eyes.

298
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,405
Director Seo seems nice.

299
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,907
Because he bought you a dog?

300
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,617
No, I just get that vibe from him.

301
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,494
He gets along with us well.

302
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,040
If my father were alive,

303
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,792
he would have adored you.

304
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,379
I miss my mom…

305
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,758
and also my dad.

306
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,259
Live a long life, Mom.

307
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,386
Don't make me miss you.

308
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,849
It's sad to miss someone.

309
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,517
You're proof of it.

310
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,282
Yes?

311
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,452
The chairman invited you to breakfast
at the hotel in Gangnam.

312
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,079
He already left.

313
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,122
Got it.

314
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,458
Sa Pi-young…

315
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,253
If you marry that single mother,

316
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,672
you will be left with nothing.

317
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,216
I will donate my wealth to society.

318
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,761
Go ahead. Thanks to being born
with a diamond spoon in my mouth,

319
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,181
you and Grandpa gave me a privileged life.

320
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,599
It's time for a humble one.

321
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,520
Enjoy your life with Mom

322
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,106
and don't expect to see
your grandchild when we have one.

323
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,983
But she's over 40.

324
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,693
That doesn't mean she's infertile.

325
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,695
Geriatric pregnancies
aren't that dangerous anymore.

326
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,865
Just look at celebrities.
Better nutrition does wonders.

327
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,580
Like I said yesterday,

328
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,207
I have brought you two
more than enough joy.

329
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:26,003
Take a trip down memory lane
every time you miss your grandchild.

330
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,428
Don't you feel bad for your mom?

331
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,096
Why should I?

332
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,807
She has a husband, a son,

333
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,435
plenty of money, and jewelry.

334
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,396
Being with you gave her a life of luxury.

335
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,732
Have you forgotten how she raised you?

336
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,985
She drove you around personally
and cared for you with love.

337
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,446
And she should be glad
I didn't go down any wrong paths.

338
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,617
I haven't told her yet
to spare her the shock.

339
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,786
She'll know that some things
can't go her way.

340
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,954
Besides, it's better
to face the music early.

341
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,582
You brat. I may be able to take it, but…

342
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,673
Have your coffee.
You don't want indigestion.

343
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,133
As if I could enjoy it.

344
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,809
They say that it's wrong
to try and change a spouse

345
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,477
to fit your needs.

346
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,687
At least that's what experts say on TV.

347
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,314
Accept them for who they are.

348
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,066
The same goes for your kids.

349
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:33,821
Great parents accept and support them
for who they are.

350
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,786
This is nothing compared
to all that you've been through.

351
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,127
You should wake Mr. Seo up.

352
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,795
Sure.

353
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,299
-Are you up?
-Yes.

354
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,553
Breakfast is ready.

355
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:01,765
Good morning.

356
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,725
Hi.

357
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:05,853
Did you sleep well?

358
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,856
-Yes. How about you?
-Breakfast is ready.

359
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,482
I'll brush my teeth first.

360
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:23,245
We keep it simple for breakfast.
Less than three side dishes.

361
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,123
That's more than enough.
Actually, it's perfect.

362
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,500
-I'll enjoy this.
-Me too.

363
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,793
Sure thing.

364
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,969
I find the soup refreshing,

365
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,180
but was it cooked because of me?

366
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,266
Hyang-gi and I like pollack soup as well.

367
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,809
Since it has such a mild flavor,

368
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,228
they've enjoyed it since they were young.

369
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,023
I'm having a proper breakfast
for the first time.

370
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,739
-Was this fried?
-Yes.

371
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,365
Isn't it good?

372
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,034
-It is.
-It's my favorite.

373
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,785
You have over ten favorite dishes.

374
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,917
I bet the smell of fish
wasn't that pleasant.

375
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,295
It was nice to wake up
to the smell of food.

376
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,964
It made waking up even easier.

377
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,593
Is this beet?

378
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,470
JI-A
IMAGE FILE

379
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,193
Jeong-bin.

380
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,779
You'll soon get a mother.

381
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,614
A stepmother.

382
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,658
I hope she doesn't change her mind.

383
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,160
I don't know how, but sparks flew again.

384
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,247
Unbelievable.
It's something that doesn't easily happen.

385
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,250
-Could it be…
-What?

386
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,793
Sa-hyeon, I mean.

387
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,629
Too big of a shock

388
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,509
could confuse one mentally.

389
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,719
-Oh, please.
-That wouldn't be the case, right?

390
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,890
I'm worried they'd lose interest
in one another again.

391
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,811
Why did you bring so much?

392
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,064
This is the last time
I'm bringing you food.

393
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,608
Here's your kimchi.

394
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,572
Have a seat.

395
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,833
The kids won't be leaving me.

396
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,045
That's only what you want. The children--

397
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,172
They agreed to stay with me.

398
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,471
From now on, you are not
to make suggestions like that to them

399
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,224
without discussing it with me first.

400
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,979
You can meet with them
since you're entitled to that.

401
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,898
But they're busy studying
and working part-time,

402
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:57,983
so keep it to a minimum.

403
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,986
Must Hyang-gi work
when you're marrying a wealthy man?

404
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,822
She's gaining life experience.

405
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:07,326
She has come to learn that
young people should endure some hardship.

406
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,870
Earning money has taught her many things.

407
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,960
Don't make them
worry about you for any reason.

408
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:20,005
-And enough with the pity party.
-Pity party?

409
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,674
Carrying yourself in a way
that makes the children worry

410
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,301
is by definition a pity party.

411
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,845
Be cheerful around them.

412
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,723
Don't tell me what to do.

413
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,516
Just have a good life, why don't you?

414
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,936
Unless you provoke the children,
I wouldn't have to.

415
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,568
Enjoying the privilege, are you?

416
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,196
Stealing is fun, isn't it?

417
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,949
How is this stealing?

418
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,660
Are you saying I stole this coat?

419
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,204
You're enjoying the taste of money.

420
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,499
Why should I dislike it?
Ban is good to me and the children.

421
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,084
How is that wrong?

422
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,632
The side dishes
should be put in the fridge.

423
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,343
Do you really love this man?

424
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:12,099
As if you need to ask.
Don't you know me at all?

425
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,521
Hello?

426
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,816
Cutie, what were you up to?

427
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,153
You're getting cheekier.

428
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,114
Be cheeky with me too.
That'll even things out.

429
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,157
Aren't you busy?

430
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,200
I still have time to talk to you.

431
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,161
Have you been to Ban's townhouse?

432
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,996
I haven't had the chance. Why?

433
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,289
I thought we could live there.

434
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,877
-With the family?
-No.

435
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,171
The complex has an available unit.

436
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,135
-Hello?
-I'm here.

437
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,761
I can always look for something else.

438
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,471
Have you told your parents?

439
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,515
Yes.

440
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,726
They don't want to see me, am I right?

441
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,145
That's not it. This is more about Ji-a.

442
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,273
It'd be difficult for her
to live with the elderly.

443
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,860
We'll talk later.
Are you getting off late?

444
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,362
-No. I'll text you when I'm done.
-Okay.

445
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,530
So what were you up to?

446
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,115
My boss summoned me.

447
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,581
-Hello.
-Hi.

448
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,374
He wanted to see Danchu.

449
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,960
It won't stay put, you know.
And it gnaws at my heel.

450
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,258
Danchu!

451
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,678
I've never seen a puppy before.
It's adorable.

452
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,516
I wish we had one too.

453
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,935
Mr. Seo will get you one.

454
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,394
My mom won't approve.

455
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,731
My mom was against it too,
but this is her last week working,

456
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,942
so she has time for it now.

457
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,069
Isn't your mom quitting her job too?

458
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,154
-Yes.
-See?

459
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,698
Hyang-gi should see this. Hold it for me.

460
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,539
Let me see.

461
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,293
Again.

462
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,546
-But you look pretty.
-No, take another one.

463
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,342
Hywang-gi wanted you to add this
to your skin-care routine.

464
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,264
No way. I got one for you as well.

465
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:05,146
Did you buy it for me?
Let's hope this makes us look younger.

466
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,774
We'll need all the help for the big day.

467
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,986
Not everyone gets to marry,
but we're doing it twice.

468
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,821
Let's hope it's our last.

469
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,366
Hey, Hye-ryung's here.

470
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,043
I see you're already settled in.

471
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,295
Join us already.

472
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,171
After a quick shower.

473
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,887
I won't be able to attend your weddings.

474
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,056
Because of a gig?

475
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,183
I'm getting married.

476
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,768
-My gosh.
-With whom?

477
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:47,022
I heard that it's bad luck
to attend weddings before your big day.

478
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,273
What's up with us?

479
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,192
-We're all remarrying at the same time.
-Tell me about it.

480
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,195
Tell us more. Is he also someone younger?

481
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,033
He's someone you know.

482
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,662
Is it Kim Min-bae?

483
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,873
-No.
-Yoo Hoe-seok?

484
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,333
It's Sa-hyeon.

485
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,338
But you weren't interested.

486
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,505
I know.

487
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:16,676
I guess it's hard to get a grip
on people's feelings.

488
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,386
I'm happy for you.

489
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,055
The baby's adorable.

490
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:24,142
Are you getting back together with him
to be a mom?

491
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,102
That's one of the reasons.

492
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,695
What if she gets pregnant
with her own child?

493
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,740
This goes to show
that they're meant to be.

494
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,203
Hye-ryung's the only one
getting back together with her ex.

495
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:49,334
By the way, my future brother-in-law
is head over heels for you.

496
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:53,546
The same can be said about Mr. Seo.
His affection for you runs deep.

497
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,341
Happy, aren't you?

498
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,635
Love is like a rainbow.

499
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,763
The colors shift depending on the person.

500
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:06,267
My feelings for Ban
aren't like what I felt for Hae-ryun.

501
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,894
Same here.

502
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,355
What about him do you like the most?

503
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,482
The fact that he can be dominating.

504
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,445
That's something considering how you are.

505
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,202
Yes?

506
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,997
What did you just say?

507
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,791
Quickly. To the hospital.

508
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,430
Yes, Ms. Choi.

509
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,103
Sir!

510
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,564
It's about your wife.

511
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,276
What is it?

512
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,652
She passed away.

513
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,156
Passed away?

514
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,993
Ms. Choi couldn't bring herself
to tell you.

515
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,503
Oh, no.

516
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,468
My gosh.

517
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,512
Why did the doctor leave so soon?

518
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,724
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

519
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,310
911 RESCUE

520
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,113
How far out are you?

521
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,656
There's traffic, so 20 minutes.

522
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,409
We should at least operate.
Did you tell them to prep?

523
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,578
I told them to prep the OR, but…

524
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,885
This seems like a bridal shower.

525
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,221
I know. The matching gowns say it all.

526
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,807
Should I ask Hyang-gi
to bring us some clothes?

527
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,685
-Come on. She'd secretly laugh at us.
-She wouldn't.

528
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,687
We should take a photo.

529
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,689
Wearing this?

530
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,192
Who cares when it's just for us to see?

531
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,368
I once spent the night here at this hotel.

532
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,994
It dawned on me

533
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,956
that I should never be arrogant.

534
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,208
You're hardly like that.

535
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,961
To be honest, I felt superior to others.

536
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,463
Or something like that.

537
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,425
My life seemed better
and happier than others.

538
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:48,221
It all worked out for the best
and a new sense of happiness awaits you.

539
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,931
The same can be said about you too.

540
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:54,644
It's as the old saying goes.

541
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,145
You two hit the jackpot.

542
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,274
My future brother-in-law

543
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,734
calls her Cutie.

544
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:02,735
Goodness.

545
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,697
He's not wrong, I guess.

546
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,491
Ban came by the house last night

547
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,951
and asked to stay over.

548
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,245
-Goodness.
-Don't get any funny ideas.

549
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,122
Funny ideas as in what?

550
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,249
I shouldn't have said anything.

551
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,878
Si-eun, how many bases
have you touched with him?

552
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,714
What bases?

553
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,382
DIRECTOR SEO

554
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,884
MR. SEO

555
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,847
-It's Dong-ma.
-It's Ban.

556
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,266
I'm jealous.

557
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,228
-Hey.
-Hello?

558
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,659
Oh, no.

559
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,620
I'm with Pi-young at the moment.

560
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,956
Don't you need us there?

561
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,084
All right.

562
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,713
Sure.

563
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,138
Did something happen?

564
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,993
Are you sick, Mother?

565
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,120
No.

566
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:24,127
-What time is it?
-It's 7:30 a.m.

567
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,191
Have some of this.

568
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,779
-What is it?
-Supplements.

569
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:52,947
You seem tired lately.

570
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,283
You should take these.

571
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,788
Do I seem tired to you?

572
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,165
You have your age to consider.

573
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,916
How old do I look?

574
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,170
Mid-fifties.

575
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,465
All right. I'll take it.

576
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,397
-And don't skip breakfast.
-I won't.

577
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,654
I spent too much time last night
watching videos online.

578
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,490
Only the dead keeps suffering.

579
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,242
Won hasn't been gone that long, you know.

580
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:42,371
I know. Didn't it seem like
his world had come to an end?

581
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:46,042
Ga-bin, did we all choose the wrong man?

582
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,753
Not me.
I'm the one who left him, remember?

583
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,382
I'm going to keep my distance from men now

584
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,052
and concentrate on my career.

585
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,929
That's easier said than done.

586
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,430
Men throw themselves at you.

587
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,474
It's all futile.

588
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,063
-It's Boo Hye-ryung.
-Is she calling to brag?

589
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,231
Hello?

590
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:11,400
It's Boo Hye-ryung. Have you been well?

591
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,485
Yes, hello.

592
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,154
It's been a while.

593
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,075
-Right.
-Could you perhaps spare me some time?

594
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:23,121
I'd like to see you
and perhaps ask for a favor.

595
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,248
-A favor to ask me?
-Yes.

596
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,043
When should it be?

597
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,506
I'm getting married, you see.

598
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,259
My ex-husband and I are back together.

599
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,094
I see.

600
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,763
You were the only person I could think of.

601
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,058
But I'm sure you know many other singers.

602
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:48,521
I do, but I'd love for you
to sing at our wedding.

603
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:52,984
Would you do it?

604
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,279
Ga-bin, it's absurd.

605
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,698
Song Won will be turning in her grave.

606
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,116
I know.

607
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:03,786
Declining is the right thing to do,
but I couldn't bring myself to say it.

608
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,663
Call her right now and decline.

609
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,206
That'd be wrong.

610
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,709
Explain how you know Won
to Jeong-bin's grandmother

611
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,378
and turn down the offer.

612
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:15,214
I'll sing at the wedding
for Jeong-bin's sake.

613
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,049
What does this have to do with him?

614
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,760
In hopes that she'll be
a good mother to him.

615
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,263
As if that's possible. She's a menace.

616
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:25,433
If I do this,
I'll be able to stop by from time to time

617
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,268
and check up on him.

618
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:28,936
Whatever.

619
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,813
Let me call you back. I'm getting a call.

620
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,484
-Damn it!
-My goodness!

621
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,824
Please make me look younger.

622
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:42,909
Sure thing.

623
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,952
I need to look good in the photo.

624
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,454
You already have handsome features.

625
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,748
Is that so?

626
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,208
I asked my brother to get his makeup done.

627
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,878
No amount of makeup
could lighten his dark complexion.

628
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,715
The brothers must have
different skin tones.

629
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,051
He loves to golf outside, you see.

630
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:04,388
Not only does he run the club,
but he's also in love with the sport.

631
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,557
Sunscreen goes a long way.

632
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,810
That's not easy for men, you see.

633
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:31,123
If you will allow me again

634
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:38,506
If I could see you again

635
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:47,014
From my past memories

636
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,143
From the pain

637
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:56,190
I call for you

638
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,365
You are

639
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,040
You are

640
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,882
With eyes only for you

641
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,470
Without a sound

642
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:30,599
I call for you

643
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,189
You are

644
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:41,235
I never even got to
call you my daughter-in-law.

645
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,362
You weren't even able to close your eyes.

646
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,531
You are

647
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:51,537
You're my delight of all

648
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:58,044
You will forever be my love

649
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,756
I now know what love truly is

650
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,592
and what it really feels like.

651
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:17,938
Please be by my side

652
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:26,405
If you still love me

653
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:34,538
Tears brimming in my eyes

654
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:39,085
Yearn for you

655
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:44,048
I love you

656
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,680
You are

657
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,855
You are

658
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:09,407
What stays the same

659
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:15,871
Is my love for you

660
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:19,834
With the drive,
it's all about loosening up.

661
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,378
At the address position, loosen your grip,

662
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,838
and wind back.

663
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,090
Then feel the weight of the head

664
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:29,093
and swing by rotating your shoulders.

665
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,514
It's not easy to pick this up at this age.

666
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,516
Easier said than done, right?

667
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,227
But you've gotten much better.

668
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,063
Keep following my lead
and you'll soon get the hang of it.

669
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,649
I know you're saying that
to lift up my spirits

670
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,734
but I already feel like I'm doing better.

671
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,696
Take what I just taught you
and take another swing.

672
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,157
Sure. Okay, let's loosen up.

673
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:11,051
Gosh, what a day.

674
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,430
Jeong-bin's 100th-day party during the day
and a wedding in the evening.

675
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,558
Jeong-bin didn't cry

676
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,435
nor did he make a fuss.

677
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,187
The boy's sociable.

678
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,230
He'll have great social skills.

679
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,316
It's their second honeymoon,

680
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,819
so maybe we should take Jeong-bin
and stay in Daejeon for a while.

681
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:33,282
When Hye-ryung only has eyes
for Jeong-bin these days?

682
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,533
You think?

683
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,994
If it weren't for him,
they wouldn't have remarried.

684
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,872
He's a lucky one.

685
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,749
I wonder if they're at the airport.

686
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,590
Goodness. Hello.

687
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,716
Yes, hello.

688
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:51,926
Were you here to practice?

689
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,054
Yes, despite my age,
I only just got started.

690
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,891
-After you.
-Sure. Thank you.

691
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,394
It's not late for you at all.

692
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,397
Men are muscular and athletic,
so they learn quickly.

693
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,774
It's not as easy as I thought.

694
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,193
-Have you been out on the field?
-Not yet.

695
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:12,279
It's the best sport ever.
And you can keep doing at old age.

696
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,074
Exactly. People around me
have been recommending it.

697
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:21,413
-No, allow me.
-Goodness.

698
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,844
I appreciate it.

699
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,222
I bet you've fully digested
the dinner you had.

700
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,100
-I have.
-How about a late-night snack then?

701
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,519
Golfing has made me hungry
and my legs are like jelly.

702
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,980
Restaurants and diners
are closed at this hour,

703
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,565
so how about a Japanese bar?

704
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,483
There's one on the first floor.

705
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,820
-Assorted skewers and an egg roll, please.
-Got it.

706
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,324
This is new.
This is my first time at a Japanese bar.

707
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,036
-Would it be all right to have a drink?
-Of course.

708
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,621
Excuse me.

709
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,748
Wait.

710
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,420
I'll have a glass too
and call for a driver.

711
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,797
Sure.

712
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,935
Sake goes down well, doesn't it?

713
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,645
It does.

714
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:30,399
I was in Singapore for a few months
to visit a friend.

715
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:32,443
I see.

716
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:37,031
Anyway, I heard about you.
Did you end up marrying her?

717
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,658
No, it didn't work out.

718
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,036
Why not?

719
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,581
I was a fool
and got caught up in the moment.

720
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:48,125
But it's useless to regret.

721
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,003
Ask for your ex-wife's forgiveness then.

722
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:53,047
-I did.
-Didn't it work?

723
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,258
-It didn't.
-Once won't do the trick.

724
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:59,303
Only a sincere apology
will get her to change her mind--

725
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,596
She's marrying someone else.

726
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,598
-Someone else?
-Yes.

727
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,933
Not you, but her?

728
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,311
That's right.

729
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,023
Didn't you hear the news?

730
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,902
Yu-sin and Pi-young are divorced too,

731
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,446
so I had no one to hear the news from.

732
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,074
Who is she marrying?

733
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:23,035
She met someone decent.

734
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,036
How decent?

735
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,414
A bachelor around her age.

736
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,666
What a catch.

737
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:32,211
And the kids?

738
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,339
Kids are usually against
their moms remarrying.

739
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,633
They're fond of the idea.

740
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:43,180
HE'S BEEN KICKED TO THE CURB

741
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,629
Can you ask Dong-ma to come down?

742
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:16,964
Yes, sir.

743
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,735
She never got to see Dong-ma marry

744
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,905
or hold her grandchild.

745
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:48,662
He's taking a shower.

746
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,380
Should I serve a snack?

747
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,389
Are you done sorting out her belongings?

748
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:10,809
Not yet, sir.

749
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,150
So do you know what I did?

750
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:22,070
You know, I'm not comfortable
with you being formal with me.

751
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,989
Should I speak casually then?

752
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:27,951
I'm exactly eight years your junior.
Let me call you Ms. Kim.

753
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,286
Ms. Kim?

754
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,705
-Did I cross a line?
-Of course not.

755
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:35,876
No one would think
that you're older than me though.

756
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,753
I hear that a lot.

757
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,004
Then call me by my name.

758
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,882
How could I possibly
just call you by your name?

759
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,383
It'll be Mr. Park instead.

760
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,927
As you please.

761
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:45,969
Cheers.

762
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,351
I'll speak casually from here on out.

763
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,811
Go ahead. We're all getting old anyway.

764
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,813
You're hardly "old."

765
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,441
You're even more stylish
than women half your age.

766
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,362
So where were we?

767
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,949
Your housekeeper quit

768
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:09,618
and your hair stood up
on the back of your head.

769
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:10,827
Oh, right.

770
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:14,373
So on the day I moved in
with Yu-sin and his family,

771
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:17,376
I set up a table of food
as if it were for an ancestral rite

772
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:21,004
and told him to sit if he were there.

773
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,297
And?

774
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,843
Well, I got this chill

775
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,637
and a shiver ran down my spine.

776
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,014
You're giving me goosebumps.

777
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,767
I'll stop then.
It's not even a pleasant story to tell.

778
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,312
I see we only talked about me today.

779
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:41,400
Oh, come on. I lost track of time
listening to you talk.

780
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,611
My friends do say
that I tell stories well.

781
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:48,407
Thanks to you, I was able to laugh again.

782
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,617
Call me whenever you need company.

783
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,619
It beats staring at a wall alone.

784
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,414
-Can I?
-Of course.

785
00:47:56,832 --> 00:48:00,002
By the way, who is your ex-wife marrying?

786
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,879
I don't want to talk about it.

787
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,215
Then don't.

788
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,718
I'll be watching her.

789
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:12,389
Just be a man and wish her well.

790
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:15,726
I guess you didn't know
that men get jealous more easily.

791
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,353
What can you do when you caused this mess?

792
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,981
-It's water under the bridge.
-The ship has already sailed.

793
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,316
It's about to.

794
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:24,318
Then wave it goodbye.

795
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,861
You and her are done.

796
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:28,238
Goodbye. Sayonara.

797
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,620
-Are you the driver?
-Yes, sir.

798
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,457
-Please escort her home safely.
-Of course.

799
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,294
Hello?

800
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,963
Over here.

801
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:48,258
I'll get going then.

802
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,887
It'll be on me next time.
Thanks for today.

803
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,766
I had fun too.

804
00:48:58,769 --> 00:48:59,811
Wait.

805
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:04,024
I see you cut your hair.
I knew something was different.

806
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:21,917
Don't depend on alcohol to help you sleep.

807
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,504
That's not why I'm drinking.

808
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,841
Once the 49-day memorial rite is over,

809
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,219
get married.

810
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:37,641
What's there to life, right?

811
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,267
All we need

812
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:42,854
is for every day
to be meaningful and happy.

813
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,651
Why aren't you answering?

814
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,445
Okay.

815
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,989
It still hasn't dawned on me.

816
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,285
From our bedroom

817
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,163
and from upstairs…

818
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:05,627
I feel like she'll show up at any second.

819
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,673
Leaving me is one thing,

820
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:12,050
but how could she
leave you behind as well?

821
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,525
Nice, isn't it?

822
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,026
Jeong-bin.

823
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:33,238
When will you call me Mom?

824
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:50,964
Sweet dreams, my baby

825
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:57,554
In the front yard
And up the hill behind us

826
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:04,436
Even birds and baby sheep

827
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,834
Can I get you anything?

828
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,211
Americanos, please.

829
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,087
Have a seat.

830
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,351
This is my father.

831
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,311
It's a pleasure to meet you.

832
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,989
I hear you have a daughter.

833
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,910
-Yes, sir.
-I thought you'd bring her too.

834
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:03,662
This is a difficult situation.

835
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:05,372
Hardly.

836
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:14,339
Is lunch being prepared?

837
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:16,091
Yes, sir.

838
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:21,805
What happened was unexpected,

839
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,307
and I'm still out of it.

840
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:31,773
Anyway, the living
must go on with their lives.

841
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:36,069
I told him he could marry you
once the memorial rite was over.

842
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:38,071
Please speak casually to me.

843
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:43,618
I'm aware that I lack in many ways.

844
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,788
No one's perfect.

845
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,041
Did you stay up all night again?

846
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,418
I got some shut-eye.

847
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,045
Do you indulge in any sports?

848
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,506
I sometimes play golf

849
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,551
and I've started doing Pilates recently.

850
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:04,055
-I hear that's good for you.
-Right.

851
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,600
Nothing trumps good health.

852
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,312
Have you been able to eat anything?

853
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,816
Well, I eat when I can.

854
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,610
But sometimes, I skip meals.

855
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,654
What does he like?

856
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,281
Noodles.

857
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,492
I can't make that for him
since it's not healthy.

858
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:28,788
Right, but it's like children
who get drawn to junk food.

859
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,124
I know it isn't good for me.

860
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:32,626
If you don't have an appetite,

861
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:37,923
having small portions of
naturally-flavored ice cream might help.

862
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:41,384
There's protein,
so it's nutritiously balanced.

863
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:45,180
Skipping meals even leaves
people our age lethargic.

864
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:47,599
Do we have any?

865
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:51,603
I don't usually have snacks, you see.

866
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,854
She bought some for us.

867
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,655
Can you get us some gelato?
Dad will have some too.

868
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,114
Sure.

869
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:07,953
There is vanilla, pistachio,
mango, and green tea.

870
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,329
Anything will do.

871
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,374
Let me serve it.

872
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,209
Have some coffee first.

873
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,312
Ji-a!

874
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,023
Hey.

875
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,275
Off to classes on a Sunday?

876
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,735
The library with some friends.

877
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:43,196
I see. Is your Mom home?

878
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:44,739
She isn't.

879
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,825
Gosh, I should've called first.

880
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,994
-What about the housekeeper?
-She's home.

881
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,664
This is to congratulate you
on starting middle school.

882
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,667
-Thank you.
-It's a bag.

883
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:56,918
I'll make good use of it.

884
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,837
Let me leave it upstairs then.

885
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,088
Sure.

886
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,673
Wait.

887
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:05,385
Your dad misses you, you know.

888
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,345
You haven't seen him since the ski trip.

889
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,433
I bet you're busy though.

890
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,102
I'm afraid so.

891
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:17,564
Of course. I'll let him down gently.

892
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:53,975
I'll text Pi-young myself.

893
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,977
-Sure.
-Did she go golfing?

894
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,979
No, to meet her future in-law.

895
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,607
Her future in-law?

896
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:09,074
Gosh, what's with the dog?

897
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,246
-What's its name?
-It's Danchu.

898
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,207
Was it adopted?

899
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,416
I think it was a gift.

900
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,668
It's adorable!

901
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,422
Is someone in the family getting married?

902
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:27,717
You should ask her yourself.

903
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,520
It's cool and refreshing.

904
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,313
It'll pick up your energy.

905
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,157
Which flavor do you like the most?

906
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,201
This one.

907
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,245
That'd be pistachio.

908
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,623
-Pistachio?
-Yes.

909
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:01,835
Pistachio has a great nutritional value.

910
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,378
It lowers cholesterol as well.

911
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:06,923
I'm the one with the medical license,
but you seem to know a lot more.

912
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:10,009
Dong-ma mentioned how impressive you are.

913
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:12,220
And I agree.

914
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:13,721
Oh, please.

915
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:15,723
Anyway, Stay for dinner.

916
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,267
Sure.

917
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,560
Ask Ban over too.

918
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,645
-With his fiancée?
-Yes.

919
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:37,454
Hello?

920
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:41,124
Ji-a, I heard that your mom
went to see her future in-laws.

921
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,375
When does she get back?

922
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,335
Before dinner.

923
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,171
Got it. Have a good day then.

924
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,213
Sure.

925
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,384
Is Pi-young getting married?

926
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:57,182
It's not like
she has a child to marry off.

927
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,017
She's still relatively young.

928
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,728
But how did she find someone so fast?

929
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,986
-Hello?
-How's golfing today?

930
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:11,196
Is that why you called?

931
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:12,906
To see if I was on form today?

932
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,115
You see…

933
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,160
-No, we'll talk later.
-Sure.

934
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,583
If it's true,

935
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:27,462
Yu-sin won't have to feel guilty
when it comes to Ji-a anymore.

936
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:40,600
Ji-a suggested that they send Danchu
over to your brother

937
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,935
even though she loves it.

938
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:44,187
So that it could bring him comfort?

939
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:47,482
Yes. She truly is considerate for her age.

940
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,902
Maybe we should buy something.

941
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,654
Does your father like plants?

942
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,864
They have everything at that place.

943
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,908
When did you last visit?

944
00:58:56,991 --> 00:59:01,037
Once, a long time ago
when he lived in a house.

945
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:04,541
Then it'd be wrong of us
to go empty-handed.

946
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:07,502
It's better than
buying what he doesn't need.

947
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,712
He hates things going to waste.

948
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:22,350
I had no idea
townhouses could be this big.

949
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,565
You can imagine
how lonely it'll get for him

950
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,775
even if he has hired help.

951
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:32,443
They don't live here.

952
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:36,239
They commute from apartment units nearby.

953
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:42,704
The way she looks tells me
she's just as sweet on the inside.

954
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:44,038
She is.

955
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:47,166
Do as she says once you marry.

956
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,045
-Got it.
-People will secretly laugh

957
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,630
when they hear you calling me Dad at 40.

958
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,717
Especially in front of Hyang-gi and U-ram.

959
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,928
They're well-behaved and polite.

960
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,057
Call to see if they left.

961
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,058
I'm sure they have.

962
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:06,185
I'll try them.

963
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:22,535
-It's your first time here, isn't it?
-Yes.

964
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,371
Please have a seat.

965
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:33,338
I bought these
just in case you'd like some.

966
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:34,589
They're baked sweet potatoes.

967
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:36,799
Right. It's been a while since I had any.

968
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,676
Can you not digest them well?

969
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,178
That's not it.

970
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:51,606
Have you been able to sleep?

971
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,567
I wake up at night.

972
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:02,617
I doubt words of comfort
would be of any help.

973
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,002
This looks delicious.

974
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:16,130
He has no appetite,
so hasn't been eating well.

975
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,549
I figured.

976
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,220
Should I serve mulkimchi?

977
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,014
We'll ask him.

978
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:31,646
Isn't it dry?
Would you like some mulkimchi?

979
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,648
I enjoy sweet potatoes as they are.

980
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:38,069
The house I grew up in had a fireplace,

981
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:40,071
so we'd grill some from time to time.

982
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:42,281
Our house in Hannam-dong has one as well.

983
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:50,415
How do you feel about moving in
and living together?

984
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,766
-I would love to.
-Me too.

985
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,331
Have a safe trip home, madam.

986
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:35,001
Sure thing.

987
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:44,111
-I don't feel well.
-In what way?

988
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,864
I'm nauseous and dizzy.

989
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,158
I suddenly had a craving for bibimbap.

990
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,160
I think I'm right.

991
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,703
Even her palate has changed.

992
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,330
Say it before I turn my car around.

993
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:56,499
Mr. Kim, to Ji-a's.

994
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:59,836
A child would be delighted
to have a young and healthy mother.

995
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:03,172
-My lady, your breakfast is served.
-But it's not even my birthday.

996
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,508
Take it as a token
of my love and gratitude.

997
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:07,593
Yu-sin, come quick.
Something's wrong with Mother.

998
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,137
I'm Seo Dong-ma, Pi-young's fiancé.

999
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:11,264
Talk about an entwined fate.

1000
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:14,350
No way.
Reality can be more dramatic at times.

1001
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:16,060
-I guess it's game over.
-What game?

1002
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:18,604
Tell her not to call her father back.

1003
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,022
Got it.

1004
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:21,607
Ji-a, is your phone off?

1005
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:24,819
Is it true that you're getting married?

1006
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,320
-Yes.
-With whom?

1007
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:32,869
