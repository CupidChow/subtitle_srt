00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,898
EPISODE 12

2
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,777
I got it. It's a book!

3
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,448
A stuffed animal?

4
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,076
It's one of them, right?

5
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,285
What if it's not?

6
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,790
I doubt it's clothing.

7
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,168
Is it underwear?

8
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,505
I get it now.

9
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,340
A muffler.

10
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,260
Am I right?

11
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,391
I guess I am.

12
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,908
-What if it's not?
-Then, so be it.

13
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,547
A desk pad?

14
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,721
PAINKILLERS

15
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,356
Ointment for burns,

16
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,401
painkillers, antipyretics,

17
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,571
waterproof bandages, medicated patches,

18
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,491
and a corn remover just in case.

19
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,493
Wearing heels might give you some.

20
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,413
You know what a disinfectant is.

21
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,791
And these pills will help
with indigestion.

22
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,086
Are you taking the evening flight?

23
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,630
I wish you a safe trip.

24
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,099
Should I walk you in?

25
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,871
I hope you're not upset.

26
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:25,914
Why would I be?

27
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,540
Your expectations weren't met.

28
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,543
This is much better. I'm grateful.

29
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:32,582
Why isn't she calling me back?
I'm sure she's back home now.

30
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,086
MOTHER

31
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,350
I was just about to call you.

32
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,561
Why did you take
all the spicy braised chicken?

33
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,729
To eat it, of course.

34
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,856
I said I'd season it some more tomorrow.

35
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,151
Why bother with the leftovers?
Besides, it'll be fine when reheated.

36
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,403
Next time, ask for permission first.

37
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,490
-I thought I was being considerate--
-In what way?

38
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,493
I brought the chicken there
hoping to learn your recipe.

39
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,953
I figured you'd hate to have it again.

40
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,831
You never eat the same dish
twice in a row.

41
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,503
Still, make a habit
of asking for permission first

42
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,463
-with everything.
-I will.

43
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,299
Don't have Yu-sin eat the messed-up dish.

44
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:26,385
A man who has a job to do
must always have a freshly cooked meal.

45
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,263
-Okay.
-Good night.

46
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,306
Sure.

47
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,266
Pi-young.

48
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,018
Yes?

49
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,104
Where is "Mother"?

50
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,191
I'm your mother-in-law.
Shouldn't you say "Mother" at the end?

51
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,402
Right. I'm sorry, Mother.

52
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,032
-Good night, Mother.
-Bye.

53
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,708
Is that the best she can do
when addressing her mother-in-law?

54
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,016
INCOMING CALL
MANAGER KIM

55
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,023
-Hello?
-Yes, what is it?

56
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,025
I have something to say.

57
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,610
Go ahead.

58
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,612
Face-to-face.

59
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,617
Could you please come back here?

60
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,974
I got myself a custom wig.

61
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,811
Why? It's not like you're bald.

62
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,274
Well, your mother-in-law
thinks I look a little old.

63
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:06,652
Rather, I thought
he could look somewhat younger.

64
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,446
But I hear wigs are uncomfortable,

65
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,656
and Father looks amazing as is.

66
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,950
People keep misunderstanding us.

67
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:13,868
Anyway,

68
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,413
he still looks young,
but he's losing out due to his gray hair.

69
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,040
I disagree.

70
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:22,460
It's not like he goes to the office,
so why bother with a wig?

71
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,087
He has gatherings
almost once every two days.

72
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,673
He'll only be wearing it briefly outside.

73
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,884
Put yourself in his shoes.

74
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,678
Would you want to wear a wig?

75
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,850
Who are you to voice your opinion on this?

76
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,771
Right. I'll try it on first.

77
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,357
I won't wear it if it's uncomfortable.

78
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,026
But people can tell you're wearing one.

79
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,736
Not the ones made these days.

80
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,739
We were promised a good job.

81
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,286
Maybe I should make an event out of it.

82
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,750
That ungrateful wench.

83
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,003
She couldn't have married Yu-sin
if it wasn't for me.

84
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,639
Goodness.

85
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,625
Your glasses were in your study.

86
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,004
Right, I see.

87
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,450
He's like a walking corpse now.

88
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:23,956
For Part One of the show,
we bring you Cozy Night Live.

89
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,209
Here are songs
that go really well with this night.

90
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,879
If you wish to share any stories--

91
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,047
I'll be late tonight.

92
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,636
Come home drunk like last night,
and you'll sleep on the couch.

93
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,599
I haven't even poured a glass.

94
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,145
Let's go anywhere.

95
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,648
Heaven or hell?

96
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:31,565
Heaven.

97
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,110
For me, that would be inside this car.

98
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,030
I'm going to go back.

99
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,075
-Where?
-In the States.

100
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,535
I won't come back.

101
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,080
-Why not?
-I've lost confidence.

102
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,540
To adapt?

103
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,291
I don't want to crumble,

104
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,086
but I feel like I will.

105
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,054
These emotions I'm feeling

106
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,348
are a first for me.

107
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,018
I realized

108
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:13,649
that time isn't what defines
the depth of your love.

109
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,693
I'm flustered.

110
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:20,531
That's probably the case
with every new experience.

111
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,869
Sooner or later,
you'll find yourself at ease

112
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,078
with those emotions.

113
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,207
It's just me, isn't it?

114
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,925
It's like I've been swept up
by a tsunami of emotions.

115
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,720
I wasn't given a fair warning.

116
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,394
I've been honest with you.

117
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,109
You can go.

118
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,194
Iâ€¦

119
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,113
I can't be honest with you.

120
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,533
Given my situation.

121
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,661
What if I'm willing

122
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,039
to overlook your situation?

123
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,176
How can I let you do that?

124
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,472
All right.

125
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,016
I should at least stay centered.

126
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,477
Fine.

127
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,490
Dad.

128
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:13,871
What's up?

129
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:18,000
I just saw people on TV
who are aspiring celebrities,

130
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,753
and they were really good
at singing and dancing.

131
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,588
Shouldn't Hyang-gi be as good now?

132
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,256
That's right.

133
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,050
Ask her to show you something.

134
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,763
You suddenly want me to dance?

135
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,514
To see if you have the talent.

136
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,642
It's a basic thing for theater students.

137
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,310
U-ram, go to your room.

138
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,606
How can you dance in front of strangers
if you can't in front of U-ram?

139
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,771
Hyang-gi, that was unexpected.

140
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,357
Have you been going clubbing
with your friends?

141
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,192
Only twice.

142
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,028
You must've practiced hard
to get that good.

143
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,238
Everything takes work.

144
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,490
-Maybe I should study theater too.
-No way.

145
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,118
Why not? You can, but I can't?

146
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,285
I'm against it too.

147
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,787
Are you saying I'm ugly?

148
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,498
It's not like you're that pretty.

149
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,834
I still got in, didn't I?

150
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,045
Hyang-gi, since you can sing too,

151
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,757
I'd rather you went into musicals
than TV dramas.

152
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,217
A musical actress?

153
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,510
Yes.

154
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,513
But it's hard to make a living
in that field.

155
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,766
It's the same for sports
and the entertainment business.

156
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,227
You barely make a living
unless you rise to the top.

157
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,480
That's why I was against
you studying theater.

158
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,525
-Then I'll become the top star.
-Easier said than done.

159
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,361
U-ram, keep your thoughts to yourself.

160
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,405
The grown-ups are talking.

161
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,115
Wasn't this a family meeting, Dad?

162
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,910
Dad, do you think I'll do better on stage?

163
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,871
You like musicals too.

164
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,540
The actors are mesmerizing.

165
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,043
My friends who've seen Broadway musicals

166
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,712
said the actors have amazing talent.

167
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,049
Exactly. And there are Koreans
who made it big on Broadway too.

168
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,800
So I've heard.

169
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,011
It might be good for all of us.

170
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,889
Maybe you'll take us to New York one day.

171
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,932
It'll make Mom and Dad proud.

172
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,476
What about you, then?

173
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,853
MANAGER KIM

174
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,614
MANAGER KIM

175
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,665
Trust me. I'll keep the boat anchored.

176
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,001
I do hope that you'll be back.

177
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,306
-Did you eat it all?
-Of course.

178
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,893
-Is our princess asleep?
-She waited, but yes.

179
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,353
Want some honey tea?

180
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,772
No, I didn't drink
saying I had an upset stomach.

181
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,024
-Not even a sip?
-Not even a sip.

182
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,386
Mother suggested we go on a ski trip
before Ji-a's school break ends.

183
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,595
Right.

184
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,266
If I can't go,
will you take Ji-a without me?

185
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,728
I need to devote myself to this new show.

186
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,233
It won't be any fun without you,
so what's the point?

187
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,490
Mother couldn't care less
about me joining the trip

188
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,825
as long as you go.

189
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,035
She doesn't mean that.

190
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,163
It's true. Check yourself tomorrow.

191
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,583
Then she can just take Ji-a herself.

192
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,130
Father got a custom wig.
Can you believe it?

193
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,007
-Why?
-Why else?

194
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,426
Because Mother thinks
Father looks too old.

195
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,803
A wig won't make him
look like he's in his fifties.

196
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,265
Who cares if he looks like
he's in his fifties or his seventies?

197
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,475
It'll be so uncomfortable for Father.

198
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,103
I'm proof of what he's like.

199
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:52,274
We do whatever our wives want.
Like father, like son.

200
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,151
I'm nothing like her.

201
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,653
I don't bother you
just to get what I want.

202
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,448
That's because you're one-of-a-kind.

203
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,074
You only have one flaw.

204
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,534
Which is what?

205
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,624
Let's give Ji-a a sibling.

206
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,630
I'll forever be your servant, my Queen.

207
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,839
Forget it.

208
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,301
Is your work that important?

209
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,845
Why do you need it so much?

210
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,599
If I were you,
I'd gratefully be a stay-at-home wife

211
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,392
and devote my life to the family.

212
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,479
Two children aren't the same as one.

213
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,731
If I have one more, I'll get fat.

214
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,608
You never will.

215
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,901
And what if you do?

216
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,362
-You'll still love me?
-Of course.

217
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,114
You only say that
because you know I'd stay fit.

218
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,074
That's right.

219
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,791
I'll wait until you change your mind.

220
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,919
-I won't push you.
-That's even scarier.

221
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,213
-And it's burdening.
-Don't feel that way.

222
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,759
Your health and your happiness

223
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,011
are my priority.

224
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,728
Gosh.

225
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,653
No wonder they say
women who have it easy become widows.

226
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,950
Are you awake, my wife?

227
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,202
What?

228
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,204
Can you scratch my back?

229
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,375
The sheets will be covered
with his dead skin cells.

230
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,714
Gosh, that's much better.

231
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,508
My back's still muscular, isn't it?

232
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,968
Of course.

233
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,595
You're fit enough to go skating.

234
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,809
Don't you think Pi-youngâ€¦

235
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,019
Yes?

236
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,147
Don't you also feel like she belittles me?

237
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,899
Why would Pi-young belittle you?

238
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,484
She's nice to you.

239
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,571
-Because I'm not Yu-sin's birth mother.
-Nonsense.

240
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,197
It's not an inferiority complex.

241
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,576
She isn't as formal with me
as one would be to her mother-in-law.

242
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,202
I don't think so.

243
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,954
When you're not around.

244
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,831
That's because you guys are close.

245
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,542
Sometimes, you come off like sisters

246
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,794
since you look so young.

247
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,963
She's cutting off the family tree

248
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,591
by not giving Yu-sin a son.

249
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,384
Yes, thatâ€¦

250
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,764
But it's like Pi-young said.

251
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,475
Who can guarantee
that the next child will be a boy?

252
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,227
She should've at least tried.

253
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,230
Ji-a's life would be more stable
with a sibling in it.

254
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,858
That's true.

255
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,111
You should talk to Yu-sin about it.

256
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,780
I'm not sure.

257
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:49,242
Who am I to get in
between a married couple?

258
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:53,080
This concerns not just them
but your entire family.

259
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,999
Pi-young would never cave in
and get pregnant again,

260
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,834
but it'll surely stress her out.

261
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,755
Besides, another grandchild
means less inheritance for me.

262
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,675
I can't wait for your wig to be done.

263
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,804
Can you imagine how cool you'll look?

264
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,475
-Where's Ji-a?
-She wants to sleep in.

265
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,436
-I didn't cook any soup today.
-Okay.

266
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,480
Gosh.

267
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,163
You should refrain
from cooking spicy braised chicken.

268
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,083
-Why?
-Or learn from Ms. Kim.

269
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,668
But Ms. Kimâ€¦

270
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,212
I mean, Mother cooked this.

271
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:46,091
I visited her with a chicken yesterday
to learn from her.

272
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,969
Even Mother fails to perfectly season

273
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,846
her dishes sometimes.

274
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,514
Really?

275
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,643
But she's never failed once until today.

276
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,894
For decades, actually.

277
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,646
You should try it.

278
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,731
I don't like
spicy braised chicken that much.

279
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,276
I brought it home for you though.

280
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,748
Anyway, I now know her secret.
She adds an artificial flavor enhancer.

281
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,502
She couldn't add it yesterday
because I was at her heels.

282
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:23,920
Really?

283
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,964
Can't you tell by the flavors?

284
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,592
Well, you won't know since you don't cook.

285
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,845
Chive soy sauce. Your favorite.

286
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,770
Artificial flavor enhancers
aren't good for you.

287
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,814
That's why I don't buy any.

288
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,442
My family's health is more important
than the flavor.

289
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,612
So, Dr. Shin,
even though it's not as good,

290
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:51,573
it's good for you, so enjoy.

291
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:55,118
Sure thing. It's good enough.
it's the best.

292
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,204
But you told me not to cook this anymore.

293
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:00,916
It was a mistake. A huge mistake.
I didn't know it was Ms. Kim's.

294
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,793
Admitting a mistake doesn't count
when only said in words.

295
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,838
Then, let's meet for dinner today.

296
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,133
Stretch your arms further. That's it.

297
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,845
Yes, that's good. Stretch.

298
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,139
Coach Kang,
you have a consultation request.

299
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,016
-Keep working on that.
-Sure.

300
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,694
Gosh.

301
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,033
Could she be sick?

302
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,244
It's not like her to ignore my texts.

303
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:02,852
Hey.

304
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:03,937
Hey.

305
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,359
-What would you like to drink?
-We should grab a meal.

306
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,986
There isn't a decent place nearby.

307
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,612
Then I'll check out the cafeteria.

308
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,699
But you don't eat pork.
Stir-fried pork is today's main dish.

309
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,202
I picked the wrong day to come.

310
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,247
There must be a brunch cafe.

311
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,502
You seem exhausted.

312
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,671
I could say the same about Nam Ga-bin.

313
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,259
-Did you see her?
-I ran into her at a wine bar.

314
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:39,848
Who are you seeing these days?

315
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,059
-A student who graduated from art school.
-How long will it last?

316
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,812
Who knows? A year at most.

317
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,648
What about you?

318
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,570
Call Dad once in a while
or text him when you can.

319
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,823
It's not even that hard,
and he's expecting it.

320
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,116
Let's just talk about you.

321
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,118
So this is about Nam Ga-bin?

322
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,162
She's perfect for you.

323
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,914
I know that,

324
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,959
but you know how many women are out there.

325
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,753
I won't be shackled at this age.

326
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,463
Does Dad look happy to you?

327
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,548
Are you happy being single and all?

328
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:16,009
-It's comfortable.
-"Comfortable"?

329
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,304
Isn't that another word for "lonely"?

330
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,014
Don't you miss her?

331
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,309
She pops into my head from time to time.

332
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,478
You'll end up regretting it.
I'm sure of it.

333
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,313
Then, so be it.

334
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,692
I prefer all things new,

335
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,612
whether it's a person,
an object, or a car.

336
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:39,407
They say you should live in a new house,
but live with an old love.

337
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,785
We're all different in our own ways.

338
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,579
You know that we both reject normalcy.

339
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,665
We're our father's sons, after all.

340
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,503
You know he's never missed or felt sorry

341
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,129
for your mother.

342
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,675
I believe that blood is thicker
than water though,

343
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,929
and I get curious about you
from time to time,

344
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,432
if you're eating properly
or if you're seeing someone.

345
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,310
If you are, let me be the first to know.

346
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,229
I'm a good judge when it comes to women.

347
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,648
-Yet, you still dumped Ga-bin.
-"Dumped"?

348
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,025
She's a person, not trash.

349
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,152
We just ended things.

350
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,572
You have an addiction
just like common alcoholics.

351
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,675
Here. I bought one for you
when I bought mine.

352
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,136
-What is it?
-Nothing much.

353
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,555
-You should get going.
-Sure.

354
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:57,444
Don't be one of those single men
who wear shabby underwear.

355
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,294
INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS A

356
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,737
Yes, I will. Thank you.

357
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,034
We're going to pick up
your wig next Friday.

358
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,161
Oh, that was quick.

359
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,456
-Good afternoon.
-Hello.

360
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,916
Thank you.

361
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,258
Doesn't he look younger, Mr. Han?

362
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,385
-He does.
-How old would you say?

363
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,762
I'd say in your mid-fifties.

364
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,639
Right?

365
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:56,521
Your friends might tease you
and tell you to remarry someone younger.

366
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,440
-Don't you dare.
-Come on.

367
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,823
MS. SONG WON

368
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,617
Hello.

369
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:13,162
My phone broke, so I had to get it fixed.
Sorry for the late reply.

370
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,914
Here's the salad recipe.

371
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:20,962
Hello. You skipped the gym,
so I was worried if you were sick.

372
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,554
My sister-in-law came to Seoul

373
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,514
to have a medical checkup.

374
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,601
Thankfully, it wasn't anything severe,
so she left for home today.

375
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,644
How's your wife?

376
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,565
I'll tell you in person.

377
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,318
Will you be at the gym tomorrow?

378
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,863
Yes.

379
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,954
See you tomorrow.

380
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,916
You're in fifth grade,
so you're a big girl now.

381
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,168
Make your own decision
regarding your issues

382
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,211
and take responsibility for the outcome.

383
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:06,424
That's right.
We can't live your life for you.

384
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,135
You never know what'll happen to us.

385
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,179
Think of your grandma and uncle.

386
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,264
Why would you make me sad
at this nice place?

387
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,891
I'm just telling you how life is.

388
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,900
Live long, okay?

389
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,070
This isn't a request.
It's an order from your daughter.

390
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,696
An earnest one.

391
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,700
We'd love to live long.

392
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,661
-But--
-Okay, that's all you'll say.

393
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:35,787
This way, please.

394
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,170
I hardly recognized you.

395
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,464
Can you tell?

396
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,591
Hardly.

397
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,260
Ji-a, how does your grandpa look?

398
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,347
Do you find it weird?

399
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,682
Can I be honest?

400
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:56,891
Of course.

401
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,518
You do look younger,

402
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,897
but there's something
awkward about you now.

403
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,816
It's new to you, that's all.

404
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,359
Pi-young?

405
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,570
It looks better on you than I expected.

406
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,323
Isn't it uncomfortable, though?

407
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,660
Not really. It's light.
I almost forgot that it's on my head.

408
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:20,331
Why don't you make a suggestion
to Pi-young

409
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,376
about having one more child
before she gets older?

410
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,128
Okay?

411
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,590
Pi-young.

412
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,259
Yes, Father.

413
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,928
Why don't you have one more child?

414
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,805
You should, for Ji-a's sake.

415
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,809
It's too late now, Father.

416
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,519
No, it's not.

417
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,940
Head Nurse Hwang gave birth to a baby boy
when she was 42, didn't she?

418
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,359
-Yes.
-You're healthy enough.

419
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,572
Isn't she a working mom with three kids?

420
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:56,617
Yes, she has two girls,
and the recent one is a boy.

421
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,453
See what I mean?

422
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,872
It's not because your father
wants a grandson.

423
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,374
He just doesn't want Ji-a to be lonely.

424
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,877
You two won't be around forever, you know.

425
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,545
My thoughts exactly.

426
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,589
You should seriously consider it.

427
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,591
Okay.

428
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,343
What's there to consider?
You should just do it.

429
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,889
Yu-sin grew up a lonely kid.

430
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,891
So did you, Pi-young.

431
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,394
You know how lonely it is
to be an only child.

432
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:29,567
Should Ji-a face this cruel world
all by herself?

433
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,153
Won't you feel so sorry for her?

434
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:36,032
The thought of it
would keep me up at night.

435
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,742
Mom.

436
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,746
Having a sibling doesn't necessarily
make a child grow up well.

437
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:45,666
Besides, Yu-sin, I, and both of you
grew up into fine adults

438
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,918
without any siblings.

439
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,880
-Then I'll act out.
-Gosh.

440
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,633
Yu-sin, what about you?

441
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:56,719
Who does she think she is
calling him like she's his wife?

442
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,889
Well, I'd like another kid.

443
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,810
But I have no complaints as is.

444
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,229
You have no complaints,

445
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,273
but you can't help but think it's a shame.

446
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,657
Where's the bread?

447
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,951
They serve it midway here.

448
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,577
I see.

449
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:25,540
The customers fill up with bread
if it's served first.

450
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,465
If we have another baby, will you babysit?

451
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,177
Of course.

452
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,515
But the mother should raise her child.

453
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,975
It's the right thing to do.

454
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,185
I was just asking.

455
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,271
Actually,

456
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,941
I sometimes bump into fortune-tellers
at the radio station,

457
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,361
and they all say
Ji-a has to stay an only child to succeed.

458
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,989
A younger sibling would ruin her chances.

459
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,201
-Really?
-Yes.

460
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,496
And if I have a son,
he will have a conflict with Yu-sin.

461
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,123
What's a conflict?

462
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,708
Clashing in a bad way.

463
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,834
Why didn't you tell me?

464
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,170
You don't even believe in fortune-telling.

465
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,254
You have a point.

466
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,756
I guess it's not safe
to ignore those signs.

467
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:21,262
Goodness. Quite a fast thinker, isn't she?

468
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,471
So cunning.

469
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,899
I should head back to the hospital.

470
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,527
-Why?
-A patient can't be calmed down.

471
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,864
-A mental patient?
-Yes.

472
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:49,707
Gosh, he never gets
to enjoy a meal at ease.

473
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,797
Hello, Professor. This is Nam Ga-bin.

474
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,676
Remember how I offered
to treat you to a meal before the seminar?

475
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,303
Do you have a date in mind?

476
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,556
This is my least busy time of the year.

477
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,558
Any day after tomorrow will be fine.

478
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,031
Did you have a good day?

479
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,867
Oh, I just watched something funny
on YouTube.

480
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,370
Are you hungry?

481
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,538
-I'm good.
-Doors closing.

482
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,750
SIN CENTRAL MEDICAL CENTER

483
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:29,181
Pi-young sure is clever,
I'll give her that.

484
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,017
What do you mean?

485
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,479
Fortune-tellers saying
that Ji-a shouldn't have a sibling?

486
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,899
That's what she must've heard.
I doubt she made it up.

487
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:42,695
It's not that hard to come up
with such a lie to avoid the situation.

488
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:46,699
Pi-young's a sweet woman
with innocent intentions.

489
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:49,910
-More than me?
-I was against their marriage at first.

490
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,496
But she's proven to be a good enough wife.

491
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,291
Men can be so gullible.

492
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,793
Why else would she
not have had another child

493
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,795
when Yu-sin wanted one too?

494
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,423
Because it'll ruin her figure,

495
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,550
and it's tough to have a baby
later in life.

496
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:08,429
Good postpartum care
will give her figure back.

497
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,349
From what I hear,
it's harder than you think.

498
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,352
Still, she should sacrifice herself
for Ji-a's sake.

499
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,937
Why did she get married
if she wanted convenience?

500
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,814
I wonder how late your dad will be.

501
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,239
-Yes?
-Will you be late?

502
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,866
No, I'm just about to head home.

503
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,034
Okay.

504
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,336
Good morning.

505
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,672
Good morning.

506
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,842
-Would you like some?
-Sure.

507
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,722
Sorry for leeching you off.

508
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,392
It's just some brewed tea.

509
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:45,651
So that day,

510
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,155
my wife felt a lump
on the roof of her mouth.

511
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:52,158
Do you have one too? It's like a bump.

512
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,289
I don't.

513
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:02,501
She freaked out, so we saw a doctor.
It turns out some people have it.

514
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,296
She was worried it might be cancer
on our way to the doctor.

515
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,423
What a relief.

516
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,968
So some have it and some don't?

517
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,637
That's right.
I didn't know about it either.

518
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,933
Did you pack your salad?

519
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,436
I didn't have time
to go grocery shopping yesterday.

520
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,397
-Did you bring your breakfast today?
-Yes.

521
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,566
I didn't even pay for the meal.

522
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,902
Don't pack any tomorrow then.

523
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,572
Starting tomorrow,
I'll be working out in the evening.

524
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,574
Why?

525
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,618
-Ms. Song.
-Oh, right.

526
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,328
Let's talk later.

527
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,755
-Don't you have an appetite?
-That's not it.

528
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,635
Why aren't you having rice?

529
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,637
I crave toast from time to time.

530
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,309
You haven't gone horse-riding lately.

531
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:03,521
Is it the cold weather?
But you need to relieve your stress.

532
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,730
I'm not stressed out.

533
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:07,942
But managing your patients
and the hospital is stressful.

534
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,989
Have some after your meal.

535
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,367
Can you

536
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,703
eat an apple without making a sound?

537
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,497
Is that even possible?

538
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:26,001
Oh, like that young man who sat next to us
on the train in Switzerland?

539
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,795
Right.

540
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,230
Impossible.

541
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,190
Mom!

542
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,776
Our puppy woke up.

543
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,026
You worked out before, right?

544
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,944
No, I'm a beginner.

545
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:38,198
But your muscles are already defined.
It's been less than a month.

546
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,743
The trainer knows what he's doing.

547
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,748
Please join me. I packed plenty today.

548
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,751
Dinner will be on me then.

549
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,837
That's not necessary. Over there.

550
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,921
Right.

551
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,888
Am I forcing you to switch time slots

552
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,973
by mooching you off your food?

553
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,482
The meat's gotten cold.

554
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,233
Beef is good even when it's cold.

555
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,528
-Right?
-Sure.

556
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,448
I'll treat you to a proper meal this time

557
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,408
to make up for last time.

558
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,494
It didn't even cost much.

559
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:28,832
I began working out in the morning
to quit my nocturnal lifestyle.

560
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,042
I see.

561
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,835
But I get sleepy during the day.

562
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,921
I get sleepy after I get to work too.

563
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,715
I bet you rely on coffee.
Espresso, to be exact.

564
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,133
It doesn't help.

565
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,636
You must've developed
a tolerance for caffeine.

566
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,971
-Yes.
-That's not good.

567
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,265
I heard that coffee is bad for you.

568
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:51,355
Maybe I should work out after work too.

569
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,857
What about your dinner gatherings?

570
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,443
We don't drink much these days anyway,

571
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,071
so I could easily come by after the meal.

572
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,909
I should do that.

573
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:09,164
I'd like to buy dinner today
if you're free.

574
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:10,582
Gosh.

575
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:14,044
Only then will I feel less guilty
about having your burdock tea.

576
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,630
It's too much for me anyway.

577
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:19,466
What would you prefer?
You have meat every morning,

578
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,844
so how about sashimi?

579
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,556
-Do you know Im-Sushi?
-Yes.

580
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,434
How does 6:30 p.m. sound?

581
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:32,354
-This isn't necessary.
-I'll make a reservation under my name.

582
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,731
Sure.

583
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,527
Then you should bring your wife
if she has time.

584
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,404
Sure.

585
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,867
But I doubt she'll come.
She's busier than I am.

586
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:49,455
Unbelievable. I'm completely worn out.

587
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:56,378
It would've been nice if we had
afternoon weddings back in the days.

588
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,173
I had to wake up at dawn
to get my makeup done.

589
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,967
My skin was terrible
because I barely slept.

590
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,429
-Why barely?
-I couldn't sleep.

591
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:06,805
Were you nervous?

592
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:10,476
-Were you excited?
-I had a lot going on in my mind.

593
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,853
What kinds of things were on your mind?

594
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,647
Imagine leaving your family
to live with your in-laws.

595
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,483
Everything is scary and troubling.

596
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,276
Why are you laughing?

597
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,196
-Nothing.
-What made you laugh?

598
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,657
I bet you couldn't sleep
thinking of our first night together.

599
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,869
You always think from your perspective.

600
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,537
What's wrong with that?

601
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,706
It's reasonable thinking on a man's part.

602
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:35,918
-I'm just as decent on a woman's part.
-So you think.

603
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,713
You always pretended to be so prim.

604
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:40,923
"Prim"?

605
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,883
-Me?
-Yes.

606
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,802
In what way?

607
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,180
-That's just how you were.
-Be more specific.

608
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,807
Would explaining it make you less prim?

609
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,062
You always think
the least of me, don't you?

610
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,189
You were the excited one.

611
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,942
Excited, my foot.

612
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,361
Why would I have been that satisfied?

613
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:06,156
That's rich coming from the man
who was in bliss.

614
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,492
-I remember it clearly.
-I was pretending

615
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:10,202
just to be polite.

616
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,578
Unbelievable.

617
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,581
So this is what they mean
by "change of perspective."

618
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,419
It was nice. There you go.

619
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,589
-It was great.
-Forget it!

620
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,299
Why are you sulking about that?

621
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:28,345
You're a master at annoying people
to the core, you know that?

622
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:30,389
Should I keep my mouth shut then?

623
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,642
Not all words are the same.

624
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:36,687
Your mouth is like a fire pit.

625
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,314
You always upset me
with your choice of words.

626
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:43,652
Would it kill you to speak more nicely?

627
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:51,827
You're wearing that?

628
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:54,538
Wear a skirt.

629
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:57,749
I could wear a rag,
and it still wouldn't be your concern.

630
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,960
Women should wear skirts.

631
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,879
Cut the sexist comments.
The world is a different place now.

632
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:06,466
And you just can't help
but always talk back to me.

633
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,219
You're right. The world has changed.

634
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,888
If it were the old days,
you would've been kicked out.

635
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:15,642
I hope you'll be born a woman
in your next life.

636
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:19,438
Will you be reborn as a man then?
No, thank you.

637
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,356
Same here!

638
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,068
A woman with that face of yours
would be too ugly to look at.

639
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:32,451
-Wear a skirt!
-It's my choice.

640
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:37,914
From now on, I'll only wear clothes
that I'm comfortable in.

641
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,249
I'm not going then.

642
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:45,130
Do you even know
how hideous your butt looks?

643
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,007
What about your saggy butt?

644
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,301
-Mine's still firm.
-As is mine.

645
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:53,263
It's not as good to look at now,
so get over yourself.

646
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:57,100
Wear clothes that are
appropriate for your age.

647
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:01,063
You have plenty to wear.
You've bought so many.

648
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:04,483
I'm hollow inside due to all the money
you sucked out of me.

649
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,487
I'm not going either!

650
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,157
That's less money to pay.

651
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,588
Who the hell are you?

652
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,188
Did something happen to Pi-young?

653
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,274
They say daydreams are never true, butâ€¦

654
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,444
Wait, slow down.

655
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,279
Slow down.

656
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,406
You're quite good.

657
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,624
Dr. Shin, it's been a while.

658
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,086
-Greetings.
-I guess you must've been busy.

659
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,005
Yes, I had to go to the States.

660
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,716
-Where's your son?
-He has to study hard now,

661
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,884
so I come alone.

662
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,889
I'm right on time, aren't I?

663
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,808
You must be a perfectionist.

664
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:05,187
Actually, I walked here
since it was too close to take a cab,

665
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,147
but it took me longer than I thought.

666
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,691
-Where do you live?
-T-Happy Apartments.

667
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:13,111
It's a long walk from there.
You must be hungry.

668
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:16,281
-I'll enjoy whatever is served.
-There's only one dinner course.

669
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,532
I see.

670
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:18,909
Isn't this place expensive?

671
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:22,245
The point of earning money
is to eat what we want, right?

672
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,915
Right. Guess what I do for a living.

673
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,542
How did you know I'm a fortune-teller?

674
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,378
If you are, I'll give you my carâ€¦

675
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,465
No, wait. A membership would be better.

676
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,425
-Do you play golf?
-No.

677
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,594
My father owns a country club.

678
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,889
Then you must work for your father.

679
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:42,432
No wonder.

680
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,352
What do you mean, "no wonder"?

681
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,103
That you're fit.

682
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,231
I don't think
you need to work out anymore.

683
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,985
-Really?
-Yes.

684
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,154
I don't work for my father though.

685
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,198
What do you think I do?

686
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,326
Judging by your ageâ€¦

687
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,370
You look like a model.

688
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:08,083
Are you not? Don't you get that often?

689
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:11,920
A few times in university.
I've been cast on the street a few times.

690
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,422
Anyone would've thought of the same thing.

691
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:15,799
Yes?

692
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,222
How about some warm sake with the sashimi?

693
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,890
-Sounds good.
-Or cold sake?

694
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,351
I'm okay with either,
so order what you want.

695
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,771
Okay. I'll order the most expensive one.

696
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,898
I mean you can order
a cold sakÃ© if you want.

697
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,066
Here's the drink menu.

698
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:35,193
An Umai gindaijo, please.

699
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,987
-Sure thing.
-Thank you.

700
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,328
A new employee at a big company.

701
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:46,997
No.

702
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,294
A designer.

703
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,547
-No?
-I work at a law firm.

704
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,341
-Oh, so you went to law school.
-Yes.

705
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,261
I finished my studies early,
so I went to law school early too.

706
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:06,016
I'm sure you're a talented lawyer
with a good heart.

707
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,393
You're flattering me,
but it's nice to hear.

708
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:12,689
You probably received a lot of love
and acknowledgment from your parents.

709
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,482
I guess.

710
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,192
I doubt you ever disappointed them.

711
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,320
-I did with my marriage.
-Why?

712
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:21,990
They wanted me to marry
someone a few years my junior,

713
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,825
but my wife is a year older.

714
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,661
These days,
that's considered the same age.

715
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:30,332
But I haven't been a good son
even after getting married.

716
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,791
Why's that?

717
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,004
Are you cold?
I'll ask them to turn up the heater.

718
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:38,173
No, it's fine. My hands are a bit cold.

719
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,592
I forgot my gloves.

720
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,970
-I'm clumsy, you see.
-You don't seem like the type.

721
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:47,265
-Not with my work, though.
-What do you do for a living?

722
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:50,060
No, wait. That's not important.

723
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,896
We agreed not to have children.

724
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:56,191
-My parents aren't pleased with it.
-Of course.

725
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:58,485
However, I've been leaning
toward having one.

726
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,528
After marriage,

727
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:04,157
I've been to my colleagues' children's
first birthday parties,

728
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,867
and I always find them adorable.

729
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,036
But it's not too late to have one.

730
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:10,538
My wife still doesn't want to.

731
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:11,998
Try talking her into it.

732
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,543
I haven't tried that yet

733
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,838
since I know it'll be a waste of time.
She's not one to yield.

734
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:21,841
Come in.

735
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,490
What made you fall for her?

736
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:50,245
Her playing the drums.

737
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:53,206
Female drummers are the coolest.

738
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:56,251
I've been talking too much about myself.

739
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,003
-I'm having fun.
-I want to as well.

740
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:03,341
My life's too ordinary.

741
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,219
Why aren't you married?

742
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:09,222
Wait. You're not, right?

743
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:13,852
I divorced after five years
because I couldn't get pregnant.

744
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,187
Oh.

745
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:19,232
Despite my wanting one,
I never got a child.

746
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,777
Having children is the way of nature.

747
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:24,904
Exactly.

748
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,033
Are you the oldest son?

749
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,410
No, I have an older brother.

750
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,413
That's why you get off the hook.

751
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,582
You should marry someone decent again.

752
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,751
I love my current life.

753
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,963
Marriage should be considered
with only the best person.

754
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:46,384
You should marry someone,
not because you feel the need to,

755
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,303
but because you can't break up with them

756
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,347
or live your life without them.

757
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:54,392
So no one like that
has entered your life again?

758
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,643
No.

759
00:55:56,686 --> 00:56:00,398
Gosh, please dig in.
I've been making you talk too much.

760
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,176
Wasabi.

761
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,180
Gosh.

762
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:34,891
We emptied it.

763
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,604
Did you love your ex-husband?

764
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:42,107
Why else would I have married him?

765
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,819
-We dated in university.
-Were you the same age?

766
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:46,778
Yes.

767
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:50,365
However,

768
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:54,285
I now feel like it wasn't true love.

769
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:58,414
-Why's that?
-Shouldn't love

770
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,918
be an innocent feeling
one has for another?

771
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:04,879
-That's right.
-I liked him.

772
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,382
That's true.

773
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,678
However, I came to a conclusion

774
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,597
that I didn't truly love him.

775
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,643
Did he feel the same way?

776
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:23,273
I should've taken priority,
not our potential child.

777
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:27,527
If he had truly loved me,

778
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:31,489
he wouldn't have easily
agreed to the divorce

779
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:35,743
over our infertility issue.
I know I wouldn't have.

780
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,038
One's emotions.

781
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:44,878
The heartache you have for another.
The fact that it lessensâ€¦

782
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,964
is bitter and sad.

783
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,427
I know what you mean.

784
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:56,306
While married,
love your wife with all your heart.

785
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:57,765
I should.

786
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,644
I'm going to,

787
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,146
butâ€¦

788
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,190
But what?

789
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,405
However,

790
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,704
love is relative.

791
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,873
Don't size up your love.

792
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:26,294
"Why don't you love me
as much as I love you?

793
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:28,755
Why won't you love me to the same degree?

794
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:30,882
Never be like that.

795
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,637
What should I call you?

796
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,056
Gym buddy? Ms. Song Won?

797
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,141
Consider me a sister.

798
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:43,394
I only have one older brother, you see.

799
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,730
No older sister or younger siblings.

800
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,857
-I don't want to.
-Why not?

801
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:48,983
I see you as a woman.

802
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:52,195
Please don't laugh. I'm not kidding.

803
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:54,197
But I am a woman.

804
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:57,075
I see you as a man as well.

805
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,870
Men come in different types.

806
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,415
An alpha male.

807
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,709
-An alpha male?
-Yes.

808
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,712
Damn, that feels good.

809
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,423
You're the best.

810
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:16,678
We should grab another drink. No, wait.

811
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,890
Let's decide how to address
each other first.

812
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:24,227
-Just call me by my name.
-But that'd be rude.

813
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,062
That's the purpose of our names.

814
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:30,775
"Ma'am" would be wrong.

815
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:33,611
Then call me "Song Yuan."

816
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,740
Call me Song Yuan.

817
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,867
Did you major in Chinese?

818
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,870
I'm a translator.
I mostly translate novels.

819
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:46,040
That's cool, Song Yuen.

820
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:47,709
It's "Song Yuan."

821
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,919
"Song Yuan."

822
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,589
"Song Yuan."

823
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,882
What would my name be in Chinese?

824
00:59:55,758 --> 01:00:00,555
-"Xiexian."
-"Xiexian." "Song Yuan."

825
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:01,598
That's right.

826
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:03,433
That'll be our names.

827
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:07,270
-"Xiexian."
-That's right.

828
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:11,566
-I'm jealous.
-Of what?

829
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,778
Without my parents, I'm as good as alone.

830
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:22,368
The only brother I have
moved away to Jeju Island.

831
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,455
It's just me in Seoul now,

832
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:30,585
which is why I'm jealous of those
whose parents are alive.

833
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,464
When did they pass away?

834
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:38,259
I was a junior in high school
when my dad passed away

835
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,595
and a university freshman
when my mom passed away.

836
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,557
I cried at my wedding.

837
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,732
Sorry, but I don't have a handkerchief.
Use this.

838
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,364
I'll say this again.

839
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,283
Be good to your parents

840
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,327
while they're still alive.

841
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:07,288
Okay. I'll keep that in mind.

842
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:14,128
We should get going now.
The plates and glasses are all empty.

843
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,547
No, wait a second.

844
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:19,092
So you'll work out in the evenings
starting tomorrow?

845
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,385
Yes.

846
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,054
I should too. Which time slot?

847
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:25,431
The 8 p.m. session.

848
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:28,267
I'm going to go to bed
right after I'm done.

849
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,693
No, let me.

850
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:38,111
Raise your arm.

851
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:39,237
Thank you.

852
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:42,782
You sound like a native Chinese woman.

853
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,159
Nonsense.

854
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:48,663
-What's "young lady" in Chinese?
-"Guniang."

855
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,540
"Guniang."

856
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:52,583
That sounds interesting.

857
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,670
I enjoyed today's dinner.

858
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:59,841
The bill must've been steep
especially with that expensive sake.

859
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:02,552
Not at all. It was all worth it.

860
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:07,265
How should I put this?
The food was delicious, of course,

861
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:09,058
but I also enjoyed your company.

862
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:14,105
-We seemed to click.
-Exactly. I lost track of time.

863
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,775
You should call a designated driver.

864
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:21,529
I was going to walk a bit to sober up.

865
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:23,865
-Let me take you home.
-It's all right.

866
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:27,076
I'm going to walk for some exercise.

867
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:31,330
-Let me be your escort.
-But it's cold.

868
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,917
You see, Song Yuanâ€¦

869
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:39,964
If I reek of alcohol,
I'll be banished to the couch.

870
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,008
This is

871
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:44,927
how Lawyer Pan Sa-hyeon lives.

872
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,767
I was never like that.

873
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:53,519
My wife is mean, isn't she?

874
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:57,023
Why would she make her pretty husband
sleep on the couch?

875
01:02:57,106 --> 01:03:00,151
That's hardly how my wife sees me.

876
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,821
-I doubt it.
-It's true!

877
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:07,408
She couldn't seem
more feminine on the outside,

878
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:10,745
but boyishness runs in her DNA.

879
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:11,996
I feel tricked.

880
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,709
How long have you been married?

881
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:21,339
A little over two years,
so we're in our third year of marriage.

882
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:25,259
Then you should work hard
on your relationship

883
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,553
and keep building affection
for one another.

884
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:32,183
It takes two hands to clap, you know.

885
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:35,353
I'm always the only one
trying to make her laugh and flatter her.

886
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:37,313
Honestly, it's getting annoying.

887
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:40,358
But you're the man.

888
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:43,194
Be generous and be more understanding.

889
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:46,906
Men get upset too, you know.

890
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:50,952
If I show her this much effort,

891
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:53,830
shouldn't I get
at least this much in return?

892
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:56,374
Of course.

893
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,126
What about her upsets you the most?

894
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:01,212
Don't walk with your hands
in your pockets.

895
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:03,130
You'll break your arm if you trip.

896
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,388
Bye. Thanks.

897
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:13,766
-Hello.
-Hi.

898
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,351
-This.
-That'll be 10,000 won.

899
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:17,645
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

900
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:24,819
Put these on.

901
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,946
-How much were they?
-It's my gift.

902
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,115
No way.

903
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:33,578
You spent too much money today.
I can't put you out like this.

904
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:36,539
Then buy me something in return.

905
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:39,417
Gosh, my neck's freezing.

906
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,253
You'll catch a cold if your neck is bare.

907
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:49,093
-This.
-No.

908
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,846
This will suit you better.

909
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:55,391
-I'll take this, sir.
-That'll be 20,000 won.

910
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,853
-I'll take it as it is.
-Okay.

911
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:01,355
-Here. Thank you.
-Thank you.

912
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,524
-Take care.
-Thank you.

913
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:06,777
Here.

914
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:14,327
Put it on me.

915
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,446
That's warm.

916
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:55,701
Not only is my neck warm,
but my heart is too.

917
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,162
Stay in place just like that.

918
01:05:58,245 --> 01:06:00,706
-What are you going to do?
-I'm going to disappear.

919
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,751
I haven't had

920
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:07,838
such a good time in a while.

921
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:12,885
My hands are warm too.

922
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:16,472
Thank you.

923
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:20,768
How do I look right now,

924
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:24,522
standing here?

925
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:28,275
Like Daddy-Long-Legs.

926
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:30,778
I mean,

927
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:32,655
an oppa.

928
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,631
Please forget it.

929
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,551
-Forget what happened tonight.
-I don't want to.

930
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:37,511
-What's this?
-What's what?

931
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:40,598
Your performance was impressive.
Seo Dong-ma.

932
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:43,184
-Are you the secretary?
-I'm Seo Dong-ma.

933
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:48,105
"Will marriage make me happy?"

934
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,440
So how is it?

935
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:53,319
I'm so happy to be living
with you and your dad.

936
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:54,653
I'm glad I got married.

937
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,197
Hello? Mi?

938
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,907
-I'm back in Korea.
-I'll be right there.

939
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:58,866
No, you can't.

940
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:00,993
-You're sending Dongmi to kindergarten?
-Yes.

941
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,411
A kindergarten for dogs.

942
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,746
Puppies,

943
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:06,248
when your new friend hops on, don't bark.

944
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:07,541
Say, "Welcome!"

945
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:10,628
-Ji-a!
-My parents-in-law are over there.

946
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:12,546
This is the writer of my radio program.

947
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:15,424
-And this is her husband.
-I'm Park Hae-ryun.

948
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:21,263
