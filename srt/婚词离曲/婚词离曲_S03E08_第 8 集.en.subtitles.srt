EPISODE 8

2
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,983
-Hey.
-Hello.

3
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,152
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.

4
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,279
I forgot I had plans today.
It's work-related.

5
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,616
This sikhye isn't sweet.

6
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,076
Maybe tomorrow or next time.

7
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,411
Good night.

8
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,492
What a good boy.

9
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,798
He should behave well

10
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,550
since his mom isn't here.

11
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,177
Sa-hyeon should marry a goodhearted woman.

12
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,222
I wonder when that'll be.

13
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,058
He won't have
much good luck in his lifetime.

14
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,685
-Sa-hyeon?
-Yes.

15
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,605
I went to a few fortune tellers.

16
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,900
They must have all been lousy.

17
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,530
Goodness. I told you to put it on vibrate.

18
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,331
You didn't even call.

19
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,922
You look prettier and younger.

20
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,092
Is Ji-a already asleep?

21
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,469
-She's washing her hair.
-I see.

22
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,640
Do you want some fruit?

23
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,975
I already had some.

24
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,567
This is an anti-aging cream.

25
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:17,572
Goodness. These are expensive,
and you bought two of them?

26
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,656
You should take one.

27
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,241
I bought some for myself too.

28
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,243
Don't forget to put some on your neck too.

29
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,078
I even put some on my heels.

30
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:27,624
This is a watch for Ji-a.

31
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,834
What if she loses it?

32
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,211
You should have bought a cheaper one.

33
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,297
It was cheap enough for me.

34
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,924
-Aren't you tired?
-Why should I be?

35
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,927
You've truly become prettier.

36
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,804
Did something good happen?

37
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,807
I got a lot of rest today.

38
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,602
Did you have lots of good food?

39
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,814
Yes. Singapore had
so many delicious dishes.

40
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,150
Let's go with Ji-a during the holiday.

41
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,652
She needs to prepare for middle school.

42
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,738
Does she have them yet?

43
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,823
Breasts.

44
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,952
Just a bit.

45
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,293
I should get going.

46
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,046
What about Ji-a?

47
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,799
You said she's washing her hair.
I can see her next time.

48
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,968
Don't see me out.

49
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:21,761
Okay.

50
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,972
Did you drive here?

51
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,307
-Of course.
-But it's late at night.

52
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,893
Don't worry. I'm the best driver.

53
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,121
Didn't you miss me?

54
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,831
I knew you'd be okay.

55
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,843
Yes?

56
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,261
Is A Mi with you?

57
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,930
I just came home.

58
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,265
Let me speak to her.

59
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,267
One minute.

60
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,148
-Is something wrong?
-Your mother's back.

61
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,485
For you.

62
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,987
-Who is it?
-It's Pi-young.

63
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,285
-Hello?
-Your phone was off.

64
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,121
I ran out of battery. What did Ji-a say?

65
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,372
What about Ji-a?

66
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,666
Didn't she tell you that we met?

67
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,294
Ji-a saw you?

68
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,006
Yes. At the bookstore.
Did she not say anything?

69
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,592
-No.
-Gosh.

70
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,178
Were you there with Yu-sin?

71
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,304
Yes.

72
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,766
Isn't that why you called?

73
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,061
I called you as soon as Ji-a left,
but you didn't pick up.

74
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,645
Tell me in detail.

75
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,278
She asked if I was living
with her dad, so I said yes.

76
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,865
Then she said she wished him a good life.

77
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:08,993
She said that?

78
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,244
Yes.

79
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,334
-What did he say?
-He just heard about this.

80
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:21,172
She's just like you. She was very calm.

81
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,675
Unlike her age,
she seems pretty mature too.

82
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,012
I called you

83
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,015
because Mother seemed a bit odd.
Did you not notice?

84
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,767
-She's back?
-Didn't you know?

85
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,143
I just came home.

86
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,728
She just left my house.

87
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,730
She felt odd to me.

88
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,018
Did Ji-a really say that?

89
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,480
How did she look?

90
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,090
A new flower shop opened downstairs.

91
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,259
Are these for me?

92
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:51,179
Of course.
Did you think they were for him?

93
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,097
Why didn't you call?

94
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,934
I didn't want you
to worry about what to cook.

95
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,437
Didn't I gain weight?

96
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,773
No. You look the same.

97
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,359
I gained 3.5kg.

98
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,404
-Did you already have dinner?
-I had some fruit.

99
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,920
Cook her some kimchi fried rice.
It's easy to digest.

100
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,257
Here.

101
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,927
I hope you like this scarf.

102
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,678
Here.

103
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,459
I miss you.

104
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,757
I miss you.

105
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,473
I'm home.

106
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,559
You startled me.

107
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,769
When did you get here?

108
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,020
Just now.

109
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,110
Did you drink?

110
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,444
No.

111
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,913
-Did you and Dad decorate the tree?
-Yes.

112
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,457
"A Mi" was it?

113
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,210
Song Yuan's friend came by
to see Jeong-bin and helped out.

114
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,678
-What did she say about him?
-That he's adorable.

115
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,561
Mom.

116
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:08,107
Do you know what Song Yuan said
during her contractions?

117
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,736
She told me to be good to you…

118
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,532
because childbirth is painful.

119
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,626
We should have had our wedding.

120
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,793
I agree.

121
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:52,360
Did you call Grandma and thank her?

122
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,653
Yes.

123
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,594
Ji-a.

124
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,097
Don't you have anything to say?

125
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,891
I heard you met A Mi today.

126
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,893
-You too?
-What do you mean?

127
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,645
"A Mi"?

128
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:33,275
I only addressed her that way
since she's much older than you.

129
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,740
WHEN ISRAEL WAS RULED BY OTHER NATIONS…

130
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,450
Do you understand the book?

131
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,620
I'm just reading it.
I understand some parts though.

132
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,756
You'll see Dad again, right?

133
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,674
I don't know.

134
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,010
I don't want to think
of anything right now.

135
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,605
Hey.

136
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,152
I'm sorry to call you so late
on your day off.

137
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,028
One more glass, please.

138
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,488
Okay.

139
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,374
Is something wrong?

140
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,720
Did you hear?

141
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,347
My ex-wife is getting married.

142
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,183
Already? With whom?

143
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,350
Exactly.

144
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,895
She won't say.

145
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,440
-Are you sure?
-She told me herself today.

146
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,110
When is your wedding?

147
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,905
It's over.

148
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,531
You broke up?

149
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,284
Yes. She went back to her ex-boyfriend.

150
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,372
It was like a midsummer night's dream.

151
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:16,086
-Are you getting married?
-Well, I never wanted a divorce.

152
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,339
I guess I should remarry.

153
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,592
I'm worried
she's getting married to some gigolo.

154
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,969
She's a very naive woman.

155
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,430
She's eager to trust others.

156
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,934
If she loses her house…

157
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,477
I doubt she's met someone like that.

158
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,771
Or maybe he's a wealthy old man.

159
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,732
I can't believe it.

160
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,485
-Don't you see her from time to time?
-Yes.

161
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,153
Can you look into it?

162
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,614
If I confront him myself,

163
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,908
Si-eun will hear about it right away.

164
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,953
The wedding is next month.

165
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,958
The pain is unbearable.
I feel sorry for our kids too.

166
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,752
I was the root of all this misery.

167
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,839
-There's no point in regretting.
-I'm in the same boat.

168
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,133
I don't think
Ji-a will want to see me ever again.

169
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,719
She won't?

170
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,013
Will you be inviting
about 50 of your relatives?

171
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,516
-I think 50 will be enough.
-Invite more if you want.

172
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,893
And your kids?
Are any of their friends coming?

173
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,229
Maybe a few of Hyang-gi's friends.

174
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,824
Hello?

175
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,829
-I'll call you back.
-Okay.

176
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,420
What brings you here?

177
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,462
Sit down.

178
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,852
I can see that you've aged.

179
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,314
Your stepmom told me

180
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,608
that you were getting married.
Is that true?

181
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,525
Yes.

182
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,860
Who is the woman?

183
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,698
Your parents are still alive and well.
You should have a wedding.

184
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,658
We'll attend.

185
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,330
-Okay?
-I'll take care of it.

186
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,789
When will you stop sulking?

187
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,249
You're not a kid.

188
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,501
You'll be 60 in no time.

189
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,588
Does it look like I'm sulking?

190
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,590
Don't nitpick.

191
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,509
-We haven't seen each other in years.
-I grew up alone anyway.

192
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,511
So it'll be a small wedding.

193
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,722
Won't her parents attend the wedding?

194
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,265
They passed away.

195
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,309
-Both of them?
-Yes.

196
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,310
How old were they?

197
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:38,854
How old is she?

198
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,314
Why do you want to know?

199
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,649
Why wouldn't I?

200
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,193
You're just like your mom.

201
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,279
Then you can live happily
with the son who takes after you.

202
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:48,864
Dong-min.

203
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,617
I changed my name ages ago.

204
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,744
I hope you let go of your grudges.

205
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:58,916
Death will come knocking
sooner than later for the both of us.

206
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,336
Whether you like it or not,
we're still father and son.

207
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,547
You'll understand me
once you have kids of your own.

208
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,884
Why can't it be the other way around?

209
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,720
Some things in life can't be helped.

210
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,391
I see. Then just consider this
as something that can't be helped too.

211
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,435
You'll regret it.

212
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,896
Didn't you say some things
just can't be helped?

213
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,816
What's her occupation?

214
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,360
Whatever it may be,
you won't be satisfied with her.

215
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,736
Given your age,

216
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,074
I don't expect her
to be a top-notch daughter-in-law.

217
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,742
Is she from a poor family?

218
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,331
I could've looked into her if I wanted to,
but I chose to ask you instead.

219
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,168
We're the same age.

220
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,838
Is that the best you can do?

221
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,049
She also has a daughter and a son.

222
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,885
We're colleagues.

223
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,887
Is she a widow? A divorcée?

224
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,348
My mom was a divorcée
when she passed away.

225
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,270
Now that you've heard my answer,
you should leave.

226
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,480
And don't barge in here ever again.

227
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:05,983
This can't be.

228
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,862
No.

229
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,990
You're healthy enough.
Don't you want kids of your own?

230
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:16,577
Watching you, I learned that
having your own kids didn't matter.

231
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,539
That's more the reason
why you should do better.

232
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,584
I've fulfilled
my responsibilities as your dad.

233
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,668
We just lived apart.

234
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,795
-We're done here.
-No, we're not.

235
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,672
Why her of all women?

236
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,965
She's a decent woman.

237
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,842
She's a great mother who is hardworking

238
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,802
and has a good heart as well.

239
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,181
I can't hold a candle to her
in any aspect.

240
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,807
You're head over heels for her.

241
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,810
You're getting married
just to become a stepdad?

242
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,312
You could do better than that.

243
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,898
How well do you know me?

244
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,441
-Pretty well.
-If you did,

245
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,194
you wouldn't have barged in here.
At least I wouldn't have.

246
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,904
How would you feel if your son

247
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,740
married a divorcée
with two kids at the age of 50?

248
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,534
It's still better than
watching my mom get abandoned.

249
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,037
I was even there
when you married the young woman.

250
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,456
You should leave.

251
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,042
I don't want to bring up the past

252
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,002
or be reminded of it.

253
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,796
I'm speechless.

254
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,948
Let's stop by a restaurant on our way.
Skip breakfast if you can.

255
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,492
-Okay. I'll call you when I'm on my way.
-Okay.

256
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,869
-Are you lying down?
-I'm about to. I'm on my bed.

257
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,496
-Good night.
-You too.

258
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,456
Don't watch movies all night.

259
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,749
I won't.

260
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,751
Bye.

261
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,515
Attention, please.

262
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,185
Korean Air 020…

263
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,024
-Are you all packed?
-Yes.

264
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,069
Don't talk about Dad visiting.
Let's have a nice ride there.

265
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,655
Of course. I'm not dense.

266
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,949
-Let's go.
-Coming.

267
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,493
You should call Dad.

268
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,579
Or even just a text.

269
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,998
He'll be fine. Mom was fine, right?

270
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,750
And he's a man.

271
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,882
-Let me know if you're sleepy.
-I'm not.

272
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,468
-Why didn't you learn to snowboard?
-I didn't want to get hurt.

273
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,347
-Does he look like a snowboarder?
-Yes.

274
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,641
I heard you fall hundreds of times.

275
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,975
So they say.

276
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,187
-U-ram, are you hungry?
-How did you know?

277
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,438
Your face says it all.

278
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,399
Let's have some delicious barbecue
when we arrive.

279
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,735
-Okay.
-Does meat always taste good?

280
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,195
You know it.

281
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,952
U-ram's mom called just a while ago.

282
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,745
She invited you to Yongpyong Resort.

283
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,998
You'll be too busy
once you go to middle school.

284
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,921
Should we go to Hanguk World tomorrow?

285
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,839
We agreed to visit the aquarium.

286
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,342
It'll be teeming with people
since it's Christmas Eve.

287
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,251
How could Dad do this to us?

288
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,840
You and I were so happy. Was he not?

289
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,133
That's not the problem.

290
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,801
-Then?
-You'll understand when you grow up.

291
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,094
I don't want to.

292
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,899
I'm dumbfounded
every time I think about it.

293
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,279
That must be why
you suddenly stopped talking, right?

294
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,238
That's not true.

295
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,614
Don't lie.

296
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,089
I just suddenly got emotional.

297
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,759
This is the very first hardship
you must face.

298
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:28,346
You'll encounter
more unbelievable events in your life

299
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,432
until the day you die.

300
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,808
It's inevitable.

301
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,312
I said there are those who break down

302
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,647
and those who overcome them.

303
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,817
If you think about it,
it may not be that big of a deal.

304
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:45,405
But for the weak,
their entire world may be falling apart.

305
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,535
-Is your world falling apart?
-No.

306
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,164
All I need is you.

307
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,749
And you have me.

308
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,000
Thank you.

309
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,504
Every time I look at you,

310
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,255
I'm glad I married your dad.

311
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,592
Thanks to him, I have you by my side.

312
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,512
You win some, you lose some.

313
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:11,389
It goes both ways.

314
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,351
That's the way life works.

315
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,646
Don't worry.

316
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,232
Your dad was a great dad
who made one mistake.

317
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:24,486
Should we resent, hurt, and punish him

318
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,029
for that one mistake?

319
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,534
Only small-minded people believe in

320
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:34,037
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."

321
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,040
Those with a big heart
just accept things for what they are.

322
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,002
In that sense,
I don't have that big of a heart.

323
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,755
-I admit it.
-Then how big is it?

324
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,715
It's bigger than a small dish.

325
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,635
-A jubal?
-What is that?

326
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,263
They're rice bowls
people used in the past.

327
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:54,099
Your heart is as big as a washbowl.

328
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,770
Is it true that A Mi calls you
by your first name?

329
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,605
-I didn't tell her to.
-Didn't you tell her off?

330
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:02,732
-No.
-Why?

331
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,444
Well, a part of me felt bad for her.

332
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,779
Why?

333
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:11,324
Falling in love with someone
isn't something you can control.

334
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,201
You can't help it.

335
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,911
Still, it was wrong of her.

336
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,080
That's how it's depicted on TV.

337
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,291
It's fine as long as we don't do that.

338
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,126
Always stay true to yourself.

339
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,838
We can never be sure
of what'll happen in the future.

340
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,632
Doing so will only prove our arrogance.

341
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,050
Just remember this.

342
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,847
Let's spend
a lovely Christmas Eve tomorrow.

343
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,807
We should buy a cake in the morning.

344
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,976
Sleep in. I'll go by myself.

345
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,020
How can I miss out on that
on Christmas Eve?

346
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,150
I'll pick it up at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

347
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,151
Okay.

348
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:50,113
I'd like to have that right now.
And a cup of rooibos tea.

349
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,239
Okay.

350
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,887
SHE'S SO ANNOYING

351
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,366
Did you take my photo?

352
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,662
-Let me see.
-What? My phone?

353
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,038
Where are your manners?

354
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,831
You suddenly want to see my phone.

355
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,250
-You took my photo.
-I didn't.

356
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,459
Yes, you did.

357
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,128
Why? As if I'd want to.

358
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,047
Because you're so amazing?

359
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,135
Just have your dessert and go.

360
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,017
Please call the police. She's a thief.

361
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:02,811
What if I didn't take one?

362
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,354
-What if you did?
-Up yours.

363
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,647
What a foul mouth you have.

364
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,276
Okay, Ms. Boo Hye-ryung.

365
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,320
Check if I took a photo of you or not.

366
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,459
Apologize.

367
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,338
-Sorry.
-That's it?

368
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,007
You accused me of being a thief,

369
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,175
that I stole a photograph of you.

370
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,885
Then you snatched my phone.

371
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,804
What gives you the right?

372
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,447
See you tomorrow.

373
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,032
Sure.

374
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,501
What's wrong?

375
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,755
Nothing. I was just thinking
about something.

376
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,382
You came all the way here for this?

377
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,176
Christmas and cake go hand in hand.

378
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,678
Ta-da.

379
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,305
I can't finish that.

380
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,681
Cut it up and freeze them.

381
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,017
-This place is expensive.
-I didn't buy it.

382
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,977
Boo Hye-ryung did.

383
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,439
Hey, Hye-ryung.

384
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,690
Are you busy?

385
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:35,487
-No. I'm home.
-A few days ago,

386
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,740
you were talking
with a young woman at the lounge.

387
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,077
The day you wore your Parapa.

388
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,661
Right.

389
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,579
Who was she?

390
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,999
-Why do you ask?
-I saw her at a cake shop yesterday.

391
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,751
Did she see you too?

392
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,336
There was an incident.

393
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,171
Did she not call you?

394
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,214
No.

395
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,675
It's a long story. Let's talk in person.

396
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,885
Okay.

397
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,018
INCOMING CALL
SHIN YU-SIN

398
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,734
-Yes?
-Is Ji-a there?

399
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,862
-No.
-Does she not want to see me?

400
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,074
I'm in front of your apartment.

401
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,077
Did you go to get it yourself?

402
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,413
No, A Mi did.
She got it from someone yesterday.

403
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:30,917
She's upstairs.

404
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,294
Her close friend moved here.

405
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:35,880
Do you want a piece?

406
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,465
No.

407
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,468
Why do you look unwell? Did it bother you?

408
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,097
-How could I sleep?
-I talked to her.

409
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,725
She was bound to find out.

410
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,934
Is she mad with me?

411
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,519
I said I talked to her.

412
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,397
Thanks.

413
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,483
No one is better than you in all aspects.

414
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,988
Don't you think your mother is a bit odd?

415
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,407
She must have decided
to get along with A Mi.

416
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,243
Arguing with each other
will do neither of them any good.

417
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,287
It doesn't look good for her.

418
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,789
She was a bit…

419
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,124
Is Si-eun getting married?

420
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:13,918
Who told you?

421
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,379
Professor Park. We met last night.

422
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,048
What did he say?

423
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,759
He's miserable.

424
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:21,843
Now?

425
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,262
So he can get married but not his ex-wife?

426
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,222
-What's his occupation?
-Why do you ask?

427
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,850
Professor Park was worried
that he's some gigolo.

428
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,228
-Tell him not to worry.
-Did you see him, honey?

429
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,982
Don't call me that.
That's no way to treat A Mi.

430
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,570
Professor Park can't hold a candle to him,

431
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,947
so tell him
all he needs to do is congratulate her.

432
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,449
He must be divorced.

433
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,160
-With kids.
-He's never been married.

434
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,286
A bachelor?

435
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,455
It's Mr. Seo.

436
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,499
The engineer?

437
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,878
Does he really love her?

438
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,005
They suit each other.

439
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,840
Why would he? He's from a rich family.

440
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,217
How did you know?

441
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,471
-I heard.
-From whom?

442
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,265
Did you do a background check?

443
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,767
-No.
-You did.

444
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,101
I was completely mistaken.

445
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,354
I'm sorry.

446
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,735
The meat here is
so much better than in Seoul.

447
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,029
-I feel this way every time.
-I agree.

448
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,365
Eat up.

449
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,160
You should eat too.

450
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,329
I prefer their doenjang soup more.

451
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:16,082
You guys should eat. I'm pretty full.

452
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,292
Do you grill meat better than me?

453
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,922
-Yes.
-Excuse me.

454
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,383
-Yes?
-Four servings of prime ribs, please.

455
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,718
Gosh. That's too much.

456
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,054
-Can you eat more?
-Of course.

457
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,896
Your brother is getting married

458
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,648
to a divorcée with two kids.

459
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,109
They're the same age.
They'll turn 51 next year.

460
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,778
Were you aware of this?

461
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,947
-Yes.
-He ignored you too?

462
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,327
-Didn't you dissuade him?
-He never listens to me anyway.

463
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:56,623
-Think of something. You're smart.
-There's nothing we can do.

464
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,207
I can't just sit and watch as his dad.

465
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,753
You're not going to live his life.

466
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,588
This is his concern.

467
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,923
He's my son.

468
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,886
Give her money. Do anything you can.

469
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,013
You know Ban. It'll worsen things.

470
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,143
I'm too dumbfounded and speechless.

471
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,982
I love this fresh air.

472
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,609
Let's stay here the entire week.

473
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,860
I have a part-time job.

474
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,404
You should quit that job
and focus on studying.

475
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,156
-She took the semester off.
-Why?

476
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,116
I want to learn about the real world.

477
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,203
I want to get a better idea
and prepare for it myself.

478
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,456
Hey, U-ram.

479
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,042
Hey! Calm down!

480
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,799
-Oh, no!
-Take this!

481
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,180
Take this!

482
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,223
Gosh!

483
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,747
He didn't call or text yesterday.

484
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,189
Maybe he fell for a blonde in Germany.

485
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,193
Who cares if he changed
or fell for someone else?

486
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,373
Hello, this is Secretary Yoo.
I work for Executive Director Seo.

487
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,250
I left your Christmas present

488
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,003
in front of your door
as he instructed. Goodbye, ma'am.

489
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,353
What's going on? When did you return?

490
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,688
Yesterday.

491
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:27,899
Get rid of that mustache.

492
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,367
Did you miss me?

493
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,787
I won't let you go until you reply.

494
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,082
I did.

495
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,544
Is Ji-a home?

496
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,381
Let's get in my car.

497
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,593
No.

498
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,057
I thought you'd come back next year.

499
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,059
I rushed things
to spend Christmas Eve with you.

500
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,314
The neighbors will see us.

501
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,566
Your gifts.

502
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,906
Take them inside.
You'll catch a cold out here.

503
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:22,954
I like this look better.

504
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,665
Ji-a will wake up soon.

505
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,041
I'll text you.

506
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,378
There are so many.

507
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,046
What are those?

508
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,756
Are they from Dad?

509
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,091
No.

510
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,719
A friend of mine
returned from a business trip abroad.

511
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,723
This must be yours.

512
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,355
Is this German?

513
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,358
-Yes.
-They must've been to Germany.

514
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:35,985
Yes.

515
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,280
They have great taste in gifts.
Is it a man or a woman?

516
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,532
Guess.

517
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,493
I doubt a woman carried all of these here.

518
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,912
Their secretary carried them.

519
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,664
Let's hurry and open them.

520
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,954
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

521
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,914
Scissors, scissors, rock.

522
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,082
Rock, rock, paper.

523
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,336
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

524
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,629
Paper, paper, scissors.

525
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,840
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

526
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,175
Paper, paper, rock.

527
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,427
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

528
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,304
They sound like brothers playing.

529
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,681
-I won!
-Call them out.

530
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,475
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

531
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,352
-Come and eat.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

532
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:52,812
Rock, rock, scissors.

533
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:53,980
Paper, paper, rock.

534
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:55,690
Scissors, scissors, paper.

535
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:58,985
Breakfast is ready.

536
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:05,283
There's rice too,
but we had rice for dinner yesterday.

537
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,994
-I like it.
-I must have been a White in my past life.

538
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,954
Everyone likes them except the elderly.

539
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,374
-Sit down.
-Okay.

540
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,921
Thank you for cooking. I'll do the dishes.

541
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:22,174
Don't thank me. Hyang-gi helped out too.

542
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,718
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you.

543
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,681
-We don't have a toaster, right?
-No.

544
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,474
We used a frying pan. Not bad, right?

545
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,684
Not bad.

546
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,562
My mom is a super chef.

547
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,397
That's a tacky expression.

548
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,940
I toasted the bread.

549
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,317
Okay.

550
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,651
Goodbye, Grandma.

551
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,496
What are you doing?

552
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,333
You need to take
better care of yourself with age.

553
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,834
You're already so beautiful.

554
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,669
But it's great to see you like this.

555
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,385
Mom.

556
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:09,555
Grandma wanted to go to Hongcheon Resort,

557
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,974
so I said okay.

558
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,809
Just you two? Or everyone?

559
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,645
Everyone.

560
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,981
Really?

561
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,193
If you're not up for it,
don't force yourself.

562
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,154
Grandma Mo passed away
when we least expected it.

563
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:29,325
So I'm afraid I'll regret not going.

564
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,952
That's true.

565
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,913
I regretted things too.

566
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,123
She wants to spend Christmas there.

567
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,919
Keep an eye on her,
but don't let her notice it.

568
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,921
-Why?
-Yesterday…

569
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,839
she seemed a bit odd.

570
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:45,716
Dementia?

571
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,595
I'm not sure. Anyway, keep an eye on her.

572
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,225
Sit down, A Mi.

573
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,359
Pack your ski suit.

574
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,360
Right now?

575
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:07,321
Yes. And tell Yu-sin to hurry home.

576
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,949
We're going to Hongcheon with Ji-a.

577
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,284
-With Ji-a?
-Yes.

578
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,203
-She said yes?
-Yes.

579
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:17,289
-Pi-young too?
-Come on. I know better than that.

580
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,458
She can't be there.

581
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,628
This isn't the Joseon Dynasty.
Why would an ex-wife be there?

582
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:27,174
I just can't believe it.
Ji-a is willing to come without her mom.

583
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,717
I told her it was my wish.

584
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,429
Hope you guys get along.

585
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,346
You're the best.

586
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,639
I did good, right?

587
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,307
Thank you.

588
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:41,105
She's definitely
not the person she used to be.

589
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,692
Maybe she'll die soon.

590
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,318
Maybe Father is waiting for her.

591
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,987
I'll be there by 5 p.m.

592
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:49,989
Okay.

593
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,616
Can you introduce me
to Ji-a as your friend?

594
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:55,828
OKAY

595
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,706
"Okay"?

596
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,501
Correct. It must have been a pain
to buy all those gifts.

597
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,629
I know how busy you are.
You bought so many of them.

598
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,840
Not at all. I had fun.

599
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,469
I loved all of them.

600
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,305
I'm glad.

601
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,224
-Are you home?
-Yes.

602
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,517
Let's video call.

603
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,273
No.

604
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:27,526
Why not? I even saw
your pretty, bare face this morning.

605
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,028
Still, no.

606
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:31,071
Why not? You're hurting my feelings.

607
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,701
I'll tell you later why I can't.

608
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,370
Are you…

609
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,422
Not at all.

610
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,882
Then prove it.

611
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,095
I'm right, aren't I?

612
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,247
Breathtaking.

613
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:23,958
HAHAHA

614
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,668
Why are you doing this to me?

615
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,504
What? What do you mean?

616
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,548
I might get a heart attack.

617
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,925
I want to live a long life with someone

618
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:34,969
and have a happy marriage.

619
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,312
Are you all packed?

620
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,607
-Do you need my help?
-Just with the skis.

621
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,654
I don't know if this is right.

622
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,115
Maybe it's because I'm an only child,

623
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,493
but I don't hate A Mi.

624
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,037
But then again, she treats me well.

625
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,582
Did you not fight when you first met?

626
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:05,791
What for?

627
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,712
Cursing and arguing with each other
wouldn't change anything.

628
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,880
They say heaven would be thrown in chaos.

629
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,507
Because an angel went missing?

630
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,675
Yes.

631
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,469
Would I be able
to be like you when I grow up?

632
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,473
You shouldn't go through
something like that.

633
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,725
And many people don't.

634
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:27,021
But then again,
you could face other hardships.

635
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:28,772
Such as?

636
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:34,069
Maybe your husband
won't make a lot of money.

637
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,155
Maybe your in-laws will be difficult.

638
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:40,618
Or your children may fall ill
or break your heart.

639
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,537
In any case,
you're bound to face hardships.

640
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,541
But don't worry too much.

641
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:51,211
It's foolish to worry about something

642
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,838
that hasn't even happened yet.

643
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,300
A Mi told me to call her anytime

644
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,677
if I got sick.

645
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,512
She said she'd take care of me

646
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:01,847
forever.

647
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,391
Really? They're just empty words.

648
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,559
I can tell

649
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,687
if someone's lying or being genuine.

650
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:13,484
Making one big mistake
doesn't mean they are evil.

651
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,736
Though sometimes, they are.

652
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,032
Don't treat her so coldly.

653
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,369
Thanks for getting along well
with the kids.

654
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:27,247
I should be thankful. They're the ones
trying hard to get along with me.

655
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,333
They weren't forcing themselves.

656
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,834
You could tell by their faces.

657
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,130
Does U-ram like saunas?

658
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:38,008
He does. Let's go in the evening.

659
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,807
Ji-a!

660
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,609
Hi, Pi-young.

661
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,279
-Don't let her get hurt.
-Okay. Don't worry.

662
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,035
Ji-a!

663
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,037
My little puppy!

664
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,710
Don't be alone.
Spend Christmas with your friends.

665
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,212
Okay.

666
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,780
-Are you not thirsty?
-No.

667
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,824
Me neither, but I need to go number one.

668
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,619
-What?
-Ten minutes until a rest stop.

669
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:49,788
-No reason.
-Because of what I said?

670
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,707
-It's better than saying "pee".
-Right.

671
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,542
You're so adorable, Mother.

672
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,586
Did I sound silly?
Or was that a compliment?

673
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:56,837
The latter, of course.

674
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,630
Thank you.

675
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,801
Or maybe she's become slyer.

676
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:06,221
UGLY TWISTED DONUT

677
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,306
Hello.

678
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,268
A box of twisted donuts
and a box of regular ones.

679
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,728
They'll be ready soon.

680
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:13,896
Okay.

681
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,940
Do you like snacks like these?

682
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,817
I'm just like everyone else.

683
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,111
We'll take a few of everything.

684
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,503
UGLY TWISTED DONUT

685
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,883
This is on the house.
Have it while it's hot.

686
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,092
Thank you.

687
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:14,706
-Hello?
-I'm here.

688
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,749
Should I go up?

689
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:16,833
It's okay.

690
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:19,461
First floor.

691
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,449
Where is Ji-a?

692
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,826
She didn't want to come.

693
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:05,966
-She's out skiing.
-With whom?

694
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:09,303
Her grandma, dad, and his girlfriend.

695
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,020
Your car changes every time.

696
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,272
This one's a first.

697
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,231
Care to drive?

698
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,232
Sure.

699
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,823
I was just kidding.

700
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,296
You're a terrific driver.

701
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:47,549
It's very responsive. It feels sturdy too.

702
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,345
I'll never joke with you.

703
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,804
I'll always be genuine.

704
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:57,351
Did you tell Ji-a about me yet?

705
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,228
-No.
-It's been a month already.

706
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:04,274
But we've only met each other
three times so far.

707
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,317
Four.

708
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:08,779
The clinic may not count,
but the golf course should.

709
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:11,323
How long we've known
each other doesn't matter.

710
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,492
Then what does?

711
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,869
Our feelings.

712
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:19,081
I felt pretty indifferent
when we first met.

713
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,541
-Even now?
-Well, as of now…

714
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,294
Ji-a loves the teddy bear.

715
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,089
I was excited

716
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,676
to see you two wearing
matching hats and scarves.

717
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,719
Should I go back and wear mine?

718
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,430
I was excited to see Ji-a.

719
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:39,309
Which ski resort?

720
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,353
You'll want to go there too.

721
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,646
Why not?

722
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:53,031
Who is this lady with such a sexy leg?

723
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,410
It was truly breathtaking.

724
00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:00,997
You're embarrassing me.
Stop looking at it.

725
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,082
That's what it's for.

726
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,042
Because you're picturing me nude.

727
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,001
You were.

728
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,754
I was underwater and covered in bubbles.

729
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,339
I wasn't just completely bare.

730
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,593
My imagination is running wild.

731
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,096
Do you want me to get the wrong idea?

732
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:17,764
Peeping Tom.

733
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,643
Don't you forget.
I'm still young and hot-blooded.

734
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:22,978
Don't you forget.

735
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,856
-I'm not into such passionate men.
-Okay.

736
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,317
Can I drink tonight?

737
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,569
Sure.

738
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,447
I'll drop you off at home safe and sound.

739
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,532
UGLY TWISTED DONUT

740
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,243
What are these?

741
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:39,828
Twisted donuts.

742
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,622
The ones with glutinous rice?

743
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,583
Yes.

744
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,863
Sa-hyeon got them.

745
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,072
I'm home.

746
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:19,659
-Hey. Did you stop by the shop?
-Yes.

747
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,286
He's sleeping after drinking milk.

748
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:24,372
It's not milk. It's baby formula.

749
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,084
Does this one have beans?

750
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:36,635
It's delicious.

751
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,094
Your kids are the best.

752
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,320
Have some.

753
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,531
They gave me one while I was there.

754
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:58,865
That's not enough.

755
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,325
Don't spoil his dinner.

756
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,202
This will be my dinner.

757
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,995
I can always have rice.

758
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,877
You're at your destination.

759
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,088
Navigation will now end.

760
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,096
Is there a restaurant up there?

761
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,692
Isn't the elevator over there?

762
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,494
One moment, sir.

763
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:46,496
Ma'am.

764
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,167
Hello. Hello, sir.

765
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,098
Maybe next time.

766
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,725
I ordered it from Germany.

767
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,436
If it doesn't fit, we'll adjust the size.

768
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,366
It fits you perfectly.

769
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,411
Anything else?

770
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:29,539
I like that necklace.

771
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:41,760
It suits you.

772
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,805
Then I'll only take this necklace.

773
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,684
It's your Christmas gift.

774
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:51,937
What about you?

775
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,271
Care to buy me one?

776
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,111
That one, please.

777
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,788
-Are they matching rings?
-Yes.

778
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,415
Does it look okay?

779
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,585
The same one for her.

780
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,297
This is my treat.

781
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,396
Call your mom and tell her we're here.

782
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,404
Hi, Ji-a.

783
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:43,905
We're here.

784
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,282
I see. It's pretty cold there, right?

785
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,450
A bit.

786
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:51,121
Aren't you hungry? You had a light lunch.

787
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:53,039
We're going to go eat soon.

788
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:56,960
Okay. Chew slowly and enjoy your food.
Don't get an upset stomach.

789
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:03,758
Here's the drink menu.

790
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,218
No, thanks. The tasting menu, please.

791
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:08,471
Are there ingredients
you can't eat or are allergic to?

792
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,515
No.

793
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,519
Aren't you drinking?

794
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:15,520
I'm already drunk.

795
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:18,565
Drunk on you.

796
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:32,620
PLAY…

797
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,877
BOY

798
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,632
I don't want to get drunk tonight.

799
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,927
I want to stay sober and focus on you.

800
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,600
You were on my mind the entire past month.

801
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,398
It's Ban.

802
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,901
Don't tell him that you're with me.

803
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:04,235
I'm a bad liar.

804
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,361
Then I'm leaving.

805
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:10,366
Hey.

806
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,244
I changed my passcode
thanks to Secretary Yoo.

807
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:15,538
He and Dad barged in here.

808
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,332
What choice did Secretary Yoo have?

809
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:18,875
Where are you?

810
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,001
At a ski resort.

811
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,669
With Ms. Lee Si-eun?

812
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,713
How did you know her full name?

813
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,340
I know everything about you.

814
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:26,966
Did you look into her?

815
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:30,053
No. I'll tell you later.

816
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:32,889
Buy some kitchen knives before flying in.

817
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,643
I already got you some last time.
Have they gone blunt already?

818
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:37,977
Not for me.

819
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,522
I see. For her?

820
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,608
You should've told me sooner.

821
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:46,402
-I flew in yesterday.
-Yesterday?

822
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:47,862
Yes.

823
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,157
-Are you coming back in a few days?
-The day after tomorrow.

824
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,242
Okay.

825
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,876
I'll tell him when he returns to Seoul.

826
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,711
We shouldn't drag things out.

827
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:04,921
And then what?

828
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,089
Find a wedding venue.

829
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,967
What about the reception hall
at Seoul Hotel?

830
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,520
Do you not trust me that much?

831
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,652
To be honest, I'm not sure about this.

832
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:30,196
When in doubt, just do it.

833
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,199
I know it sounds odd.

834
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:37,245
Have you ever been on a tube
and let the waves carry you?

835
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,290
Wasn't it relaxing?

836
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,173
Let's quickly pack and leave Seoul
once we're done here.

837
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:50,800
It's the winter season.
All the rooms will be booked.

838
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,970
Ban is at the Yongpyong Resort.

839
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:57,098
We have a vacation home
in Namhae, but it's too far.

840
00:57:57,182 --> 00:58:00,101
Namhae doesn't give off a Christmas vibe.

841
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,603
It barely snows.

842
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,315
Let's just stay here.

843
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:07,442
I don't want to waste time in the car.

844
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,447
Will your father
be attending Mr. Seo's wedding?

845
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,283
They haven't talked about it yet.

846
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,660
Dad has no right to oppose it.

847
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,579
Is that how you address him?

848
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:21,623
At home, yes.

849
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,000
I shouldn't.

850
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:27,170
Why is "Mom" okay but "Dad" not?

851
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:30,882
Honestly, it's not easy
to change the way you address him.

852
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:32,258
Old habits die hard.

853
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,719
That's exactly why
we should get married soon.

854
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:42,018
Addressing each other formally
feels distant. I don't like it.

855
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,104
But…

856
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:48,691
But what?

857
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,613
We can't say
that we're close to begin with.

858
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,406
Have you forgotten already?

859
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,264
I really like you.

860
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,103
I like you.

861
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,356
Don't force it on me.

862
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:29,399
Force what?

863
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:38,491
BOO HYE-RYUNG'S
LOVE, MEMORIES, AND MUSIC

864
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,742
LEAVE YOUR SONG REQUESTS

865
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:40,994
WRITER
LEE SI-EUN

866
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:43,329
Thanks.

867
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,835
She's definitely a middle-aged woman.

868
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:22,827
-You should sleep with A Mi since I snore.
-You should.

869
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:30,335
-I pray that my spirit
-I pray that my spirit

870
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:34,130
-Will see you again, my Lord
-Will see you again, my Lord

871
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:40,219
-Please give me salvation
-Please give me salvation

872
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:47,143
-I pray that my spirit will live again
-I pray that my spirit will live again

873
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:53,816
-In Your presence
-In Your presence

874
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:09,999
Do you have food coma?

875
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,919
-No.
-Closing your eyes

876
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,712
is relaxing enough when you're tired.

877
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:16,714
Then I can drive to Hongcheon.

878
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,008
Can we please do that?

879
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:21,177
I can book a place
with just one phone call.

880
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:23,346
We can't go there.

881
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:25,765
Then let's go somewhere
and have some ice cream.

882
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,183
It's only 8 p.m.

883
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:29,811
Shops aren't open right now.
Or they've probably run out.

884
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:32,438
I flew for 12 hours
and only get to see you for three.

885
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,482
It's four hours plus the time in the car.

886
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:36,776
And you arrived yesterday.

887
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,569
Had you visited me straight away,

888
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,988
I would have gone anywhere.

889
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:45,410
I had to get the Santa outfit
and report back to my father.

890
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,831
I bet your secretary
got the outfit, not you.

891
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:50,957
It took him too long…

892
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:56,170
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

893
01:01:57,755 --> 01:02:00,341
-Have you seen Cute Woman?
-Yes.

894
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:03,261
I hope you'll never change of heart
and take me for a ride.

895
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,724
What do you think about my personality?

896
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,517
-You have multiple.
-You won't get sick of me.

897
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,103
Look at you talking so casually.

898
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:13,813
Fine, then.

899
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:15,773
Hey, Pi-young.

900
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,611
Why are you so pretty?

901
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,698
Not only are you pretty but cute too.

902
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:28,327
And you also have some sexy calves.

903
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:32,290
Scream for me.

904
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:35,209
Come on.

905
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,462
-I can't force it.
-Then let me help.

906
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:46,804
What are you doing?

907
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,596
Maybe I was just seeing things.

908
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,518
That can't be.

909
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,036
You should go.

910
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:53,120
After you go in.

911
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:10,680
Third floor.

912
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,272
There's a camera over there.

913
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:21,440
So what?

914
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:23,442
I'm keeping you warm.

915
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:43,337
I'll buy you a cake tomorrow.

916
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:44,630
I already have one.

917
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,007
Then some gelato.

918
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,341
I have that too.

919
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:00,813
I was craving
some ice cream on my way here.

920
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:04,859
When?

921
01:05:04,942 --> 01:05:08,112
You invited me for some ice cream.
You didn't say you were craving it.

922
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:09,655
Stop…

923
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:12,283
moving your mouth…

924
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,620
like that.

925
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,762
Text me when you get home.

926
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,728
Ma'am, are all men really not trustworthy?

927
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:47,855
It depends on the man.

928
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:50,024
-I can be mean.
-I even like that side of you.

929
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:53,027
-I'd like to meet her.
-To say what?

930
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:54,987
You're insane.

931
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,989
Don't mind me and look after yourself.

932
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,784
The man who gave you
that teddy bear likes me.

933
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:01,911
How do you feel about him?

934
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:06,165
It breaks my heart as your father.

935
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:07,500
-How is it?
-Thank you.

936
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:08,709
It's all thanks to the design.

937
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:11,796
Lucky you. I guess a woman's fate
doesn't depend on her husband.

938
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:16,092
Mom, can't you still get pregnant?
I think it'd be nice if you did.

939
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:19,720
Should I tell them that I saw Song Won?

940
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:24,517
What am I to you?

941
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,061
Was I just a one-night stand?

942
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:33,025
