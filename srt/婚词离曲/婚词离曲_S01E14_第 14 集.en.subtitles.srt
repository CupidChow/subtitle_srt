00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,771
EPISODE 14

2
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,277
It's interesting you don't drink coffee.

3
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,197
Apart from my daughter,
everyone drinks it.

4
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,741
I have my dad to thank for that.

5
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,620
Your father too?
Does that go for your whole family?

6
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,246
Yes.

7
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,416
It's nothing good, I guess.

8
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,794
The biggest issue it has
is caffeine addiction.

9
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,508
How serene.

10
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:41,684
You'll be sacrificing a lot.
Actually, you'll have to

11
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,062
be tolerant of many things.

12
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:48,650
We won't be able to spend time together
when we want to,

13
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,736
and that'll leave you dissatisfied.

14
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,571
That I'm ready for.

15
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,906
I won't ever sleep out.

16
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,162
I can't be with you when you're sick

17
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,081
or talk on the phone when you want,

18
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,792
especially after 6 p.m.

19
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,795
Are you okay with all that?

20
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,760
Think it through.

21
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,179
It's not an easy decision.

22
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:22,475
We'll still be able to see each other
at least once a week, right?

23
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,857
I'm good, then.

24
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,070
Promise me one thing, though.

25
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:40,034
Promise me that you'll never ask me
to choose you over my family.

26
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,790
-I won't.
-Doing so

27
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,459
won't benefit you in any way.

28
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,755
-I'll have you though.
-You'll be sharing.

29
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,092
How you feel about me
means more than our time spent together.

30
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,221
Tell me if you don't love me.

31
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,189
Emotions from the heart can be felt.

32
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,901
I'm sure you know how I feel

33
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:18,197
and I can also feel how you feel about me.

34
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:23,036
I won't text or call after 6 p.m.

35
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,873
And we can meet every few weeks
when you're busy.

36
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:33,338
Just let me always hold
a small place in your heart.

37
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,262
Am I asking too much?

38
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:47,143
My feelings for you
aren't to be taken lightly.

39
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,312
They run deep.

40
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,025
That's more than enough for me.

41
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,919
-U-ram.
-Yes?

42
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,462
You like Ji-a, don't you?

43
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,130
What makes you say that?

44
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,424
You look at her with love in your eyes.

45
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,385
-With love in my eyes?
-Yes.

46
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,972
I'm still a kid, you know.
And what you said is inappropriate.

47
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,307
Your eyes were on her the whole time.

48
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,396
I looked at the ice, the ceiling,

49
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,314
and even the people around me.

50
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,566
Besides, can't we talk to each other?

51
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,820
It's been a while,
so we talked about our old teacher.

52
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,197
You know what I mean.

53
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,865
What exactly is that?

54
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,786
If I'm being honest, Ji-a's a sweet kid.

55
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,414
So I hope you two remain close friends
as you grow up.

56
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:53,710
I want you to have a decent guy friend
too, you know. But you don't.

57
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,046
-Smart girls won't like you.
-Why not?

58
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,467
Girls don't like men who answer a question
with two and get all chatty.

59
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,972
I hope you didn't fall down a lot.

60
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,141
I should've been there to hold you up.

61
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,059
Hyang-gi and U-ram did instead.

62
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,602
Excuse me.

63
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,231
Let me. You don't want to hurt yourself.

64
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,149
Sure.

65
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,902
U-ram is always formal with his parents.

66
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,613
-I'm choosing not to.
-Why?

67
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,199
To feel closer to you guys. Want to see?

68
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,245
Father, please let the pieces be small.

69
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,336
Mother, could you please pass me a napkin?

70
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,504
-Is that better for you?
-Yes, young lady.

71
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,466
Not for me. My tongue's rejecting it.

72
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,178
Here.

73
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,015
You must be hungry too.

74
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,559
Watching you two eat appeases my hunger.

75
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,895
It's true.

76
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,066
Ji-a, you'll understand
once you become a mom too.

77
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,194
Anyway, your mom is also my baby.

78
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,156
Here you go.

79
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,412
Why does U-ram's mom
have a bandage on her wrist?

80
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,748
It's a medicated patch for her sore wrist.

81
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,876
Her job requires her
to type all the time, you see.

82
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,757
How sad.

83
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,801
Does your job affect you too?

84
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,969
Not really. Not physically.

85
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,931
Dad, what about you?

86
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:33,601
I bet he can't help but analyze
other people's minds.

87
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:37,939
He never says it, but I bet he always
tries to figure out others' personalities.

88
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:40,817
She's right.

89
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,278
Here. Please enjoy, my princess.

90
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,699
Let's order a pizza too.
You love gorgonzola pizza.

91
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,410
-Won't it be too much?
-We'll take home the leftovers.

92
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,456
I'm glad you weren't there today.

93
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,501
Si-eun and her family
would've been embarrassed if you were.

94
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,586
-Why's that?
-Professor Park

95
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,380
doesn't slice anyone's meat for them.

96
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,508
Did you have steak for lunch?

97
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,927
Yes. You know, the kids love it.

98
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:13,057
Come to think of it, I've never seen
any other husband as sweet as you are.

99
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,143
It's because I love you.

100
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,438
Does that mean U-ram's dad
doesn't love his family?

101
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,571
Are you hungry?

102
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,949
No, not yet. It must be
because of the big lunch I had.

103
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,370
I'm finally done.

104
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,749
Ms. Sa's father-in-law was beaming
all the time thanks to his pretty wife.

105
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,711
It's why the dead are always pitied.

106
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,796
Didn't his wife pass away a long time ago?

107
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,425
He remarried before the two-year mark
with a nurse 19 years his junior.

108
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,387
It's true that love transcends borders.

109
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,600
-Jealous much?
-What are you implying?

110
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,894
I guess the jealousy is understandable.

111
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:02,106
A woman 19 years your junior is 31.

112
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,109
Seriously. Stop that.

113
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,070
Don't jump to conclusions.
When did this get to be about me?

114
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,949
-Maybe it's what you secretly want.
-Oh, please.

115
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,370
Women like young men too, you know.

116
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,916
A junior colleague of mine
goes hiking on the weekends.

117
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,709
The older ladies there

118
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:25,755
would pull him toward them
offering him snacks and all that.

119
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,342
That's how it is these days
regardless of gender.

120
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,219
We're the normal ones, right?

121
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,179
Of course.

122
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:39,060
You see a lot of court-related scenes
in TV dramas.

123
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,438
-Right.
-Don't you get nervous speaking

124
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,440
in front of all the audience?

125
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,902
I took public speaking classes as a kid,
so not really.

126
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,989
I hear people take calming pills
on their first court day though.

127
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,618
When I was in law school,
I went to see a trial,

128
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,287
and it must've been
that lawyer's first day in court.

129
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,458
You know how you don't know what you're
talking about when you're too nervous.

130
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,336
It turned out that one of the documents

131
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,839
was printed with a number
that was miscalculated.

132
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,135
And the judge told the lawyer
to correct it.

133
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,804
-Oh, dear.
-Normally,

134
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,849
you can just tell the judge
that you'll correct it in your seat,

135
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:23,563
take your time calculating the number,
and then hand in the document again.

136
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,565
However, the judge that day

137
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,111
told the lawyer to do it on the spot
instead of handing in another document.

138
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,239
He was like,
"Calculate the number right away."

139
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,450
So the lawyer had to calculate the number,

140
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:40,246
but he was too nervous
to get it done properly.

141
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,166
He couldn't get the right number,
which flustered him greatly.

142
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,712
I still remember what the lawyer said.

143
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:52,800
"Your Honor, I had
jjolmyeon for lunch, you see.

144
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:58,556
I'm so nervous
since this is my first day in court,

145
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,975
so I have indigestion!"

146
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,062
The judge scoffed gently at him

147
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,149
and told him to calculate it in his seat.

148
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,194
I nearly died trying to stop myself
from bursting into laughter.

149
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,489
The situation was hilarious
and the word jjolmyeon made it worse.

150
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,374
His company is always enjoyable.

151
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,440
Hi, I'm at the bookstore

152
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,818
and was wondering if you could
recommend anything that you translated.

153
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:53,903
Xiexian.

154
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,948
-Which bookstore are you at?
-Jesam Bookstore.

155
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,673
What? Gosh, you startled me.

156
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,801
-Where's your wife?
-She went golfing.

157
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,807
Oh, and I had a wedding to attend to.

158
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,850
You look completely different today.

159
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:25,935
In a good way?

160
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,937
You've always been a catch,

161
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,523
but you look as good in a suit
as in casual wear.

162
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,859
-Who does?
-You, Xiexian.

163
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,739
I came by to buy a book you translated
since I didn't want to go home

164
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,907
to an empty house.

165
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,284
It's over there,

166
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,621
but I'll give you
an extra copy I have at home.

167
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,873
I didn't think it'd suit your taste.

168
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,000
That is never the case with books.

169
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,711
Just like food,
it's best to never be picky.

170
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,631
There's something to learn
from every book.

171
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,175
I'll buy one today. Where is it?

172
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,554
I really want to give you the copy I have,
with my gratitude.

173
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:06,183
Gosh. Your gratitude?

174
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,771
I shouldn't reject that, right?

175
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,899
Do you have anything to buy today?

176
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,988
I looked around,
but nothing's speaking out to me.

177
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,490
Besides, I'd rather keep my hands light.

178
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,118
-You should grab my arm.
-Gosh, no.

179
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,246
You said
you wanted to keep your hands light.

180
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,290
I hear locking arms eases the weight.

181
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,749
Says your wife?

182
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,002
No, my first girlfriend.

183
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,297
She was probably your first love too.

184
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:42,178
Come to think of it,
I don't believe it was love.

185
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,096
I liked her a lot, that's all.

186
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,224
Is your wife your first love, then?

187
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:52,021
Well, it's true that
I practically begged her to marry me.

188
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,857
But as soon as the honeymoon phase ended,

189
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,695
my feelings for her
kind of thinned down in a way.

190
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,908
-Please take my arm--
-It'll seem misleading.

191
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,952
Who cares if people misunderstand us?

192
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,246
It's only a misunderstanding anyway.

193
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,874
And misunderstandings
aren't even a great deal.

194
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,335
But in some cases,
it could mean everything.

195
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,340
What do you think is a great deal then?

196
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,759
Well…

197
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,012
Life or death.

198
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:28,432
The harmony and good health
of your family.

199
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,267
Financial issues too.

200
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,895
Have you ever lacked money before?

201
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,314
Not yet. What about you?

202
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,983
I've been lucky.

203
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,654
My parents passed away
when I was still young,

204
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,323
but they left me a building.

205
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,368
That's a relief.

206
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,454
You must've driven here.

207
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,540
I'm having the car washed.

208
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,000
-I'll get going then.
-And leave me here alone?

209
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,212
-Should we get some coffee?
-But you don't drink it.

210
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,965
Let's just keep walking.
I quite like it, you know.

211
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,635
I take a walk almost every day.

212
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,512
I see. Where, exactly?

213
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:10,349
I walk around the apartment complex
if I'm too busy,

214
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,184
or go to a nearby park.

215
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:16,188
Walking helps me come up
with decent expressions.

216
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:21,026
In translation, the target language
is most important, you see.

217
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:25,239
I translate from Chinese into Korean.

218
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,117
So I often read Korean literature.

219
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,537
The Korean phrases and words
should match those of the source language.

220
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,289
Yes, of course.

221
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,090
Hold on.

222
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,427
Goodness. Thank you so much.

223
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,601
-It's a boy, right?
-Yes.

224
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,024
How old is he?

225
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,568
He's in his 15th month.

226
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,115
Wait.

227
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,911
-Aren't you Pan Sa-hyeon?
-Who…

228
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,538
I'm Pan Mi-ju from sixth grade.

229
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,540
We have the same surname, remember?

230
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,958
Oh, right.

231
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,920
Gosh, you've gotten
handsome over the years.

232
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,924
-We were classmates.
-I see.

233
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,218
You're a lucky man to have ended up
with such a beautiful woman.

234
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,013
-No…
-No, we're just friends.

235
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,806
You aren't married yet?

236
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,478
You just share a bed for now?

237
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,981
That's not it. We're only gym buddies.

238
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,359
We bumped into each other
at the bookstore.

239
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,695
We'll go after lunch then.

240
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,863
-Sure.
-Cool.

241
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,659
U-ram, are you in this class too?

242
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:00,918
You're a freshman now, so you'll take
orders from the sophomore heads.

243
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,503
Heads?

244
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,339
Juniors and seniors
appoint them for their projects

245
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,968
who are then put in charge
of the outfits and props.

246
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,387
So the errands will be run by freshmen.

247
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,140
The Theater Department is strict.
You may be often called out before dawn.

248
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,643
Your nightmare begins.

249
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,854
Why do they do that?
This isn't the military.

250
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,898
-Mom!
-Yes?

251
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,068
I've outgrown all my clothes now.

252
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,195
It's not like you to care.

253
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,030
You know how they say

254
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,658
that beggars who are dressed well
get more to eat.

255
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,118
Fine, I'll buy you some.

256
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,912
Rather than what I usually wear,

257
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,708
I'm hoping for some nicer clothes.
I'm in fifth grade now.

258
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,168
-To impress Ji-a?
-What are you talking about?

259
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,380
I know I'm right.
I see right through you, you know.

260
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,757
-Seriously?
-You can't deny it, can you?

261
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,678
Look at you already caring about girls.

262
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,430
-Ji-a's not one.
-So she's a boy?

263
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,431
She's a friend.

264
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,435
Mom, don't get him any.
He has enough clothes.

265
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:00,853
Stay out of this.

266
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,856
Would you like it if I spend time
dolling myself up for guys?

267
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,400
-It wouldn't be bad.
-I won't find success then.

268
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,945
And we need to in order to
repay Mom and Dad for what they've done.

269
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,405
Keep that in mind.

270
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,033
Hearing you say that is more than enough.

271
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,494
-I'm sure you won't let us down, right?
-Of course.

272
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,955
-Now, do you need new clothes?
-No.

273
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,128
Let's just get him one.

274
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,922
Out of everyone I know,
you look the youngest for your age.

275
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,924
Who'd believe you're 42?

276
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,512
So you're telling everyone here
how old I am?

277
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,354
They're done at the carwash.

278
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,359
I'll still be going home
to an empty house though.

279
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,445
Let's go somewhere.

280
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,657
The office, my home,
the gym, and the court.

281
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,992
I need some fresh air.

282
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,470
-The air feels different, doesn't it?
-Yes.

283
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:22,726
Shall we decide on a destination
or just go somewhere random?

284
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,061
Random is better, right?

285
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,625
Are we water gazing?

286
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,795
It's better than fire gazing, you know.

287
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,131
Fire gazing can damage your eyes.

288
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,719
Isn't it nice?

289
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,679
It's therapeutic.

290
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,891
Aren't you hungry?

291
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,143
I don't mind that feeling either.

292
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,147
I like it, but you probably don't.

293
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,899
When I studied for the bar,

294
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:55,068
I stuck to small portions
since a full stomach makes you sleepy.

295
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,821
The feeling of an empty stomach
is relaxing.

296
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,365
And your mind becomes clearer.

297
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,869
Exactly. Feeling brings you joy,

298
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,246
but so does the feeling
of an empty stomach.

299
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,584
You're not like most men.

300
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,086
I'm not?

301
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,885
-How so?
-You're more evolved, I guess.

302
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,638
In other words, more civilized.

303
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,016
You're not like most women either.

304
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:31,897
You're calm, sensible, witty,

305
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,192
delicate, feminine,

306
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,611
and considerate to those around you.

307
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:41,615
Let me buy you dinner.
Where could a restaurant be?

308
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,825
Your hunger is making you say things.

309
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,328
I really mean it, you know.

310
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,040
-How many?
-Four.

311
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,376
I bet you can see my wings.

312
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,920
Of course. They're right there.

313
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,221
You know,

314
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,851
my divorce brought me
a great deal of pain.

315
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,147
Because it was like I lost my family.

316
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,609
I lived with my in-laws.

317
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,656
They only got to raise sons
all their lives,

318
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,284
so they doted on me
as if I were their own.

319
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,078
They filled the absence

320
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,955
of my own parents.

321
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,293
The love I had for them

322
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,421
was more of the reason
I agreed to the marriage.

323
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,259
I remember how my mom

324
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:47,514
used to say that children are the glue
that keeps a marriage together.

325
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:54,146
Even if your spouse disappoints you
or your love withers,

326
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,232
you stay together for your children.

327
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:04,406
But I wasn't able to have a child,

328
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,241
so we had no other choice.

329
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,413
My mother-in-law used to tell others

330
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,666
I was as good as her own daughter.

331
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,464
But she started talking
less and less to me.

332
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,632
And she stopped smiling at me.

333
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,011
Soon, she suggested a divorce.

334
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,515
That's when

335
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,727
I felt like my whole world crumbled down.

336
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,190
Just like when my parents passed away.

337
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,904
I left without even shedding a tear.

338
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,909
I don't think about my ex-husband much,

339
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,037
but I think about them once in a while.

340
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,333
Are they well and healthy?

341
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,337
I saw them at the department store

342
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,715
and could tell
they doted on their granddaughter.

343
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,847
It seems like everyone's destined
to be with a certain person.

344
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,060
And he wasn't the one for me.

345
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,066
My life isn't so bad though.

346
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,778
Sometimes, I even feel happy.

347
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,948
But,

348
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:32,244
whenever I see babies
like we did at the bookstore,

349
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,999
my heart still aches.

350
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:54,432
I'll be there for you.

351
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,852
I can't fill the absence

352
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:59,980
of your parents, but still.

353
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,804
Thank you.
I appreciate it even if you don't mean it.

354
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:42,314
You'll see it's not just words.

355
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,357
I mean it.

356
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,660
You seem much more mature than me
at times.

357
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,038
My height isn’t the only thing
that’s bigger.

358
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,790
So is my heart, when it’s for you.

359
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,297
-How many?
-Three.

360
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:12,052
You'll soon get to realize
that I truly mean…

361
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,971
what I said.

362
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:25,065
"The nickname Boom.
I love its meaning and the way it sounds.

363
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,567
I wonder who came up with it."

364
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,819
It was our engineer, Mr. Seo.

365
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:35,242
Username 9155 says, "Really?"
Yes, it's true.

366
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,911
"Is it Mr. Seo Ban
that you mention at the end?"

367
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,204
Yes, that's right.

368
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,374
No gift will be given
since the winner is one of the staff.

369
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,673
First floor.

370
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,758
When are you free?

371
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,886
Nothing should be for free
which is also the case this time.

372
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,263
But we all like freebies.

373
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,974
You're joking, right?

374
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,643
Whether you take it as a joke
is up to you.

375
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,521
Shouldn't the meal be on me?
I absolutely love my nickname.

376
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,939
Go ahead then.

377
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,525
It's fine. I'll see you all tomorrow.

378
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,360
Mr. Seo.

379
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:16,992
Shouldn't you treat us to a meal
since you won the contest?

380
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,285
I'd rather not be full.

381
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,079
-How about drinks then?
-Yes, at a fancy place.

382
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,665
-One that suits Hye-ryung.
-Sounds good.

383
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:24,791
I have plans today.

384
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:25,834
-A date?
-A date?

385
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,421
Yes.

386
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,965
The doors are closing.

387
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,970
-Do you really think it's a date?
-Might be.

388
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,556
He's too good to stay a bachelor.

389
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,392
I can never read him, you know.
He's a mystery.

390
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:45,312
Where can I take you all
to make him feel small?

391
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,522
Do you know Lakas? It's members-only.

392
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:50,025
-Do you have a membership?
-My husband does.

393
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,113
Is it too flashy?

394
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,364
You look great.

395
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,161
It's not bad to seem like a celebrity
since you're still active.

396
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,205
I personally like the word "stylish."

397
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,291
It seems special in a way.

398
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,543
I'm hardly fashionable.

399
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:11,880
If that was unfashionable,
I'd be called a fashion terrorist.

400
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:15,675
-Professor Park, you--
-Please just call me Hae-ryun.

401
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,844
I can't, not in front
of the other professors.

402
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:22,057
You should know that we're required
to follow strict guidelines.

403
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,684
Don't make eye-contact with one student
for too long

404
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,729
and don't tell a student
that he or she is pretty.

405
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:31,274
I guess all communications are banned
to prevent misunderstandings.

406
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,820
Wait. Isn't that a gas heater?

407
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,366
It is. The central heating goes off
at 5 p.m.

408
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,744
And we're told not to use electrical ones
due to the bill.

409
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,329
But you're the department head.

410
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,414
The job rotates every two years anyway.

411
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,751
So I just bought it with my own money.

412
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,879
Quite inadequate, isn't it?

413
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,718
I guess that's enough
for my introduction. Any questions?

414
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,011
Anything you wish to know?

415
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,139
No?

416
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:06,393
Being an actor is all about waiting.

417
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:10,355
And you chose this major
aspiring to careers in acting.

418
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,773
Yes?

419
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:15,026
-Can I ask a personal question?
-Sure.

420
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,362
I went to see a musical of yours
in middle school.

421
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,407
You had a lot of fans.

422
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,783
Does that include you?

423
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,369
I'll be one starting today.

424
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,499
Are there any memorable fans?

425
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,254
Fans who send handwritten letters
are always memorable.

426
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,215
And there was…

427
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:41,428
someone who sent me 100 roses.

428
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,847
-Was it a man?
-Yes.

429
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,933
Did it end with just the 100 roses though?

430
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,645
Did you come into contact with him?

431
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,279
Since I want you guys to be honest,

432
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,781
I should be honest with you first.

433
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,534
The fan contacted me in person,

434
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,369
and we ended up dating.

435
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,080
Is it still ongoing?

436
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,125
-Do you want to know?
-Yes.

437
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,878
-Why's that?
-Because it's a love story.

438
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,964
Do love stories
usually have happy endings?

439
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,090
I wouldn't know.

440
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,676
Mine ended in tears.

441
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,138
That's right. Mine too.

442
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:26,890
It had a sad ending.

443
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,498
U-ram and Ji-a are classmates again.

444
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,043
Is Ji-a thrilled? Or isn't she?

445
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,087
They're good friends
since Si-eun and I are too.

446
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,215
U-ram's nice to Ji-a.

447
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,591
Is he the cheeky type?

448
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,427
Of course not.
His parents taught him well.

449
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,555
Having a professor for a father
sure helps.

450
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,850
Professor Park is a true gentleman.
A noble one too.

451
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,143
What about me?

452
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,728
No one can hold a candle to you.

453
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,105
That sounds like flattery to me.

454
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,357
What would be the truth?

455
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:23,363
Ji-a wishes to marry
a man like you someday.

456
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,781
That's the best compliment.

457
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,617
Well, that's from Ji-a. What about you?

458
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:32,580
Would you still marry me
if you were ever born again?

459
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:38,253
Will a headlock be coming my way
if I don't give a satisfying answer?

460
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,339
Of course. I'll be tying you up too.

461
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,177
You first, then.

462
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:52,183
If I could ever be born again,
I'd want to get married three times.

463
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,896
The first one would be to Sa Pi-young.

464
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,441
The second one would be
to my current wife.

465
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,779
And the third one would be to Ji-a's mom.

466
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,383
DONG-MA

467
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,094
DONG-MA

468
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,890
-Hello?
-Where are you?

469
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,017
-The salon.
-When will you be done?

470
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,103
In about an hour or so. Why?

471
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,396
Which salon?

472
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,244
-Let's go.
-Go where?

473
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,829
-A palace.
-Gyeongbokgung Palace?

474
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,456
-Changdeokgung Palace.
-Liar.

475
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:01,336
I had Secretary Yoo buy us tickets.
You haven't been to the Alhambra, right?

476
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,171
No way.

477
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,673
This is a joke, right?

478
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,425
Maybe you'll believe me on the plane.

479
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,512
-Hold on. Seriously?
-Yes.

480
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,098
-You're free this week.
-When's the flight?

481
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,976
-We have 30 minutes to get your passport.
-But I haven't packed.

482
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,520
We can buy everything there.

483
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,798
OH JIN-A

484
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,930
-Hey, Jin-a.
-Join us over here at Mama.

485
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,808
-Who's with you?
-Ga-bin,

486
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,102
when a senior summons you,
you should just come,

487
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,854
-no questions asked.
-Sure thing.

488
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,691
You'll recognize someone,
so hurry over here.

489
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,693
Got it. Let me just get changed.

490
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:10,029
You can be in a tracksuit for all I care.
Just hurry up.

491
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:14,701
Right. A fine bottle of wine
would be nice.

492
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,801
Is Ms. Oh Jin-a, here?

493
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,429
-Yes, it's this way.
-Right.

494
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,562
-We should meet more often.
-Of course.

495
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,401
My gosh.

496
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,862
Here. Have a seat.

497
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,367
Do you two know each other?

498
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,660
We're best friends!

499
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,496
Wait. That was rude of me, wasn't it?

500
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,916
We're all getting old anyway.

501
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,714
Out of everyone here,
the one aging backwards is me!

502
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,719
He's well acquainted with my husband too.

503
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:17,597
This is No Pil-jae,
a reporter from Taeseong Daily.

504
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,932
Hello, I'm a fan.

505
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,517
Nice to meet you.

506
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,394
What kind of fan?

507
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,479
An avid one.

508
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,482
I thought you'd come by before leaving.

509
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,985
I did, but you were already
in a meeting with the professors.

510
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,653
I see.

511
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,198
Why didn't you tell me
about the guest lecture gig?

512
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,450
I didn't know if I'd do a good job.

513
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:40,411
Besides, you're super busy all the time.

514
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,455
She had her first class today.

515
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,833
Anyway, you should've told me.

516
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,295
If you had, I would've ruined it.

517
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,506
Why's that?

518
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:56,427
Because the stage is where Ga-bin belongs.
She should never leave the stage!

519
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,014
How was it today?

520
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,933
Are you asking how I managed?

521
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,101
That's right.

522
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,858
-Is this from Spain?
-Yes.

523
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,155
I think I did better than expected.

524
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,990
The students seemed intrigued.

525
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:21,035
Wait. Is this too much self-praise?

526
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,205
One needs that, you know.

527
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:29,043
Ms. Nam's fame and passion from the stage

528
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,129
will shine even brighter in class.

529
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,339
I'd appreciate it if you all
gave me some energy.

530
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,383
Consider it done.

531
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:36,759
You'll be drained.

532
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,803
I'd gladly be an empty shell.

533
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,472
Thank you.

534
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,142
Anyway, congratulations!

535
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,231
I emptied mine.

536
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,491
Let's drink the night away!

537
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,794
-How's it coming?
-Good.

538
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,177
You can leave those.

539
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,556
I love you with all my heart

540
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:27,185
So why is it that you don't trust me?

541
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,688
Until the day I die

542
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:34,317
You'll be the only one for me

543
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,155
No, even though I die

544
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:44,410
You'll be my only one, so please trust me

545
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:48,998
Trust me and love me

546
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:59,091
Sexy man, you are mine

547
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,929
Handsome man, you are mine

548
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:06,474
Even if the world comes to an end

549
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:15,376
TO ME WHO'S NOT FAR AWAY

550
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,118
-This one.
-Oh, sure.

551
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,457
-Is it a gift?
-Yes.

552
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,878
-Dr. Shin!
-Hey.

553
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,379
Did you buy a gift?

554
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,883
Yes. You too, I see.

555
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,092
That's right.

556
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,346
If you're done shopping,
why don't we have some coffee?

557
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,682
There's a decent cafe
at the basement level.

558
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:12,850
Is that so?

559
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,146
-What did you get?
-A perfume.

560
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,899
You truly are good to your wife.

561
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,777
Isn't it a trend with husbands these days?

562
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,403
Not really.

563
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,948
Half of my friends got divorced
for being inconsiderate jerks.

564
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,033
They got dumped.

565
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,952
A second wife is better for some, though.

566
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,621
You don't see that often.

567
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,290
Don't lose the people from your past.

568
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,125
Better the devil you know, right?

569
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:42,046
The first wife's always the best,
except for extremely rare cases.

570
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,547
That's right.

571
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,841
I remember your wife having a job.

572
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,386
Yes, she's a producer
at a broadcasting station.

573
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:52,473
But she keeps the house
better than housewives.

574
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,892
That's not easy.

575
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,478
Tell me about it. So I'm always grateful.

576
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,063
You should be.

577
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,148
My body runs hot, you see.

578
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,817
As do most men.

579
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,820
My wife irons my underwear

580
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,072
along with a cotton t-shirt

581
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,783
and places them in a box
that's put in the fridge.

582
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,785
-To keep them cool?
-Yes.

583
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:16,539
Imagine how fresh I'd feel
when I put them on after a shower.

584
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,417
-My gosh.
-She hasn't skipped a day

585
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,169
ever since our wedding day
except when I go abroad.

586
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,923
That alone explains what she's like.

587
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,758
She's one incredible wife.

588
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,011
You must be the luckiest man on earth.

589
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,598
How did you marry someone like that?
Were you set up on a blind date?

590
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,934
No, we met in college.
She was a different major.

591
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,061
-Is she your age?
-Four years my junior.

592
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,646
My wife's four years younger too.

593
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,442
They say that a four-year age gap
brings the best harmony.

594
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,610
It's not something to take lightly, is it?

595
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,739
You seem to be
having a happy marriage too.

596
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,909
-We should go on a double date sometime.
-Sure.

597
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,166
I was going to ask
what kind of perfume you use.

598
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,751
Then it wouldn't be a surprise.

599
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,838
See if you like the fragrance.

600
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,799
I'm not one to wear perfume.

601
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,885
-No?
-But this I will.

602
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,555
Gosh, I love the subtle scent.

603
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,468
Watching them eat pizza
made me crave some.

604
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,011
They'll be closed at this hour.

605
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,138
Can we order some in for the first time?

606
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,058
Well, I had a big dinner.

607
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,279
The smell's drawing me to it.

608
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,032
Well, it's not like we have it every day.

609
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,254
What a sweet combination.

610
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,424
Pizza and coke. Fried chicken and beer.

611
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,427
Let's have the latter for dinner tomorrow.

612
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,096
Sure thing.

613
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:46,438
Do you remember the pizza
we ate in Naples?

614
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:50,150
Of course.
The award-winning margherita pizza.

615
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,319
It was absolutely divine.

616
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,864
The same goes for
the gorgonzola pizza in Myeong-dong.

617
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,825
Eat before it gets cold.

618
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,702
Sure.

619
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,627
And the one in Milan baked
in the wood-burning oven was to die for.

620
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,255
You and your good memory.

621
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:15,301
I need to be sharp
to take care of you, you know.

622
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,177
To do it perfectly.

623
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,848
You're more than perfect.
There's no one quite like you.

624
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,017
You're the best husband out there too.

625
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,602
Oh, please.

626
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,437
You appreciate everything.

627
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,440
And your words of gratitude
and your compliments

628
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,400
make me want to do even better.

629
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,735
It's only relative.

630
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,362
You're right. It's relative.

631
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,531
Dig in already.

632
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,491
You're the one who was craving this.

633
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,286
Rather than eating what I crave,

634
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:45,539
chatting with you like this
brings me more joy.

635
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,249
I bet

636
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:52,546
that we rank high
in terms of the happiest couple in Korea.

637
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,303
Please have another.

638
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,096
But it's quite late.

639
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,557
You don't know
how healthy you look lately.

640
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,934
Just eat as I tell you to,

641
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,479
and you won't need any detox
or Botox shots.

642
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:12,024
You're right. Everyone's been saying
I look good these days.

643
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,108
Exactly.

644
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:04,576
Are you asleep?

645
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,460
What the…

646
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:19,049
What? What is it?
Are you not feeling well?

647
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:20,968
Why no arm pillow?

648
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,097
Don't you love me anymore?

649
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:29,101
Don't be ridiculous.
My arm goes numb, that's all.

650
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,727
What about before then?

651
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:34,314
You used to offer your arm all the time,
but now it goes numb?

652
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:38,152
Your head… It's heavy, you know.

653
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,195
But it has always weighed the same.

654
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,905
You think it's heavy now?

655
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,700
Whatever. Just go back to sleep.

656
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,945
-High blood pressure.
-Hyperlipidemia.

657
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,404
-Diabetes.
-And obesity.

658
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:09,368
These are the multi lifestyle diseases
the middle-aged and elderly are prone to.

659
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:15,582
And the primary cause of these diseases
is insulin resistance.

660
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,877
Insulin resistance
brings about lifestyle diseases?

661
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:29,721
Deliver it safe and sound.
Don't let it break.

662
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:30,722
Yes, sir.

663
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:35,102
And find a new kindergarten for Dongmi.

664
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,186
Yes, sir.

665
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,690
It must not only have a good facility
but also a good sitter.

666
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:43,902
Dongmi has never been abused
or treated badly before.

667
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,612
The sitter from last time

668
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,906
looked as if she could

669
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,701
scare off the dogs by glaring.

670
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:51,910
I got it, sir.

671
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,456
And don't skip your meals.

672
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,043
Never work on an empty stomach.
You shouldn't at that age.

673
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,795
Yes, sir.

674
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,259
Why not have a face reader go with him?

675
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:09,094
Here comes the sarcasm again.

676
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,306
Dongmi's not some neighbor's dog.

677
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,392
-Even if she were--
-When we raised our children,

678
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,060
you weren't at all interested

679
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:20,439
in them going to school
or even graduating for that matter.

680
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:23,734
That's because I knew
you'd take good care of everything.

681
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:26,987
It's something to be laughed at.
A kindergarten for dogs?

682
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:31,074
I don't care if it's laughed at or not.
Zip it unless you're paying for it.

683
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,660
You'd probably have
a funeral for her in the end.

684
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,537
Of course, I should.

685
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:41,084
That's the least we can do
for the joy she's brought us.

686
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,629
Wagging her tail a few times
counts as bringing joy?

687
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,131
Whether it's the middle of the night

688
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:48,008
or raining or snowing,

689
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,345
Dongmi's the only one who greets me
with the same amount of love.

690
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,640
How often are you up
when I come home late?

691
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,309
You don't get up to greet me.

692
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,062
How should I greet you then?

693
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,356
I don't have a tail,
so maybe I'll shake my butt.

694
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,273
Go ahead.

695
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:06,318
Why only me though? You should do it too.

696
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:08,487
What, no answer?

697
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,490
Dogs don't try to
argue with you all the time

698
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:13,450
and they never talk back.

699
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,161
They never exhaust you.

700
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,376
-Who sent this?
-There's a card.

701
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,338
-Right, thank you.
-Have a good day.

702
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:33,178
HEAD OF DEPARTMENT, THEATER AND FILM
PARK HAE-RYUN

703
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,860
Never did I expect to enjoy or be proud
of being able to teach aspiring students

704
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:52,739
the knowledge I was able to pick up first
as their senior

705
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:56,702
as well as the techniques
required for any good actor.

706
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:00,205
I head to class with a spring in my step.

707
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,834
Although I lacked experience,
you still gave me a chance,

708
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,878
and for that
I show you my gratitude with this gift.

709
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,965
Despite my lacking the skill,

710
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:12,801
I made the bouquet myself for your wife.

711
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:16,680
I hope you accept my gift
that comes from the heart.

712
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,515
Yours truly, Nam Ga-bin.

713
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,981
You have arrived at your destination.
Navigation ended.

714
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,442
I'm at the apartment complex

715
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,986
you wrote down as your address
on your resume.

716
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,863
If you're not at home,

717
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:36,199
I'll leave the gift you gave me
with the building security guard.

718
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,910
The letter and bouquet
are more than enough.

719
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:44,207
It's our honor to have a lecturer
that is as talented and successful as you,

720
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:47,085
and the students have been learning a lot.

721
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:50,839
Deep down,
I'm truly ashamed for not being able

722
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:54,926
to pay you enough
when you most obviously deserve more.

723
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,596
Keeping the gift
until your class next week

724
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,598
might ruin your chance of returning it,

725
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,726
so I stopped by your residence
knowing it was a rude gesture.

726
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,936
Could I leave it with the guard?

727
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,899
NAM GA-BIN

728
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:13,820
Yes, Ms. Nam.

729
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,406
-Are you at my apartment complex?
-Yes.

730
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,618
Mr. Park, could you perhaps
take me to the hospital?

731
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,912
Yes, of course. Did you injure yourself?

732
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,664
Yes, a little. I'll be right out.

733
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:25,707
Okay.

734
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,698
-Are you hurt?
-Yes. Can you take me to the ER?

735
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,784
-I'm sorry about this.
-My car's this way.

736
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,380
Gosh, what happened?

737
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,893
I banged my head on the chair's armrest.

738
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,395
Oh, dear.

739
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,525
Seojong Hospital, please.

740
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:40,031
I opened the window
to let some fresh air in,

741
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,909
but turned off the lights
to stay hidden from my neighbors.

742
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:46,955
The sweater that was hanging
from the armrest slid off,

743
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:49,332
and when I bent down to pick it up…

744
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,126
Goodness.

745
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,919
I can't stop the bleeding.

746
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,838
You'll need stitches.

747
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,047
Right.

748
00:52:56,965 --> 00:53:00,385
You texted me as soon as it happened.

749
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,888
I couldn't drive in this state,

750
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,975
so I was about to call an ambulance.

751
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,852
It's a good thing I came by.

752
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:09,895
Exactly.

753
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:12,147
Or maybe you have yourself to thank

754
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,274
for sending me the right gift.

755
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:15,942
It's nothing really.

756
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,819
My coming here says otherwise.

757
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,697
What if it leaves a scar?

758
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:24,743
You'll have to tell the doctor
to do a good job with the stitches.

759
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:27,078
If I were a doctor,
I most certainly would.

760
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,166
-Your arm must be aching.
-It's all right.

761
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,544
I've never gotten stitches before.

762
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:38,465
You'll be given a numbing cream,
though I haven't gotten any myself.

763
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,022
Are you at the gym?

764
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:57,525
Yes, are you here?

765
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,612
No, I was just wondering
if you were there.

766
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:04,115
I see. Well, I just got here
and am by the lockers.

767
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:06,993
Got it.

768
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:22,008
-It doesn't seem like you need stitches.
-Really?

769
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,677
The wound is only superficial.

770
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,137
But it bled a lot.

771
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,181
This part has a lot of capillaries.

772
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:31,059
-I see.
-Anyway, it'll heal in a few days.

773
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,061
How will you wash your face?

774
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:35,188
I'll just have to use a wet towel.

775
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:36,982
I must look ridiculous.

776
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,818
You're lucky it wasn't anything serious.

777
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:42,529
What if you injured your eye instead?

778
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,323
Tell me about it.
The thought's scary enough.

779
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,245
-You probably didn't have dinner.
-I'll grab some at home.

780
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:53,707
I keep causing you inconvenience.

781
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,876
It's over 8 p.m. You must be so hungry.

782
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,753
I enjoy being on an empty stomach.

783
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,133
I can't go anywhere
looking like this though.

784
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:06,302
You had quite the shock today,
so you should go home and rest.

785
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,263
The wound will heal faster that way.

786
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,849
I didn't get any bad signs in my dreams.

787
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,226
Does that happen often?

788
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:15,520
If it did, I would've had a premonition.

789
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:19,399
Will you not accept my gift
even though it's nothing grand?

790
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,776
I'm keeping the letter and flowers,
of course.

791
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,697
My wife will be so excited when she hears
you made the bouquet yourself.

792
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:31,786
May I take this call?
It's from a friend in Hong Kong.

793
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:32,829
Sure.

794
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:35,498
Will a long conversation be okay?

795
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,083
Of course.

796
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,296
Hey, Chichi.

797
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,174
I'm in a car.

798
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:48,011
Did you argue with your fiance again?

799
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,308
RIVER PARK FITNESS

800
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:10,366
-Hi, there.
-Goodness.

801
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,043
I got into it with my wife

802
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,420
but had nowhere to go.

803
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,131
I wasn't in the mood to work out either.

804
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,008
Why don't you wait for me elsewhere?

805
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:30,512
I'll change into something
more appropriate than these leggings.

806
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:43,942
Yes?

807
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,861
Would it be okay for me to drink?

808
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:47,987
Sure.

809
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,740
Do you know Deokdam House? It's nearby.

810
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:51,908
Yes, I know the place.

811
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,704
I'll have a glass.

812
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:59,374
No, not after the workout you did.

813
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:00,583
It's all right.

814
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,196
My wife…

815
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:34,409
Instead of TMI, she's TMM.

816
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:35,952
Too much makeup.

817
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:42,041
She's gotten older now,
so to see her up close…

818
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,713
Well, it makes me uncomfortable.

819
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,299
Her lashes look like they can stab.

820
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:53,720
So I suggested that
she wear a more natural look.

821
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:01,060
-You're home.
-Hey. What are you up to?

822
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:03,563
I'm reheating the rice.

823
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,399
Let's eat out.

824
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,403
Let's eat at home at least once a day.

825
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,654
But I had rice for lunch.

826
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,324
-Shall we grill some meat?
-But it's frozen.

827
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:16,618
It'll defrost faster
than going out for a meal.

828
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,162
-Let's go to Happy Dinner.
-At this hour?

829
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,622
We'll be stuck in traffic.

830
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:23,500
Then someplace else nearby.
I'm craving a katsu sandwich.

831
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,753
Okay?

832
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:30,673
-Got it.
-Be ready in ten minutes.

833
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,175
I'm starving.

834
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,684
-A katsu sandwich, please.
-Curry udon for me.

835
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,896
-It doesn't have to be served together.
-Sure.

836
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:50,693
-Curry elevates your blood sugar level.
-Practically everything does.

837
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,862
You seem to be in a bad mood.

838
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:53,988
Of course not.

839
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,919
-Have a piece.
-I don't like pork cutlets.

840
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,713
This isn't the same.
Besides, you love sandwiches.

841
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:13,716
Honey,

842
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:18,054
why don't you wear lighter makeup now?

843
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,848
-A soda, please.
-Sure.

844
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:22,350
What do you think?

845
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:25,687
Don't bother to change me.
I'll never change.

846
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:28,439
-But people stare at you.
-I enjoy it.

847
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,483
Just when we eat out then.

848
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,986
To see people glancing at you
makes me uncomfortable.

849
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,573
Koreans sure take
a lot of interest in others.

850
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,032
I won't let it faze me.

851
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:41,202
Aren't you aware that
people call you a raccoon online?

852
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:45,331
Someone whispered it while we were in line
at a restaurant the other day.

853
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,381
Unbelievable.
What's gotten into you these days?

854
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:55,508
You upset me every chance you get.

855
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:59,429
The kid that just left whispered something
to her mom while looking at you.

856
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,847
Then don't be around me.

857
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,068
And?

858
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,779
I took two bites and left.

859
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,158
Was I wrong?

860
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:24,203
Well, I guess you're allowed to say it
since you're family.

861
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:27,540
But I do believe that we should

862
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,918
only talk about positive things
during meals.

863
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,547
You weren't wrong to say it.

864
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:38,217
You have a right not to like
the look your beloved wife gets

865
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,719
from other people.

866
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:45,808
But in Buddhism,
we're told not to judge or discriminate.

867
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:48,269
Right or wrong.

868
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:51,105
Logical or illogical.

869
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:55,068
Rather than being the judge of that,
you should just accept everything.

870
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,655
I wanted to stay home
and eat a simple meal,

871
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,740
-but I let her have her way.
-Keep at it.

872
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,158
Must it always be me?

873
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:03,785
You're being judgmental again.

874
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:09,123
"I let you have your way with one thing,
so why can't you appreciate that?"

875
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:13,586
I'm aware that
it's upsetting to never be appreciated,

876
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,255
but you can't change a person
to your liking.

877
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:20,677
Demanding something impossible
and arguing about it

878
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,887
will only ruin your marriage.

879
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:28,059
You can voice your opinion now and then

880
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:29,352
when in a good mood,

881
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:33,272
but it's better to give up
when the other person

882
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:34,899
has no intention of changing.

883
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,528
Everything depends on how you think.

884
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:40,780
So changing your views and thoughts
is easier

885
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,824
than changing those of another person.

886
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:48,746
Imagine your wife having a huge accident.

887
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:52,834
If she ends up in a coma,

888
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:56,129
you won't care
if she'll wear heavier makeup

889
01:01:56,212 --> 01:02:00,007
if she can wake up and walk again.

890
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:04,762
That's what I told myself
over and over again

891
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,723
during the five years of my marriage.

892
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,101
Every time, I find you amazing

893
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,729
in many ways.

894
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:14,939
It all depends on how you think.

895
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:32,081
Women aren't thoughtless beings, you know.

896
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:36,043
Let us have our way once,
and we'll repay you in double.

897
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:38,504
That depends on the person.

898
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:42,383
My wife is the type of person
who gets her way five times

899
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:44,010
and wishes for ten more.

900
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:48,055
Rather than being grateful,
she takes me for granted.

901
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,224
What can you do, though?

902
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:53,311
You'll have to either divorce her
or let her win.

903
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:55,772
Is it spiritual energy I lack?
Is that the case?

904
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:00,485
The one with the bigger heart
always yields.

905
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:03,905
You, Xiexian,
don't lack any energy at all.

906
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,699
You're just too generous and considerate.

907
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:20,129
Listening to what you have to say
always makes me feel calm and at peace.

908
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,173
Go home and extend an olive branch.

909
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:26,260
Don't go empty-handed, though.
Buy some flowers on the way.

910
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:29,764
How happy would I be
to live with a woman like her?

911
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:45,738
Stop judging and just accept everything.

912
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,114
It's not even that hard.

913
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:50,326
I bet you never judge me.

914
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:52,411
How about I give it a shot?

915
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:56,791
Judge my pros and cons
as well as my personality.

916
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,378
Accept me for who I am too.

917
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,992
Wow. Mom.

918
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:32,535
Mom.

919
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,913
It's been a while
since Dad bought you flowers.

920
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:38,749
I know.

921
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,007
Thanks.

922
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:52,680
-Where did you get them at this hour?
-You can search online.

923
01:04:55,766 --> 01:04:58,060
-Actually--
-These are for me, right?

924
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:00,605
Of course. Who else would I give them?

925
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:02,189
Our daughter.

926
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,860
She can get some from her own boyfriend.

927
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,487
If only I had one.

928
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,780
-Where's U-ram?
-The bathroom.

929
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:12,909
I should get these in some water
before they wilt.

930
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:21,542
Dad.

931
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,630
You should buy Mom flowers often.
She loves it.

932
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:28,049
Right.

933
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:41,354
Lilacs will be in full bloom
soon in Korea.

934
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:08,297
It's kind of embarrassing
to take these back.

935
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:12,635
It was enough of an honor to have received
your handwritten letter.

936
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,096
I only wanted to thank you.

937
01:06:15,846 --> 01:06:17,556
Well, you know how I feel.

938
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,476
Once again, I put you out.
Thank you so much.

939
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,478
Don't be ridiculous.

940
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:24,730
Anyway…

941
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,651
-Yes?
-You see,

942
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:32,530
I've become a fan of yours.

943
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:36,242
I'll see you next week.

944
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:50,131
Why don't you have some tea

945
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:52,258
at my house?

946
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,376
-You're so funny.
-May I ask how old you are?

947
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:29,503
About graduating?

948
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,881
-You'd rather get a divorce?
-Yes.

949
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:34,050
There are twice as many
at my house in Yangpyeong.

950
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,551
You have a house in Yangpyeong?

951
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:38,054
He's handsome and well-educated.

952
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:41,682
Let's make him drink a lot the day
after tomorrow and find out about him.

953
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:43,601
-You three can share them.
-What are they?

954
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:46,812
-You know…
-Are we saying goodbye today?

955
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:49,648
Hye-ryung sure is generous.

956
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,318
-Why are you so quiet?
-I just don't want to agree with you.

957
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:55,279
Are you saying you don't like
me or Hye-ryung?

958
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:57,156
I'm bad at grilling meat. What do I do?

959
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,365
I'll do it.

960
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:00,451
You want to hit me, don't you?
Get a divorce!

961
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:03,329
Fine, let's do it!

962
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:07,458
Mr. Park. Could you hold me for a moment?

963
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:13,506
