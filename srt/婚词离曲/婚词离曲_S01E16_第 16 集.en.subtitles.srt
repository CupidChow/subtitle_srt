EPISODE 16

2
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,143
Professor.

3
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,439
Could you

4
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,776
hold me for a moment?

5
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:20,914
Then, how about
you fix it some other time?

6
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,000
Music at this hour
might disturb the neighbors.

7
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,711
You're right.
I should do it in the daytime.

8
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,130
Is it hard for you
to make time on weekends?

9
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,965
Weekends are better, actually.

10
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,551
Mr. Park.

11
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,971
That sounds distant, right?

12
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,015
You can address me as your senior.

13
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,183
No.

14
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,143
Why not?

15
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,063
Because it'll make us seem too distant.

16
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,941
Although, we are kind of distant.

17
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,193
Do you…

18
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,862
find me distant?

19
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,491
Isn't that the case?
It's not like we're friends.

20
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,201
That day…

21
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,204
When you sang for me in the park,

22
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,957
I was deeply moved.

23
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,669
I performed just for you.

24
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,131
Let's just call each other Professor.

25
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,340
Sure thing.

26
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,886
You know, you keep amazing me.

27
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,350
Nonsense. It's not like
I've been all that good to you.

28
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:25,562
You have been.
You're kind and generous too.

29
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,188
You make people feel at ease.

30
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,482
I'm glad you're comfortable around me.

31
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,403
What kind of women do you find attractive?

32
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,740
-I haven't thought about it.
-You should.

33
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,952
I'll think about it. How about you?

34
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,790
I hear women often find it attractive
when men are behind the wheel.

35
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,502
Especially when they roll up their sleeves
and steer in reverse with one arm.

36
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,505
-No, I don't.
-Then what?

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,177
I don't know. As I grow older,

38
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:03,808
I've been leaning toward men
who are kind and attentive.

39
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,519
THAT MEANS ME…

40
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,105
Anyway, you had your time to think.

41
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,903
Someone similar to
but also different from my mother.

42
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,031
What was your mother like?

43
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,618
She was cheerful and full of excitement.

44
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,914
However, she wasn't all that healthy.

45
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,250
Raising two fussy sons

46
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:33,171
and living with her parents-in-law
wasn't easy.

47
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,006
Of course not.

48
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,300
We were all men
except for her and my grandma,

49
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,928
so she always had to cook a great amount.

50
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,138
Like many mothers in the past,

51
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,599
she had to overwork herself.

52
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,937
I told you what happened
to my twin brother, right?

53
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,772
Yes.

54
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,733
Her condition worsened rapidly after that.

55
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,195
When I picture her,

56
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,240
all I can see is how sick she was.

57
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,869
So the woman of my dreams
would be someone as cheerful as her

58
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,999
and someone who'd never fall ill
like she did.

59
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,586
Your wife must be healthy
and cheerful all the time then.

60
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,756
Why do you think that?

61
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,550
Because we normally end up
with those we dream of.

62
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,357
All I asked for was ramyeon,

63
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,317
but you prepared quite a spread.

64
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,444
I can hardly take credit for this.

65
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,655
I ordered these to-go at a restaurant.

66
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,493
Though I can hardly cook, I love to eat.

67
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,246
Do you stick to delivery food then?

68
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,041
No, but I mostly eat out.

69
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,962
Laugh at me all you want,
but I can't help it.

70
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,297
Nonsense.

71
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,133
We're all different
with different talents.

72
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,676
Cooking is…

73
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,595
Well, even kids can make a pot of ramyeon.

74
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,014
Anyway, Ga-bin…

75
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,143
-I mean, Professor.
-Please call me by my name.

76
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,397
Not everyone has the talent you have.

77
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,400
Practicing for a decade
won't make me as good as you.

78
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,360
You're avoiding my question.

79
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:24,324
I asked if your wife is
cheerful and healthy.

80
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,078
Her job brings her pain.

81
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,415
She's suffering from wrist pain
due to all the typing.

82
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,418
And she's more of the quiet type.

83
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,340
How happy are you?

84
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,427
Must you think to answer that?

85
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,513
Yes.

86
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:51,434
Happiness isn't something
you have to think about.

87
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,269
You just feel it.

88
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,022
Do you feel happy?

89
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,650
Place your hand over your heart.

90
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,535
You see,

91
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,122
up to about five or six times a day,

92
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,627
I do this.

93
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:23,424
Because of the loneliness
and the aching I feel.

94
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,970
Professor.

95
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,555
Yes?

96
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,559
Could I hold a place in your heart?

97
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,646
Or would you like a place in mine?

98
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,819
Could you hold me for a moment?

99
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,949
Is that a no?

100
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,743
I'm not sure if I'm worthy…

101
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,370
Worthy in what way?

102
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,289
No one needs to be worthy to hug another.

103
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,294
I'd be crossing the line with you.

104
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:08,261
People only laugh for two reasons.

105
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,930
When they find something funny

106
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,558
or try to hide their true feelings.

107
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,851
In my case,

108
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,104
it's the latter.

109
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,731
Is it hard to live far away
from your family?

110
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:25,528
How much do you have to love someone
to want to marry them?

111
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,449
I married when I was young and clueless.

112
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,327
What I thought love was when I was young,

113
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,290
is quite different from what I think it is
now that I'm pretty old.

114
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,041
In what way?

115
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,712
As a young man,
I mistook unconditional emotions for…

116
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,339
Actually, I wasn't mistaken,

117
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:49,969
but love isn't as simple as I thought.

118
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,679
Don't you dream

119
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,599
of another chance at love?

120
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,434
My honest answer is yes.

121
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,062
I'm being honest
because I want to open up to you.

122
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,776
Anyway, I should get going.

123
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,613
It's quite late.

124
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,190
I can feel your warmth.

125
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,539
Grill the meat a little longer

126
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,332
-for table number eight.
-Sure.

127
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,962
You have a reservation under…

128
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,922
-Ms. Boo Hye-ryung.
-Oh, right.

129
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,801
I'm sorry, but where's the restroom?

130
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,939
-My gosh, Si-eun!
-You look amazing today.

131
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,482
I hardly recognized you.

132
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,371
-The script was nice today.
-Right.

133
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,542
Oh, hey.

134
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,840
Did you drive here?

135
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,219
No, I took a cab.

136
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,762
Then, we're good to drink.

137
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,473
It's like you both
came right out of a magazine.

138
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,268
You look like models in magazines.

139
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,479
I thought we'd stand out,

140
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,942
-but we blend right in.
-A woman can't be guilty of dressing up.

141
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,527
Well, I guess I'm guilty.

142
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,406
Out of the customers here,
I think I'm the oldest one.

143
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,035
Don't worry, Si-eun.
The lights will save you.

144
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,124
When did I get so old?

145
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,211
You look pathetic, Si-eun.

146
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,554
Did you have fun today?

147
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,723
Have a seat.

148
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,064
Don't grow old too fast.

149
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,483
Eat well, doll yourself up,

150
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,111
and enjoy life as you live it.

151
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,365
Mom, you look great today.

152
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,701
You think so because you're my daughter.

153
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,120
You know…

154
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,165
I'm not saying I regret my life,

155
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:12,004
but I hope you marry a man
way more competent than your father.

156
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,092
So that you can always live
like a princess,

157
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,553
spending every penny you earn on yourself.

158
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,806
Dad's home.

159
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,856
I bet he'll be blown away
by my beauty today.

160
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,278
Shouldn't he be the one waiting?
Where are his manners?

161
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,863
He's not late or anything.

162
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,490
A guy should arrive early and wait.

163
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,283
What do you expect from Mr. Seo?

164
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,701
Here he comes.

165
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,248
Here comes the model.

166
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,459
You're here early.

167
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,795
There wasn't much traffic
near the restaurant.

168
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,673
You should dress like that all the time.

169
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,217
Regardless of occasions?

170
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,889
-You look a lot like your older sister.
-Sorry?

171
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,435
-Do you know her?
-Aren't you Ms. Lee's younger sister?

172
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,400
-I didn't know you could crack jokes.
-I meant it.

173
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,116
Annoying prick.

174
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,368
What? Am I an annoying prick?

175
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,079
No, the executive manager of my show.

176
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,205
Why?

177
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,916
There's just something annoying about him.

178
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,880
Aren't you spending too much?

179
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,800
You gave me my nickname, remember? "Boom."

180
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,470
How did you come up with it?

181
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:46,098
From your surname.
It has a good meaning in English too.

182
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,017
I just elongated Boo.

183
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,561
-It reminds you of our jingle too.
-Right.

184
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,023
Let me pour you a glass
as a token of gratitude.

185
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,160
You can't deny the power of a name.

186
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,206
And thanks to the nickname,
we're getting good ratings.

187
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,667
It's thanks to Ms. Lee's scripts,
Ms. Sa's producing skills,

188
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,003
and your talent as a host.

189
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,297
-Are you being humble?
-It's my honest opinion.

190
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,383
-Mr. Seo.
-Yes?

191
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,803
Are you pretending not to be drunk
when you are,

192
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,889
or are you really not drunk?

193
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,724
I'm slightly tipsy, I guess.

194
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,354
I see you can hold your liquor.

195
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,356
It's one of those days.

196
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,192
When was your last relationship?

197
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,196
Or are you currently in a relationship?

198
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,907
-Must I answer that?
-Well, I asked.

199
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,826
It's rude to ignore someone's question.

200
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,538
-Are you upset about something?
-No.

201
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,457
Don't try to wriggle out of this one.

202
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,167
She's on my side.

203
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,506
Flirting has become a trend.
Does that count?

204
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:04,218
Would it kill you
to just tell us the truth like a man?

205
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,844
You want me to be honest?

206
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,098
I'm not interested in dating.

207
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,560
It's bound to end,
so I see it as a waste of emotions.

208
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,144
Gosh.

209
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,106
You must never want
to suffer a loss in life.

210
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,276
A loss? That's not why I don't date.

211
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,194
I'm just not sure if it's meaningful.

212
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:26,282
Then, when was the last time
you wasted your emotions?

213
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,580
It's been a while. At least, in my book.

214
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,415
You should put it in figures.

215
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,543
A few months? A few years?

216
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,547
-I won't.
-You won't answer us?

217
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,756
-No.
-Why not?

218
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,174
It feels like an interrogation.

219
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:48,512
We're asking about you
because we want to know more about you.

220
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,639
We're a team, right?

221
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:55,477
Women even ask
what kind of cutlery their friends have.

222
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,687
I see.

223
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,573
Is there anything you wanted to tell us?

224
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,325
Any job-related advice?

225
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,494
Like I said earlier,
you're all good at your jobs.

226
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,166
Mr. Seo, did your childhood dream
come true?

227
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,920
I dreamed of becoming a pilot as a kid.

228
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,090
But?

229
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,217
My mother was against it, so I gave up.

230
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,719
My mother described it as…

231
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,848
being in a flower garden
because women dig pilots. She hated it.

232
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,603
Wait. Would you say you're
in a flower garden right now?

233
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,856
Or in a field of cabbages?

234
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,570
A field of cabbages and one white radish.

235
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,247
Why did you buy so many
when you barely wear makeup?

236
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,208
They're from my first commercial.

237
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,336
-Cosmetics commercial?
-Yes.

238
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,713
It's the best kind one can wish for.

239
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,216
That's great. Congratulations.

240
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,513
Aren't there any for men?

241
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,848
This sunscreen. For when you golf.

242
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,686
I was only joking.
Keep them all to yourself.

243
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:23,232
And saving up some of your first earning
is considered to bring you luck.

244
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,858
So don't spend it all.

245
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,151
But I was going to.

246
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,445
Do as I say, sweetie.

247
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,406
Of course.

248
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,618
Give these to the nurses if you want.

249
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,764
Turning off.

250
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,939
You're home late, young lady.

251
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,360
Young lady?
"Young" isn't the word I'd use.

252
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,280
You are to me, always.

253
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,057
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

254
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,350
Did Dr. Shin head inside?

255
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,353
-I didn't see him.
-But he was sitting right here.

256
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,530
He's not here.

257
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,450
Could you perhaps check the bathroom?

258
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:57,910
Sure.

259
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,544
There. Over there!

260
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,213
My gosh.

261
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,632
Dr. Shin!

262
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,182
My gosh!

263
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,784
Dr. Shin!

264
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,916
Dr. Shin…

265
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,974
Dong-mi.

266
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,394
Dong-mi?

267
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,529
Maybe I should've let you sleep some more.

268
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,374
-Did you have a dream?
-A disappointing one.

269
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,501
Then why were you smiling?

270
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,129
Was I smiling?

271
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,134
-Unbelievable.
-Tell me.

272
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,720
I'm good at interpreting them.

273
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,389
I thought I won the lottery, but…

274
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,436
Dreams during a nap
don't mean anything anyway.

275
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,731
What would you like for dinner?

276
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:53,567
Anything you make is
fine by me, of course.

277
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,447
-Even poison?
-Yes, as long as we take it together.

278
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,325
And die together? Are you insane?

279
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,372
Gosh, it's Yu-sin.

280
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:13,003
I'm off to the bathroom.
My stomach's tingling.

281
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:14,838
Here.

282
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,592
-What's this?
-Some cosmetics.

283
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,386
But it's not even my birthday.

284
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,684
-Did Pi-young buy this?
-No, I received it as a gift.

285
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,651
I was running out, you know.

286
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,819
-This is the brand I use.
-I'm glad.

287
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,781
Back in the day,
it would've been worth a kiss.

288
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:42,699
Go ahead.

289
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,504
-Stay for dinner.
-Sure.

290
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,882
Dad's taking a while.
Is his constipation bad?

291
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,133
It's habitual.

292
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:07,266
Meat? Dried yellow corvina? Or maybe both.

293
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,183
That's right.

294
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,979
Gosh, look ahead of you.

295
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,606
Right, look ahead. Jeez.

296
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,235
Okay, I think I got it. I got it.

297
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,407
Hold on.

298
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,669
You should treat us to celebrate the fall.

299
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,504
Pick a date then.

300
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,674
Not today, so how about next week?

301
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,134
Sure.

302
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,304
I'm glad my daughter wasn't here.
She would've been shocked.

303
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,017
Girls these days aren't fazed that easily.
They're bolder than boys.

304
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,978
This is my son.

305
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,605
Gosh, he seems like a reliable one.

306
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:59,151
Let's raise our children well
and set them up one day.

307
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,569
Sounds good.

308
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,282
Your patients have been
saying good things about you.

309
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,578
-Like what?
-He's not only a good doctor,

310
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,039
but also the most attentive husband.

311
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,835
We both know how difficult that is.

312
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,465
Don't look at me. I'm good to my wife.

313
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:26,553
I guess it's just me then.
My wife nags me all the time.

314
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,806
I don't know why though
considering all the money I make.

315
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,684
Money isn't everything to them.

316
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:36,146
Must I bring home a fortune
and then kiss up to her?

317
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:39,483
Why would you think of it that way?
No one likes buttering.

318
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,860
You should express your love.

319
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:45,322
Easier said than done. Are you sure
that's from a man's perspective?

320
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,741
When my juniors ask me for marital advice,

321
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:51,953
I tell them to decide whether they'll live
as a father or as a son.

322
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,371
I chose to be a father.

323
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:57,834
And you, Dr. Shin?

324
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:02,172
I don't think I'm a good father
and definitely not a good son.

325
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,883
But I think I'm better at being a dad.

326
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,718
I think so too.

327
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:11,556
I guess I'm like a son, then.
One that gets scolded all the time.

328
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:18,105
No wonder my wife tells people
that she has a daughter and a "son."

329
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,192
Why not change your ways
and be more of the child's dad then?

330
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,194
It's my wife.

331
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,487
Please go ahead.

332
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,367
-Yes?
-Dad,

333
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,830
a chair with back support is being sold
on a TV shopping channel. Can I buy one?

334
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,749
For whom? For you, honey?

335
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,128
WHY NOT CALL HER DAUGHTER INSTEAD?

336
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,717
I never got to learn how to ride a bike.
I only rode a kick scooter.

337
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,803
But better late than never, right?

338
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,764
I never got to learn to swim
because of my fear of water.

339
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,225
-Because of a near-drowning?
-No, it just scares me.

340
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,394
-I'll teach you then.
-No way.

341
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,522
-Why not?
-I'd rather learn from a coach.

342
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,941
I took up private lessons
from a pro swimmer.

343
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,610
Bang Jun-cheol's my cousin.

344
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,528
My gosh.

345
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,882
How he feels about me
differs from how he feels about his wife.

346
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,302
Should we go flower-viewing?

347
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,262
Spring flowers are in bloom.

348
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,473
-But the air's chilly today.
-We'll bundle up then.

349
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,851
You'll catch a cold.

350
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,680
I'm sorry.
I thought you were someone else.

351
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,749
PROFESSOR PARK HAE-RYUN

352
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,420
Hello?

353
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,422
This is Park Hae-ryun.

354
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,258
Yes, Professor.

355
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,969
You left again without saying anything
yesterday.

356
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,178
Right.

357
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,390
I should fix your speakers,
but you must be busy.

358
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,685
I already had it fixed.

359
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,021
-You did?
-Yes.

360
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,816
A friend of mine came over.

361
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:13,280
I was meaning to tell you this in person,

362
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:17,284
but I'd like to quit teaching
after this semester.

363
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,412
This semester?

364
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:24,708
Yes, so I think you should
start looking for my replacement.

365
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:26,710
But why?

366
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:31,256
I just realized that
it's a bit too much for me, I'm afraid.

367
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,883
But the students enjoy your class

368
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,261
and you mentioned the job was worthwhile.

369
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,388
My head must've been in the clouds.

370
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,598
Anyway, I'm sorry about this.

371
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,479
I'll hand in
my official resignation next week.

372
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,607
Is it bad?

373
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,652
Okay. Bye, Si-eun.

374
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,614
Professor Park can't make it.
He has the flu.

375
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,200
He must be working hard
even during the break.

376
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,410
Tell me about it.

377
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,830
-Did you pack the beach ball too?
-Of course.

378
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,499
-Ji-a.
-Coming!

379
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,337
Hey, Gi-ppeum.

380
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:14,341
I can't go. My family and I
are going on a staycation at a hotel.

381
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,677
The Queen Hotel. Okay, bye.

382
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,597
Are they back from Europe?

383
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,141
Yes. I want to go to Europe too.

384
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,602
You can go backpacking
once you're in college.

385
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,188
Yes?

386
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,773
Can't you make it happen?

387
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:34,194
I think I'm the only one in my class
who hasn't been to Europe.

388
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,321
Many haven't even been to Southeast Asia,

389
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,740
and some of my friends
haven't even been to Japan.

390
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:42,077
People must live looking down,
not looking up.

391
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,893
Let's go and enjoy the fall foliage.

392
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,480
There wouldn't be any in September.

393
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,066
There would be in Gangwon Province.

394
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:16,861
Even in Gangwon Province,
one must wait until October.

395
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,029
Is that so?

396
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,910
This can't be a sign of dementia, can it?

397
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,745
That would be terrible.

398
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,680
First floor.

399
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,516
Let's have wine pairing dinner.

400
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:50,520
Don't just drop me off today.
I don't want to come home alone tipsy.

401
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,564
Sure.

402
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,822
Ask me where I am.

403
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,450
Where are you? On vacation with Dad?

404
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,576
No, Incheon Airport.

405
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,162
You're joking, right?

406
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,872
Why would I be joking?

407
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,416
I'll take a cab and be there in an hour.

408
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,501
Dad too?

409
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,962
Of course not. You know how busy he is.

410
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,215
Are you really in Korea?

411
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,217
Should I make a video call?

412
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,636
You should've told me
before getting on the plane.

413
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,766
-Do you need my address?
-I already have it.

414
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:32,020
Anyway, it might take more than
an hour and a half due to the traffic.

415
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,938
Sure.

416
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,690
My mom's in Korea.

417
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,859
I'll cancel our reservation.

418
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,362
Only text me for the time being.
No, wait for my text.

419
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,156
I'm sorry.

420
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,034
For what? Go on upstairs, then.

421
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,083
The doors are closing.

422
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,423
Hello?

423
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,425
-Are you still at work?
-I'm getting off.

424
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,677
-Meet me then.
-What about horse riding?

425
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,222
I'd rather see you than the horses.

426
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,224
Where should we meet?

427
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,892
Morning in Paris. My name.

428
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,603
You booked it knowing I could have plans?

429
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,647
I had a hunch.

430
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,192
I'll wait there, so see you later.
Drive safely.

431
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,443
Sure.

432
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,446
Yu-sin suggested a date.

433
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,616
It's like you're still
in your honeymoon phase.

434
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:30,870
Could you ask your husband to tutor
Sa-hyeon on how to be a good husband?

435
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,831
Your husband's not so bad, you know.

436
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,416
I'm looking for perfection, not mediocre.

437
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,710
-He'll get better at it.
-When? In old age?

438
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,797
Dr. Shin's been a sweetheart
since the very beginning.

439
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,591
Well, marrying well
is the greatest luck of all.

440
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,135
You don't have any complaints
with your husband.

441
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:50,014
I guess. He's not one
to excite you in any way,

442
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,685
but he brings calmness
just like a homemade soup.

443
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,044
Mom!

444
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,758
Here, wear these.

445
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:31,556
Gosh, look at my daughter.
You seem better, you know.

446
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,683
Korea's been serving me well.

447
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,978
Seeing you in person
finally puts me at ease.

448
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,815
-Mom, let me.
-Sure.

449
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,363
Dad said to buy an apartment
if you think you'll be staying here long.

450
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,532
That'd be great, but Gangnam's not cheap.

451
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:52,535
As if that matters.
We can easily afford it.

452
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,580
Did you eat anything on the plane?

453
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,248
Yes, bibimbap.

454
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,375
Still, you'll soon get hungry again.

455
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,503
As I said on the phone, Korea is the best.

456
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,590
It changed a lot since you last visited.

457
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,343
-Do you want some tea?
-No, water would be fine.

458
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,929
-Heated, if you can.
-Sure.

459
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,893
You seem much livelier than before.

460
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,854
There's a sparkle in your eyes as well.

461
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,815
Is it Korea that you love
or the job you do?

462
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:23,733
Both.

463
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,528
Has any guy shown interest in you?

464
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:32,825
Don't date just anyone, though.
Women must always be careful,

465
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,286
especially since you're here on your own.

466
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,537
Okay.

467
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,873
-Thank you.
-No problem.

468
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,254
Maybe we shouldn't have paired the wine.

469
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,465
My body's an uncontrollable mess,

470
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,592
but I feel great.

471
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,845
There's no issue with that.
I'll carry you.

472
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,015
That won't be necessary.

473
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,193
Come on.

474
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,534
Bridal style or a piggyback ride?

475
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:18,162
-You're just as tipsy.
-When I only had a few glasses of wine?

476
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,791
Here.

477
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,544
I'm good.

478
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:26,754
Someone will see us.

479
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,049
No one's here.
Besides, who cares if someone does?

480
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,345
Let's go!

481
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,140
Put me down.

482
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,895
Ji-a will tease me about this.

483
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,398
-Do you love me?
-Must you ask?

484
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,775
Well, I asked you.

485
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,277
You ask me all the time.

486
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,906
How much do you love me?

487
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,867
-A lot.
-That's not enough.

488
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,618
Then what?

489
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,412
Give me a proper answer.

490
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,706
I did give you a proper answer.

491
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:05,084
I'm going to pull your hair, you know.

492
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,463
Go ahead.
I'll just be one of those husbands.

493
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,214
Unbelievable.

494
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,176
All right.

495
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,518
-Want me to undress you?
-Forget it.

496
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,688
You can't be bothered with anything
when you're drunk.

497
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,357
I'm fine, you know.

498
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,778
No, you're not.
Besides, I want to undress you.

499
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,572
Just do as I say, will you?

500
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,658
Did you have to wear
something so complicated?

501
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,869
Stop that.

502
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,348
Yes?

503
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,101
-Did I wake you?
-No.

504
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,979
I'm in front of your house,
but the lights are out.

505
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,689
I'm not at home.

506
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,150
Then where are you?

507
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,194
I'm just somewhere else.

508
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:18,449
I see. Well, I came by to ask you
to go see the Gangneung sea with me.

509
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,333
Hello?

510
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,085
Listen carefully, okay?

511
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,091
XIEXIAN

512
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,553
I hear waves crashing.

513
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,596
That's right.

514
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,932
Where are you? I'll be right there.

515
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:46,185
Gangneung. I'm at a hotel in Gangneung.

516
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,521
Really?

517
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,064
Yes.

518
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,899
Stay awake until I get there, okay?

519
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,736
Sure thing.
Why are you coming over here though?

520
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,864
I'll tell you when I get there. See you.

521
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,699
Okay.

522
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:24,098
The phone you have called is switched off.
You'll be directed to voicemail.

523
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,965
What brings you here?

524
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,098
Have you eaten?

525
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,809
No, but I don't have an appetite.

526
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,605
Why not? You must be upset again.

527
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:23,074
Come on.
There's a 24-hour restaurant nearby.

528
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,369
-When did you get here?
-Early in the afternoon.

529
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,746
-Why?
-No reason.

530
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,248
I love it here, you see.

531
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,962
-Me too.
-You're being informal.

532
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,338
Sorry about that.

533
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,093
-I'm home.
-Hey.

534
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,348
You're home earlier than usual.

535
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,986
-Why are you throwing those away?
-They taste funny.

536
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,154
We should've eaten them
before they went bad.

537
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,199
When though? We can't always eat at home.

538
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,909
But…

539
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,870
I'm just speechless.

540
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,291
Have you been throwing away
my mom's food like this?

541
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,709
Not all of it.

542
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,127
How can you?

543
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,505
You should've at least frozen them.

544
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,507
It'll only last a couple of months.

545
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,843
You should've told her
to stop sending them then.

546
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,637
How can I when it's her joy
to cook and send food to us?

547
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:30,766
To be blunt, it's not for me, is it?
It's all for her youngest son.

548
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,059
Are you serious?

549
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,187
I'm not blaming her.
I'm saying it's just how all parents feel.

550
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,442
Is this how you were raised?
To throw out food without any guilt?

551
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,363
Are you saying
my parents didn't raise me well?

552
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,991
-My mother made this food with love--
-What then?

553
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:50,119
-Must we eat what went bad?
-It'll be okay once reheated.

554
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,038
And slightly spoiled food won't kill us.

555
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,081
It's a sin to throw out food like this.

556
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,876
But she always sends too much.

557
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,003
Then we should eat it more often.

558
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,921
For breakfast and for dinner.

559
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,383
Then do it yourself.
Why should it be my job?

560
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,844
Don't expect me to do what you can't do.

561
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,806
Am I wrong?

562
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,938
No, what you said is right,
so let's drop it.

563
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:27,448
Call my mom
and tell her to stop sending food.

564
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,535
Then she'll be worried
that you might not be eating well.

565
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,372
That's the truth though.
I never eat breakfast at home.

566
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,415
Then she'll know I've been lying.

567
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,042
It's better than throwing it away.

568
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,877
The waste is turned into animal feed.

569
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,296
-It doesn't rot away.
-Can you be sure?

570
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,383
Besides, it's for animals, not people.

571
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,885
My mom made the food for us to eat.

572
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,346
Cooking isn't an easy task.

573
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,517
You complain about it
even when you only cook on holidays.

574
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,064
One should not have to live like this!

575
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,895
Don't you have any clothes in your car?

576
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,984
No, I just undid my tie on the way here.

577
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,570
It's really cold by the sea in the fall.

578
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:53,909
Isn't divorce the right thing to do?
My wife says it all the time.

579
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,453
Of course not.

580
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:59,039
That sort of thing is never enough
to make a woman want to seek a divorce.

581
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,291
It's all just words.

582
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,126
I'm not at fault here, right?

583
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,670
Distinguishing right and wrong
won't do you any good.

584
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:05,921
It's just that…

585
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,011
we're so different. In every way possible.

586
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,138
How could she throw away the food
like that?

587
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,765
That, I agree with you.

588
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,145
Tell your mom in a way
that she'll understand.

589
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,147
That you're both too busy these days

590
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,734
and that skipping breakfast
is actually beneficial to one's health.

591
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:32,865
And you can always give me
the side dishes you don't eat.

592
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,117
I'll enjoy them all.

593
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,077
How could I?

594
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:41,415
I've been missing food made by my elders
ever since my mom passed away.

595
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,170
Anyway, please dig in.

596
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,718
-A bottle of soju, please.
-Sure.

597
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,515
Why don't we have seafood ramyeon?

598
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:01,018
No, wait. Spicy seafood stew with rice
would be better for our stomachs.

599
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,229
But you said you already had dinner.

600
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,648
Actually, it wasn't much of a meal.

601
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,107
Why?

602
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,068
I wasn't keen on eating alone.

603
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,695
Maybe I knew you'd join me.

604
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,366
Maybe it was really the telepathy thing.

605
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,138
You're not in the mood for drinks too?

606
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,516
I just don't want to drink alone.

607
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,894
-Shouldn't you call a driver?
-You want me to head back so soon?

608
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,063
Let's watch the sunrise
from the car together.

609
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,149
But it's only 11 p.m.

610
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,609
You must be sleepy.

611
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,820
Not really. I don't sleep much.

612
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,281
Your wife will be worried.

613
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,744
Even marriage has a golden hour.

614
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:05,040
If you don't make up in time,
the hatred will only run deeper.

615
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,750
It already runs deep.

616
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,294
It's only a lovers' quarrel.

617
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:15,175
-I should get going.
-Oh, let me pay.

618
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,386
Here.

619
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,389
-I'd like to pay the bill.
-Sure.

620
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,809
-Why?
-Because we came all this way,

621
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,227
and I got here first.

622
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:36,989
Gosh.

623
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,284
No, I'm fine. I have my coat on.

624
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,578
I don't want you catching a cold
because of me.

625
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,874
Call a driver fast.
The air's chilly tonight.

626
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,085
It's a refreshing contrast
to the hot stew.

627
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,591
Everything depends on how we view it.

628
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,969
Having a positive approach
makes things better.

629
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,556
A good person only thinks positively.

630
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,312
You just described yourself.

631
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:13,692
Go back to your wife
and compliment her once a day from now on.

632
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:18,072
You may not mean it at first,
but you will in the end.

633
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,710
I should end it.

634
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,755
It's best for us both.

635
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,299
You'll end your marriage?

636
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,345
Yes.

637
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,599
-Please take my advice.
-I always did,

638
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,394
-but not this time.
-Are you saying I'm wrong?

639
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,104
It's not about right or wrong.

640
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,690
I can't fully explain how I feel anyway.

641
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,993
Do you know the number
of the driver service?

642
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,790
Come upstairs for some tea first.

643
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:27,474
You can hold the tea.
Just say what's on your mind.

644
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,362
Even lifelong couples say

645
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:43,365
they felt an urge to get a divorce
several times.

646
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,909
Ending your marriage over this

647
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,370
will only bring sorrow
to your parents and hers.

648
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:52,249
You once said that sometimes
it's hard to control how you feel.

649
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,667
That's the state I'm in.

650
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:59,631
Part of me is willing to put up with her
and let it slide, but…

651
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,467
Then just focus on that.

652
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:07,431
I wish

653
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,851
I had met you sooner.

654
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,398
Anyway, it's still not too late.

655
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,026
What do you mean?

656
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,652
Song Yuan,

657
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,530
what do you think of me?

658
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,159
You don't have to say it since I feel it.

659
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:30,454
I know you can tell how I feel too.

660
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,666
Will you come back to Seoul tomorrow?

661
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,714
I'll sort out the situation I'm in
and officially propose to you.

662
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:42,591
That's nonsense.

663
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,677
You're lost in the heat of the moment.

664
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,388
-We'll talk about us later.
-I mean your divorce.

665
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,350
I'll text you when I arrive in Seoul.

666
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,269
Wait.

667
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,691
Do I not get a say in this?

668
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,151
Let me rephrase.

669
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:04,530
For reasons that don't include you,
I'm ending my marriage.

670
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,282
Wait!

671
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,540
Come sit.

672
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,855
It's still not too late for us.

673
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,400
You must take responsibility
for your actions.

674
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:44,152
You made your vows
in front of all those people.

675
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,572
I learned that
emotions shouldn't be promised,

676
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:49,283
and love is an emotion.

677
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,832
You think way too well of me.

678
00:47:57,499 --> 00:48:00,794
I get that I've only shown you
my better side.

679
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:05,090
You're right. We click in many ways
and enjoy each other's company.

680
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,051
-We comfort each other.
-Our personalities are compatible,

681
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,430
but that might just be it.
No, that I'm sure of.

682
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:15,892
Your wife is 33, and I'm 42.

683
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,313
I'm ten years older than you.

684
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,690
Age doesn't matter.

685
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:24,109
Some people at my age
even experience menopause.

686
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:27,446
-I'll reach menopause soon.
-So?

687
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,448
I know what men are like.

688
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,491
I was married for five years.

689
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,536
Just like not all women are the same,
men aren't either.

690
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,414
Today is proof that you are.
How is that a reason to divorce--

691
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:40,792
This was a big deal for me.
You know how it's been.

692
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:44,212
You know how my wife
has been hurting my feelings.

693
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:47,633
There's an order to things,

694
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:51,178
so I'll start by ending my marriage
as soon as I go home tonight.

695
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,472
What about your wife?

696
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,891
She'll gladly say yes
without even hesitating.

697
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:23,669
You should know about the real me
before you go.

698
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,463
I already do.

699
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,256
No, you don't.

700
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,301
You may be aware of youth,

701
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,845
but not what comes with old age.

702
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,082
I now know

703
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:32,005
what love truly is
and what it really feels like.

704
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,591
Please,

705
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,678
protect my dignity.

706
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:41,723
Forever.

707
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:45,310
Learn the real me today

708
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,271
and end your feelings for me.

709
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:45,287
LET'S END…

710
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,082
MOM

711
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,690
I guess ending our marriage
is the right thing to do.

712
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,444
You're not happy in this marriage either.

713
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,739
All right. I'll sign the divorce papers.

714
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:51,811
My dad was diagnosed with cancer.

715
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:55,398
-What do we do?
-What kind of cancer?

716
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,818
-Colorectal cancer.
-When did you get the call?

717
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,279
-Who called whom?
-Last night.

718
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,074
Are you going to fly out?

719
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:07,118
No, Mom and Dad are coming to Korea.

720
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,537
Can you ask your dad
to make a hospital appointment?

721
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,289
The sooner, the better.

722
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,628
Did you sleep at your parents'?

723
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:21,007
-No.
-Why did you turn off your phone?

724
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,510
-No reason.
-Where did you sleep then?

725
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,805
I hardly slept.

726
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,183
And that's not important right now.

727
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,505
XIEXIAN

728
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:04,718
XIEXIAN

729
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:11,057
POWER OFF

730
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:17,480
Colorectal cancer
isn't anything to worry about.

731
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,442
It's a simple surgery
as long as it's not Stage 4.

732
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,527
It might be, though.

733
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,823
My friend's older sister's cancer
wasn't Stage 4,

734
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,284
but it spread all over her body,
and she passed away.

735
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,246
You know, God decides who lives or dies.

736
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,458
Talk about hitting close to home.

737
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,009
SONG YUAN

738
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:50,180
The phone you have called is switched off.
You'll be directed to voicemail.

739
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,390
After the beep, you'll be charged…

740
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,491
Why are you typing in the dark?

741
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,037
Are you stuck?

742
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,498
It's not that.

743
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,042
Quit this habit of leaving the house.

744
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:23,505
You always do that after we argue.
And now you even slept out.

745
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:28,093
-Got it?
-All right.

746
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:33,264
How's fried chicken for dinner?

747
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:35,517
Good.

748
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,608
What brings you by?

749
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:29,737
Are you going to make me leave
without offering me tea first?

750
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:34,534
I went to Spain in July
and came back to Korea two days ago.

751
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:37,245
Your family must've been thrilled.

752
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:41,207
-Aren't you going to drink that?
-I should.

753
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:44,335
It'll get bitter.

754
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,927
Did you lose some weight?

755
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,847
No, do I look thinner?

756
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,307
Yes.

757
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,310
Maybe it's just my face.
I weigh exactly the same.

758
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,481
Do you have plans for dinner today?

759
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:09,611
-No.
-Then have it with me.

760
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,710
-Yes?
-I'm sorry,

761
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:29,214
but something came up.
You guys should eat without me.

762
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:32,133
Gosh. Hyang-gi will be disappointed.

763
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:35,595
A friend from middle school is
moving out of the country for good.

764
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,098
-So a farewell party?
-Something like that.

765
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:42,852
At least text Hyang-gi yourself.

766
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,103
I will.

767
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:49,859
The Alhambra in Granada.

768
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:51,277
I know the place.

769
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,364
They say a couple that visits there
together will never break up.

770
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,783
-Is that so?
-I've been there myself.

771
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,118
Does your family live in Granada?

772
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:02,747
No, my family lives in Barcelona.

773
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:06,417
I see. There's quite a distance
between Barcelona and Granada.

774
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:10,171
-How long does it take?
-Over an hour by plane.

775
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,092
I saw it on TV and was mesmerized.

776
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:16,803
You must have photos of the place.

777
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:19,764
I did, but I deleted them all recently.

778
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,935
-Why?
-Because I broke up with the man

779
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,521
that took me there.

780
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,483
We broke up early last year,

781
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,404
but I only deleted them recently.

782
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,284
And I still have feelings for him.

783
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,911
You must've loved him a lot.

784
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,122
Yes.

785
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:49,460
Could I…

786
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,839
perhaps use you?

787
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,552
Use me how?

788
00:59:57,635 --> 01:00:00,930
I'd like you to be my rebound
so that I can get over him.

789
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,599
I think it's possible.

790
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:07,854
Crazy, right?

791
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,064
I know it's shameless to ask.

792
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:14,110
This is why I quit teaching.

793
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:15,778
To ask you of this.

794
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:21,951
When I'm with you, I feel…

795
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,246
I find comfort and become at ease.

796
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,665
Is it only because you need stability?

797
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,710
That's how desperate I am.

798
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,423
I used to be attracted to bad boys.

799
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:39,636
But I've matured now,
so I seek someone kind.

800
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,138
How about romantically?

801
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:45,183
I like being with you.

802
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:48,019
That's the case with friends too,

803
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:50,271
so let's be that.

804
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:54,484
You're someone I want to talk to
all night.

805
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:57,820
But talking isn't all that I want.

806
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,406
I want to hold your hand

807
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:05,036
and touch your face
as well as the line of your jaw.

808
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,038
I wish to feel them.

809
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,215
Please enjoy.

810
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:44,200
Happy birthday to you

811
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:46,994
Happy birthday to you

812
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,956
Happy birthday dear Hyang-gi

813
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:53,209
Happy birthday to you

814
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:00,007
Here.

815
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,261
This is from me.
It's good for your health.

816
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:05,346
Mom, you're the best.

817
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:08,975
Thanks.

818
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:12,228
-Is Dad on his way?
-Don't do that.

819
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:16,232
He loves you more than anything,
so I bet he feels terrible.

820
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:17,942
Old Man U-ram strikes again.

821
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:21,362
I'm right, though.
A daughter should know how her dad feels.

822
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,764
What's on your mind?

823
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:52,685
Is it regret?

824
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,145
No.

825
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,668
Can't you stay?

826
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,088
I don't want to sleep alone.

827
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:27,303
I won't want anything more than just you.

828
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,306
Let me be with you once in a while,

829
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:34,393
and I'll be more than satisfied.

830
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,829
-Thank you.
-No problem.

831
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:56,332
-Make sure his physical therapy goes well.
-Yes, doctor.

832
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,416
All right.

833
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:06,926
LOW ENERGY, LOW IMMUNITY

834
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,761
ADDRESS: 350 N RODEO DR, BEVERLY HILLS, CA

835
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,347
NAME: JI SU-HUI

836
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:30,449
Please have a seat.

837
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:41,711
-What's been troubling you?
-Well,

838
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,922
I have trouble sleeping occasionally.

839
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,760
It seems like my immunity level is down.

840
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:52,346
I see.

841
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,641
I see you live abroad.

842
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:57,852
Yes.

843
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:00,521
Let me examine your pulse.

844
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:24,003
-Ms. Kim, can you help me for a bit?
-Sure.

845
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:33,596
It's been a while.

846
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,223
Right.

847
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,185
You've changed…

848
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:40,645
a lot.

849
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:46,692
I heard that you've known how I've been.

850
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:49,737
I heard you moved to the States.

851
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,030
And?

852
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,036
Isn't there anything else you wish to ask?

853
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:02,792
I'm sure you know…

854
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:09,340
that I didn't have an abortion
and gave birth to the baby.

855
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:19,809
How old is your son?

856
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:21,852
He's 16.

857
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,897
Then he's 12 years younger…

858
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:26,565
than his sister.

859
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:32,738
Because our daughter is 28.

860
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:33,317
PLEASE LOOK FORWARD TO SEASON 2
IT WILL EXCEED YOUR EXPECTATIONS

861
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:40,199
