1
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,144
He's seeing a divorcée

2
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,605
who's ten years his senior?

3
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,903
EPISODE 3

4
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,572
If my husband found out…

5
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:14,866
Look.

6
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,787
They say what goes on behind closed doors…

7
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,581
Wait, was it "locked doors"?

8
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,170
Anyway, I just can't wrap my head around…
You understand me, right?

9
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,380
I know what you mean.

10
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:34,677
I was also flustered by the situation
I got myself into

11
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:40,058
and didn't know what to do.

12
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,186
The only crush I had was on my neighbor
when I was young.

13
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,231
I've never been with anyone
other than my husband.

14
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,192
Although he's my son…

15
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,861
I just don't understand him.

16
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,990
Please tell me your honest thoughts.

17
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,328
What is your plan for the future?

18
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,123
Please drop the honorifics.

19
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:10,380
I don't need anything else but this baby.

20
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,215
That's how I plan to live.

21
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:17,595
In the end,
it's my fault that this happened.

22
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,140
She's not going to let go of her baby
that easily.

23
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,891
Sa-hyeon promised his wife

24
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,146
that he'd end it with you.

25
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,399
But do you think she can trust him

26
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,068
when that baby you're carrying
is growing every day?

27
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,237
If I were her…

28
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,866
She wants you to move.

29
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,368
Without Sa-hyeon's knowing
and as soon as possible.

30
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:44,747
I'll try my best to persuade him.
If it fails, I'll do as you say.

31
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:49,627
My husband is considering
getting you a house.

32
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,130
If Sa-hyeon doesn't listen,

33
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,300
I'll sell my house and find a new place.

34
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,178
I can give you my word.

35
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,265
Don't worry about it. I promise.

36
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:06,936
She's not materialistic
and has a clear conscience.

37
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,689
You must be thirsty. Have some juice.

38
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,156
How are you feeling?

39
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,868
I've been nauseous around food lately.

40
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,287
It's not that bad, though.

41
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,248
I hope your morning sickness
doesn't last long.

42
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,375
I'm okay.

43
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,295
She's totally different from Hye-ryung.

44
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,506
Being a single mother
won't be easy at all.

45
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,717
This may not sound right,

46
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,762
but I feel blessed.

47
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,724
I tried to get pregnant
with my ex-husband for five years,

48
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,226
but it never happened.

49
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,311
What a twist of fate.

50
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,022
I'll make Sa-hyeon give me his word
in the next few days,

51
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,399
and I'll stand my ground.

52
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,695
I can stay at my brother's in Jeju Island.

53
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,489
Does he know?

54
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,866
I'm going to tell him soon.

55
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,621
Oh, dear. He'll be shocked to hear this.

56
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,750
Listen.

57
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,835
Do you think…

58
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:19,092
your brother will be able
to forgive Sa-hyeon?

59
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,512
I may just tell him
that I found a sperm donor.

60
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,555
I haven't decided what to tell him.

61
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,229
What is it?

62
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,564
-There's Dr. Shin.
-He's here?

63
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,192
Can't you see him?

64
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,993
Are you seeing things?

65
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,370
I'm serious.

66
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,753
Go and treat yourself.

67
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,964
You may be malnourished.

68
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,507
That's not it.

69
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,592
Just take it and stop thinking about it.

70
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,391
No, thank you. I want to quit.

71
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,019
Then you could've just said so,

72
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,478
not make up an excuse.

73
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,356
Are you a shaman or something?

74
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,775
My mother was.

75
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,987
She's passed away now.

76
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,783
You won't need to worry about anything.
I promise.

77
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,870
I should take care of you if my son can't.

78
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:34,042
I haven't even told my friends about it.

79
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,419
I'll reach out to you if I need help.

80
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:40,340
When you're carrying a child,
you miss your mother even more.

81
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,932
Whenever you miss or need her,

82
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,061
call me.

83
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:05,823
He must've been fed up with Hye-ryung
who's always grumpy and nitpicking.

84
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,037
-Yes?
-Are you still with her?

85
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,038
No.

86
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,332
-Are you on your way home?
-Yes.

87
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,793
We'll talk later.

88
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,378
I'm curious. What did you decide to do?

89
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,671
Ask her yourself.

90
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,756
Her phone's off.

91
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,841
I'll call you when I'm home.

92
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,176
Okay.

93
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,891
Dear Lord.

94
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,562
All I have is this baby now.

95
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,065
I'll let go of all my greed.

96
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:44,862
I only implore
that you keep this baby safe.

97
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,125
You're not a member here, are you?

98
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,795
No. Not yet.

99
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:06,050
I saw you praying last time as well.

100
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,387
I remember you
because you seemed very earnest.

101
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,597
I'm the pastor here.

102
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,975
Oh, I see.

103
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:17,603
When times are tough,
it helps to talk about it with someone

104
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,231
and put down your burden.

105
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:26,654
I'm scared that I may harm
my baby's safety.

106
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,907
I'm pregnant.

107
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,286
Do you believe
that you've done something wrong?

108
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,288
I have.

109
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,916
I ended up committing a sin

110
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,085
although it was unintentional.

111
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,590
-Do you like flowers?
-I do.

112
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,261
Every flower is beautiful in its own way,

113
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,221
and so are humans.

114
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,101
Each and every one of us
has a reason for our existence.

115
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:01,689
Trust that the Lord has His reasons

116
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,984
for blessing you with a child.

117
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:09,030
Don't you worry about a thing
and patiently wait for your child.

118
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:21,542
I'm sorry. If you call the office,
they'll send over my replacement.

119
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,003
Goodbye.

120
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,047
Thank you for your help.

121
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,925
Is he still here?

122
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,223
No, not anymore.

123
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:40,144
Right. Please throw out the boxes
that are by the door.

124
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,979
Yes, ma'am.

125
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,154
Good.

126
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,157
I have an excuse to move in with them.

127
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,161
-You're home early.
-I am.

128
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,329
Dongmi.

129
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,416
I'm flabbergasted.

130
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,377
She's ten years your senior.

131
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,382
And a divorcée? Why didn't you tell us?

132
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,217
It's not like I'm single.

133
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,843
What is wrong with you?

134
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,389
How could you fall for someone
who is much older than you?

135
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,102
A divorcée who's ten years his senior?

136
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,728
-Is Dad home?
-Hang up.

137
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,857
You ingrate!

138
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,569
You have a perfectly beautiful wife,

139
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,113
yet you go and have an affair?

140
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,614
-How could you?
-Dad.

141
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:39,078
Inner beauty matters more
than appearance or merits.

142
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,456
Then tell me what the hell
is in that head of yours!

143
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,834
You should be focusing
on becoming a partner.

144
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,878
Instead, you knocked up an old woman
and caused this mess?

145
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,298
Gosh, the housekeeper will hear you!

146
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,300
Let me explain in person.

147
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,467
Explain?

148
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,474
What if Hye-ryung finds out?
I'm mortified!

149
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,311
-Don't get worked up, Dad.
-How can I not?

150
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,439
I wasn't happy with Hye-ryung
being a year older.

151
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,107
But 10 years? Soon to be 50?

152
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,067
She looks young, though.

153
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,528
I don't care! I'm done!

154
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,405
-There's no apartment!
-What apartment?

155
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,160
You saw her without me?

156
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,205
Good going. Look at you two.

157
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,917
The gold digger has won you over.
An old gold digger at that.

158
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,669
She's not a gold digger.

159
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,921
Is it even true that she's pregnant?

160
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,675
The sonogram could be fake, you know.

161
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:39,013
When a woman has given birth before,
it shows on her face.

162
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,349
He's head over heels for her.

163
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,393
This is definitely not her first rodeo.

164
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,272
Her baby would think
that she's a grandmother.

165
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:52,026
She's not terrible like you think she is.
She's a good girl.

166
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,612
What kind of a good girl
seduces a young married man

167
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,697
and gets pregnant?

168
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,033
Hear her out, and you'll understand.

169
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,285
Understand, my foot.

170
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,082
-Did you tell her about the apartment?
-She's totally uninterested.

171
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,376
She has a decent job too.

172
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,920
-What does she do?
-She's a translator.

173
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,130
She's the opposite of Hye-ryung.

174
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,507
Of course, she is.

175
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,927
She lacks nothing apart
from being older than him.

176
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,512
They suit each other.

177
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,848
Their personalities, I mean. She's modest.

178
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,268
That sly, old fox is putting on a show.

179
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,853
That gold digger…

180
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,523
That's how Sa-hyeon fell for her.

181
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:35,403
Forget it.
She's going to end things with him

182
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,405
and live with her baby.

183
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,243
-And?
-That's all.

184
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,329
If Sa-hyeon doesn't give in,

185
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,207
she said she'd go to her brother's
in Jeju.

186
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,002
Right before leaving, she told me
that she'll end things with him

187
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,631
and said I had nothing to worry about.

188
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,009
-Can we trust her?
-We'll see.

189
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,639
I don't know what's going on.
How could this happen?

190
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,643
-Where are you going?
-Don't you want dinner?

191
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,479
We are not done here.
The housekeeper's still here.

192
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,816
I need to season the food myself
and adjust the heat.

193
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,030
She's 42? He must be insane.

194
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,032
What is he thinking?

195
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,368
What a fool.

196
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,121
How can he call himself a lawyer?

197
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,172
Hello.

198
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,091
You're arriving at ten o'clock?

199
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,801
Okay.

200
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,975
I told you not to expect too much from me.

201
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,530
-Hello?
-We can't meet today, right?

202
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,409
Of course, we can.
I'm at your door. What about you?

203
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,162
I'm in the complex. I'll be there soon.

204
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:09,955
Okay.

205
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,226
Do you want something to drink?

206
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,144
No, it's okay.

207
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,939
Why was your phone off?
You made me anxious.

208
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,191
I was at church.

209
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,735
What did my mom say?

210
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,320
Did you not speak with her yet?

211
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,865
My dad came home,
so I couldn't ask in detail.

212
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,284
She didn't upset you, did she?

213
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:48,994
No.

214
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,874
It will be like you have another ally.

215
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,086
You can meet with her
and go out to have delicious food

216
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,505
once your morning sickness subsides.

217
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:03,467
She's a great cook, so feel free
to tell her anything you're craving.

218
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,969
She'll love it for sure.

219
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:05,928
You know what?

220
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,307
-I can do that with her.
-Okay.

221
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,269
But to make that work,
we need to stop seeing each other.

222
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,773
I've thought long and hard,
and it's for the best.

223
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,609
-Can you live without me?
-Yes, I can.

224
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,862
-I can't.
-Listen to me. It's best for everyone.

225
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:28,993
Not for Bada. I told you.
Our baby needs to hear my voice.

226
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,662
-The baby can hear me soon.
-This is for the baby.

227
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,081
-Did my mom put you up to this?
-No.

228
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,046
This is my decision.
You can check with her later.

229
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,716
I understand what you're worried about.

230
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,427
-I won't get caught--
-You may deceive your wife,

231
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,138
but not God. God knows everything.

232
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,183
Let's end it here. I was thoughtless.

233
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,643
Do you regret this?

234
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,272
If it wasn't for our baby,

235
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,774
I would've ripped my heart out.

236
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,861
This is all because of me. I'm to blame.

237
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,404
It wasn't because of you.

238
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,699
You know I wanted to divorce her anyway.

239
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,869
I've wanted to get a divorce many times.

240
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:16,624
But you dissuaded me time after time.

241
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,502
It's not your fault. Don't you get it?

242
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,881
She still doesn't want a divorce.
She's willing to forgive you.

243
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,592
Let's end this. We must.

244
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,970
This little angel of mine
is growing day by day.

245
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,807
I'm afraid we'll receive severe punishment
if we keep this up.

246
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:38,395
I don't care if I get punished,
but what if our baby suffers?

247
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,439
-I'll suffer instead.
-That's not up to us.

248
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,107
How am I supposed to endure this?

249
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,234
How will I live without you?

250
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:48,072
-Every single day--
-Consider it as your punishment.

251
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,366
We're getting what we deserve.

252
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,329
This isn't easy for me either,

253
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,165
but our baby comes first.

254
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,502
Let's not humiliate ourselves
in front of our baby.

255
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,921
I know it was a sin to have this baby,

256
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,090
but, still, we must.

257
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,760
God is omniscient. He's watching.

258
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,972
Let's say I was in your wife's shoes.

259
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,848
You tell me you've ended it

260
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,476
but still sneak around
and continue the affair.

261
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,272
When I find out the truth,
I'd be disgusted and appalled.

262
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,568
You've done as I said until now.

263
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,239
This is my last request.

264
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,910
Everything's bound to have an end.

265
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,038
This is where we end things.

266
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,832
How come?

267
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,041
In return,

268
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,336
I'll rely on your mother,

269
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,965
take care of myself,
and give birth to a healthy baby.

270
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,803
She will tell you how I'm doing
from time to time.

271
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,396
You have no idea how I'm feeling
right now.

272
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,358
It feels like
my heart is being ripped apart,

273
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,152
thinking that this is the end for us.

274
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,301
It may be too late,

275
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,804
but we should do what's right from now on.

276
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,476
That way, we won't regret anything

277
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,147
and have the right to tell our baby
to live an honest life.

278
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,902
But I won't be there.

279
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,448
Will you tell our baby that I'm dead?

280
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:58,494
I don't know. We'll figure it out later.

281
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,673
Hello.

282
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,526
Hey, Hye-ryung.

283
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,236
You're done with work, right?

284
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,363
-I checked our website.
-Yes.

285
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,616
Come out. I'm in front of your house.

286
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,160
Why? Is everything okay?

287
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,955
Let's go grab a drink.

288
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,748
At this hour?

289
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:48,085
It's only 8:30 p.m.
It's the perfect time for a drink.

290
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,379
I can't leave my kids home alone.

291
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,505
Hyang-gi is an adult.

292
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:54,341
She'll think it's odd.
I've never gone out at this hour.

293
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,468
You need to be spontaneous for once.

294
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,929
She won't be home late.

295
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,347
But it's already late.

296
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,560
I'm just kidding. We'll go to bed first,
so have a blast.

297
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,311
It's not like we're going clubbing.

298
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,648
Bye. I'll treat you
to something good next time.

299
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,441
-Okay. Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

300
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,526
Bye.

301
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,113
She doesn't look like she's married.

302
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,409
Okay.

303
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,995
I'll do as you say.

304
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,832
I will.

305
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,046
But will you really be okay by yourself?

306
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,464
You still have a long way to go.

307
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,508
I have your mother.

308
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,100
This isn't right. I don't want a tearful…

309
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,771
I don't want a tearful goodbye.

310
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,817
I refuse to acknowledge
that this is over. I'll just…

311
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,778
I'll just think it's temporary.

312
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,615
"Just today…

313
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,745
Hang in there just for today."

314
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,498
I'll think that way every day.

315
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,878
I'll book a restaurant.

316
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,589
Let's chat, laugh, and eat

317
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,967
like we did when we first met.

318
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,888
And…

319
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:35,484
I LOVE YOU

320
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,236
I'll tell you next time.

321
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,916
I'll text you
after making the reservation.

322
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,419
It's great that there's no traffic.

323
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,361
Let's have something nice.

324
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,658
Okay.

325
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,412
Here…

326
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,083
We didn't order this.

327
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,584
It's from that gentleman.

328
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,712
The one who's seated over there.

329
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,427
Tell him we can't take it.

330
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,971
Yes, ma'am.

331
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,810
He's not that bad, though.

332
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,482
How does it feel?

333
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,776
This must happen all the time.

334
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,237
No, not that often.
Just every now and then.

335
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,782
It feels nice when the guy is handsome.

336
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,787
Sir, the ladies refused to accept it.

337
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:18,999
Really?

338
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,088
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

339
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,305
Playing hard to get?

340
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,266
They should be grateful
that you showed interest.

341
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,729
-So?
-I told him to sell them

342
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,148
-to reap a smaller loss.
-But most of all,

343
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:46,735
Min-gyu doesn't listen to anyone.
He's cocky.

344
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,404
-How much did he lose?
-His pride hurts too much to tell.

345
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,824
How is U-ram these days?

346
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,075
He spaces out at times.

347
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,542
-Who is it?
-It's your grandmother.

348
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,793
Really?

349
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,838
Dad, Grandma's here.

350
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,133
The door's open.

351
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,056
-Are you sick?
-Hi, Grandma.

352
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,265
Hey.

353
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,396
I'm so out of it.

354
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,692
Have you eaten yet?

355
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,780
I barely ate.

356
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,699
Is something wrong?

357
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,078
My housekeeper quit.

358
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,580
-We can find a replacement.
-Your father…

359
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,582
Ji-a, go to your room.

360
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,460
Go on.

361
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,676
She said she's been seeing

362
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,803
Dr. Shin for the past two days.

363
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,930
-Where?
-In her dreams?

364
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,014
At home.

365
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,104
Yesterday,
I thought she was just seeing things,

366
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,189
but she could be telling the truth.

367
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:11,444
But today, she looked terrified
and asked if I could also see him.

368
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,239
-Oh, dear.
-But I couldn't see him.

369
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,323
Of course not.

370
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:19,452
Anyway, she told me to find
her replacement and quit.

371
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:24,874
But when the sun went down,
I got the chills and was frightened.

372
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,795
It didn't feel like I was alone.
I couldn't stay there.

373
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,173
-Spend the night here.
-She really saw him?

374
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,133
Yes.

375
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,635
Are we supposed to believe this?

376
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,389
I even offered a raise, but she declined.

377
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,557
She's not pretending.

378
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,476
The house felt creepy at night.

379
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,062
That's why I came here.

380
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,689
Stay here for the time being.

381
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,358
I was in a rush and even forgot my phone.

382
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,943
Bring your stuff tomorrow.

383
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,447
Tell Ji-a that I'm not feeling well.

384
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,657
-Okay.
-Is your father…

385
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,618
trying to make me let go?

386
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,038
I'm sure he'll leave
after the 49-day rite.

387
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,751
If it wasn't for you guys, I would've
never visited a place like this.

388
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,044
Should we order steak?

389
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,296
It's okay. You're on a diet.

390
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,839
Beef is good for weight loss.

391
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,257
This is enough.

392
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,343
How are you these days?

393
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,013
-It must be painful.
-Not great.

394
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:24,517
In some ways, I'm better off this way.
But my kids…

395
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,644
Some change their minds
during the cooling-off period.

396
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,063
Not him.

397
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,898
Is he that stern?

398
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,275
Who in the world is she?

399
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,236
Are you sure
she's not one of your friends?

400
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,989
There are women who seduce
their friends' husbands.

401
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,449
You heard, right?

402
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,409
None of them are capable of doing that.

403
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,913
I've lost touch with most of them
due to work.

404
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,290
I barely have any to begin with.

405
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:51,336
And they were all appalled
to learn about it.

406
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,420
Of course.

407
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,056
Is that bottle of wine
all he's going to do?

408
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,308
Yes?

409
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,937
He's handsome.

410
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,898
I hope U-ram will become like him.

411
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,401
He's like Prince Charming.

412
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,361
We see guys like him at work all the time.

413
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,114
He's different.

414
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,742
Excuse me. Can we get some more water?

415
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:23,660
Yes, ma'am.

416
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,787
And the bill, too.

417
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,871
Yes, ma'am.

418
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,335
Ms. Lee, this is my treat.

419
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,295
Let me treat you for once.

420
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,132
After all, I'm older than you.

421
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,093
I dragged you here today.

422
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,095
And I'm also thankful
for your manuscripts.

423
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,012
Later.

424
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,099
You like the curry they serve
at Sogong Hotel, right?

425
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,935
-I do.
-I'll treat you sometime.

426
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,019
Okay.

427
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,231
In retrospect,

428
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,611
I sometimes think I should've listened
to Pi-young sooner.

429
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,781
I should've taken more care of myself.

430
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,909
I've always taken care of myself,
yet my husband cheated on me.

431
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,579
I've realized
it has nothing to do with that.

432
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,999
That may not be the case.

433
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,251
It's just how men are.

434
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,295
My cousin's husband

435
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,840
has been a loyal husband his entire life.

436
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,885
Not all men are the same.

437
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,053
Maybe he didn't get caught yet.

438
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,723
You didn't see it coming either.

439
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,477
You're right.
I had never imagined it before.

440
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,437
Me neither.

441
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:36,733
You never know
what life has in store for you.

442
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:42,197
I'd be grateful to maintain
this life that I have right now.

443
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,283
This incident has surely humbled me.

444
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,619
You should meet someone better.

445
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,580
They say 50 is the new 30, you know.

446
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,540
It doesn't ring true for me.

447
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,171
Even women in their sixties look young.

448
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,006
Only those who take care of themselves do.

449
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,634
It's not too late to start now.

450
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,804
You are beautiful to begin with.

451
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,017
Isn't that Mr. Seo?

452
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,564
-No, it isn't.
-I think it's him.

453
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,071
I was wrong.

454
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:28,576
The gentleman from before
already paid for your drinks.

455
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,495
-For us?
-Yes, ma'am.

456
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,873
-You should've asked us first.
-You're right.

457
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,335
He's one of our VIP customers. I'm sorry.

458
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,586
What does he do?

459
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,173
I'm afraid I don't know.
Next time, I'll inform you beforehand.

460
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,092
It was a mistake on our part.

461
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,511
He must buy drinks
for female customers often.

462
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,222
No, not from what I know.

463
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,730
I thought death was the end.

464
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,360
If we had souls,

465
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:06,197
my dad would've often visited me
in my dreams.

466
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,953
Perhaps, that's not something
one's soul can do.

467
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,999
We should sell the house, right?

468
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:19,335
You wouldn't be able to live alone
in a big house either.

469
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:27,218
She'd better brace herself
for what's coming.

470
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,265
How did it go?

471
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,644
-Do you want some water?
-No. Just answer me.

472
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,647
-I'll end it this weekend.
-Why drag it on?

473
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,524
You should've ended it today.

474
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,276
Are you trying to buy time?

475
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,862
I'm not. You can trust me.

476
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,239
How can I when our trust is broken?

477
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,700
Are you ready?

478
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,954
-To have a baby.
-But you're drunk.

479
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,290
I didn't mean today.

480
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,293
Are you prepared to be a father?

481
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,508
I'm a fan.

482
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,391
I'd like to treat you to a meal
when you have time.

483
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:16,935
Out of respect.

484
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,899
Why did he give up so soon?
He didn't seem like the type.

485
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,033
I still look good.

486
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,535
Even if I become a divorcée,

487
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,622
I'd still be able to get
any wealthy bachelor that I want.

488
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,125
I'm only holding myself back
because of my family in Canada.

489
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:45,254
And I've realized
that all men are just the same.

490
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,973
Goodness. You're already up?

491
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,433
Yes. You should sleep more.

492
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,185
It's okay. I'm up.

493
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,771
Come on. You have to go to work anyway.

494
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,192
I was going to make
some soft tofu soup today.

495
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,611
I know.
I saw the ingredients in the fridge.

496
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,405
I'll make breakfast while I'm here.

497
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,285
There's nothing else I can do.

498
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:20,289
Cooking and doing other household chores
will keep my mind off of my husband.

499
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,374
Okay.

500
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,386
The coffee smells great.

501
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,346
Have a seat.

502
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,819
What about yours?

503
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,320
Maybe you can give me a sip.

504
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,038
Why is it so tasty?
Is it the coffee or me?

505
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,289
Both.

506
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,585
Where will you have lunch?
At the cafeteria?

507
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,757
Don't you miss your wife's lunch box?
She made them out of love.

508
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,051
It was a hassle to carry around.

509
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,636
You could stop by Gangnam Sandwich
on your way to work.

510
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,138
That's a good idea.

511
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,145
My translator friend is pregnant,

512
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,564
and it got me thinking.

513
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,901
I'm thinking about trying
before it's too late.

514
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,528
I'd be thankful and elated.

515
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,488
Really?

516
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,500
It's meat, my favorite.

517
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,085
It must've been tiring.

518
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,211
Not at all.

519
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,213
Have some seasoned beans.

520
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,341
When did you wake up?

521
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,718
It's become a habit to wake up at 5 a.m.

522
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,220
It's all thanks to your father.

523
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,931
Do you have a lot to bring?

524
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,016
Just my clothes.

525
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:05,103
I'll send Mr. Han.
I have dinner plans today.

526
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,855
I can do it by myself.
I'm not moving for good.

527
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,440
Put your house on sale.

528
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,817
That place has grown on me.

529
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,195
Let's take some time and think about it.

530
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,993
Should I tell Pi-young the truth?

531
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,832
I shouldn't bother her
when she's already so busy.

532
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,363
Mom, do we have carrots?

533
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,906
You want carrots?

534
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,285
-We don't have any.
-Can you pack me some tomorrow?

535
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:06,038
Cherry tomatoes, walnuts,
and pine nuts as well.

536
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,958
-For lunch?
-No. As a snack for study hall.

537
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,543
Why? You're a meat lover.

538
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:14,172
Can you stop nagging
and compliment me for once?

539
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,300
Just for tomorrow?

540
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,845
-I'll try it out first.
-And that'll be the end.

541
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,515
-Do you want to bet?
-Bring it on.

542
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,767
What's gotten into you?

543
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:32,523
I get it.
Did Ji-a pack some carrots for herself?

544
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,361
That's not true.

545
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,113
I can totally see that I'm right.

546
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,533
You make me never want to get married.

547
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,743
You frighten me.

548
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,661
Are all girls like her?

549
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,540
Wise and intelligent women like me
are rare,

550
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,292
so don't worry and get married.

551
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,089
Who are you going golfing with?

552
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,008
With Mun-sik.

553
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,636
-"Mu-sik"?
-Mun-sik!

554
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,429
The one with an orchard.

555
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,183
Have you gone deaf with age?

556
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,310
It's your lack of enunciation.

557
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,062
What's her name?

558
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,107
That old pregnant woman.

559
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,152
Song Won.

560
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,820
-Just two syllables?
-Yes.

561
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,782
Even her name sounds lonely.

562
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:24,784
I want to see her.

563
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,788
What will you say to her?
She's carrying a baby.

564
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,331
I must meet with her.

565
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,125
Both you and Sa-hyeon
are bad judges of character.

566
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,128
Gosh. It's not right for her
to deal with you as well.

567
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,548
What do you mean? She only met you so far.

568
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,926
We should be glad
Hye-ryung didn't meet her.

569
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,178
Nothing good will come out of meeting her.

570
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,555
If we're certain
that it's Sa-hyeon's baby,

571
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:51,727
I need to be on good terms with her
if I want to hold my grandchild.

572
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,730
She agreed to end things with him.
She won't be happy to see you.

573
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:58,567
In any case, I want to meet with her.

574
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,653
Why do you talk so much?

575
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:03,406
The baby's important,
but so is the mother.

576
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,408
You're too naive

577
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:08,786
and always think the best of others.
Except me.

578
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:11,205
You always find ways
to make me resent you.

579
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,458
What did I do? Just call her already.

580
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,960
What's the rush?

581
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,920
Hye-ryung could change her mind.

582
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,631
If this drags on,

583
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,634
she might not want a baby anymore.

584
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,595
-Hello?
-It's me, Sa-hyeon's mother.

585
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,182
Hello, ma'am.

586
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,060
My husband would like to meet with you.

587
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,897
It's okay if you're too uncomfortable.

588
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:37,982
What do you mean?

589
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,278
If you pick a place to meet,
I'll be there.

590
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,613
Or you could come to my house.

591
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,783
We don't want to be an inconvenience
although a cup of tea will do.

592
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,410
I'll text you the address.

593
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,872
Sure. How does 3 p.m. tomorrow sound?

594
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,498
Okay.

595
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,210
She invited us to her place.

596
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,629
Let's go. Let me see how she's living.

597
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,258
-What should we bring to her place?
-Meat.

598
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,802
She's having morning sickness
and could get nauseous.

599
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,721
Just looking at it could make her sick.

600
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:13,726
I can't seem to tell by my dream.

601
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:19,607
It could be both a daughter or a son.

602
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,318
What's the point
when it's not your decision to make?

603
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,071
This parcel came for you.

604
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:28,866
They keep sending me useless things.

605
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,496
Who's it from?

606
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,956
SENDER: KIM DONG-MI

607
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,583
I don't recognize the name.

608
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,046
SENDER: KIM DONG-MI

609
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,548
Bring me a box cutter.

610
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,053
That's enough.

611
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,199
Thank you for the medicine, Mun-ho.

612
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:14,161
You always gave me gifts
and took great care of me.

613
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:18,374
You haven't changed one bit. Thank you.

614
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,751
I bought this green tea myself
while on a trip.

615
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,711
Have it every now and then.

616
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,548
I'll see you at the golf course next year.
From Dong-mi.

617
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,766
He's extremely considerate.

618
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,352
I only fold the dumplings.
He prepared the filling.

619
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,229
Even my dad wasn't like that.

620
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:43,357
Ha Mi-hui said the same thing.
She dated all the top celebrities,

621
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:47,069
but they all ended in heartbreak.
Then she fell in love with that guy.

622
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,155
Right. I heard he's 16 years her senior.

623
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,573
Yes.

624
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,367
I'm curious. How does he look?

625
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,078
He looks like an old gentleman now,

626
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,830
but he used to be very handsome.

627
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:02,835
Oh, my.

628
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,381
He definitely was handsome.

629
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,051
This is him now.

630
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,181
He has a kind face.
He seems to have good character too.

631
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,558
He must be popular
among his female students.

632
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,186
He's actually quite strict at work.

633
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,729
He's only softhearted with me.

634
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,481
As he should.

635
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,858
You guys look good together. I'm jealous.

636
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:29,111
Seeing you made me want
to get pregnant too.

637
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,780
You should. When will you get married?

638
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,658
Next year after the musical ends.
What about you?

639
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,914
We're going to stop seeing each other.

640
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,499
-Oh, my.
-Why?

641
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:47,213
His wife changed her mind.
She doesn't want a divorce anymore.

642
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,298
Goodness.

643
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,176
We weren't planning to have an affair
from the get-go anyway.

644
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,762
It's all for the best.

645
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,973
She doesn't know you're pregnant, right?

646
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,103
-She does.
-She does?

647
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,231
I just don't get her.

648
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:08,025
I would've gotten a divorce at once.

649
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,401
They don't even have kids.

650
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,947
Right. And he's okay
with ending things with you?

651
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:18,285
But his mother is willing
to take care of me.

652
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,704
I met her yesterday.

653
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:27,586
Anyway, don't you dare send her
the medicine.

654
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,092
What if I do?

655
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,803
It's my money.

656
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,721
You've never earned a penny.

657
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,640
-Have you ever made any for me?
-No.

658
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,517
You're completely healthy.

659
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,357
Will you really be all right?

660
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:52,945
I try not to judge.

661
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:56,323
It's also become a habit to accept things
as they are.

662
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:01,328
The moment I wake up, I'm instantly filled
with gratitude these days.

663
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,209
I hope the baby will be healthy.

664
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,169
It will be.

665
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,090
-Aren't you also excited and curious?
-Very much.

666
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,884
-Have you named your belly bump?
-Bada.

667
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:21,765
Bada, we're all excited to meet you.

668
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:24,893
Hey.

669
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,813
-Are you done with work?
-Yes.

670
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:32,026
Yesterday, I treated your radio DJ
to some drinks.

671
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,028
-Boo Hye-ryung?
-Yes.

672
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,529
How did you run into her?

673
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,866
Is that possible? What do you guys think?

674
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:42,119
There's no reason
for the housekeeper to lie.

675
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,830
They're more common than you think.

676
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:48,292
I have a friend who's a chef
and a devout Christian.

677
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:51,837
-And she's seen a ghost twice.
-Goodness.

678
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,423
You can only see one's body
but not one's heart.

679
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,967
Maybe that's the case.

680
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,178
The body is one's physical self.

681
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,512
The spirit is their heart.

682
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,433
How long is your mother-in-law
staying with you?

683
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,560
I doubt she moved in for good.

684
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,228
It must be uncomfortable for you.

685
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,105
It's only temporary.

686
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:13,150
She's your husband's stepmother,
so I doubt she'll rile you up.

687
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:16,195
Mothers-in-law are careful
around their daughters-in-law nowadays.

688
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,854
MESSAGES

689
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:07,413
If you're here, please sit down.

690
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,766
I understand
that I may have hurt your feelings.

691
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,228
But please just let it go.

692
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:35,315
Wasn't I good to you?

693
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:40,028
I was devoted to you for almost 40 years.

694
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,739
I've done my best,

695
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:45,492
and you lived a long life.

696
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:49,204
Maybe you wanted to live until 100 years,
but that'd make me 81.

697
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:53,625
I devoted my youth to you.
Must you take the rest of my life as well?

698
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:55,669
That's not fair.

699
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:59,298
Please let go
of your bitterness and anger.

700
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,635
I gave you joy and happiness.

701
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:07,222
You've enjoyed more than enough.

702
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:11,685
Now, I want to be happy.

703
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,854
I'm a human being and a woman.

704
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,565
I don't regret it.

705
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:21,403
If I were put in the same situation,
I'd probably make the same decision.

706
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,449
I didn't cause your heart attack.

707
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,701
Don't resent me.

708
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,664
This is my last meal for you.

709
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,834
Please enjoy it and go on your way.

710
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,881
You liked beef radish soup.

711
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,175
I made it just for you.

712
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:54,603
It's not right for you
to remain in this world.

713
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,033
You don't scare me.

714
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,286
Turn them all off if you want.

715
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,711
Dead men…

716
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,423
tell no tales.

717
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,555
-Did you have dinner?
-No.

718
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,769
What are these?

719
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,730
I can tell by your tone
that you're still mad at me.

720
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:42,985
Wait in your room.

721
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,405
Come out when I tell you to.

722
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:06,883
I feel bad for my maternal grandma.

723
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,386
My paternal grandma
will be living with us.

724
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,681
Aren't you sad?

725
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:15,892
Don't worry about me.
I consider both of them my parents.

726
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,729
What about when I get married,
and you're all alone?

727
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:20,981
Why would I be alone? I have your dad.

728
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,609
Right. I was thinking
about my maternal grandma.

729
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,403
Wouldn't you guys feel lonely without me?

730
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:29,698
-That's why you should visit often.
-You got it.

731
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,575
-Once a month?
-Once a week.

732
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,703
If my husband's okay, we'll live together.

733
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,705
-That's not good.
-Why not?

734
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,332
Your in-laws wouldn't like that.

735
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,460
If I get married to U-ram,

736
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:44,379
both of our parents would love that.

737
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,882
Right? You're close with his mom.

738
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:53,221
-Do you like U-ram?
-Yes.

739
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,808
As a friend. He's kind.

740
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,146
I'm not sure about him.

741
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,899
-Because he's chubby?
-No.

742
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:07,611
-Kids take after--
-Their parents?

743
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,285
There.

744
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,957
We don't need to hike and feel sore.

745
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,376
We can do it right here.

746
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,427
Should we go inside?

747
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,304
No.

748
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,151
Are you going to stay mad?

749
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,237
Can't you feel my love?

750
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,322
I don't know.

751
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:56,118
I'm doing the best I can.

752
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,411
Don't force yourself.

753
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,080
We'll get married in our next lives.

754
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:06,002
If I was the irresponsible type,
I would've abandoned my family.

755
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:09,256
But what can I do?
You should be more understanding.

756
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,731
Let's go on a picnic when spring comes.

757
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:27,941
Where to?

758
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:30,569
Anywhere. There are many nice places.

759
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,371
You didn't text me once.

760
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:46,251
Look who's talking.
You just left me yesterday.

761
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:47,377
I was upset and hurt.

762
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,017
You don't have to do that.

763
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:05,562
I rarely get thirsty when I sleep.
And if I do, I can get it myself.

764
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,230
That'll wake you up.

765
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,107
I can manage on my own.

766
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,119
I got teary-eyed on my way out.

767
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,456
We had a happy life there for decades.

768
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,208
To leave him there…

769
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,629
I understand.

770
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,508
Isn't he so handsome?

771
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:38,053
Thanks to him, people compliment Yu-sin
for his good looks as well.

772
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,848
He may no longer be here physically,

773
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,434
but he still lives on in my heart.

774
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,520
Then why were you terrified?

775
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:48,772
Are you no longer scared?

776
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:52,150
I'm sure he did it so I'd let go,
but we spent years together.

777
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:58,073
I had both love and admiration for him.

778
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:01,159
Loving a man may be easy,
but admiring him is different.

779
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,536
I agree.

780
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:06,873
What about you?
Do you love or admire your husband?

781
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,585
We're similar in age,
so I don't admire him just yet.

782
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,504
It will happen.

783
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:16,007
He's an honest, family-oriented man.

784
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,343
He loves his family dearly

785
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:21,221
and is respected by his colleagues
and patients.

786
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,640
Right.

787
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,935
I'll leave after the 49-day rite.

788
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:28,520
Please bear with me until then.

789
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,480
Don't say that.

790
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,357
-I'm happy you're here.
-Really?

791
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,486
It feels much livelier in here,
and Ji-a loves it too.

792
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,823
Yu-sin was worried about you living alone.

793
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,157
Now, he's relieved.

794
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,909
I feel at peace here.

795
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,622
I slept so soundly last night.

796
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:52,711
I'm thinking about seeing
a fertility doctor.

797
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:56,298
-You want a kid?
-My partner does.

798
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,174
How old is she?

799
00:52:58,258 --> 00:52:59,509
She'll turn 41 next year.

800
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,761
But she's healthy
and looks to be in her 30s.

801
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,096
You look happy.

802
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:07,893
To be honest, you may not understand
since you have a good relationship but--

803
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,937
No, I do. They say old is gold,

804
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,481
but that's about people, not love.

805
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,817
New love is more attractive.

806
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,360
I think it's a good idea

807
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:20,113
to create a new law
where people must separate

808
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:22,115
after 20 or 25 years of marriage.

809
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:25,911
I doubt any woman would want to spend
the rest of her life with just one man.

810
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,579
Sure, but what about the kids?

811
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,581
They won't live with us forever.

812
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:32,000
They'll all eventually move out.

813
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,502
Goodness.

814
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:38,798
What are you still doing up?

815
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,175
Aren't you coming inside?

816
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:55,523
Take a shower.

817
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:57,817
I can't be bothered.

818
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,168
That's nice.

819
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,129
How was golf?

820
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,173
Good.

821
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:24,010
Did you really not get any herbal medicine
for Kim Dong-mi?

822
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,638
What? I never saw her again
after that time.

823
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,391
-You told me not to give her any.
-And?

824
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:31,935
You listened to me?

825
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,730
No news is good news.

826
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,613
What's wrong?

827
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:57,711
Open it.

828
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,214
-Open it.
-What is it?

829
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:05,385
Kim Dong-mi sent you a thank-you gift
for the medicine.

830
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,391
Do you want a cup right now?

831
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,728
She bought the green tea herself
while travelling.

832
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:16,896
There's a letter too.

833
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,190
Aren't you curious?

834
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:33,204
"Thank you for the herbal medicine,
Mun-ho.

835
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:37,333
You always gave me gifts
and took great care of me.

836
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:40,587
You haven't changed one bit. Thank you.

837
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,131
I bought this green tea myself
while on a trip.

838
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:45,133
Have it every now and then.

839
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:48,219
I'll see you at the golf course next year.
From Dong-mi."

840
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,399
I felt sorry for her.

841
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:04,652
It's nothing special.
It didn't even cost me that much.

842
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:06,071
Is that so?

843
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,450
Have you ever bought me
some cold medicine?

844
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,327
I'm sure I have.

845
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,369
When?

846
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:15,622
When?

847
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,083
Is that even important?

848
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,838
Listen to me, Pan Mun-ho.

849
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:28,384
From this moment on, don't expect me
to treat you like a husband.

850
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:32,889
If you want to be treated like a king,
you should treat me like a queen.

851
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,725
But you treat me like a maid.

852
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,062
Despite that,

853
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:42,398
I treated you like a king all this time.

854
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,110
I've always given you freshly-cooked food.

855
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,529
I served you warm food every meal.

856
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,323
Fine. Let's say that's a given

857
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:52,659
since you're the breadwinner.

858
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:55,286
And I'll continue to do so in the future.

859
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,246
However…

860
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,040
I have no more respect for you.

861
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:01,251
You have not an ounce of respect for me.

862
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,670
That's not true.

863
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,714
Every time I do something out of love,
you never show gratitude.

864
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,634
You've always looked down on me
throughout our marriage.

865
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:13,346
Our mothers always said
that men never grow up until they die.

866
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:17,976
Every time I felt hurt,
I'd comfort myself with those words.

867
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,520
But not anymore.

868
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:26,276
-That letter--
-I said it meant nothing.

869
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:27,694
Still, you have never done

870
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:31,448
anything like that for me.

871
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,700
I'm nothing but a maid

872
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:37,912
who cooks and brings you clothes.

873
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,498
I'm no different from our housekeepers.

874
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,834
You treat Dongmi better than me.

875
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,922
You've looked down on me,
so I'll do the same.

876
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,633
I'll give you some herbal medicine.

877
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:56,014
Give me poison instead.

878
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,433
I'll die like you want me to

879
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:01,102
so that you can remarry that widow,
Dong-mi!

880
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,813
Don't be absurd.

881
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,567
Isn't that what you want deep down?

882
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,237
Am I wrong?

883
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,240
You're ridiculous.

884
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,867
I'm all sober now.

885
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,453
It's just herbal medicine.

886
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:21,247
Must I explain myself again?
The herbal medicine?

887
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,542
That's not the issue.

888
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,378
The underlying reason is the problem.

889
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,548
You deceived your partner

890
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,425
and blatantly lied through your teeth.

891
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,761
-"Partner"?
-That's what I am to you.

892
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:37,514
Or a housekeeper?

893
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:42,185
Had you acted like a devoted husband

894
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:45,063
then sent her that medicine,
I would've let it go.

895
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,191
I still would've been unhappy.

896
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,569
But you couldn't care less about your wife

897
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:54,280
who tended to you until her fingers ached.

898
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:56,407
Were you ever worried about me

899
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:59,452
when I complained of back pain
and headaches?

900
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:02,956
Have you ever felt bad for me?

901
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,333
I don't even expect any medicine!

902
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:09,212
That's enough.

903
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:13,091
I'll treat you the same way I always did
in front of the others, so don't worry.

904
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:15,218
I will no longer consider you

905
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,054
my husband.

906
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,807
Then what? A stranger?

907
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:22,976
A servant?

908
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,271
You're…

909
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:28,856
less than human.

910
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:42,870
Are you asleep?

911
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:09,397
You're still up, my queen.

912
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,733
Why did you get drunk
when your mother's here?

913
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,154
-You're right.
-Go say hi to her.

914
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,823
It's almost midnight.

915
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,034
-She's probably asleep.
-She's not.

916
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,537
I'll see her in the morning anyway.

917
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,212
Nothing good comes from drinking.

918
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,840
It's not like I drink every day.

919
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:22,387
I'm glad my mother is here.

920
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,138
We can have a lazy morning.

921
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:26,099
I wonder if she made hangover soup.

922
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:33,147
I don't have a hangover.
I had a nice, light drink.

923
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,692
Nice, light drink with who?

924
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:41,823
Sometimes, there are colleagues
that you just click with.

925
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:45,284
It's really tiring when they are
the only ones talking incessantly.

926
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:49,622
I should age gracefully
so I won't be called a headstrong geezer.

927
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:55,545
Are you getting up already?

928
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:58,005
I'm going to wash my hair.

929
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,260
You can skip a day.

930
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:03,302
It stinks.

931
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,513
Come here.

932
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:07,640
How dare you snatch my hair?

933
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,518
Then grab mine too.

934
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:12,562
There's nothing to grab onto.

935
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,440
Is this a bullfight?

936
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:24,907
It smells just fine.

937
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,367
It'll get greasy.

938
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:07,700
Dong-mi.

939
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:15,792
Did you sleep well, my prince?

940
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,739
You have it rough here.

941
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,534
What do you mean? Not at all.

942
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:56,499
Doenjang soup with cabbage?

943
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:58,334
-Yes.
-It'll be refreshing.

944
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,089
I came home late, so I didn't say hi.
I didn't want to wake you up.

945
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,924
I wasn't sleeping.

946
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:08,302
But forget about the formalities.
It'll get tiring.

947
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,012
Go get ready for work.

948
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:15,518
Right. Since you wake up early,

949
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,603
make sure you take a nap in the afternoon.

950
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:18,563
I will.

951
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,900
Should we eat out for dinner?

952
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:26,237
Come on.
I told you I'm sick of eating out.

953
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,739
Homemade meals are the best.

954
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,131
Eat.

955
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:55,099
Don't you think you're too cruel?

956
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:00,897
Even I don't treat my employees that way.

957
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:06,319
You've already given me an earful.

958
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:09,363
Are you a kid? Stop being so petty.

959
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:12,158
-Shut your trap.
-Shut my what?

960
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:13,784
Ask Byeol-hui.

961
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,373
HYE-RYUNG

962
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,167
Why is she calling me at this hour?

963
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:27,381
-Hey.
-Father, I'll be arriving there soon.

964
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:28,591
-You are?
-Yes.

965
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:30,551
-Sa-hyeon too?
-No, just me.

966
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:31,761
Okay.

967
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:38,935
Hye-ryung's coming.

968
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:42,021
Did they get into another fight?

969
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:44,607
Hye-ryung's almost here.

970
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,151
Do we have more rice?

971
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,864
She's so cold.

972
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,041
GA-BIN

973
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:06,671
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

974
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,508
-Are you driving?
-I'm in the parking lot.

975
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:13,135
Why did you call me
so early in the morning?

976
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,512
Do you have class in the afternoon?

977
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:16,055
Yes. Why?

978
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,392
Then you can give it a listen later
through the app.

979
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:22,311
I'm going to be a guest on a show today.

980
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:24,814
-Which one?
-It's a radio show.

981
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,110
What's the name of the show?

982
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:31,696
Boo Hye-ryung's Love, Memories, and Music.

983
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:08,441
What now?

984
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,568
I'm appalled to the point
that I'm speechless.

985
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:11,819
Is this an interrogation?

986
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:13,237
-Boo Hye-ryung?
-Yes.

987
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,114
Should I tell her that you're my brother?

988
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:16,365
That I'm your half-brother?

989
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,491
The reality is this.

990
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:20,536
In eight months, your grandchild
will be born out of wedlock.

991
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:23,164
It annoys me that I can't have you
all to myself.

992
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:26,333
Any other man
would've responded with his fist.

993
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:27,543
-Go ahead
-Right here?

994
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:29,128
Bring it on.

995
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,464
Then you just haven't
met anyone you love that much.

996
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:32,548
I have.

997
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:34,967
Not doing so
will only lead to misunderstandings.

998
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,094
I won't doubt your intentions anymore.

999
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,263
I guess all that's left is for us to meet.

1000
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:41,599
If she calls, let me know right away.

1001
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:44,268
Your mom didn't say anything
to keep you from worrying…

1002
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:47,354
Is this Ms. Lee Si-eun?

1003
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:48,272
Yes.

1004
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:51,108
This is Nam Ga-bin.

1005
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:55,988
