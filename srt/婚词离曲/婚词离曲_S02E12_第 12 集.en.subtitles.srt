1
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,392
EPISODE 12

2
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,408
I'll grab you a plate. Toast or waffle?

3
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,464
Want some sausages?

4
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,518
You should have
come by earlier for a swim.

5
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:48,942
I took a cab here.

6
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,236
Right. Is Ji-a home?

7
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,487
She's going skiing.

8
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,364
-With Ms. Kim?
-With Hyeon-jin's family.

9
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,991
Mother has errands to run today.

10
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,619
Shouldn't a family member go with her?
She might get hurt.

11
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:02,705
Hyeon-jin's mom is a teacher
and knows how to take care of kids.

12
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,582
Hyeon-jin's aunt is going too.

13
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,128
We should head out after brunch
and surprise her.

14
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,963
I don't have any patients today.

15
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,509
Well?

16
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,927
We're going to court.

17
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,188
Who is this divorce for?

18
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,067
Do you think you'll be happy
if you get a divorce?

19
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,777
And if I carry on living like this?

20
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,822
That depends on me. I'll do my best.

21
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,866
You did your best with that girl,

22
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:41,202
which is why she said you two are in love.

23
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,581
You always do your best with everyone.

24
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,842
Then give me three years.

25
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,095
I'll divorce you then
if that's what you still want.

26
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,681
-I've made up my mind.
-During 13 years of our marriage,

27
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:05,852
I've never done anything wrong
except for this one incident.

28
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:07,896
Who knows?

29
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,651
I can't blame you for not believing me,
but it's the truth.

30
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,153
I swear to God.

31
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,781
Have you ever been turned off by someone?

32
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,702
You never felt any attachment
toward your birth mother, right?

33
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,123
Imagine how you'd feel
if I was the one who had an affair.

34
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,836
I'll make it up to you.

35
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,299
You can hate me all you want,
but think about Ji-a.

36
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,136
I have, over and over again.

37
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,267
Can you please just
forget about everything

38
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,687
and do as I say this time around?
I'm begging you.

39
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,814
Not seeing you is how I'll forget.

40
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,609
Actually, it'll be more like enduring.

41
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,364
If neither staying married
nor getting a divorce

42
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,865
can bring you happiness,

43
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,700
let's do the former,

44
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,078
so that this won't take a toll on Ji-a.

45
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,955
I can't act like nothing happened.

46
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,374
I can hardly smile anymore.

47
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,126
Can you put on an act for us both?

48
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,461
I'll do anything.

49
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,798
I don't want to see your face
or hear your voice anymore,

50
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,467
because everything was a lie.

51
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,688
I'll drive.

52
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,573
Head to court.

53
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,496
COURT

54
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,916
Turn left at the next intersection.

55
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,006
Even if you had been with another man,
I could let it slide

56
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,718
as long as you didn't truly love him.

57
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,094
I must have married a saint.

58
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,722
A saint who cheated on his wife

59
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,766
with a girl who is 16 years
younger than you are.

60
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,020
Just like how men can't
fully understand women,

61
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,690
it's the same the other way around.
We're just wired differently.

62
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,275
Women have affairs too.

63
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,862
Many do. It's just a matter
of that person's character.

64
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:25,658
You only seem perfect on the outside.

65
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,372
You're going the wrong way.

66
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,775
AIRPLANE MODE

67
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,870
Forgive me.

68
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,372
I did a terrible thing.

69
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,043
You'll only hurt your knees.

70
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,924
Please take good care of her.

71
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,969
Right. I thank you in advance.

72
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,667
You're only exhausting me.

73
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,503
If I were your son,
you would have forgiven me.

74
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,755
You're not just my wife, but my friend.

75
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,424
Not just a friend, but my lover.

76
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,512
There are also times when I
depend on you like a son does to a mother.

77
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,806
-Only when I'm needed.
-I can't live without you.

78
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,057
Get lost.

79
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,186
Ever seen a dead man come back to life?

80
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:22,692
If my mom returns from her grave,

81
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,944
I'll forget this ever happened.

82
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,364
So get up.

83
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,826
Get up.
Even seeing you kneeling disgusts me.

84
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,636
There's no need to waste time
or exhaust our emotions.

85
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,849
I won't change my mind even if
you beg for forgiveness for ten years.

86
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,350
Me neither.

87
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,769
-How dare you!
-I know I wronged you.

88
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,898
You've changed and that's
why you turned to another woman.

89
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,150
That may be true,
but I never gave her my heart.

90
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,528
If I didn't love you anymore,
I would have wanted a divorce.

91
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,655
-Well, I'm grateful.
-What if I were your son?

92
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,326
If your son had an affair, you would
give him an earful and let it slide.

93
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:17,914
If it were my son, I wouldn't disown him
for cheating on his wife.

94
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,416
But you're not my son.

95
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:24,462
I'm your wife,
not your mother who gave birth to you.

96
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,130
Humans are emotional animals.

97
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,799
An AI robot would only feel
what it's programmed to feel

98
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,636
and not be swayed
even if a beautiful angel appeared.

99
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,430
But humans are living organisms.

100
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,016
Our emotions are easily swayed.

101
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,478
-It was a misjudgment.
-I can see right through you.

102
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,065
I can tell
whether you're being sincere or not.

103
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,983
You don't think I'm sincere right now?

104
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,735
Does this sound like I'm lying?

105
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:48,945
I know you mean it.

106
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,697
You were sincere with me,

107
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,033
but also with that A Mi girl.

108
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:59,080
I don't know if you loved her,
but I could tell you sincerely liked her.

109
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,875
I guess you didn't love her
since what we had wasn't love either.

110
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,211
-It wasn't?
-You wouldn't cheat on me if it was.

111
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,629
You'll know at the very end.

112
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,840
Your kids still love you
after finding the love of their lives.

113
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,009
That's how it is.
We all love in unique ways.

114
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,846
Then you're admitting
that what you felt for her was love

115
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,515
no matter how deep that love was.

116
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,851
This will all seem like
a minor setback when we're older.

117
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,395
It's not a life or death matter.

118
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,438
Haven't you heard of "crime of passion"?

119
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,066
Love can lead to heinous crimes.

120
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,986
-I won't divorce you.
-You don't get a say in it.

121
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,530
The decision is mine, you cheating--

122
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:36,242
Whether it's a mistake or wrongdoing,
we should set things right,

123
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,910
not end the relationship.

124
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,079
We have Ji-a to consider.

125
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,998
We have a responsibility as parents.

126
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,292
I guess that includes having an affair.

127
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,003
I'm a parent but also an adult male.

128
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:51,007
How can a grown man do everything
by the book all the time?

129
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,883
The world isn't always beautiful.

130
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,845
Grand waterfalls, rivers, and forests.

131
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,222
There are many beautiful things,

132
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,058
but we also have deserts
that are too barren to live on.

133
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,269
Even Confucius, at the age of 70,

134
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,731
found that he no longer had any
problems when following his heart.

135
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,941
I'm only in my mid-forties.

136
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,526
I'm a man still in the making.

137
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,195
We're just still too young.

138
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,700
You're too young to forgive me,
and curiosity got the best of me.

139
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,536
Let's give this some time.

140
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,331
It's just formal paperwork.
There's no need to rush into it.

141
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,791
Since it's not a deal,
we'll file the papers today.

142
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,293
That's not what I meant.

143
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,421
A divorce is something
we can do at any moment,

144
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,256
so let's give it some time.

145
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,676
I don't want to live another day
as your wife on paper.

146
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,180
Life is about doing what you don't want
to do and enduring the pain.

147
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,473
That's what you tell Ji-a.

148
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,309
In the big picture that is our lives,

149
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,978
this might not be a stain
but an opportunity.

150
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,192
Those who live their lives to 80 and 90
without leaving a stain

151
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,485
are truly admirable.

152
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:57,490
I left a stain on my life
and I'm embarrassed by it.

153
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,953
But I'm setting my pride aside
and begging you to forgive me.

154
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,583
I could go to greater lengths
to change your mind.

155
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,128
You're the only one for me.

156
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,297
The only woman I truly love.

157
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,634
And that will never change
until the day I die.

158
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,137
I'll write a memorandum if you want,
even in blood.

159
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,809
If it's what you want,
I'll ask A Mi to come here…

160
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,645
Although it's not humane on our part,

161
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,271
I can swear my love to you.

162
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,817
You're the only woman I love.

163
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,028
Remember Mongsil, the dog
we had when we were newlyweds?

164
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,573
It broke an expensive vase
while we were playing.

165
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,367
You saw how upset I was

166
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,994
and patched it back together with glue.

167
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,956
It seemed like it was fixed,

168
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,417
but it still leaked

169
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,877
and the cracks remained.

170
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,672
So what if we live together
under one roof?

171
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:55,798
It means nothing.

172
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,426
We're disrespecting
the concept of marriage

173
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:02,012
-by living without love or respect.
-I don't care if we disrespect it.

174
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,933
Because from this moment on,
I will only live for you and Ji-a.

175
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,019
I don't care what happens to me.

176
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,604
Outside the broadcasting station,

177
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,233
I approached an actress
about a jacket she had on.

178
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,486
She said it was a gift from her boyfriend.

179
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:22,408
Without even batting an eye,

180
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,119
you said that you were him.

181
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,373
It turned out to be true.

182
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,336
I always envied those
with younger sisters,

183
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,547
so that's what I wanted.

184
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,341
Why lie if you had nothing to hide?

185
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,052
-You could have invited her over.
-I didn't want you to misunderstand.

186
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,014
You hid her from me
because you had feelings for her!

187
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,892
Your friend from middle school,
named Cheol-ho.

188
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,019
Does he even exist?

189
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,480
He moved to another country.

190
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:56,358
We stayed in touch for a few years,
but we drifted apart.

191
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,236
L.A. is too warm for puffer jackets,

192
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,072
so he would have given it to a relative
visiting from Korea?

193
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,367
How can I possibly
overlook all these lies?

194
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:09,747
To be honest,
I don't even know who you are anymore.

195
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,166
You're not the person I knew.

196
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,629
They say we can't ever know
what goes on in people's heads.

197
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,048
It was all true.

198
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,426
This will only sound like an excuse,
but I just didn't want to upset you.

199
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,054
Doubt would have only made you miserable.

200
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,556
It would have driven a wedge between us.

201
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,893
She was new to Korea
and it's not easy to settle down alone.

202
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,186
It's dangerous here.

203
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:36,232
I met her a few times to give her advice
and we grew close.

204
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,609
There were no romantic feelings,

205
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,820
but she started to
feel something more for me.

206
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,867
-I should've ended things then.
-As a father of a daughter yourself,

207
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,827
how could you do that?

208
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,789
She only fell for you
because you gave her a reason to!

209
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,998
I didn't give her one.

210
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,044
It seems like she mistook
my good manners and chivalry.

211
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,256
Have a happy marriage with her then
because I no longer want one.

212
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,425
I promise it's over,
so please let it slide just this once.

213
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,636
I ended things first
because it felt wrong.

214
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:09,265
I thought she had accepted it,
but she came to the hospital in a mess.

215
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,516
It was after I had left.

216
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,309
You probably only ended it because

217
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,437
I asked about the jacket
and went to the riding club to check.

218
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,941
If I hadn't, you'd still be dating her.

219
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:25,155
I had no idea
that you were such a bastard.

220
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,283
I never dreamt of it.

221
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,702
I should have trusted you less

222
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,538
-and liked you less--
-Our assets…

223
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,540
will all be under your name.

224
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,253
Will having all assets under my name

225
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,007
help me heal from the pain and betrayal?

226
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,886
I'll make sure that it does.
You'll be glad you listened to me one day.

227
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,638
Being a psychologist
doesn't mean you know how I'll react.

228
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,224
I'm not one of your patients.

229
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,769
It'll take some time,
but the truth will come out.

230
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,480
And once again,

231
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,609
the only woman in my heart is you.

232
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,028
I know money can't ease your pain,

233
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,822
but I'm willing to try anything.

234
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,032
Don't let this mistake

235
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,911
-make you doubt my true love for you.
-How many faces do you have?

236
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,664
We wear our emotions on our sleeves,
so which is the real you?

237
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,920
Now that I think about it,
there was never any truth to your words.

238
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,797
As a psychologist,

239
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,008
you just had fun
controlling others' emotions.

240
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:31,305
It's all a show, isn't it?
You don't feel guilty at all.

241
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:35,351
-Give it a few years and you'll find out.
-You'll give me all your assets?

242
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,646
Yu-sin, are you that crazy about women?

243
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,399
You must be. You even bought
an imported car for your new girlfriend.

244
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,734
You go all out, don't you?

245
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,946
That was going to be
the cost of ending things.

246
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,240
End it with me instead.
I can't treat you like I used to.

247
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,077
I don't care about that
and I don't expect you to do so.

248
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,412
I'd rather you just kill me.

249
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,332
Divorce is never an option.

250
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,669
Apart from that,
I'll do everything you say.

251
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:06,173
Your father once told me
that he was happier with his second wife.

252
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,425
The situation is different.
My mother died.

253
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,304
Are you that against being divorced?

254
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,598
Your patients will think less of you.

255
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,184
But who knows
how long we have left to live?

256
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,853
Every day should be spent in happiness.

257
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,648
Including the years we dated,
we were together for 20 years.

258
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,819
-Of course you're sick of me.
-We'll soon be in our fifties and sixties.

259
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,822
-You'll regret this.
-You're doing this for me?

260
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,907
Because I might regret it?

261
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,826
I might.

262
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,205
But I can't look at you
let alone live with you.

263
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,165
If Ji-a ends up in the same situation,

264
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,752
will you tell her that divorce
is the answer?

265
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,422
-I'll ask you the same--
-I'm not a chronic cheater.

266
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,341
I took a step in the wrong direction
without realizing it.

267
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,426
Easy for you to say.

268
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,512
Once a cheater, always a cheater.

269
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,973
See if that's true then.
There's always an exception.

270
00:16:56,557 --> 00:17:00,728
No two people are the same. Even the law
is forgiving towards first time offenders.

271
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,688
Don't you dare justify your actions.

272
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:07,192
Besides, whether it's parents or children,
you can't live their lives for them.

273
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,987
All we can do is wait and see
what Ji-a decides.

274
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,031
Be that patient with me too then.

275
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,908
If you find someone better,
I'll do as you say.

276
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,829
-Do you want to punish me that much?
-I always keep my word.

277
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,247
I told A Mi to take you in.

278
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,790
Who's more important? Me or her?

279
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,376
-For 13 years, I was devoted to--
-Devoted?

280
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,796
Okay, I take that back. But I did my best.

281
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,215
-And I didn't?
-It's not what I want.

282
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,592
I don't want to marry her.

283
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,552
You're being unreasonable.

284
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:37,014
You have some nerve saying that.
What about me then?

285
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,184
I get it. I made a mistake
and what I did was wrong.

286
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,769
If so, bear the fallout.

287
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,895
I said I would.

288
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,689
I said I'll sign over
all my assets to you.

289
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:49,902
I'll do anything except divorce you.
Why is divorce the only option for you?

290
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,863
Do you think I wanted you
to cheat on me for that?

291
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,657
This marriage is over,
so we'll go our separate ways.

292
00:17:55,741 --> 00:18:00,496
I want to be next to you when I take
my last breath. Please let me do so.

293
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,082
Everything you say sounds fake now.

294
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,293
When my friends make mistakes,

295
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,337
they're forgiven
after writing memorandums.

296
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,131
I'm here begging
for your forgiveness. I said I'm sorry.

297
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,382
Your mistress said

298
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,595
that you two were in love
but you didn't agree to it.

299
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,640
You tried to come up with a way
to fool me again,

300
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,141
so that you wouldn't be liable!

301
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:25,062
Just like I didn't expect this to happen,
who knows how Ji-a's life would turn out?

302
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,147
You said women can be just as bad.

303
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,525
You're right.
Jeong-gyun is dating a married woman.

304
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,861
If it were Ji-a,
would you cut her out of your life?

305
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,655
Like I said, it's not the same thing.

306
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,866
We aren't related, so we can
easily go back to being strangers.

307
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,076
It's exactly how I feel.

308
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,036
We're still a family though.

309
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,914
Aren't families supposed
to overlook each other's mistakes?

310
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,627
We've almost been married for 15 years.
It's long enough for mountains to shift.

311
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,548
So how do you expect
a person to stay exactly the same?

312
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,759
In my case, I haven't actually changed.

313
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,761
I was briefly distracted.

314
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,890
Well?

315
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,811
If only you held back.

316
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,062
I know.

317
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,401
I took a step forward
not knowing there was a swamp.

318
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,861
How did it feel…

319
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,947
to hold her in your arms?

320
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,491
It must've felt good.

321
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,703
That's why you kept seeing her.

322
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,291
She must have been charming
in a different way than me.

323
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,960
-I didn't feel anything.
-Liar!

324
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:33,172
She kept turning to me
for support and guidance,

325
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,507
and I felt I should care for her.

326
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,719
I just couldn't push her away.

327
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,139
It must have felt good
to have a young woman cling to you.

328
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,724
Keep taking care of her.

329
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,976
What if something happens to her?

330
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,271
We never came across
any hurdles in this marriage so far.

331
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,982
Let's think of this as our first one

332
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,567
and jump over it together.

333
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,571
-Don't let your emotions sway you.
-You just said we are emotional beings.

334
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,323
You're better than me in every way.

335
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,284
So please forgive your fool of
a husband just this once.

336
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,079
A Mi never knew her father growing up.

337
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,875
Her mother had her out of wedlock.

338
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,628
She was drawn to me
because I'm a father figure.

339
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,797
Our relationship is not what you think.

340
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,424
So you never slept with her?

341
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,886
You sure are talented.

342
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,388
You justify everything
without even faltering.

343
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,057
Not even a flinch.

344
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,851
I'll bear your lifetime
of resentment and sneers.

345
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,647
Kimchi is only good when it's fermented.

346
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,148
It's the same with people.

347
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,776
I was like pre-fermented kimchi.

348
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,153
I was immature and lacked judgment.

349
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,323
They say that men never grow up.

350
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,368
Toddlers are at least adorable.

351
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,411
An immature man at your age?

352
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,581
A man who does what he wants to
even though it's wrong?

353
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,625
Are you saying I should cope with that?

354
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,669
-With pity.
-Women are the same.

355
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,338
We wish to be comforted and protected.

356
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,006
More so than men, if you ask me.

357
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,219
Are men allowed to cause trouble
and be understood and forgiven

358
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,430
while women bear the heartache,

359
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,100
forgive them, and clean up after them?

360
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,726
Be the troublemaker from now on.

361
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,062
I'll clean up after you.

362
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,274
From now on, I'll stop every woman
who wishes to marry a psychologist.

363
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,944
They have an answer for everything
and are just too cunning.

364
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,155
You're twisting my words.
Knowing would have only worried you.

365
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,367
The truth isn't always liberating

366
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,868
and lies aren't always bad.

367
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,663
They say sometimes it's better
to stay in the dark.

368
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:35,210
I shouldn't put it this way, but I met her
because I needed a change of pace.

369
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,297
I'm stressed out too, you know.

370
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:43,427
I tried so hard to be the best
for you and Ji-a.

371
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,305
I see patients with broken hearts,

372
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,057
which means I have to hear
their problems every day.

373
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,811
Running a hospital
is harder for me than you think.

374
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,896
That's why you took up horseback riding,

375
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,482
and you loved it because
it helped relieve your stress.

376
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,068
She must have been a great partner

377
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,696
for you to have taken her there as well.

378
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,115
Si-eun's husband caught you in the act.

379
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,950
He knew she was a mistress.

380
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,744
That's why he told Si-eun to tell me.

381
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:13,332
What did you say when Mother suggested
that Ji-a and I go watch you ride?

382
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,584
You said we'd spook the horse.

383
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,211
The members aren't fond of distractions?

384
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:19,838
It was to keep us away.

385
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,174
Everything is clear now.

386
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,760
And you say family means the most to you?

387
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,095
Don't you dare mention
the word family ever again!

388
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,723
Horseback riding was
to keep things clean between us.

389
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,892
You won't admit a damn thing!

390
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,478
Fine, I'll use Ji-a as an example too.

391
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,480
Just thinking about it
gives me the creeps,

392
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,192
but if she chooses
to date a middle-aged married man,

393
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,694
will you tell her it's okay
if she keeps things clean?

394
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,074
I'm done arguing. The more you talk--

395
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,868
Must Ji-a grow up without a father?

396
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,120
They say women are weak
but a mother's love is strong.

397
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,499
Will you sacrifice Ji-a's happiness
just because I broke your heart?

398
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:59,086
I won't tell her right away.
Not until she can naturally accept it.

399
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,588
-What's natural about a broken family?
-You caused it!

400
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,173
Ji-a will catch on.

401
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:06,760
Why don't you convince her
with what you said to me today?

402
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:11,098
You said it wasn't serious,
so what's stopping you?

403
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,350
Mankind may seem strong, but they're weak.

404
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,394
You can't cope with me
because you're weak.

405
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,479
You're right.

406
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:22,067
No matter how hard I try,
this is impossible to get past.

407
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,488
All the lies. The betrayal.

408
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,659
How could I let it slide?
How could I forget?

409
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,913
If there was a pill
that could erase bad memories,

410
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,165
I would choose to take it and forget.

411
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,920
A handsome and caring husband.

412
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,257
I'm envied by all those around me.

413
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:49,803
I want to keep living
as a woman everyone envies.

414
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,430
Did your brain tell you to cheat on me?

415
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:56,309
My mind tells me to cope with the pain,

416
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,271
but my heart won't let me.

417
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:04,734
Your mind could have never wanted
to cross the line either.

418
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,320
But your heart wouldn't listen.

419
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:12,617
You're a weak man who couldn't
resist the temptation of a woman,

420
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:16,705
and I'm a petty and weak woman
who doesn't have it in her

421
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,665
to forgive her husband.

422
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,126
We're compatible that way.

423
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,672
Wives in the past
understood their husband's unfaithfulness,

424
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,509
but that's just something
I can never forgive.

425
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,724
We'll live apart
until your anger subsides.

426
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,142
That's my best offer.

427
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,895
I don't mind being called a bastard,

428
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,646
so ask your friends.

429
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,024
Ask if this is enough
to break up a family.

430
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,942
Why didn't you ask your friends

431
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,028
if it was all right to cheat?

432
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,697
Or maybe you did and they encouraged it.

433
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,409
Your mother was miserable
after her divorce.

434
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,163
I could see a shadow cast over her.

435
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,292
She never smiled sincerely,
except for when she was smiling at Ji-a.

436
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,837
That's a low blow. Don't you dare
bring up my vulnerability.

437
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,047
It's the same situation.

438
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,965
-Your mother--
-It's different!

439
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,552
My father never purposely lied
to my mother's face!

440
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,138
Did he let your mother know
before dating his secretary?

441
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,184
Unless the person's vile
or the love has faded,

442
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,519
no one cheats
because they're determined to.

443
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,939
It always happens unexpectedly.

444
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:28,026
A lot of things happen in life
and this is one of them.

445
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,319
Life isn't always a joy.

446
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:32,572
We sometimes feel sad and wronged.
We can also be in accidents.

447
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:36,076
Because we're not saints,
we can't help but succumb to temptations.

448
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,579
It's just like how women
impulsively buy designer purses.

449
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,666
Our basic desire is pretty much the same.

450
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,001
What's different
is the object of our desire.

451
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,711
Again with the sophistry.

452
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,421
Is there fault in my logic?

453
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,882
What logically makes sense is the truth.

454
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,176
You may think you're right--

455
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,471
I never said I was!
I admit that I lack in some ways.

456
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,892
So go to A Mi who has a heart big enough
to lie about only being friends

457
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,852
with a married man she's sleeping with!

458
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:03,979
I'm letting you go.

459
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,899
Let's not make our emotions
leave a stain on our lives.

460
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,235
-Who are you patronizing?
-This isn't just about us.

461
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,780
Please, think of our child.

462
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,658
What I did is in the past and it's over,

463
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,993
but Ji-a is our future.

464
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,663
Must you cast a dark cloud over her
because of what I did?

465
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,873
I grew up just fine
under divorced parents.

466
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,751
What don't I have
that women from two-parent families do?

467
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,337
-Nothing.
-Ji-a will be the same. Don't worry.

468
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,756
Just because you're clever and flawless

469
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,634
doesn't mean everyone else
will see you that way.

470
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:38,555
If it weren't for Ms. Kim,
my father wouldn't have approved of you.

471
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:41,433
No one can go through life alone.

472
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,477
We receive help from people
and lend a hand too.

473
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,188
What I need right now
is your tolerance and understanding.

474
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,775
If only your father
was never persuaded back then.

475
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:55,530
For 13 years, I was a good husband to you.
You admitted that countless times.

476
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,116
The affair went on for less than a year

477
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,785
and I never neglected
my duties to this family.

478
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,454
But you still regret marrying me?

479
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,580
As a result, yes.

480
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,752
Even the sturdiest dam
can collapse because of a rat hole.

481
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,880
We get upset by the smallest things

482
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,673
and relationships break apart.

483
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,427
Whether it was a year or two
doesn't matter.

484
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,220
The trust between us has shattered.

485
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:23,350
Marriage is built on love,
faith, and trust.

486
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,227
Even if your love for me hasn't changed,

487
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:30,940
the trust between us is now long gone.

488
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,443
I'll rebuild our marriage
to what it once was.

489
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,320
We should at least try.

490
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,031
It doesn't make sense
not to give me a chance.

491
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:41,368
Don't you ask me to be reasonable
after doing something so unreasonable!

492
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,411
No one is perfect, you know.

493
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,248
I recommended marriage
to a junior who was on the fence about it.

494
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,126
That it's different from dating.

495
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,171
That it just can't be explained in words.

496
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,423
"What if our love withers?

497
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,385
What if my husband
falls for another woman?"

498
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,221
She was worried about that
on top of how to deal with her in-laws.

499
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:04,641
So I told her that marriage is
only for those who can handle all of that.

500
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:08,436
I gave her that advice in confidence
but now I'm the one who can't handle it.

501
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,191
In some ways, this is my fault.

502
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,235
Just like you admitted your mistake,

503
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,946
I admit my flaws too.

504
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,073
You are not flawed in any way.

505
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,075
It's me who's flawed.

506
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,618
Whatever.

507
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,122
I turn my head when I see a handsome man

508
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,125
and find someone
with a deep voice attractive.

509
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,459
But that's all.

510
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,837
I don't get any ideas.

511
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,713
I did my best as a wife,

512
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,758
so how could you want another woman?

513
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:42,262
While keeping your act up
as a caring husband,

514
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,014
you cheated on me.

515
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,809
-I must have lost my mind.
-Anyone can make mistakes.

516
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:52,689
But you can't call it a mistake
when you've killed someone.

517
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:56,234
You took another woman in your arms
when you have a wife.

518
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,697
You probably told her you love her.
It should never happen.

519
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,908
How would you feel if I acted all caring

520
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,035
while cheating on you?

521
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,667
I was about to eat dinner

522
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,920
when my aunt, who should be
in the Philippines, called

523
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,338
saying that my mom collapsed.

524
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,592
I ran over there in a frenzy.

525
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,971
My aunt yelled at me
for not knowing she was severely ill

526
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,557
and even slapped me.

527
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:33,354
I fell to the ground,
but I didn't feel any pain.

528
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,609
You weren't picking up your phone,

529
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,236
and my mom was taken to the family ward.

530
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:45,074
Nurse Park walked by,
so I asked where you were.

531
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,703
She said you went
to the VIP room to see A Mi.

532
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,039
It was on the same floor,
so I hurried over there.

533
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,960
Someone went into that room by mistake
and then headed to the next room.

534
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,380
When I got there,
through the opened doorway,

535
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,844
I saw you rubbing cheeks
with some female patient.

536
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,680
I guess I stumbled backward
without realizing it.

537
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,892
I was so shocked.

538
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,145
I still don't get why
I tried to go back to where my mom was.

539
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,940
I must have thought
that I saw something I shouldn't have.

540
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,360
But then it struck me
that I might have been mistaken.

541
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:23,321
So I headed back to the VIP room.

542
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,657
My knees gave in though.

543
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,952
The hospital walls were spinning,

544
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,956
and I couldn't move
even though my aunt was talking to me.

545
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,792
"I must be wrong. There's no way."

546
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,294
That's all I could possibly think of

547
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,712
when you…

548
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,382
came out of that room.

549
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,635
That's as far as I can remember.

550
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,053
When I came to,

551
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,848
you were sleeping on the couch next to me.

552
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,684
Peacefully at that.

553
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,647
Anyway…

554
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,984
I wanted to ask about
my mom's condition first,

555
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,403
but words wouldn't come out.

556
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,615
Saying I was in shock hardly explains it.

557
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,744
Never did I suspect you
of cheating before.

558
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,455
That's how much I trusted you.

559
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,583
The word "betrayal"
didn't even come to mind.

560
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,628
I just couldn't believe
how you could do that to me.

561
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,049
You've been a certain way all those years.

562
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,302
You were a man
who always took responsibility,

563
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:31,180
never said anything harsh,
and were always the sweetest.

564
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,183
I was appalled.

565
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,313
Others thought my mom's condition
caused my mutism.

566
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,608
My mom was dying

567
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,987
while my husband's mistress
was in a neighboring room.

568
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,240
I couldn't breathe properly.

569
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,658
I even thought

570
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:56,122
that maybe I should just follow my mom.

571
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,125
Ji-a kept me alive.

572
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,594
But I should just look past
that mistake of yours?

573
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,971
I want to do that too.

574
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,023
You can be attracted to other women,

575
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,566
but you shouldn't love them.

576
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,487
Or maybe just keep the affair brief
so that I'd never find out.

577
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:32,283
A man only loves one woman.
She never had a place in my heart.

578
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,536
If she had, I would have divorced you
like Ms. Lee's husband.

579
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,955
What you did is worse.

580
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,748
He fell in love with someone

581
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,960
while you used this woman
without feeling an ounce of guilt.

582
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,505
I guess it only makes sense since
you didn't feel guilty toward me either.

583
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,048
That's not true.

584
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,341
No matter how hard I think,

585
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,594
you must have showered me
with surprise gifts out of guilt.

586
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,306
You whispered sweet words
in my ears to feel at ease.

587
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,185
They say people are
the most terrifying and it's true.

588
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,603
You're living proof.

589
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,647
Is everything black and white with you?

590
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,940
Is there no gray for you?

591
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:08,444
One's heart and feelings
can't be categorized like that.

592
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,196
When it comes to love, it can.

593
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,699
Either you love someone or you don't.
There's no middle.

594
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,368
You love your wife but also another woman?

595
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,620
Only a lowlife thug
would juggle multiple women.

596
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,289
One's job doesn't define one's character.

597
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,418
But as a husband and father,

598
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,545
how could you deceive your family?

599
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:29,924
That's why I'm truly ashamed.
The level of guilt is tearing me apart.

600
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:34,178
But you never know either.
They say you shouldn't guarantee anything

601
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,389
until your coffin is nailed shut.

602
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:40,476
-Anything can happen down the road.
-So you're praying that I slip up?

603
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,439
Maybe that's true
regarding what's inevitable,

604
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,984
but is an affair
something you can't avoid?

605
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,987
It's avoidable for anyone
with a conscience.

606
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,239
All you have to do is not do it.

607
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:57,744
Depending on how you see it,
it might not be such a big deal.

608
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:01,164
This one time, we invited a monk
to speak at the hospital.

609
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:04,917
It's better to be sick than to die
and better to lose assets than to be sick.

610
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,087
So isn't a heartache better

611
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,089
than being terminally ill?

612
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,842
Let's say I led a clean life

613
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:16,679
being a devoted father and husband,
but became terminally ill.

614
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:21,017
If God told you that an affair
would give me a clean bill of health,

615
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,605
you'd find a decent woman for me

616
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,940
and approve of the affair.

617
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,902
After a storm comes the calm.

618
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:35,281
Recent events have
only reaffirmed my love for you.

619
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,657
You're the one--

620
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,701
That's because I take care of you.

621
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,995
No wife in the world
would be as devoted as I am.

622
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,247
I'm one-of-a-kind according to people.

623
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,709
You're right. I also said there's
no woman like you in this universe.

624
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,588
And from this moment on,
I'll be like that too.

625
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,008
I'll take care of repairs
around the house,

626
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,886
family business, and tend to Ji-a.

627
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,555
You can focus on your work.

628
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,643
-Do whatever you want, whenever you want.
-You said you'd marry three times.

629
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:07,313
Once with your current wife,
once with Sa Pi-young,

630
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,773
and once with Ji-a's mom.

631
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,235
How could you even say something like that

632
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,695
while fooling around with another woman?

633
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,863
But I meant it.

634
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,158
My actions may say otherwise,
but that was the truth.

635
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,496
Even if I get to live 100 lives,
I'd marry you every time.

636
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,332
I know that won't happen,

637
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:30,002
but if you end up dying first,
I'll have you buried

638
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,338
and ask Ji-a to cremate you with me
when I die too

639
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,423
and scatter our ashes together.

640
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,844
Says who? We're done.
It's over between us.

641
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:42,056
If I die first, I'll ask Ji-a
to scatter my ashes immediately.

642
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,352
I once said that
I'd marry you again in my next life,

643
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,688
then Shin Yu-sin, and then Ji-a's father.

644
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,898
I regret it so much
that I want to rip my tongue out.

645
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,359
If I could,
I'd cut my own tongue to pieces!

646
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,989
Let's go to court.

647
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,241
I said what I needed to say
and heard you out.

648
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:09,375
I won't go with you.
Only death will do us apart.

649
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,254
Why are you holding out like this?

650
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,680
I disappointed you and caused you pain.

651
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:26,893
Rather than divorcing you,
I'll make up for it in some other way.

652
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,562
If we end things here,
it'll end in hatred and resentment.

653
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,981
I'll love you until the day I die,

654
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,400
but you'll resent me
for the rest of yours.

655
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,738
I'll make you realize
that my love for you was real.

656
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,449
If you want to divorce me,
do so when you love me.

657
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,160
That doesn't make any sense.

658
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:47,413
Queen Elizabeth II
was married to her husband for 74 years.

659
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:52,335
You probably read the article, but I doubt
their marriage was always smooth.

660
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,754
Despite all the ups and downs,

661
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:59,467
even the Queen of England endured
the hardships that come with marriage.

662
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:05,181
These recent events
will make me a new man.

663
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,474
I'll grow as a person.

664
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,895
I'll be born again as a great husband
and devote my life to you.

665
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,773
I'll win back your love.

666
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:18,361
-Did you not hear a word that I said?
-You can swear at me and spit on my face.

667
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,740
I won't complain even if you mistreat me
or not let me touch you.

668
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:23,658
I deserve it.

669
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,828
Just let me grow old by your side
as your husband.

670
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,290
Why are you being so stubborn?
I want to be with another man too.

671
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,584
Someone who is the same
on the inside and out.

672
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,962
My life so far has been in vain.

673
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:40,591
-I trusted you and look where that got me!
-The outcome is all that matters.

674
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:44,720
A life you don't regret
is a life well lived.

675
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,847
"Luck finds those who are patient.

676
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,141
Patience can ward off great disasters."

677
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,685
Why couldn't you hold back then?

678
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,688
I tried to be careful not to
cross the line, but stumbled.

679
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:57,149
-You have an excuse for everything.
-Must you make Ji-a

680
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:00,027
resent you
just like you resented your mom?

681
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,572
That's only because my mom
didn't let me see my dad.

682
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,449
You're free to see her.

683
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,744
-Whenever you want. I won't stop you.
-I know from my patients.

684
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,372
They may seem fine on the outside,

685
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,041
but a divorce has a
negative effect on the children.

686
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,836
-And cheating has a positive one?
-I said I'd make up for that.

687
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:20,715
Don't judge everything
by your rules and standards.

688
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,092
My pain…

689
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:26,595
You were probably sweet to her
just like you were to me.

690
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:31,517
You probably touched her
the way you touched me.

691
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,895
How can I not think of that?
How can I not be reminded of that?

692
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:40,109
Whenever I think of you two, I feel like
I'm going to change into a devil.

693
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:44,822
-How could I live on like that?
-Leave that to me. Trust me.

694
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:49,618
Because of you,
I didn't even get to say goodbye to Mom.

695
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,954
I should have told her I was sorry,

696
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,123
but I couldn't speak.

697
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,251
My mother passed away like that.

698
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,923
When my mom came from the Philippines,

699
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,927
I asked why she came
and told her to go back.

700
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,973
I only gave her pain all my life

701
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,186
and told her it was her fault
that Dad cheated on her.

702
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,146
I told her Dad found comfort elsewhere

703
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:20,149
because she had issues.

704
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,611
I can't even imagine
how devastated she must have felt.

705
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,530
You need to
experience it yourself to know.

706
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:30,201
You'll forgive me even if I cheat on you?

707
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:33,162
-If you didn't love him.
-That's because you don't know.

708
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:36,832
I attacked my mom
with words that broke her heart

709
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,876
only to end up with mutism.

710
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,295
I really believed

711
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,090
that it was her fault
my dad stepped out on her.

712
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,092
What issues did I have though?

713
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:49,345
What did I do
that was not good enough for you?

714
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,180
Tell me.

715
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,519
I should burn my own mouth

716
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,813
because I told Hye-ryung

717
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,190
that Professor Park cheated

718
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:05,694
because Si-eun didn't bother
to doll up or look attractive.

719
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,489
It turns out that's not true.

720
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:12,118
Men don't cheat on their wives
because of some reason.

721
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,662
That's just who they are.

722
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:18,874
I thought

723
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:23,546
our love would last
and our trust wouldn't break

724
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,047
if I was the perfect wife.

725
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,466
On days you came home late,

726
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,510
I was curious who you were with
but I didn't ask.

727
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,179
Whenever you looked dashing
when you went to work,

728
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:36,892
I worried about other women
fighting for your attention.

729
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,437
But I never once nagged you
or kept tabs on you.

730
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,607
I was constantly at war with myself
to hold back my suspicions

731
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:47,570
just to be a so-called wise wife.

732
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,656
One that lets her husband be at ease.

733
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:56,245
So that your home
could be a peaceful sanctuary.

734
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,415
That's how hard I've tried.

735
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,543
But look where it got me.

736
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:14,138
There's no way that one-bedroom apartment
is better than this house,

737
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,266
so it's the person you loved more.

738
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,226
The one living in it.

739
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,898
So tell me.

740
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:30,029
What did you like so much about her?
That she was young and looked up to you?

741
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,239
-That wasn't it.
-Then what was it?

742
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,535
-Tell me.
-There's that book.

743
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:41,081
Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus.

744
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,501
You wouldn't understand.

745
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,545
Enough with the analogies
and persuasive techniques.

746
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,381
Explain with logic instead.

747
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:53,886
Stop trying to wiggle your way out of this
by saying it's "a guy thing."

748
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:59,391
As kids, girls play house with dolls.

749
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,352
Meanwhile, boys like toys.

750
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,982
But after a while, they grow sick of them
and want new toys.

751
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,653
-You get that, right?
-So you married a toy

752
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,447
and then sought out a new one.

753
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,823
I'm saying that's how it is.

754
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:18,494
We both did our best as husband and wife.

755
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,538
But then I met A Mi.

756
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:24,542
The way she talks and acts,
and how she cares about me.

757
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,502
It just felt different,

758
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,963
so I guess I wanted
something new for a while.

759
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,131
It really is no big deal.

760
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,592
If only you'd think of it differently.

761
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,638
They say that men are the sky
while women are the Earth.

762
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,099
Rain falls from the sky, right?

763
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,519
Rain clouds move around to spray rain,

764
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,729
but land can't move around
to be caught in it.

765
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,314
It's the natural order of things.

766
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,442
Mankind is a microcosm

767
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,236
and that's why women are the Earth.

768
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,655
"Men can't refuse women
that come their way."

769
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,365
Proverbs reflect reality.

770
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:59,785
They were coined because we're different.

771
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,620
What was it like to be with her?

772
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,125
-Good?
-If I say it wasn't,

773
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,587
you'd ask why I still bought her a car

774
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,255
and took her horseback riding.

775
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,842
But some toys you keep with you
for the rest of your life

776
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,636
while some you get sick of.

777
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,221
So I'm a toy that lasted 13 years

778
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,765
while she only lasted one.

779
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,727
When we got married,

780
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:29,607
you laughed at
what was in my box of my valuables.

781
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,150
That robot toy I had.

782
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:35,362
Do you really think
that's the only toy I had growing up?

783
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,239
It had a different sentimental value.

784
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,950
That's just how men are wired.

785
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,827
No wonder we're called animals.

786
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:46,707
For a person to live with one,
there may be hardships

787
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,543
and things you're not happy with.

788
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,961
We're a different species.

789
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,463
That I honestly admit.

790
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,506
Women are on a higher level.

791
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,343
Then why did you pretend to
be human when we dated?

792
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,054
A perfectly fine human to be exact.

793
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,307
Intellectual, well-mannered,
and with common sense.

794
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,309
-I know.
-Are you saying

795
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,395
that it's hard to keep up the act
after marriage?

796
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,980
We try.

797
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:14,610
We do, but our true nature
shows every once in a while.

798
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,072
I'm fazed by it too
despite it not seeming that way.

799
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:22,034
The guilt I felt toward you
was unbearable.

800
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:25,371
In some ways, I'm more at ease now.

801
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:28,540
My conclusion is this though.
I can only live with a human being.

802
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,751
A man who's a person inside and out.

803
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:35,255
If such a man doesn't exist,
then I'll be living on my own from now on.

804
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,591
Look on the bright side for once.

805
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,970
Kids don't always do bad things.
If so, how could we raise them?

806
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:44,139
We do so because
they bring more joy than pain.

807
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,059
When Ji-a turned four,
she started talking back to us

808
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,436
and upset us in more ways than one.

809
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,064
Apart from this incident,
I never caused you pain.

810
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:56,443
Financially, most of what I have
was provided by my father.

811
00:44:56,944 --> 00:45:00,114
But I'm not a terrible drunk and
I respect you as your own person.

812
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,826
And unlike other men,
I care about my personal hygiene.

813
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:07,037
I'm not embarrassing to be around

814
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,872
and I am easygoing.

815
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,707
Just think of my good qualities.

816
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:14,253
One mistake is enough.
Never will I make another one.

817
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:16,922
-I'd be a son of a bitch to--
-That's not the point.

818
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,967
Everything you say seems logically right,

819
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,552
but that perfection of yours?

820
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,513
In your case, it showed in the worst way.

821
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,933
How can you have an affair

822
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:31,145
when you have a wife and child
who look up to you and trust you,

823
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,439
and pretend as if nothing happened?

824
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:36,024
That side of you I got to know

825
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:40,362
seems foreign to me and inhumane.
You're no longer the man I married.

826
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,450
The love I had for you is now gone.

827
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,369
I can't look at you without scowling

828
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,246
or with affection.

829
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:53,709
I can't say words of affection either,
so how can we be a family?

830
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,003
Must I still stay married to you though?

831
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:59,882
How? Just for the sake of our kid?

832
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,383
By putting on a show?

833
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,427
Are we supposed to live fake lives?

834
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,137
Is that how we taught Ji-a?

835
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,557
If you're home late,
I'll think there's another woman.

836
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:13,020
If you give me a gift,
I'll think you're guilty of something.

837
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:17,191
Even when you're nice to me
and even when you're not,

838
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:18,692
I'll have doubts.

839
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,945
Affection, respect, and trust?

840
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,615
Your affair threw those out the window.

841
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:29,286
I feel bad too. It has left me
dumbstruck and heartbroken.

842
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,290
Why should I endure this and carry on?

843
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,335
For Ji-a?

844
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,879
For our image?

845
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,215
Our lousy future?

846
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,718
Because people will envy us

847
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:47,846
if we go around hand in hand
when we're old with wrinkled faces?

848
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,766
That could happen.

849
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:55,354
Just like you said,
if I keep enduring the pain,

850
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:58,982
I might someday forget
or just learn to live with it.

851
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,486
We're wired to forget, right?

852
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,156
I guess it's a mistake
a young man can make.

853
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,825
I could even be grateful

854
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,537
that you didn't ask for a divorce sooner.

855
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,331
But still,

856
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:18,043
I thought it over again and again
when I couldn't speak,

857
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,879
but I couldn't get over it.

858
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,507
How could I?

859
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:28,470
When I show you trust, I expect
you to trust me back, not deceive me.

860
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,307
-It wasn't deception.
-Then what?

861
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,726
Was it mockery?

862
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,562
How did it feel to fool me?

863
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,730
While not knowing you were cheating on me,

864
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:42,818
I laughed and smiled at your sweet words.

865
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,528
Was that fun for you?

866
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,573
Was it reassuring to know
that you had me completely fooled?

867
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,659
It's never good
to push your luck though, is it?

868
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,411
So when I told you I saw A Mi,

869
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:55,914
and Si-eun's husband saw you
horseback riding with a younger woman,

870
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,584
and I went to the club
to confirm my suspicions,

871
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,377
you knew it was time to end things.

872
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,504
You might think I'm cruel

873
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,881
for not changing my mind
after all your begging.

874
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:09,261
If I had been a mediocre wife
like most women,

875
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,430
I might've screamed a few words at you

876
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,766
and looked past this mishap
after getting you to write a memorandum.

877
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:19,563
But not after what I did for you.
And the man I finally got to see

878
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,898
isn't someone I can live with.

879
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,484
You are of a different kind.

880
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,238
Just like how not all women are the same,

881
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,157
not all men are animals.

882
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:34,411
I've said my piece.

883
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:38,206
There's nothing more to say
or nothing I want to hear.

884
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,630
Do you want some water?

885
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,154
If your mother

886
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,574
had forgiven
your father's extramarital affair,

887
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,161
you might've been able to do the same.

888
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,499
They say you learn through hardships.

889
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:24,044
You spent your whole life
resenting your mother for the divorce,

890
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,921
but here you are doing the same.

891
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,089
Watch your mouth.

892
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:30,509
Don't just think about
my flaws and mistakes

893
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,761
and think about yours.

894
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,846
Is this really the right call to make?

895
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,686
Could you proudly
tell Ji-a about this someday?

896
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,021
Would she approve?

897
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:47,484
"Mom, you made the right decision.

898
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,278
My friends didn't make fun of me

899
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,656
for being from a broken home,

900
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,574
and my fiancé's parents
didn't have to tell me

901
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:58,537
I grew up in a good family
despite only being raised by one parent."

902
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,088
Hit me some more.

903
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,466
I'm going to say everything
I want to anyway.

904
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,428
Children are our mirror image.

905
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,596
Is that how your father taught you?

906
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,683
This must be how Ms. Kim taught you.

907
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:21,643
Don't badmouth people behind their backs.

908
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,353
She didn't do you any wrong.

909
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,484
Children are our mirror image.

910
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:32,404
She raised you,
so this is how she taught you.

911
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:36,116
Just like my father, I'm a decent person.

912
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,159
You can't deny that.

913
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,286
I didn't put on a show

914
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:42,122
and deceived you for the fun of it.

915
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,666
He just taught me to be a chivalrous man.

916
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:45,917
What about you though?

917
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,879
Were you taught to never forgive?

918
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:54,050
No matter how much I beg,

919
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:57,387
you stubbornly stick to
your initial decision.

920
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,890
I let myself have a little fun. So what?

921
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,477
-You didn't suffer a loss.
-I didn't?

922
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,104
I didn't buy her gifts
with the money you earned.

923
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,523
I brought home
enough money for the family.

924
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:12,277
You were hurt and felt betrayed
since you've found out,

925
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:16,698
but I didn't let my infidelity
affect my role as a family man.

926
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:21,203
Did I fall out of love with you
and abuse you instead?

927
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:25,373
I only met with her a few times
because our fates entwined,

928
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:28,084
but you make me out
to be some lowly bastard.

929
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,171
Even the truth hurts, you know.

930
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:34,257
You won't even budge despite my apologies.

931
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:38,970
Finally your true colors are showing.
You're the one who let it go this far.

932
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,097
If only you had come with me to court.

933
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,600
Must I dive into fire
just because you want to?

934
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,186
You want to break up this family

935
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:49,689
and break our daughter's heart,

936
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,107
so how can I accept it?

937
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,693
-You made your own bed.
-Put yourself in my shoes.

938
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,154
-If you were a man--
-What about my perspective?

939
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,865
I understand how you feel right now,

940
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,575
which is why I apologized

941
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:03,119
and said I'd looked past
your infidelities too.

942
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:05,747
Live your life however you want.

943
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,458
Only a crazy man would say such a thing!

944
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,545
This must be the real you.

945
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:14,214
Yes, there are even more sides to me
than you know about.

946
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:19,678
If you had accepted your mother's decision

947
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:22,681
and had been a good daughter to her,

948
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,392
she might have not fallen ill.

949
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:31,064
Then she wouldn't have been taken
to the hospital that day,

950
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:35,151
and I would've ended it with A Mi
as I planned.

951
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:40,866
Because of me, you didn't get
to say goodbye to your mother?

952
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:44,953
Right. I'm responsible
for causing your mutism.

953
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,497
But you could have not known about it.

954
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:51,126
And people make mistakes
at least a few times in their lives.

955
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:54,004
-It depends on the mistake.
-All souls are damaged.

956
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:57,465
Most women just yell at
their husbands for having an affair

957
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,175
and forgive them at least once.

958
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:02,220
Gyeong-cheol and Dr. Ha's wives
didn't forgive them

959
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,389
because they're
any less of a woman than you are.

960
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,766
Dr. Ha's wife is an interpreter

961
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:10,270
while Gyeong-cheol's wife earns more
from her academy business.

962
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,731
What makes you so much better than them?

963
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,775
You look more sophisticated
than the average woman

964
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,987
and have worked hard to look younger
than women your age.

965
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,615
But if I didn't earn enough,

966
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,909
we would have had to live off
what you earn too,

967
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,995
which means you would have
looked the same as other women.

968
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,831
You wouldn't have had
the luxury to care for yourself.

969
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,292
Did being raised by a single mother
hinder my role as a wife?

970
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,961
Do women who grew up
in a two-parent household

971
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,005
have hearts of saints?

972
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:39,591
I was a better wife than any of them!

973
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:40,842
Exactly.

974
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:44,471
I'm well aware
of how good you are as a wife,

975
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,473
which is why I won't divorce you.

976
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,141
I know what to be grateful for.

977
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:50,435
No one could possibly
be a better wife to me.

978
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,855
This is a hardship

979
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,149
brought on by me,

980
00:53:57,317 --> 00:54:00,278
and I'm begging you
to forgive me just this once and forget.

981
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,113
I know I would.

982
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:05,533
Whenever you're reminded of my affair,

983
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:08,119
you're free to lay out
your resentment on me.

984
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,373
But after a while,
you'll get sick and tired of it

985
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,749
and your anger will subside.

986
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,000
In the end,

987
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,795
we will start laughing again.

988
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:19,673
That's how humans are.
It's a flaw but also a blessing.

989
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:23,093
So you're saying
that I'm the problem, not you.

990
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:26,012
I'm saying we should stop
pointing fingers now.

991
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:29,140
When kids do something wrong
and ask for forgiveness,

992
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,851
it's a parent's job to forgive.

993
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,814
Must you sever all ties and kick them out
when they're begging for forgiveness?

994
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,190
It's the same with husbands.

995
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:39,859
I'll leave then.
To my mom's place with Ji-a.

996
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,861
Live here with Ms. Kim forever

997
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,655
or marry A Mi for all I care.

998
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,700
Forget the alimony.

999
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:49,995
Just pay for Ji-a's education
since you're her father.

1000
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:53,540
-I'm in tears of gratitude.
-Same here.

1001
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,001
To justify your wrongdoing,

1002
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:59,838
you dug out your wife's painful memory
and her long-term trauma.

1003
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:02,757
I was finally able to realize
how much I lack as a person.

1004
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,592
And I thought I was a saint.

1005
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,013
-Pi-young--
-Just like that,

1006
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:11,182
you probably called A Mi's name
numerous times.

1007
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,810
I'd rather you never say mine again.

1008
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:19,024
You must have called her multiple times
in a drunken state.

1009
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,401
What did you say to her?

1010
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:24,237
That you miss her
and want to be with her, right?

1011
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,406
Juggling the affair

1012
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:29,117
probably cost you your sleep.

1013
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,911
I doubt you got to enjoy
waking up next to her,

1014
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,621
so do that to your heart's content.

1015
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,166
You know what men say.

1016
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:39,127
Their ideal woman
is someone they haven't met before.

1017
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,880
You said
I should think from your perspective

1018
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,090
rather than a wife with a kid.

1019
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,968
If I were a man, I'd choose A Mi.

1020
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,512
A man who's as meticulous as you

1021
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:53,349
could probably keep dating her while
pretending that it's over between us.

1022
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,561
That's why I can't maintain this marriage.

1023
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:59,147
Because all I'll do is doubt you.

1024
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,198
I beg you one last time.

1025
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,743
Forgive me this once,

1026
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:14,829
and tell Ji-a the truth when she's of age.

1027
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:18,833
And then you can teach her
to be a forgiving wife

1028
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,711
when her husband cheats on her.

1029
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,588
It's hard for men

1030
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:26,174
to resist these kinds of temptations.

1031
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:28,676
If it were that easy,

1032
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,262
the presidents of the United States
and English noblemen

1033
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,348
wouldn't have succumbed to it.

1034
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:37,393
I say this again.
Men are wired differently.

1035
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:40,855
If you were a man and beautiful women
kept fighting for your attention,

1036
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,274
you wouldn't have found it easy

1037
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:47,403
to reject those women
like they're sour milk.

1038
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:50,115
Think of how
we crave unhealthy snacks more.

1039
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:53,326
Your mother went through this,
and now you.

1040
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:56,704
There's also a high chance
this will happen to Ji-a too.

1041
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,498
Lead her by example

1042
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,376
so that she can stay strong
and endure the pain.

1043
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:09,300
I know I haven't lived that long,

1044
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,511
but I never regret holding back.

1045
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,972
Not holding back ensues regret.

1046
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:17,642
Just like how you're finding it hard
to hold back your anger,

1047
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,310
I too could not hold back.

1048
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,730
Ask A Mi if you can't believe me.

1049
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,691
Ask her who started it.

1050
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:30,280
When it's not happening to you,
you can guarantee anything

1051
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:32,532
and make textbook choices.

1052
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:36,578
But it's easier said than done
when you're caught in the mess.

1053
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:41,583
I know what you're trying to say.

1054
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:47,046
I want Ji-a to look up to you
as a role model.

1055
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,883
So when she makes
the same choices you did,

1056
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:54,345
I want her to think that
she did the right thing

1057
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,763
by listening to you.

1058
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:00,185
You said

1059
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:04,647
you wanted to ask your mom
for her forgiveness.

1060
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,859
But you couldn't because I made you mute.

1061
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:12,405
I don't want Ji-a
to have regrets like that.

1062
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:17,619
Regrets shouldn't be passed down.
Let it end with you.

1063
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,920
My mom has always been my weak spot.

1064
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,797
To be more accurate,

1065
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,593
it was actually
the void my dad left me with.

1066
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:38,681
I resented my mom for not having a dad,

1067
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:42,852
which is why I promised myself
that I would never get divorced

1068
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,647
no matter what happened in our marriage.

1069
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,025
"I'll make sure nothing like that happens.

1070
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:51,361
I won't give you a reason to cheat on me."

1071
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,530
That's what I thought

1072
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,366
and I had confidence in myself.

1073
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,619
That's why I made sure to give you my all.

1074
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:02,872
But…

1075
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:07,252
the beautiful glass castle
that I worked hard to build

1076
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,547
shattered in pieces overnight.

1077
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:15,134
It was as if my brain stopped functioning

1078
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:19,556
as if I were a corpse.

1079
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,475
Listening to what you had to say

1080
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:26,854
made me realize how sad it is to be born

1081
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,731
as a human.

1082
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:32,402
Why can't we be perfect?
Why are we so weak?

1083
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:35,405
Is God even perfect himself?

1084
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:38,366
He tells us to offer the other cheek
when struck on one side

1085
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:41,202
and that patience is a virtue,

1086
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,538
so why does he speak
about being punished too?

1087
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,375
Shouldn't God embrace and forgive mankind

1088
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:49,961
since we're designed to be flawed?

1089
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:54,799
You and I both
should have met someone perfect.

1090
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:58,636
Someone like God.
Someone perfect like a deity.

1091
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,015
But like you said,
such a person doesn't exist.

1092
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,433
Exactly.

1093
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:08,980
So can't we move forward with our lives
and forgive and understand each other?

1094
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:28,333
My heart flipped multiple times
in your presence

1095
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:33,671
and thought many times
that I couldn't be happier.

1096
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:38,676
How can I possibly live without you?

1097
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:44,474
They say that mankind is wired
to adapt to any situation,

1098
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,518
but not all of us.

1099
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:48,728
I…

1100
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:53,566
tried to persuade you
by letting you think it was for your sake,

1101
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:58,446
and I only used Ji-a as leverage
just to save myself.

1102
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:01,866
Because I knew
I couldn't cope with the pain.

1103
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,039
How could I possibly live in this house

1104
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:11,459
without you?

1105
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,297
I'm not saying this as an excuse,

1106
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:22,428
but I looked back on myself
while I was with A Mi.

1107
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,930
"What am I doing?

1108
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,099
I shouldn't be doing this."

1109
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:29,560
I evaluated myself
from a psychological standpoint.

1110
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:32,188
My mother didn't give me enough love.

1111
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,607
Not only was she cold towards me,

1112
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,568
but she also passed away at an early age.

1113
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,487
Ms. Kim tried to fill that void,

1114
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:42,073
but she could never be
a replacement for my mother

1115
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:44,117
despite how horrible she was.

1116
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,953
And my father was always busy
running his hospital.

1117
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,663
And because of that lack of love,

1118
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,667
made me have an affair.

1119
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,879
I craved acknowledgement from people.

1120
01:01:56,963 --> 01:02:00,425
From those at work as well as women.

1121
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,635
Your love should have been enough,

1122
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,555
but my greed got the best of me.

1123
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,891
Was this really your first affair?

1124
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:14,981
That's probably why I acted
chivalrously toward women.

1125
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,775
It wasn't just to be nice,

1126
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:21,988
but to somehow make them
fall for me in a way.

1127
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,322
I guess that's my problem.

1128
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:27,285
Then you'll continue to be that way.

1129
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:29,579
You'll keep wanting
the attention of women.

1130
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,622
I don't have the energy anymore.

1131
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,291
With you gone, it's pointless.

1132
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:36,502
You were my joy, and now it's over.

1133
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,922
Will you really be dating someone new?

1134
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:41,883
Would you be willing to?

1135
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:43,050
I don't know.

1136
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:47,346
I don't think I can after hearing
what you said today.

1137
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,932
All men are pretty much the same.

1138
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,936
-What about A Mi?
-It's already over for me.

1139
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,607
I'm just trying to give her some time
so that she won't act out.

1140
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,819
What are you going to tell Ji-a?

1141
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,697
-The truth?
-For now,

1142
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:07,575
I told her we'll be moving into

1143
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:10,536
where my mom stayed to mourn her.

1144
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,121
Did she say yes?

1145
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,600
Because of my flaws

1146
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:36,521
and my foolishness…

1147
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:44,862
Like you said,
it could be me who's flawed.

1148
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:53,079
Come back to me any time
if you change your mind.

1149
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,455
When you can forgive me.

1150
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,459
The disappointment and the shock

1151
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:00,169
must have caused you so much pain.

1152
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,673
So how would Ji-a feel?
She might cut me out of her life.

1153
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:12,765
She takes after you
and is very straightforward.

1154
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:17,061
I won't keep her from you.
She loves her father.

1155
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:20,565
Since she's still young,
she might not think it's a big deal

1156
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,900
-if you stay in her life.
-That would be a relief.

1157
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:26,821
Being hated by my daughter
would give me no reason to live

1158
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:29,156
even though I brought it on myself.

1159
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,701
I remember hearing on TV
that it's impossible for us

1160
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:36,664
to only live with one partner when the
average life expectancy is 100 years.

1161
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,085
We need to switch things up
once in a while,

1162
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:44,046
so just think that the time
came for us a little early.

1163
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,590
Could you do it?

1164
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:47,675
Can you really live without me?

1165
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:50,928
I'll have to.

1166
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:54,765
I'll make it happen.

1167
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:57,935
If only I could turn back the clock a year

1168
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:00,938
I wouldn't have sold the house in L.A.

1169
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:04,358
This was bound to happen at least once.

1170
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:08,070
Take good care of yourself
for Ji-a's sake.

1171
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:10,281
Although Mother would make sure of it.

1172
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:14,285
It won't matter
unless it's you who's caring for me.

1173
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:19,498
I can tell I've caused you a lot of pain

1174
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:22,877
and I'm sorry.

1175
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:01,892
Because of me,

1176
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:06,313
you weren't able
to properly bid farewell to your mother.

1177
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:09,025
I'm so sorry.

1178
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:12,945
I won't ever be able to forgive myself.

1179
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:17,700
I did the unthinkable to you and Ji-a,

1180
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:22,788
but I also should have
looked in on your mother

1181
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:25,875
more often.

1182
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,378
I spent that time with A Mi instead.

1183
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:33,299
All that's left for me
is a one-way ticket to Hell.

1184
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:36,510
My heart aches
when I think of your mother.

1185
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:37,970
I'm her son-in-law,

1186
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:41,766
but I only called once in a while
and didn't visit.

1187
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:45,311
Neither did her daughter for that matter.

1188
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:49,648
No wonder her illness spread so fast.

1189
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:57,656
I should have been more grateful
for the little things in life.

1190
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:02,328
-Now that I've lost everything--
-I couldn't speak,

1191
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:06,248
so I wrote the words on her chest.

1192
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:09,418
"I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
I love you."

1193
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:14,340
The moment I was done, her heart stopped.

1194
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:17,885
I should have said those things
while she was alive and healthy.

1195
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:23,682
If the affair was inevitable,
why couldn't you have had it sooner?

1196
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:27,061
Then I would have made up with my mother

1197
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:31,065
and apologized properly
and asked for her forgiveness.

1198
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:33,150
I'm sorry.

1199
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,403
I really am.

1200
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:42,576
Mom…

1201
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:47,581
I caused her illness.

1202
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,334
It was my fault.

1203
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:54,421
She gave birth to me and raised me,

1204
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:56,632
but never did I once

1205
01:08:57,424 --> 01:09:00,427
express my gratitude toward her.

1206
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,270
All I did was bombard her with resentment.

1207
01:09:10,437 --> 01:09:13,774
I don't know how I'll be able
to manage my life from here on out.

1208
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:25,161
I will still be there for you,

1209
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:28,664
so call me if anything happens
or if you need my help.

1210
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:31,375
Day or night, I'll come running.

1211
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:33,252
I hate you!

1212
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:36,046
We could have had a good life together.

1213
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:42,636
Everything we did to make
this marriage work was all for nothing.

1214
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,513
Whenever I want to see you,

1215
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:47,391
whenever I want to be with you,

1216
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:51,937
should I just take comfort
in the fact that

1217
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:54,148
we're in the same city?

1218
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,110
Just promise me this though.

1219
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:01,447
Call me first
when you're met with hardship.

1220
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:05,743
Whatever it is,
ask me for advice and assistance.

1221
01:10:07,828 --> 01:10:08,829
Okay?

1222
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:16,837
Hate me all you want,

1223
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:20,883
but don't doubt my love for you.

1224
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:22,635
You will be

1225
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:26,972
my one and only true love, Pi-young.

1226
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:48,327
Here.

1227
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:13,686
Do the papers just need to be filed?

1228
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:18,440
Then we'll do things properly.

1229
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:22,403
I'll pay alimony
and have our assets divided.

1230
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:23,821
Just pay for Ji-a's tuition.

1231
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:25,864
I have a job too.

1232
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:30,494
We're getting a divorce like you want,
so let me decide on the details.

1233
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:35,499
Will we be able to sit down
for a meal from time to time?

1234
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:39,295
Will you not allow that?

1235
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:41,046
Fine.

1236
01:12:58,665 --> 01:13:02,461
I want to talk to you.
I have something to discuss with you.

1237
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,296
-It gets lonely.
-Are you?

1238
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:06,673
Mr. Seo.

1239
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:08,217
Maybe she's joking.

1240
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:11,178
What time did you get up to make these?

1241
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:12,471
It didn't take long.

1242
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,932
I kind of like the new me.

1243
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:16,016
Why all of a sudden?

1244
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,476
Aren't you glad?

1245
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:21,105
I can swear too
and do even worse than that.

1246
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:23,107
-Go ahead.
-Are you taunting me?

1247
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:27,027
I'm going to move in with him
no matter what Yu-sin says.

1248
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:30,906
Who were you drinking with?
You'll get sick.

1249
01:13:30,989 --> 01:13:33,659
You're the only woman for me.

1250
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:37,287
I guess you're right.
Everyone else is gone.

1251
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:40,249
What?

1252
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,585
Did you call her over?

1253
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:48,340
