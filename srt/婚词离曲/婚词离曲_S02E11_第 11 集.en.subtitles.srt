00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,559
EPISODE 11

2
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,445
How could you ask to see her phone?

3
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,280
That's not right.

4
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,289
Who are you defending?

5
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:24,292
-Act mature.
-And cheating is mature?

6
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,505
Answer me!

7
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,886
You must be out of your mind.

8
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,639
You leech.

9
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,600
-A spider?
-Is this funny to you?

10
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:41,601
What's a leech?

11
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,232
-Go.
-Look at her. She's putting on a show.

12
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,985
You're not going anywhere.

13
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,918
If you leave,
you're admitting to the affair.

14
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,090
Show me your phone,
and let's resolve this misunderstanding.

15
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,012
If I were you, I would do it.

16
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,141
Aren't you being falsely blamed?

17
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,643
Don't you feel offended?

18
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,483
Make your decision. She's looking at you.

19
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,199
They say trust is the mother of deceit.

20
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,830
I finally realized what it was like
to be speechless after seeing Pi-young.

21
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,791
It's not just figurative. It's real.

22
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,335
How startled was she to go mute?

23
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,048
What will you do?

24
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,342
-Answer me!
-Mother.

25
00:02:56,426 --> 00:03:00,555
I believed you would be
the last person to cheat.

26
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:04,142
It's not right. Didn't you learn
anything from your father?

27
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,936
And what about me?

28
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,565
Pi-young is a perfect wife.
There's no one like her.

29
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,779
Go.

30
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,742
So you're admitting it?

31
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,952
This must be why my husband left so soon.

32
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,539
Are you going to end it or not?

33
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,126
-I'm sorry.
-Don't change the subject!

34
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,587
-Is it a yes or no?
-Wait.

35
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,468
Pack your belongings and go with her.

36
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,345
Come to the court by 10 a.m. tomorrow.

37
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:45,934
Go.

38
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,521
Instead of the evidence,

39
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,440
you're getting rid of the witness.

40
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,123
Drink. Have at least one sip.

41
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,894
This is The Lia Oriental Clinic.

42
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,063
Did Dr. Cho leave already?

43
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,231
Yes, just now.

44
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,025
Could you tell me his number?

45
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:40,405
Tell him my name is Ji Su-hui.

46
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,739
Ms. Ji Su-hui?

47
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,159
Yes. Do you see my number on the screen?

48
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,452
What's today's menu?

49
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,040
Yes. Okay.

50
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,338
-Yes?
-Sir.

51
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,716
A woman named Ms. Ji Su-hui just called.

52
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,176
She wanted to know your number.

53
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,774
-Hello?
-It's me, Cho Ung.

54
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,069
Can we meet?

55
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:24,032
I just arrived
at Incheon International Airport.

56
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,993
I'll see you at Yeouido Hotel.
At the lounge in the lobby.

57
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,787
We'll get there around the same time.

58
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,768
I'll be in Pyeongchang-dong
for the time being. I need some time.

59
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,062
-For what?
-To think.

60
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,521
What gives you the right?

61
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,899
I've already thought this through.

62
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,488
Do you need time to come up
with an excuse?

63
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,948
See you in court tomorrow.

64
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:06,908
I'm not going.

65
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,536
-Says who?
-Avoiding it won't solve anything.

66
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,918
How could this happen to us,
of all families?

67
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,727
-She wins if you divorce him.
-This isn't about winning or losing.

68
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,354
Didn't you see her face?

69
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,148
Imagine how shocked Ji-a will be

70
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,569
if she finds out about the divorce
when her grandmother just died.

71
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,366
We're caught between
a rock and a hard place.

72
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:53,037
I'm also dumbfounded and speechless.

73
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,249
I still can't believe it
even when I saw it myself.

74
00:06:56,332 --> 00:07:00,002
I may not be his real mother,
but I raised him with all my heart.

75
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,422
So how dare he betray us?

76
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:11,430
I thought Yu-sin of all men
wouldn't cheat on his wife.

77
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,141
Never in my wildest dreams…

78
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,564
I can't fathom how you must be feeling.

79
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,776
You have to brace yourself
at a time like this.

80
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,156
Look at how that girl blatantly lied
about their relationship.

81
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,743
-He probably made her say that.
-If I had my way,

82
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,538
I would have torn her scalp off.

83
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,042
What a bastard.

84
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,297
He didn't want her to get hurt.

85
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,424
He must adore her dearly…

86
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,509
since she's so young.

87
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,137
Young? She's turning 30 soon.

88
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,974
He betrayed his wife…

89
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,228
and his little girl
who's the apple of his eye.

90
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,940
He's an asshole who seduced
a girl who's ten years younger than her.

91
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,901
What should we tell Ji-a?

92
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,154
Should we say
that he's still hospitalized?

93
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,967
I'm going to make him mine at all costs.

94
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,805
We'll be right back.

95
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,186
I thought getting a massage
would feel weird,

96
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,521
but it's quite nice.

97
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,105
It's addicting.

98
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,440
I can see why.

99
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:48,152
I should pay attention
and give you a massage when you're tired.

100
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,612
Just hearing that makes me happy.

101
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,406
-I always keep my word.
-For now.

102
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,951
And will continue to do so.
Just watch and see.

103
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,465
Which hotel?

104
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,759
I'm going to go to Gangnam.

105
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,346
-I'm here to see my daughter.
-What's her name?

106
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,640
I was taken aback last time
and forgot to ask.

107
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:22,228
Her English name is Caroline.
But here, she's A Mi.

108
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,856
She has a one-syllable name,
but I just call her A Mi.

109
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,233
Mi?

110
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,194
Does she take after me?

111
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,237
A bit.

112
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,157
She does look like you.

113
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,201
-Can I see a photo?
-Before that…

114
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,330
do you intend to meet her?

115
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,335
-No?
-I have to fly out if I want to meet her.

116
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,380
But due to my work… I'm free in two weeks.

117
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,340
-She's here.
-By herself?

118
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,844
What is she studying? Korean?

119
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,888
So, you want to meet her?

120
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,808
If not, I'll just leave.

121
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,060
Does she want to see me?

122
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,988
JI-A'S DAD

123
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,618
-Hello?
-Hello. This is Ji-a's dad.

124
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,203
Yes, hello.

125
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,663
I'm sorry for calling so late.

126
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,958
It's okay. It's only 8 p.m.

127
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,462
-Can we talk over a cup of tea?
-Right now?

128
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,714
If you're too busy, we can meet tomorrow.

129
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,050
I can come to where you are.

130
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,099
I know. I'm your servant of love.

131
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,643
The one you'll forever be with

132
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,104
is neither your mom nor Ji-a. It's me.

133
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,774
Let's age gracefully together.

134
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,861
Join me in the tub, my dear Sa Pi-young!

135
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,148
Has she gone insane?

136
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,170
It's understandable.
I would've been the same way.

137
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:09,103
Si-eun must've told his wife everything.

138
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,902
Are you trying to wreck our home
like you did yours?

139
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,071
Is that what you want?

140
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,241
You should've shown some sympathy
and turned a blind eye.

141
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,492
I would have done so.

142
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,787
It's not like she has a big mouth.

143
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,834
To be frank…

144
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,004
I also made the same mistake you did.

145
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,256
I had an affair.

146
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,216
Pi-young eventually found out.

147
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,345
She wants a divorce,
but I have no intentions of doing that.

148
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,474
Your wife…

149
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,813
Ms. Lee and my wife are very close.
They see each other every day.

150
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,650
Could you ask her to dissuade my wife?

151
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,861
Do you love your wife
more than that woman?

152
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,530
Yes.

153
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,116
Then I don't see why you should
keep seeing that woman.

154
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,994
As a man yourself,
can you not empathize with me?

155
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,122
In my case, my feelings leaned more
toward the other woman.

156
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,251
It was a difficult decision to make,
but I had no choice.

157
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,589
I visited the equestrian club once
with a colleague.

158
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,675
That's when I saw you with another woman.

159
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,802
Come and get me.
I'll gladly deal with you.

160
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:21,860
So I think it's best for you
to meet with Si-eun first

161
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,864
and persuade her.

162
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,907
She won't listen to me anymore

163
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,910
and she will think
I'm defending a fellow adulterer.

164
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,038
Don't you think she'll resent me more

165
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,500
for not trying to save
my marriage like you?

166
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,466
I'm going to Pyeongchang-dong.

167
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,023
I'm going to make sure
he didn't go to that girl instead.

168
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:02,359
Who cares? He can do what he wants.

169
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,446
I don't care where he goes
or what he does anymore.

170
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,573
Don't give in
after everything you've done.

171
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,409
Are you going to let her
take away your perfect husband?

172
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,912
Well, he's no longer perfect.

173
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,622
Anyway…

174
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,292
you can't let her have
such a seemingly perfect man that easily.

175
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,003
Don't act irrationally.

176
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,924
-He disgusts me.
-I feel the same way.

177
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,802
But look at the big picture
and weigh your gains and losses.

178
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,096
Don't choose to be miserable.

179
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,724
I'm talking to you as a woman,
not your mother-in-law.

180
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,768
But he's an immoral bastard.

181
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,687
I'm talking to you as a woman too.

182
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,565
If I were you, I'd get a divorce
after splitting them apart.

183
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,735
I can't let them get their way.
They'd be ecstatic.

184
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,612
Just don't go there.

185
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,198
He'll think I sent you.

186
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,785
Do you miss your biological dad?

187
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:57,122
I'm not sure.
I do think of him from time to time.

188
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,415
He wants to see you.

189
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,252
-He's not a bad person.
-He does?

190
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,215
I finally managed to get his number.

191
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:12,388
He didn't even know
that he had a daughter.

192
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,808
-I didn't tell him.
-Why not?

193
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:19,269
I'm not sure. I guess it was
because of my stupid pride.

194
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,358
All in all, I'm sorry.

195
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,235
I have no excuses.

196
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,407
Does he really want to meet with me?

197
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,410
Why did you guys break up?

198
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,580
There are many reasons why couples split.

199
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,875
We didn't have much money.

200
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,127
-And--
-And now…

201
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,298
Never mind, I want to see him.

202
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,634
I don't care about anything else.

203
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,581
That bastard…

204
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,043
I guess you're just like the rest of them.

205
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:32,968
In any case, shouldn't I be happy
that they're splitting up?

206
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,947
-Hello.
-Hey.

207
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,409
I haven't been here in ages.

208
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,829
Has Yu-sin gone to work?

209
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,916
Yes. You drink espresso, right?

210
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,502
I stopped drinking coffee for my health.

211
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,973
Ji-a told me that your mother-in-law
is living with you.

212
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,851
Yes. She's at the swimming pool right now.

213
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,562
-It must be tough.
-She helps me around the house.

214
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:29,191
She also takes good care of Ji-a.

215
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,778
I can also take good care of her.

216
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,656
I flew in to spend
some quality time with your mom,

217
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:39,159
but she passed away and I didn't get to
spend a single day with her.

218
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,580
It breaks my heart.

219
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,583
When are you leaving?

220
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,252
-In two days.
-That soon?

221
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,671
Everything reminds me of her.
It's too much.

222
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:54,007
-What will you do with her house?
-I'll leave it for now.

223
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,551
And her belongings?

224
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,804
I can't bring myself to do it just yet.

225
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,641
Seo-hyang, are you listening?

226
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,144
You're too cruel.

227
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,398
You should've told her.

228
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,733
She was your one and only child.

229
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,076
Talking about your grandma made me cry.

230
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,037
Have lunch with us.

231
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,874
No. I'm meeting a friend later.

232
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,418
Mom.

233
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,504
Yes?

234
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,966
Nothing.

235
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,932
Ms. Sa's husband will contact you.

236
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,523
Poor Pi-young.

237
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,067
She must be baffled.

238
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,486
Are all men the same?

239
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,665
Are you almost done?

240
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,211
Do I look okay?

241
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,588
Yes.

242
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:19,593
Ji-a. Your dad is staying at the house
in Pyeongchang-dong for a while.

243
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,511
Why?

244
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,640
We put that house on the market,
and someone's interested.

245
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,769
Let's spend some time together.
Just the two of us.

246
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,648
-When do you start work again?
-Next week.

247
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,610
-What should we do?
-I'll treat you to something tasty.

248
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,446
I saved up some money.

249
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,657
-How much?
-That's a secret.

250
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,783
It's quite a lot.

251
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:46,203
I went to the basement to find something.

252
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:50,082
That's when I came across
A Mi's diary from when she was little.

253
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,834
She missed her dad.

254
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,712
She was also hurt not knowing who he was.

255
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:57,839
It broke my heart.

256
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,676
I had no idea.

257
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:05,055
She never asked
or expressed such feelings.

258
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,600
Are you sure her stepdad
didn't favor his kids over her?

259
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,062
No. He treated her very well.

260
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:16,233
He paid more attention to her
than his two biological kids.

261
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,528
-Maybe he did it behind your back.
-Then we would have split.

262
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:24,032
A Mi also loves her stepdad dearly
and feels grateful toward him.

263
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,872
But I guess her longing
to see her biological dad…

264
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,375
is inevitable.

265
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,630
I thought it'd be best
to let you two meet.

266
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,173
That's why I came here.

267
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,968
I haven't told her yet

268
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:47,472
in case you'd refuse and she'd get hurt.

269
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,518
She doesn't know that I'm here.

270
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,854
I've been thinking about her
ever since that day.

271
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,148
I feel the same way.

272
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,402
I called you,
but it was an unregistered number.

273
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,863
ELDEST DAUGHTER

274
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,491
-I thought you only had a son?
-It's my wife.

275
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,120
Pick it up.

276
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,707
I'll text you.

277
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,089
He's already here.

278
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,079
Do you two know each other?

279
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,249
-She's A Mi.
-Really?

280
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,587
Do you know each other?

281
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,216
-Yes.
-How?

282
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,926
-While horseback riding.
-Goodness.

283
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:09,096
No wonder she looked familiar.

284
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,057
I guess you two were destined to meet.

285
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,235
Should I just go ahead and order?
What do you say?

286
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,361
Sure.

287
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,076
Course B, please. What about beverages?

288
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,163
Just water will do. She's on a diet.

289
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,919
For the main menu,
there are lamb chops and beef tenderloin.

290
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:44,548
-Beef tenderloin for us.
-Lamb chops for me. Let's share them.

291
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,433
I've read articles like these
from time to time.

292
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,978
About siblings who were parted at birth

293
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:01,231
coincidentally
meeting each other as acquaintances.

294
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,608
Right. I've read them as well.

295
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,653
Introduce yourself to him.

296
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,698
-Is that awkward?
-Did Dr. Shin tell you my name?

297
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,868
He just said you were Dr. Cho.

298
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,120
I'm Cho Ung.

299
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:20,709
The broadcasting station also tried
to cast your mom several times. Right?

300
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,043
It was just on the streets.

301
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,549
Did you tell her about Yeong-jae?

302
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,259
No.

303
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,971
You have a younger brother.

304
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,901
You look exactly like your mom
when she was young.

305
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,737
I visited a Benzi store recently.

306
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,282
-I heard you're their model.
-I am.

307
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,700
When I saw your face there,

308
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:58,205
I wondered if you could be
my daughter for a minute.

309
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,208
You looked exactly like your mom.

310
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:06,588
By the way, she's not related
to Dr. Shin Yu-sin, is she?

311
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,381
-Who is he?
-Don't you know him?

312
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,424
Is he your colleague?

313
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:16,306
He said she was his cousin.

314
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,892
He just said that,
because it's a bit complicated

315
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:22,187
-Then how do you know each other?
-He's just an acquaintance.

316
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,205
-Are you two close?
-Yes.

317
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:44,251
So you're telling me that he lied
and said you were his cousin?

318
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:47,337
-What for?
-Please, explain.

319
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,215
-It's a long story.
-I doubt you're lovers.

320
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,302
-No, right?
-Why are you so curious?

321
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:58,181
Because he could've just said
that you were a close friend.

322
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,808
I'm curious as well.

323
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,607
Here's your bread.

324
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,871
I can't ask him myself.

325
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,249
It's not…

326
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,377
an affair, is it?

327
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,422
Are you two lovers?

328
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,260
I like him.

329
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:37,846
How exactly?

330
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,348
What more do you want to hear?

331
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,893
How old is he?

332
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,271
I think he's 44.

333
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,773
And you're dating him?

334
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,074
-Is he divorced?
-I heard he has a young daughter

335
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,076
and a family.

336
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,080
This is my problem, so don't get involved.

337
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,416
-How could I not?
-I won't say anything else.

338
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,380
This is unbelievable.

339
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,258
Neither of you can criticize me.
Don't you think so?

340
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,928
Turn a blind eye
or just don't get involved.

341
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,140
Don't get involved?
Your dad and I met when we were young.

342
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,435
Was that it?
Why did you have me all by yourself?

343
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,356
I heard you didn't even know about me.

344
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,358
What does that insinuate?

345
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,276
-I'm marrying him.
-How could you?

346
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,694
It's all going to end well,

347
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,322
-so stop asking questions.
-Is he divorcing?

348
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:40,283
His wife told me
that she wanted a divorce.

349
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,035
-She made it loud and clear.
-What about him?

350
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,871
He said he'd end it with her
and come to me.

351
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,874
-It may take some time.
-He probably doesn't mean it.

352
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,085
-I know him.
-I think…

353
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,296
you should eat without me.

354
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:57,675
This is too much.

355
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,637
And it doesn't feel real either.

356
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,818
Enjoy your meal.

357
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,906
Why did you let her come to Korea
all by herself?

358
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,410
That bastard…

359
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:43,263
The phone is turned off.
Your call will be…

360
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,727
What kind of person is he?

361
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,771
What should we do?

362
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,482
I don't know what to do.

363
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,944
I can't stay in Korea for too long.

364
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,279
I'll tell them to end it.

365
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,364
Do you think she'll listen?

366
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,575
It's not like I can drag her
back to the US.

367
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,790
In any case, let's go see him.

368
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,422
I'll go see him myself.

369
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:21,801
-Are you going to have this?
-How can I eat right now?

370
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,104
-You must be disappointed.
-Yes, I am.

371
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,525
-Please help me.
-I can't fathom how Pi-young must feel.

372
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,861
Even I am shocked.

373
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:44,240
You know her. She's not
the one to ask for a divorce lightly.

374
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,619
That's why I'm asking for your help.

375
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,078
Why did you do it?

376
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,335
Judging by her self-esteem,

377
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,380
I can't bring this up first
unless she asks for my advice.

378
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,466
Tell her the truth and say we met.

379
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:02,801
I just don't get it.

380
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,386
What was so wrong with Pi-young?

381
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,763
It's not that.

382
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,267
It just happened.

383
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,771
She had so much respect and love for you.

384
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,567
How could you betray her trust?

385
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,488
I deeply regret what I have done
and I am repenting.

386
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,824
Please persuade her to change her mind.

387
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,787
It would be best if I didn't say anything.

388
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,958
It may worsen the situation
if I interfere.

389
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,627
She's not like me.

390
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,129
I told others about my situation early on.

391
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,173
Will you truly end it?

392
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,926
We had already broken up.

393
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,719
Is she clinging onto you?

394
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:50,682
She's struggling to let go
given her young age.

395
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,309
But I know what I want.

396
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:57,564
As a man, don't you want
to start a new relationship

397
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,982
with a young woman?

398
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,611
-Don't you?
-Interest and curiosity

399
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,739
-are different from love.
-Are you saying…

400
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,908
it was out of pure curiosity?

401
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,913
Marriage is more than just a relationship.

402
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,459
You've vowed to love each other
in front of everyone.

403
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,211
I just don't understand

404
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:24,799
how a change of heart can happen so easily
after making such a vow.

405
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,010
For both men and women.

406
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,469
I didn't change.

407
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,100
I have no excuses.

408
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,772
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

409
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,320
Dr. Shin is off this afternoon.

410
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,863
-Is he not here?
-No.

411
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,950
May I know his address? His phone's off.
We go to the same equestrian club.

412
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,077
-What's your name?
-Cho Ung.

413
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,705
I'll let him know.
He turns his phone off when he's busy.

414
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,336
I think he's avoiding us.
A Mi must have called him already.

415
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,712
I just know it.

416
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,056
Is today's menu beef katsu?

417
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,516
-It's beef, right?
-Yes.

418
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,310
You got that right. But this isn't for us.

419
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,478
Then who is it for?

420
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,522
You can have some too.

421
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,159
Dr. Shin.

422
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,622
Hello, Dr. Cho. Your niece…

423
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,208
Damn you!

424
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,793
You bastard.

425
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,878
-What is this about?
-A Mi…

426
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:30,508
-is my daughter.
-Don't you have a daughter too?

427
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,097
We'll talk in my office.

428
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,684
How could she be your daughter?

429
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,603
Put yourself in our shoes.
Imagine how we'd feel.

430
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,481
-I'm sorry.
-As a parent yourself,

431
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,567
how could you do such a thing?

432
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,652
You can confirm this with A Mi,

433
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,823
but at first, I took care of her
like an older brother.

434
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:57,618
I was worried about her safety
since she was here all alone.

435
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,288
Then she grew on me.

436
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,123
In any case, it's my fault.

437
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,751
I should have stayed grounded.

438
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,711
This is driving me crazy.

439
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,130
All this time,

440
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,175
I had no idea she was my daughter.

441
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:19,265
Do everything you can to end this
as soon as possible.

442
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,808
I already tried to.

443
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,104
But she is
psychologically very unstable right now.

444
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:30,234
After hurting herself,
she was admitted to our hospital.

445
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,196
She hurt herself? How?

446
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:36,491
Judging by the wound,
she must've used a broken bottle.

447
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,202
Her left hand was severely wounded.

448
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:48,211
That's why I'm not going
to mention the breakup for the time being.

449
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:55,635
She told me that you're going to
get a divorce. Is this true?

450
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,012
-That's what she wants.
-What about you?

451
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,057
What would you like me to do?

452
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,852
I'm asking about your thoughts, not ours!

453
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,605
For the life she'll have in the future,

454
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,484
she should be with someone better--

455
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,111
You should have never dated her!

456
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,279
What? You're sorry?

457
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,659
Hey!

458
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,037
All I can say is that I'm sorry.

459
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,916
I'm in a meeting with some guests.

460
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,084
Yes, sir.

461
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,754
I don't deserve to say this…

462
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,674
but this is painful for me too.

463
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,845
She drank for days on end
and was unconscious.

464
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,055
Every time I saw her…

465
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,933
We shouldn't provoke her for now.

466
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,982
I know you're distressed and in shock,

467
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,778
but I'll fix this no matter what.

468
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,672
SIN CENTRAL MEDICAL CENTER

469
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:20,928
Did you meet with him?

470
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,059
-Yes.
-What did you say?

471
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,063
Let's talk at home.

472
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,274
You didn't hit him, did you?

473
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,901
We just talked.

474
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,654
How? What did you say?

475
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:42,325
I told you not to intervene.
This is my problem to deal with.

476
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,952
How so?
Your parents are still alive and well.

477
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,039
Am I a kid?

478
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:51,000
In a way, I was raised like an orphan.

479
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,840
I don't resent either of you.

480
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,550
I accepted it.

481
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,678
Just like how I accepted my fate,
you should do the same.

482
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,348
It's too late.

483
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,996
-Hey.
-Yu-sin, I'm at the hospital.

484
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,373
Can we meet for a minute?

485
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,293
-I just left.
-Dr. Cho is…

486
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,757
-You can't believe it either, can you?
-No.

487
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,386
Imagine how I'd feel.
Ignore everything they said to you.

488
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:46,055
Given the situation,
that's the least of my worries.

489
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,890
We won't be able to talk that often.

490
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,101
-You understand, right?
-Yes.

491
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,144
I'll call you once
everything's been resolved.

492
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,480
Can't we at least text once in a while?

493
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,357
-Yes.
-Okay.

494
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,495
Aunt, it's me.

495
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,622
I came to the hospital to visit a friend

496
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,957
and saw Uncle.

497
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:18,254
I think he has another child
other than Yeong-jae. It's a daughter.

498
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,717
I'm not joking. I'll send you the video.

499
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,231
This is nice.

500
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,703
Dong-ma.

501
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,580
Can you help me with this?

502
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,767
That's cold.

503
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,774
Are you free next Friday evening?

504
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,860
-I need to check. Why?
-My dad is celebrating his publication.

505
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,617
-What's wrong?
-It felt like something touched me.

506
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,995
Are you sure? Maybe it's a muscle cramp.

507
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:37,041
No. It felt eerie.

508
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,125
An invisible fish?

509
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,276
Hello.

510
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,530
There's something
I'd like to tell you in person.

511
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,448
Could you make some time for me?

512
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:10,991
Seo Ban.

513
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,084
Where's Ji-a?

514
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,752
At Unit 103.

515
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,589
Why? They don't have any kids.

516
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,551
They bought a puppy.
She wants to play with it.

517
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,099
I'm going to Pyeongchang-dong.

518
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:38,394
I want to make sure A Mi
doesn't come. It's my house after all.

519
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,397
Yu-sin isn't the problem here.

520
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,024
That wily fox is clinging onto him.

521
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,111
I'm going to split them up at all costs.

522
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:50,865
I stand by what I said. If not,
I wouldn't have chosen to get a divorce.

523
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,159
Anything that's too strong
is bound to break.

524
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:56,579
You know what they say
about the carrot and the branch…

525
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,748
This is just my opinion,

526
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:03,586
but being too perfect may make things
harder for others. Men are like that.

527
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,254
It's "the carrot and the stick."

528
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,047
And you're probably right.

529
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:11,385
Father never cheated on you
in his lifetime.

530
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:15,556
Unlike me, you're truly perfect.

531
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:19,435
I've realized what I lack
through this incident.

532
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:23,731
That's not what I meant.
I'm just saying that could be a reason.

533
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,234
What do you even lack?

534
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,236
Nothing.

535
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,155
So I thought maybe that was the issue.

536
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:34,241
What's the point
when it's already come to this?

537
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,494
Let's just say I'm to blame.

538
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,373
In any case,
I won't let this family be separated.

539
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,625
Think of Ji-a.

540
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,421
Force yourself to eat
and take good care of yourself.

541
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,341
I'll split them up no matter what.

542
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,308
Tell Ji-a that I went to cook for him.

543
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,816
Life is full of ups and downs.

544
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:16,492
A dozen young girls like A Mi
are no match for me.

545
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,410
I have no relation to her.

546
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:22,414
I've gone through all sorts of
hardships in my lifetime,

547
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,208
and this is nothing.

548
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,419
-We finally meet.
-Tell me about it.

549
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,255
You're much more beautiful in person.

550
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,508
He usually means the opposite.
Remember that.

551
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,387
You must be tired. It'll take
at least a week to get over the jet lag.

552
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,055
We're just happy to be here.

553
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,766
-How do you address her?
-"Honey."

554
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,393
Ever since we got married.

555
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,562
-You guys were so young.
-Just me.

556
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,188
He wasn't young.

557
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,107
Twenty-five isn't young.

558
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:51,485
Back in the day, we would have
had a daughter-in-law at that age.

559
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,696
What about you guys?

560
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,782
"Babe."

561
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,951
"Babe" isn't bad either.

562
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:02,538
But "honey" sounds quite endearing.
It really feels like we're married.

563
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,958
My sister-in-law is white.

564
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,294
She used to be my brother's secretary.

565
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,796
She calls me by my name.

566
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:15,092
He's 14 years older. Here, you could never
do that to your brother-in-law.

567
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:18,971
She used to call him "Tae-bong."
But now, it's just "Bong."

568
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,389
What do your parents say?

569
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:23,350
What can they say?
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

570
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,811
They live in the US,
so they must follow their customs.

571
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,105
They're extremely understanding.

572
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,398
Ours too.

573
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,693
Hye-ryung bragged so much
every time we talked on the phone.

574
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,196
-About my parents?
-No, about you.

575
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,117
What's the age gap between you and him?

576
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,162
Don't ask me that.

577
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:44,955
I'm just curious.

578
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,957
We're only eight years apart.

579
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,627
But you should take good care
of your hair.

580
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:53,672
If not, you may look like
his father or uncle.

581
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,300
Come on. Why would you talk about my hair?

582
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:00,971
They'll probably find a cure for hair loss
in ten years.

583
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,098
Stem cell research has been ongoing.

584
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:17,529
Where are you going?

585
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,198
I have a headache.

586
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,240
-A walk?
-Yes.

587
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,618
-What brings you by?
-This is my house.

588
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,373
-Let's talk.
-Take a walk first.

589
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,800
There's a cafe down the road.

590
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,850
Did you have dinner?

591
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,311
-Do you have house wine?
-Yes.

592
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,563
-I'd like a glass.
-Milk tea for me.

593
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,735
I should get some groceries for you.

594
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,905
-You're going to stay with me?
-That way, Pi-young will be at ease.

595
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,615
Her imagination won't run wild.

596
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,952
-I want to be alone.
-I won't allow it.

597
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,954
I don't want that girl at my house.

598
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:10,332
That won't happen. We ended everything.

599
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,084
It didn't seem that way.

600
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,963
If you haven't started it
you wouldn't have got caught.

601
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,173
It's so enraging.

602
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:22,177
Take good care of my family
and help me persuade her.

603
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,595
Do it yourself.

604
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,391
She won't listen to you,
so why would she listen to me?

605
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,893
She'll be relieved if I stay here.

606
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,438
-She might think A Mi--
-Then I'll go to the hospital.

607
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,148
You might as well tell the workers

608
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:37,025
you got caught cheating
and may get a divorce.

609
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,652
Imagine what they'll think of you.

610
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,990
-Do I make you uncomfortable?
-I want to be alone.

611
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,909
-Don't worry about me.
-I'm not.

612
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,494
Take good care of Ji-a.

613
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,581
Pi-young will start working again
next week.

614
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,500
Things will be different around the house.

615
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,878
Don't make her feel down.

616
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:58,964
Didn't you get married in spring?

617
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,884
How do you remember that
when you didn't even come?

618
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:04,928
I didn't choose not to attend. I couldn't.

619
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:08,765
I know. How could you come all the way
from the US? It's not like we're related.

620
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,602
Had I not gotten an appendectomy,
I would have.

621
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:13,395
-I mean it.
-I can guarantee that.

622
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,980
You're my best friend.

623
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:18,859
Don't you feel like your spouse
is your best friend these days?

624
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,570
What do you think?

625
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:24,156
-You can call his name.
-You can.

626
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:27,493
This is my first time meeting him.
And he's much older.

627
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,785
Then call me mister.

628
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,497
Mister.

629
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,999
But that doesn't mean
I can call you ma'am, right?

630
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:36,877
Right. That's why I love you.

631
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,422
You guys are so lovey-dovey.
Have you really been married for a decade?

632
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,759
We don't have any children.
I'm sure you guys are just the same.

633
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,387
We've only been married
for three years now.

634
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:51,391
During the entire time you've known him,
when were you the most touched?

635
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,981
-Too hard to pick one?
-You first.

636
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,905
I once lost this engagement ring at home,

637
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,949
but he didn't even get mad.

638
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:09,451
I was searching every nook and cranny.

639
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:13,372
He told me not to worry
and that he'd buy me a five-carat ring.

640
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:18,418
Goodness. Most men would have
scolded their wives for being careless

641
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,547
and losing such a valuable item.

642
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,259
Exactly. I was truly touched.

643
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,386
Where did you find it?

644
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:30,389
I can't quite remember, but I did find it.

645
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:33,058
You found it in the underwear drawer.

646
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,643
Did I?

647
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,520
Your turn.

648
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:40,899
Aren't there any?

649
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,238
We met almost every day
when we were dating.

650
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:51,285
He drove me home every single time

651
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,745
-instead of letting my manager drive me.
-Oh, my.

652
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,415
-Where did you live?
-Ui-dong.

653
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:59,793
-Until you got married?
-Yes.

654
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:02,921
I loved that house.
There was even a swing in the yard.

655
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,631
Now, it's an apartment complex.

656
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,510
What about you?

657
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:15,183
When she accepted my proposal.

658
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,482
I know you like beef katsu.

659
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,818
Just take them out of the freezer
and fry them.

660
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:27,362
Gosh, this must've taken a while to make.

661
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,867
This is chicken curry.

662
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,578
-Ji-a liked them.
-When did you have the time?

663
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:37,706
I should have brought them
before dinner, but I was late.

664
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:40,834
We'll have them for breakfast.
Thank you so much.

665
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:43,712
To be honest…

666
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,674
I'm going through the same thing you are.

667
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:52,095
Yu-sin is seeing someone.

668
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,314
Where's your mother-in-law?

669
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,399
In Pyeongchang-dong.

670
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,318
Did she leave for good?

671
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,535
-Hello.
-Goodness.

672
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,044
I should get going.

673
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,809
He wanted some time alone.

674
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:40,852
He's worried about Ji-a.

675
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,940
Meet that girl and put an end to it.

676
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,485
-He's going to break up with her.
-I don't want to see his face.

677
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,986
Do it for Ji-a.

678
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:54,116
Even if we stay married,
things will never be the same.

679
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:58,328
I've done my part now.

680
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,756
You know what?

681
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:13,969
After talking with them,

682
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:16,513
I realized that you truly treated me well.

683
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,100
It must not have been easy.

684
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,731
Let's try to make things work.

685
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,402
I won't bring up the past anymore.

686
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:32,904
Okay?

687
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:36,992
Okay.

688
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,164
Help me get changed.

689
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,559
Let's get matching rings as well.

690
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,481
-Okay?
-Enough with that nonsense.

691
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,107
It's not nonsense.

692
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:12,486
Let's follow the trend
and wear one like young couples do.

693
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,947
Don’t bite off more than you can chew.
You'll dislocate your jaw.

694
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,742
Why are you so serious over a simple ring?

695
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:21,161
-That phrase is irrelevant.
-Don't talk back to me.

696
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,163
It's cheap.

697
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,332
-We're going to be an embarrassment.
-To who?

698
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,250
-Our kids.
-Our daughters-in-law?

699
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,169
Come on!

700
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,060
I'm exhausted.

701
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:48,730
Chatting is more exhausting
than horseback riding.

702
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,400
I used up all the energy
from horseback riding and chatting.

703
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,861
-You should've left first.
-I had to maintain my connections.

704
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:10,001
No matter how much I think about it,
I can't forgive him.

705
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,467
Did you stay up all night?

706
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:27,978
-Goodness. My rings.
-I took them out.

707
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:29,938
-Where are they?
-In the drawer.

708
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,608
-Why?
-They looked heavy.

709
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,861
I wouldn't wear them if they were.

710
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:39,239
Let's get matching rings today.

711
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:41,741
What did you say?

712
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:45,745
-Did I hear you correctly?
-Yes.

713
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,372
What's gotten into you?

714
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,626
Seriously? You're going to wear one too?

715
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,837
Aren't we a couple?

716
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,510
I'm the one who likes him.
He's not to blame.

717
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,637
Once my career started to take off,

718
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,974
he dumped me saying
I should become successful

719
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:07,893
and meet someone better.

720
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,812
But I couldn't let go.

721
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,856
-What's so great about him?
-Just…

722
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,483
everything.

723
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,445
I like the way he talks.

724
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,406
But most of all, I like his heart.

725
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:26,536
You will be able to meet
someone much better than he is.

726
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,288
I couldn't find one until now.

727
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,582
They were all boring.

728
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:33,710
You weren't even in
that many relationships.

729
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,421
Don't sigh.

730
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,965
What matters is the outcome.

731
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,635
He is bound to get
a divorce sooner or later.

732
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,970
It's not that easy with a child.

733
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:47,140
If it wasn't for their child,
he would have divorced her already.

734
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:50,268
He asked me for more time
because of his daughter.

735
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,646
You never know
until the divorce is finalized.

736
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:56,191
People change their minds all the time.
Especially women.

737
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:59,527
I met her myself. She told me to have him.

738
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:02,030
-She was just being emotional.
-Do you want to bet?

739
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:07,744
His feelings toward me are sincere.

740
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,956
Do you think it's okay
to be a homewrecker?

741
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:12,666
I'm not going to think about that.

742
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,752
It's already been done.

743
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:19,756
She wants to get a divorce. This is fate.

744
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,134
Don't worry about me and just leave.

745
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,303
I'll take care of this.

746
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,432
Do you love him more than your job?

747
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:35,647
DIRECTOR SHIN YU-SIN

748
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,655
See you in court tomorrow by 10 a.m.

749
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,156
I'll wait until you come.

750
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,002
SEE YOU IN COURT TOMORROW BY 10 A.M.

751
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,091
Is Dad not coming today?

752
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,970
-Why?
-Don't you miss him?

753
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:12,100
I miss your grandma much more.

754
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:16,855
Ask him if he'd like to
have dinner with you. I have plans.

755
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:19,607
Maybe next time when you're here.

756
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:21,901
You have Grandma.

757
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:24,154
Ji-a.

758
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:29,617
How about you and I move into
Grandma's apartment for a while?

759
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,702
Just us two?

760
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,290
I've only been there once

761
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,168
after she had flown in
from the Philippines.

762
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,961
My excuse was that I was too busy.

763
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,548
I regret it so much.

764
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,801
But it's too late now.

765
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:53,058
I want to stay there
and feel her presence.

766
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,435
This is too painful for me.

767
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:59,064
Then Dad should come too.
Does he not want to?

768
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,690
I want it to be just us.

769
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,568
He's more comfortable here.

770
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,528
After all, she was my mom.

771
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,781
Still, we should ask him
if he wants to come.

772
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:12,035
I will, but he will say no.

773
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:14,579
He has Grandma, so he'll be okay.

774
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:18,500
Don't you know how well Grandma
takes care of him?

775
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,668
It brings her joy.

776
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,962
Okay, if that's what he wants.

777
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:27,217
If you don't want to go,
then you can stay here with Dad.

778
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,468
I want to go.

779
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:32,222
I don't care where I am
as long as I'm with you.

780
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,022
How about those?

781
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,359
Pick whatever you like.

782
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:46,111
You should like it too.

783
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:49,656
You two look great together.
Have you set a wedding date?

784
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:53,118
We've been married for a while now.

785
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:55,703
Goodness. Really? I'm sorry.

786
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,038
Don't be.

787
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,624
You guys looked so lovey-dovey.
That's why.

788
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,167
That's because we're married.

789
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,087
Strangers shouldn't be lovey-dovey.

790
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,422
I thought you two had just started dating.

791
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,175
-How much are they?
-It's 3,190,000 won.

792
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,594
-For one or two?
-One.

793
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:12,804
It's so expensive.

794
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:15,265
That's because it's platinum,
not white gold.

795
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:16,975
Aren't they the same thing?

796
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:19,727
That's what many people think,
but they're different.

797
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:22,689
White gold is an alloy of gold
and another mineral,

798
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,941
so it could change color.
But platinum doesn't.

799
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:28,736
That shouldn't happen.
Both love and rings shouldn't change.

800
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:30,572
Do you have my size?

801
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,574
We do.

802
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:38,663
-Pay for mine.
-I don't want to.

803
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:42,125
What's the point in buying my own ring?

804
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:43,751
Don't you think so?

805
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,005
What's mine is yours.

806
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,423
Still…

807
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:53,636
Thank you.

808
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:59,726
You may think it's rude,
but I didn't ask about you.

809
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,519
Chang-hui told me.

810
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,481
-I see.
-Your delivery is at the end of May.

811
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,774
The due date is May 31.

812
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,694
-But it could be later.
-Is it a boy or a girl?

813
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:12,030
The baby has its legs crossed,
so I'm not sure.

814
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:16,951
I wanted to ask you if you could
teach me after you give birth.

815
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,536
There are many places we could meet.

816
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:22,540
There's a playroom for kids on
the first floor and a lounge as well.

817
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:25,627
Could Chang-hui not find a replacement?

818
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,463
She did. But…

819
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:32,050
I'll be frank.
I'd like your baby to come as well.

820
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:34,052
If that's difficult for you,

821
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,179
I could go to your neighborhood instead.

822
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:42,060
I've never really seen babies before
except on the streets or at restaurants.

823
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:45,146
Didn't you say you have a younger brother?

824
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,691
We met when he was a kid.
I think he was eight.

825
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:51,152
-We have different mothers.
-I see.

826
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,279
I ended up staying single.

827
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,073
I lived in isolation.

828
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:58,284
I just worked and enjoyed my hobbies.

829
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:00,828
I hope it's not too much to ask.

830
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:03,039
It's not.

831
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:07,418
But for now, I'd like to focus
on the baby and giving birth.

832
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:10,463
I understand.
From what my colleagues have said,

833
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,173
it sounds tough.

834
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,425
My friends told me that I have it easy.

835
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,844
Your baby is already considerate of you.

836
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:22,183
I envy women.
They can have a baby whenever they want.

837
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:25,979
But men can also have a baby
no matter how old they are

838
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:29,232
if they get married to a young woman.

839
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:33,111
I bet you could find a good woman
if you wanted to.

840
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,529
It's hard to make up my mind.

841
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,872
Shouldn't you ask me why?

842
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:49,627
I just don't think
there's a special reason for it.

843
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:53,548
Many of my colleagues ask me this often.

844
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:57,719
"Why are you still a bachelor?
Are you seeing anyone?"

845
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:00,054
They're just showing interest in you.

846
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:03,016
I feel uncomfortable
when I'm asked such questions.

847
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:09,355
Anyway, my yearning to find love
is still not that strong.

848
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:13,359
But when I see babies, I want to
look them in the eye and swaddle them.

849
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,905
-I've grown old, haven't I?
-I don't think that's why.

850
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,907
I think your compassion has just grown.

851
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:24,412
In our youth, we tend to be self-centered.

852
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:29,042
I think growing old is good.
At least for me.

853
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,210
-Do you truly think so?
-Yes.

854
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:35,381
I get what you're saying.

855
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,300
I was the same way.

856
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:38,968
My desire to have a baby

857
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:42,472
was incomparable with my other desires

858
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,599
such as hunger or material wealth.

859
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:47,560
When I found out I was pregnant,

860
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,520
I felt as if I was blessed.

861
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:55,568
I'll think about it on a positive note.

862
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,622
Give that to me. I'll do it.

863
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:09,666
-It's okay.
-It's like pouring a drink.

864
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:12,001
You should let the other person
do it for you.

865
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:13,920
Goodness. Okay, then.

866
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:21,886
Let's live happily until the day we die.

867
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:24,639
Okay.

868
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:30,978
It's comfortable.

869
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,901
Excuse me.

870
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,953
-This is milk porridge.
-Okay.

871
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:58,047
You'll probably only wear it
for a day or two.

872
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,216
That's how you lost our wedding ring.

873
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:01,342
I won't take it off.

874
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:02,927
-We'll see.
-Sure.

875
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:10,768
Why did you suddenly want
to get matching rings?

876
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:25,825
Those rings on your fingers looked heavy.

877
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:30,204
Like the burden you've been carrying

878
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,958
and the emptiness you felt in your heart.

879
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:40,631
It felt like you were trying to fill
that emptiness with those two big rings.

880
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,845
Look how light that one is.

881
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:58,816
It may seem like
you've forgiven me for everything,

882
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,863
but I'm sure you still have
some grudges left.

883
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,574
That's what I think.

884
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:18,211
I was an idiot.

885
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:21,714
I lacked in so many ways.

886
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:25,802
You were kind enough
to understand and endure it.

887
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:36,062
Just watch me. I'll do well.

888
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,107
That's an odd expression.

889
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:45,112
Anyway, I'll do my best.

890
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:04,632
I had grudges,

891
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:07,927
but I'll let go of all of them today.

892
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:12,723
Eat up.

893
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,438
You're going to feel lonely

894
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,108
-when you go to heaven.
-Why?

895
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:25,111
Because you'll be going there alone.
I'll be in hell.

896
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:30,616
Even if I was the Grim Reaper,
I wouldn't send myself to heaven.

897
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:33,327
After all that I've done…

898
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:36,539
Humans aren't the only ones
who can forgive.

899
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,459
God can forgive as well.

900
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:45,047
And you're not that bad of a guy.

901
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:48,134
You're more than worthy
of going to heaven.

902
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,595
Is that so?

903
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,848
Right, Lord?

904
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:04,400
-Good morning.
-Hi.

905
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:05,985
Wake your mom up.

906
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,082
Mom, where are you?

907
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,710
You should've woken me up.

908
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,338
Okay.

909
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:31,594
-Mom and Dad are at the swimming pool.
-They're swimming together?

910
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:32,929
Probably.

911
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:42,438
I thought you were hell-bent
on divorcing him.

912
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:55,368
But then again,
divorcing him wouldn't satisfy her.

913
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:17,223
Then what will happen to that girl?

914
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,649
-Hello?
-Are you at the swimming pool?

915
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:29,068
Yes. I'm done now.

916
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:31,404
Come have breakfast. I'm at the buffet.

917
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:33,531
-The buffet here?
-Yes.

918
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:34,532
Okay.

919
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:29,962
