00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,382
EPISODE 9

2
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,999
My goodness!

3
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:10,130
When you're in need of help,
call out for a dad.

4
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,799
-There's no dad here though.
-I'm going to be one.

5
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,385
Who knows?
I might become one in ten months.

6
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,600
Ask for permission first.

7
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,145
Don't just tip-toe out of bed
without me knowing.

8
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,897
-That's up to me.
-Just say you'll comply.

9
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,107
Why must I?

10
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,151
Because that's what loyal followers do.

11
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,569
A loyal follower?

12
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,947
Yes because you'll only love me forever.

13
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,699
Would you risk your life for me?

14
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,034
It's yours to take.

15
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,042
Have some coffee. I made some espresso.

16
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,840
This is my first ring ever.

17
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:36,966
As if.

18
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,719
Really?

19
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,598
Honey.

20
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:48,228
We're married now.
All that's left is the ceremony.

21
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,814
Then you've probably been married
multiple times.

22
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,025
My heart has never been in sync like this.

23
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,069
They say the hearts
of a husband and wife become one.

24
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,364
What am I to you?

25
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,659
Was I just a one-night stand?

26
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,627
I can tell.

27
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,213
I can feel it.

28
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,850
Our wedding will be ten days after Ban's.

29
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,354
They'll have to be back
from their honeymoon to attend ours.

30
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,523
-That's not possible.
-Why not?

31
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,401
I need to tell Ji-a first.

32
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,196
Besides, it takes more than
booking a venue to get married.

33
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,282
I'll put two of my assistants on it.

34
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:46,244
And dragging this out
won't make it any easier for Ji-a.

35
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,413
You have to grab the bull by its horns.

36
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,415
You can do anything you put your mind to.

37
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:51,916
Leave it to me.

38
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,002
I'm not sure.

39
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,838
You're not sure?

40
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,340
Let me handle it.

41
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:01,592
Honey.

42
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,637
I just called you "honey."

43
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,224
I'd appreciate it
if you matched the pace of my emotions.

44
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,228
Got it, Honey.

45
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,074
Grandma!

46
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,660
Grandma!

47
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,955
Why did you cut off your hair?

48
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,166
Oh, it kept getting in the way.

49
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,131
I feel as light as a feather.

50
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,424
It looks weird, Grandma.

51
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,717
Because you're new to it.

52
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,136
It'll grow on you.

53
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:34,393
Should I tell them that I saw Song Won?

54
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,859
But what if they think I'm crazy?

55
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,123
What's with your hair?

56
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,500
Don't I seem liberated?

57
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,293
You should have asked me first.

58
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,256
Did you help her?

59
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,425
-No.
-I did it myself.

60
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,844
For what reason?

61
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,221
How do I look?

62
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,390
I guess short hair suits you too.

63
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,725
As if. That's easy for you to say.

64
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,936
The upkeep got annoying with old age.

65
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,147
I prefer it because it's easy to manage.

66
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,858
You look like a boy.

67
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,736
Long hair has always suited you best.

68
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,198
I'm 60 now.

69
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,950
Who cares if I look like a tomboy?

70
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,827
My puppy should have a glass of milk.

71
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,538
I'm not hungry.

72
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,874
I think the salon here opens early.

73
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,960
I'll get a proper haircut in Seoul.

74
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,546
-No, Grandma.
-Why? Do I embarrass you?

75
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,049
Let me take you. I'll get my jacket.

76
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,552
Oh, please. I'm not a kid, you know.

77
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,265
I should have some breakfast first.

78
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,693
Can I stop by your place today?

79
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,029
Sure. When?

80
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,780
Your father left about an hour ago.

81
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,033
-With my mother?
-She went to the spa.

82
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,176
Why don't we let the ladies go first
and stick around a little longer?

83
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,054
We should leave as we came. Together.

84
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,889
Sure.

85
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,558
Did you ever not want to study as a kid?

86
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,227
Of course.

87
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,020
How did you cope?

88
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,981
Well, I tried not to think about it.

89
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,526
Thinking about studying
makes you want to quit

90
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,528
-and play outside.
-And play games!

91
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,487
Sure.

92
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,865
When you don't feel like it,
stop or think about something else.

93
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,951
Can that be done?

94
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,036
Give it a try.
You'll find that it's doable.

95
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,921
-Why are you here?
-The chairman's here.

96
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,224
Here's what we'll do.

97
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,394
Marry the woman you want.

98
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,188
Our family will all attend the wedding.

99
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,233
But in return, let go of your grudge.

100
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,862
Dong-ma's mother did nothing wrong.
It was all me.

101
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,365
As you know,

102
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,368
she wanted a good relationship with you.

103
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,661
On your birthday,

104
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,664
she'd always cook seaweed soup
for the family.

105
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,834
She never sent you any
because she knew you'd refuse.

106
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,796
Do it for Dong-ma's sake.

107
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,266
Two kids, right?

108
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,603
-Yes.
-They must be at a sensitive age.

109
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,604
Aren't they trouble?

110
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,690
-They're sweet.
-I would like to meet her.

111
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,693
-I can't let you marry a stranger.
-To say what?

112
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,361
Nothing that will ruin things.

113
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,780
You know I always keep my word.

114
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,283
So you two argued?

115
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,827
That's right.
I apologized for the misunderstanding

116
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,830
and she insisted that I buy her
four cakes as an apology.

117
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,373
Four whole cakes.

118
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,293
How do you know her?

119
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,836
Is she a friend?

120
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,964
-She's Yu-sin's girlfriend.
-My gosh.

121
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,799
Seriously?

122
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,473
DIRECTOR SHIN YU-SIN

123
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,224
-Yes?
-What's Ji-a up to?

124
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,059
-She's not picking up.
-She's learning to snowboard.

125
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,061
How dangerous. Why not stick to skiing?

126
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,021
A Mi's teaching her some basic moves.

127
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,440
She's letting A Mi teach her?

128
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,359
Yes, Ji-a asked.

129
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,904
-Are they getting along?
-Yes.

130
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,824
You must be alone.

131
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,492
-Right.
-Are you home?

132
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,952
-Yes.
-Should I join you?

133
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,912
Why?

134
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,456
You shouldn't be alone.

135
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,083
-I'm heading out soon.
-Do you have plans?

136
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,043
Yes. I'll hang up, then.

137
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,795
Tell Ji-a I'll call her later.

138
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,797
Got it.

139
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,095
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SEO

140
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,577
Let the front of your feet hover.

141
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,953
That's it!

142
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,164
I'll let go, all right?

143
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,754
Let me help you up. I bet that hurt.

144
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,589
There you go.

145
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:19,924
Okay, let's try that again.

146
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,033
Take that.

147
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,869
Diamonds.

148
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:50,871
Reverse.

149
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,706
Is that how it'll be?

150
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,625
Reverse once again.

151
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,709
What?

152
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,928
Are you kidding me?
I don't have a card to play.

153
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,555
Unbelievable.

154
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,440
Yes, Mother.

155
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,654
In about 30 to 40 minutes.

156
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,740
Sure thing.

157
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,327
Excuse me.

158
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,352
Are you all right?

159
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,604
Of course.

160
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,982
Let the others know
without shattering their mood.

161
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,527
Sure. I'd drive you home
if I hadn't been drinking.

162
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,821
Su-yeon would loathe me.

163
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,531
She'd never.

164
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,536
The hired driver is here.

165
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,292
I'm glad.

166
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,461
Dad took a huge step back.

167
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,756
Underneath all that, he's a loving father.

168
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,261
I'll swing by tomorrow.
In the evening, of course.

169
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,221
Sure.

170
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,019
My dad approved of Ban's wedding.

171
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,396
Si-eun will be ecstatic.

172
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,315
I'll wait a week before telling him.

173
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,194
He might react differently to your case.

174
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,737
The outcome will be the same.

175
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,003
What if he asks you to move in?

176
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,090
-He wouldn't.
-Why not?

177
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:09,969
He'd only want to live
with a daughter-in-law he approves of.

178
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,429
Relationships rarely begin on a high note.

179
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,555
What matters is the outcome.

180
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,394
I believe in my wife
and I know my dad well.

181
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,561
What about your mother?

182
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,606
She's more like my soulmate,
so you don't need to worry.

183
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,775
-It's Ji-a who's unpredictable.
-I know.

184
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,152
She needs to focus on her studies,

185
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,321
but both her parents are causing trouble.

186
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,823
It depends on how you look at it.

187
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:34,451
I tell myself that too,
but it's easier said than done.

188
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,787
She hasn't been through much in life,

189
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,832
so how can this be easy to accept?
It'll confuse her.

190
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:40,958
Leave that to me.

191
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,302
I'm sorry, but you should know
I had a few drinks.

192
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,638
I was at a party, you see.

193
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,767
-I see. Well, please have a seat.
-And the baby?

194
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,145
He's in that room.

195
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,397
Oh, I'll wash my hands first.

196
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,648
The bathroom's that way.

197
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,992
It doesn't roll off my tongue.

198
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,285
Has Sa-hyeon called?

199
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,287
He wouldn't be home early
on a day like this.

200
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,581
It'd be nice of him
to be home early today.

201
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,207
Why?

202
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,961
What are you hoping for
in that head of yours?

203
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,005
Nothing. It's just that…

204
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:29,673
She's 40.

205
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,342
Forty?

206
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,511
Is she that old?

207
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,221
You were there when I found out.

208
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,182
I keep forgetting things

209
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,100
ever since Song Yuan left us.

210
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,396
Hand.

211
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,408
It's beautiful as your heart.

212
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,701
I can be mean too.

213
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,745
I know, and I even like that side of you.

214
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,042
Won.

215
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,252
Your baby…

216
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,672
is an angel.

217
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,682
Jeong-bin, I know your mom isn't here
but I'm here for you.

218
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,436
I'll shower you with love.

219
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,445
Here you go.

220
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,072
Thank you.

221
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,783
If you haven't eaten,
please have some dinner.

222
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,076
Drinks are hardly a meal.

223
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,578
I haven't had much of an appetite lately.

224
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:45,249
-Why not?
-I won't blame you for spreading a rumor,

225
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,501
but the man I was supposed to marry…

226
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,089
-ended things.
-Goodness.

227
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,883
Neither of us like spreading rumors

228
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,344
so don't worry.

229
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,554
Please address me casually.

230
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,598
Won told me that you only have sons.

231
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,143
Right, and that is a shame.

232
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:08,147
Jeong-bin's mom was like a daughter to us.

233
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:13,152
My parents
were as gracious and generous as you two.

234
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,278
Swing by anytime.

235
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:18,073
When you need comfort
or when you want to see Jeong-bin.

236
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,037
-A Mi came by yesterday, right?
-The day before that.

237
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,540
She set up the tree with us.

238
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:34,673
Ma'am, are all men really not trustworthy?

239
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:38,093
It depends on the man.

240
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,513
-Just think that it wasn't meant to be.
-You probably haven't been dumped before.

241
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,723
Of course not.

242
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,851
It hurts like hell.

243
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,645
You lose the will to live.

244
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,441
Don't say things like that
or even think about it.

245
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,902
There are a lot of decent men out there.

246
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,197
I'm feeling more tipsy.

247
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,033
-You do?
-Please speak casually to me.

248
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,201
Sure thing.

249
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,037
I mean, got it.

250
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,456
My son drinks iced coffee to sober up.

251
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,250
I'm afraid I don't drink coffee.

252
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,628
Because coffee…

253
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,297
reminds me of him.

254
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,593
Tell us about him
and let this be the day you move on.

255
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,386
He's a catch.

256
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,055
I'd expect no less.

257
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,682
How else could he have dated
a famous musical actress?

258
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,727
I hear that men…

259
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,065
keep their first loves
buried inside their hearts.

260
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,489
My words will be the death of me.

261
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,908
Why did I tell her
to lay it all out for us?

262
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:48,664
Not all men are the same,
and it depends on the situation.

263
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,623
How was it for you?

264
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,964
Who knew that someone so pretty
could be persistent?

265
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,298
In my case…

266
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,844
my wife is my first…

267
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,723
and last love.

268
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,436
-Is that true?
-What can I do but believe him?

269
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,272
Maybe I should

270
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,317
have a baby on my own
without getting married.

271
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,819
How so if you're not married?

272
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,196
-Don't be silly.
-It's a different world now

273
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,864
and I can use a sperm donor.

274
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,199
It's wrong.

275
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,828
Why are you willing to bring
a fatherless baby into this world?

276
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:31,498
-Is that what you think?
-Yes, it's not natural.

277
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,499
Natural?

278
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,462
The natural order of the world
is defied at every turn,

279
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,257
so why must we stick to it?

280
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,679
If that were the case,
Won would still be around.

281
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,682
Nothing in life is with reason.

282
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,517
We may not be able to see her,

283
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,187
but she continues to live
within our hearts.

284
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,230
I feel her too.

285
00:21:55,814 --> 00:22:00,110
There's a warmth in this house
that makes me feel like she's here.

286
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:06,408
-I might fall asleep if I lie down.
-Then stay the night.

287
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,077
I'll set you up in the study.

288
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,374
By the way, have you had any cake today?

289
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,919
It wouldn't be Christmas without one.

290
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,298
-But I didn't get around to eating any.
-We have some.

291
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,633
-Right?
-We do.

292
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,054
Goodness. The little one's awake.

293
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,430
-Allow me.
-It's okay.

294
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:37,689
What would you wish for
if Santa was here right now?

295
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,566
To wake up next to you tomorrow.

296
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,110
-And you?
-Nothing.

297
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,070
Because it already came true?

298
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:49,201
-Arrogant jerk.
-You are my Santa.

299
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,161
If only I felt the same way.

300
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,623
-Why don't you?
-Well…

301
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,376
No one knows what the future holds.

302
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,337
I'll return this ring

303
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,589
if Ji-a doesn't accept us.

304
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:05,884
-And I doubt your parents will approve.
-They gave Ban their blessing.

305
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,303
What's your mother like?

306
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:11,306
She's nicer than people assume.
And I'm not just saying that.

307
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,359
My mom has never gone
against my dad's wishes.

308
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,279
Must I be that way too?

309
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,532
As her son, I didn't find it ideal.

310
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,662
You keep addressing me casually.

311
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,789
Can't you allow it when it's just us two?

312
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,294
Why am I the only one drunk?

313
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,546
I'm trying to keep it together.

314
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,423
You can let loose when you're with me.

315
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:49,261
And what if I do?
Would you be able to handle me?

316
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,099
Would you?

317
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,517
Should I scrub your back?

318
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,685
I'm good.

319
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,228
But it'll be refreshing.

320
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,608
Do you still see Mother as a woman?

321
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,985
What are you getting at?

322
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,737
You overreacted
after seeing her haircut this morning

323
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,448
saying she looks better with long hair.

324
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,075
Can you condone that mom bob?

325
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,163
It's not about whether she looks good.
At her age…

326
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,706
Don't nitpick.

327
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,250
It looks good on her.

328
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,295
Haircuts should reflect your age too.

329
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,547
Why not focus on looking better yourself?

330
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,216
More than I already do?

331
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,385
Are you not satisfied with me?

332
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,682
Thank you.

333
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,936
You didn't answer me.
Could you live with my parents?

334
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,438
I wasn't avoiding the question.

335
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,732
I'd move in with them
if that's what they want.

336
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,317
Gladly or reluctantly?

337
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,444
I haven't even met them.

338
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,280
If we can't see eye to eye on things,

339
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,657
I'd be moving in reluctantly.

340
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,827
You're pretty but also honest.

341
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,175
Wasn't this a nice getaway?

342
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,345
It's true that love brings out a glow.

343
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,930
-You're proof of that.
-Gosh.

344
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,141
Watching you made me realize
that people should marry well.

345
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,351
Of course.

346
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,732
If my marriage is troubled,
it'd show on my face,

347
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,609
and that will upset you.

348
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,735
That's right.

349
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:31,488
Mom, can't you still get pregnant?

350
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,827
If you can manage it,
I think it'd be nice if you did.

351
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,748
Judging by how Mr. Seo is,

352
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,209
he'll be a great father to his own child.

353
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,002
Just look at how he is with us.

354
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:47,921
He's sweet.

355
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:54,052
U-ram has always wanted a younger sibling.

356
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,976
Here you go. I know it's late,
but Merry Christmas.

357
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,228
What is it?

358
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,396
My goodness.

359
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,524
I was actually in need
of a little pick-me-up.

360
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,318
We weren't able
to get you anything though.

361
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,196
As if there's anything I need.

362
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,992
You looking after Jeong-bin
is the biggest gift I can ask for.

363
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,159
Thank you for this.

364
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,954
We need to stay strong and healthy.

365
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,722
Yesterday, the musical singer…

366
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,099
-Actress.
-Yes, whatever.

367
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,728
Nam Ga-bin came by
with clothes for Jeong-bin.

368
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,354
As a Christmas gift.

369
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,481
Text her and thank her.

370
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,775
-Sure.
-Jeong-bin may have lost his mother,

371
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,069
but many still care about him.

372
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,738
They all dote on him.

373
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,114
Did you have fun?

374
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:57,782
Yes.

375
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,160
How do you think
I found out it was Ms. Lee?

376
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,162
-I'm curious.
-Through Sa Pi-young.

377
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,164
Did she call you? Or did you call her?

378
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,167
-I doubt it was you.
-It was me.

379
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,837
She's the reason I ended it with Ga-bin.

380
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,921
What are you saying?

381
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,346
INCOMING CALL
PARK HAE-RYUN

382
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,473
Go ahead. I need to take this.

383
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,475
-We'll order for you.
-Got it.

384
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,479
-Hello?
-Yes, hello.

385
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,439
-Hi.
-Have you had dinner?

386
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,732
I was just about to.

387
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,816
I'll call back then.

388
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,778
It's fine. We're at a restaurant
and my mother's ordering.

389
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:35,820
I see.

390
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:40,700
Anyway, Ms. Lee is marrying
the radio engineer she used to work with.

391
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,371
-A radio engineer?
-Yes.

392
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,915
-How many kids does he have?
-He's a bachelor.

393
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,250
It's his first marriage?

394
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,460
Yes, and he's her age.

395
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,174
He comes from a good family.
Have you heard of SF Electronics?

396
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,176
-Yes.
-He's the chairman's oldest son.

397
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,347
-Is this all true?
-Yes.

398
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,893
Hello?

399
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,021
-I'm here.
-It must have been office romance.

400
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,065
Is he good-looking?

401
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,234
I doubt it. It's why he never married--

402
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,111
He's handsome in a masculine way

403
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,530
and seems younger than his age
as all bachelors do.

404
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,573
-Height?
-At least 180cm.

405
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,617
-You saw him?
-A few times through Pi-young.

406
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,205
There's nothing to worry about.

407
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,581
He seems decent.

408
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,084
IT MUST STING

409
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,171
I see. Thank you.

410
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,548
Have a good evening, then.

411
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:37,757
Sure.

412
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,017
As if that makes sense.

413
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,687
Does Ms. Sa like you back?

414
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:58,111
It's actually a good thing.
The two ladies are close.

415
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,155
What will Father say?

416
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,116
He accepted Ga-bin, didn't he?

417
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,702
Not easily. Besides, she wasn't married.

418
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,495
Neither is Pi-young.

419
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,997
-She's divorced.
-But Father--

420
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,040
He has been through worse.

421
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,709
He has high expectations for you.

422
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,421
-Unlike me.
-Children are equally precious.

423
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,716
Higher the expectation,
bigger the disappointment.

424
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,552
Do you like her that much?

425
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:25,555
Asks the man who fell for Ms. Lee
when she's past her prime.

426
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,057
We're the same age
whereas you're younger than her.

427
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,184
Five years to be exact.

428
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,269
It's five, right?

429
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,190
We're both in the same situation.

430
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,983
What differs is the number of kids.

431
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:41,780
For some reason,
I've already taken a liking to Ji-a.

432
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,575
-I'll handle this.
-I'm sure you will.

433
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,119
-But--
-Is it me you're worried about?

434
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,955
-Or is it Dad?
-I'm worried about Ms. Sa.

435
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,415
Don't be.

436
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:56,878
Are you sure this time?
Is this what you truly want?

437
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:01,758
I finally realize what it's like
to be with someone you're destined for.

438
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,577
Ms. Han mentioned in passing
that it's her birthday.

439
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,162
Really?

440
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,957
Why treat us to a meal
saying it's her birthday?

441
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,501
-We can't go empty-handed.
-I know.

442
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:40,255
She likes designer items,
so I should get her a wallet.

443
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,007
I'll just rewrap one of my old gifts.

444
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,844
Everything she does
rubs you the wrong way.

445
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,763
Without a gift receipt,
she'll know it's not new.

446
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,390
Gosh, you're right.

447
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,434
Whatever. I'll see you tomorrow.

448
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,187
-Sure.
-Anyway, Ms. Sa's phone is off.

449
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,022
-I'll try her.
-I left a text.

450
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:58,940
Sure.

451
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,449
What brings you by?

452
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,535
-Am I not allowed here?
-Hey, Dad.

453
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,370
Hey.

454
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,293
Take a seat.

455
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,087
-We'll take it outside and talk.
-Sit.

456
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,812
I heard you're marrying the engineer.

457
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,442
Are you going to call him Dad?

458
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,823
I haven't thought about it yet.

459
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,867
When it's your mom who's getting married?

460
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,493
Are you happy that he's wealthy?

461
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,871
Professor Park,
I'm the one getting married.

462
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,041
Who are you to barge in here
and lash out on the kids?

463
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,753
Did you get their permission
before the affair and divorce?

464
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,504
-This is different.
-How so?

465
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,798
-We'll talk in private.
-This is about their stepdad.

466
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:09,052
You can't always say that
birth fathers are better than stepdads.

467
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,637
Some birth fathers are worse.

468
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,639
It's not like you truly know the guy.

469
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:15,224
That's for me and the kids to figure out.

470
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,477
We are no longer a family.

471
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,812
-Go to your rooms.
-I'm not done.

472
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:24,150
Did you come here to ask
whether they will call him Dad?

473
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,110
You could have called or texted.

474
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,571
-This isn't the time for sarcasm.
-Then cut to the chase.

475
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,614
I can't condone this.

476
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,743
You have no right.
I don't need my ex's permission to marry.

477
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:37,205
-Sever ties with the kids.
-How can you say that so easily?

478
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,666
Check all the documents.
Legally, I'm their father.

479
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,794
And that father

480
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,589
-abandoned them.
-I never told them to call her Mom.

481
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,216
Yes, you are our birth father.

482
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,926
You raised us well all these years.

483
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,636
But then you left.

484
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,890
On your own accord, because you wanted to.

485
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,768
To be with another woman
and not your children.

486
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,522
Should I dig up the past again?

487
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,983
It's not like this is
our most cheerful memory.

488
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,568
I never forced anyone into your lives.

489
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,404
You were in good hands with your mom.

490
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,697
What's scaring you?

491
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,739
He's not a nobody.

492
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,534
Because his family's wealthy?
Don't judge a book by its cover.

493
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,911
-You don't need to worry.
-As if you know the guy.

494
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,038
You two calling that stranger your father?

495
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,665
I won't watch that happen.

496
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,625
Then don't. No one told you to.

497
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,668
You're insane.

498
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,004
Don't mind me and look after yourself.

499
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,465
By the looks of it,
it's been going on for a while.

500
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,175
-Hasn't it?
-What do you mean?

501
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,844
What don't you get?

502
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,887
Our divorce is still fresh.

503
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,264
Time is irrelevant.

504
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,766
Even our 30 years
were over in a heartbeat.

505
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,310
The kids are to be left out.

506
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,313
They're not the ones getting married.

507
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,983
Would you have let me
if you were in my shoes?

508
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:48,901
You're right.

509
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,446
My kids take priority over men.

510
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:56,034
-Ban gets along well with the kids.
-They all do at the beginning.

511
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,036
Don't judge people by your standards.

512
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,414
Exactly. The world
isn't as gullible as you are.

513
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,791
This must be confusing
for our young U-ram.

514
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,126
Now you're worried?

515
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,587
After putting them through hell yourself?

516
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,630
-Take a walk in my shoes.
-You first.

517
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,215
I wouldn't do this if I were you.

518
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:15,219
You moved out a year ago
and we've adjusted to this life.

519
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,722
Who Mom lives with and how
is our issue to address.

520
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,515
Don't you think you'll make mistakes?

521
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,100
I know that I was wrong,

522
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,603
-and I've repented.
-You're too late.

523
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,354
Better me than some stranger.

524
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,898
We met as strangers too.

525
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,942
Love and affection

526
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,028
can bring anyone together as a family.

527
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,406
Do you love that guy? Is he family to you?

528
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,492
I'm fond of him.

529
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,035
Well, that can easily go away.

530
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,411
Like us, you mean?

531
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,582
I understand your concern,

532
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,794
but he's not the kind of man
you make him out to be.

533
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,838
It is said that one's true colors
aren't easy to see.

534
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,800
Marry all the times you want,

535
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,385
-but leave my kids out of it.
-Stop being unreasonable.

536
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,471
-Ask anyone if I'm being unreasonable.
-You are.

537
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:02,433
You don't want us,
but you can't let others have us?

538
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:05,436
You leave me no choice but to say that.

539
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,063
I'm not getting in her way.

540
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,231
We're not babies.

541
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,316
We're old enough
to make our own decisions.

542
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,692
Stop making it hard on Mom.

543
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,280
Mom has been a joy to watch these days.

544
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,407
It puts us at ease.

545
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,868
-If you can't give your blessing…
-My blessing?

546
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,412
-…stay out of the way.
-I'm only voicing my concern for you.

547
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,749
It turns out that
they knew each other as kids.

548
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,710
So just wait and see
because she'll have a good life.

549
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,005
You should leave.

550
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,509
You've brainwashed them well.

551
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,096
You'll probably say I'm wrong,

552
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,765
but they're still my kids.

553
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,352
So you never got to call him Dad?

554
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:11,979
No.

555
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,359
Do you still go horseback riding?

556
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,571
No, I haven't been able to
since I got the news.

557
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,827
This design will look good on you.

558
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,537
Well, not something so revealing.

559
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,790
Sure. It's not the trend anyway.

560
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,876
When will it be ready once ordered?

561
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,679
This is your final fitting.

562
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,307
-How is it?
-Thank you.

563
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,809
It's all thanks to the design.

564
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,394
I have your figure to thank.

565
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,729
Having a busy life
naturally kept you in shape.

566
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,903
Lucky you. I guess a woman's fate
doesn't depend on her husband.

567
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,781
You've always lived
in the spotlight though.

568
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,033
But nothing good came out of it.

569
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,160
I'm left with nothing substantial.

570
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,704
I wouldn't mind staying at home.

571
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,163
As if anyone would believe that.

572
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,916
I'm having a mid-life crisis, you know.

573
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,384
My friends want us
to treat them to a meal.

574
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,053
And we should. Call them all at once.

575
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,097
You wouldn't be able
to handle their gossip.

576
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,058
What about your dress?
Is it the way you want it?

577
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,147
Well… Should I say I'm baffled?

578
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,399
I can't believe it myself.

579
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,696
But Ms. Sa might soon be my sister-in-law.

580
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,281
Sister-in-law?

581
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,408
Is she dating a friend of yours?

582
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,035
-My brother.
-A brother-like friend?

583
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,290
No, it's Dong-ma.
He wants to marry Ms. Sa.

584
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,127
Don't joke around.

585
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,380
I wish I was joking.

586
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,134
How? How did they meet?

587
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,344
At a dermatology clinic.

588
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,644
-I'll be right back.
-Sure.

589
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,109
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SEO

590
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,201
-Is your meeting over?
-Yes.

591
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,410
-Are you on the road?
-No.

592
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,828
Let's video chat. I miss you.

593
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,290
-What?
-You always request that when I'm naked.

594
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,709
You went dress shopping.
Where exactly are you?

595
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,169
-Don't ask.
-At the shop?

596
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:43,047
I was feeling under the weather,
so I came to a spa.

597
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,174
-What if you catch a cold?
-I'll be careful not to.

598
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,842
-You have plans later, right?
-Yes.

599
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,928
Make an excuse to cut it short.

600
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:55,893
I can't, it's a senior colleague's
birthday party. One I dislike too.

601
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,855
Quit that job already.
Unwanted encounters will only age you.

602
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,608
-Got it.
-You can work until this month.

603
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,443
It's good you're already off the show.

604
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,653
Where are you headed?

605
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,613
Don't change the subject.

606
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,285
Would Mr. Seo have told Si-eun by now?

607
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,912
Until when will you call him that?

608
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,289
I guess they should know.

609
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,251
It might be unhealthy for the baby.

610
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:32,179
Why are you here so early?
I'm ten minutes early myself.

611
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,307
-My schedule ended early.
-Don't you earn enough already?

612
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,976
I spend as much.

613
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,603
You're glowing today.

614
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,230
Did you receive a facial?

615
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,066
A massage.
I was feeling under the weather.

616
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,611
Didn't you bring a gift?

617
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,281
How could I not?
It's a moisturizing cream.

618
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,035
Ms. Lee's here.

619
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:01,500
How women and homes
are maintained truly matters.

620
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,626
Thank you.

621
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:10,426
Is it true? I can't believe it.

622
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,305
-What's going on?
-You'll be my sister-in-law?

623
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,352
-We'll talk later.
-Does Ji-a know?

624
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,691
-Not yet.
-Ban couldn't believe it at first.

625
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,068
He thought it was a joke and so did I.

626
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,238
You're going to be sisters-in-law?

627
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,574
How?

628
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,160
It's not like Mr. Seo has another brother.

629
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,412
His younger brother. Director Seo Dong-ma.

630
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:40,998
He's marrying

631
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,459
none other than our Pi-young.

632
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,884
How…

633
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,808
You two are such minxes.

634
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,981
I can't believe you played dumb
the last time.

635
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:09,068
Back when I mentioned him.

636
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,946
I barked up the wrong tree again.

637
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,240
Unbelievable.

638
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:18,702
That was before things got serious
and he was in Germany for business.

639
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,287
He got back only a few days ago.

640
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,581
He proposed in that short period of time?

641
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:27,461
You must have been in contact
while he was in Germany.

642
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:32,258
Fate works in mysterious ways.
I won't believe it until I see it.

643
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,722
Am I being pranked?

644
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,933
You two are starting to scare me.

645
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,812
They say every grave has a story.

646
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:48,649
If it's meant to be,
fate finds a way to bring you together.

647
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,567
Is he serious?

648
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,610
I don't get it either.

649
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,987
Isn't he five years younger?

650
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,991
-He is.
-I hear he ended it with his girlfriend.

651
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,660
He felt a strong pull toward you.

652
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:03,747
Did it begin when he first saw you
at the golf club?

653
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,166
It's a long story.

654
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,836
What about his parents?
What will they say?

655
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,505
Their father approved of me.

656
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,215
-Did you meet him?
-Not yet.

657
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,890
Darn rush hour. I'm not late though, am I?

658
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:30,941
Was there a quarrel?

659
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,279
Did your dad say anything?

660
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,572
That he's sorry.

661
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,741
-So?
-So what?

662
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,117
Can we keep the tree for a while?

663
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,670
I feel bad for AM.

664
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,213
-AM?
-As in A Mi.

665
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,798
Do you know about her birth father?

666
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:01,930
Ji-a.

667
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,434
The man who gave you that teddy bear

668
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:07,519
likes me.

669
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:14,443
-He wants to meet you.
-You said it was from a junior colleague.

670
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:17,613
There is an age gap between us.

671
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,448
Is he younger than you?

672
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,370
How do you feel about him?

673
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:26,747
I actually don't mind.

674
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,918
To be honest, I've grown to like him too.

675
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:36,548
I've come to think of him
as a new partner.

676
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:39,343
So? Are you going to marry him?

677
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,762
I won't if you say no.

678
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,515
Then, don't.

679
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,877
-I have nothing to say.
-Why not at least meet him?

680
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,308
He's Mr. Seo's younger brother.

681
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,360
He's a smart man with a great personality.

682
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:41,613
Mr. Seo's brother
hasn't been married before either?

683
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:51,707
Boo Hye-ryung, what gives?

684
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,168
What's wrong with you?

685
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,671
People praise your beauty,

686
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,966
but those brothers
only see you as a TV personality.

687
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,386
Why don't they see me as a woman?

688
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,555
Damn it!

689
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:10,893
Damn it.

690
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:14,980
My gosh.

691
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,407
Hi.

692
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,452
We should talk.

693
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,207
Dong-ma told me everything.

694
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,667
-Is it true?
-Yes.

695
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,422
I bet it's hard to understand.

696
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,592
It came as a shock.

697
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,471
He's my brother and all,
but when it comes to women,

698
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:49,973
he can be quite picky.

699
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,143
Not that I'm saying you don't qualify.

700
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,812
I'm just worried and confused.

701
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,064
You and me both.

702
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,691
Do you have faith in Dong-ma?

703
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:02,611
He acts in a way
that makes you trust and believe him.

704
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,238
I'm worried he'll change.

705
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,407
Who knows what the future holds?
We can't control who we like.

706
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,076
I hate to say this,

707
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,579
but the breakup might hurt Ji-a immensely.

708
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:17,334
Are you and him on the same page?

709
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,585
For now, at least.

710
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,797
I personally would like
to slow things down.

711
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,050
I quite like the idea, and so does Si-eun.

712
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:29,471
Hearing that he's your younger brother

713
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,224
changed Ji-a's mind a bit.

714
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:35,018
Would this make her cousins with my U-ram?

715
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,104
U-ram.

716
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,939
Can we talk?

717
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:42,234
Aren't you eating?

718
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,653
-How's Mr. Seo?
-You know he's nice.

719
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,365
Why do you ask?

720
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,367
Don't you know?

721
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,039
-Know what?
-Have you met his younger brother?

722
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,666
No, not yet.

723
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:59,084
We might--

724
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,169
Do you think we might argue?

725
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,379
I can't say it.

726
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,880
You can. It's okay.

727
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:08,677
My mom's dating Mr. Seo's younger brother.

728
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,137
For real?

729
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,931
"Would this make her cousins
with my U-ram?"

730
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:16,893
He subconsciously addressed him
"my U-ram."

731
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,771
It melted my heart.

732
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:23,567
I could tell that he was serious
about this relationship.

733
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,735
Really?

734
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,362
Yes, really.

735
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,699
It's true that life is unpredictable.

736
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,534
Who knew we'd be divorced?

737
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,745
And remarrying didn't even seem
like an option.

738
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:37,706
Exactly. But now here we are
weeks away from marrying

739
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,458
into the same family.

740
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:44,087
I admire you for your courage.

741
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,257
I don't know
whether I'm courageous or reckless.

742
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:51,303
People will think that I've fallen
head over heels for some younger guy.

743
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:52,387
You're young yourself.

744
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:55,390
Si-eun, please. Let's not fudge the truth.

745
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:58,727
Dong-ma's never been married before
and he's five years my junior.

746
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,521
On top of that, he's
the future chairman of SF Electronics.

747
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,858
Min General Hospital is theirs as well.

748
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:06,735
Goodness.

749
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:09,404
It's like Hyang-gi says.

750
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:13,659
Think of it as a reward from the heavens
for living an earnest life

751
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,452
and just accept it.

752
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,664
There's Ji-a to think about.

753
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:22,084
It's why I can't bulldoze through this.

754
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,418
She's still too young.

755
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:28,882
What gives him the right
after all this time?

756
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,968
He hounded them wanting to know
if they'd call him Dad.

757
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,096
Of course they should call him that.

758
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,599
Who knew old age
shed your conscience away?

759
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,101
Age has nothing to do with it.

760
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,479
Hyang-gi is a daughter
you sure can't do without.

761
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,564
Since when did he care so much about them?

762
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,527
You never know how Dr. Shin
will react to your situation.

763
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,153
What right does he have?

764
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,906
After getting caught with his girlfriend
by his daughter?

765
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,576
As did Hae-ryun.

766
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,162
Why are men oblivious of their own flaws?

767
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,167
I saw Nam Ga-bin the other day.

768
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:07,421
Dining at Seoul Hotel with her boyfriend.

769
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,423
How did he seem?

770
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:11,341
He's a total catch.

771
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:15,429
His mother must be fond of her
judging by how her phone call went.

772
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:19,683
She didn't see me though.

773
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,351
Good for her.

774
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:24,688
Only Hae-ryun
has lost everything, I guess.

775
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,399
If only he knew she dated a married man.

776
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:30,235
People these days don't care about that.

777
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:31,611
Wouldn't you?

778
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,698
Who am I to judge
the people my children like?

779
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,750
Is that pork cutlet?

780
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,294
Beef cutlet.

781
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,088
I'll meet Mr. Seo's brother.

782
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,727
No way. Really?

783
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:04,978
Yes.

784
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,481
-This is unreal.
-What did Ji-a say?

785
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,774
That's all she said.

786
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,859
You should have asked
how she feels about it.

787
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:13,236
-Whether she likes it or not.
-I didn't ask.

788
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,572
She didn't exactly seem excited.

789
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:19,284
That would make him our uncle
from both our mom's side and our dad's.

790
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:20,869
Family gatherings will be fun.

791
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:23,163
-What do you think?
-I don't mind it.

792
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,832
Mom, tell me more.

793
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,293
-How did they meet?
-Your stew will go cold.

794
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:31,463
I don't know much anyway.
There wasn't time to dive into details.

795
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,819
FATHER

796
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:58,907
Yes?

797
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,286
Hello?

798
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,289
It breaks my heart

799
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,292
as your father.

800
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:13,839
I don't care how many children she has.

801
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:17,467
If she were 40 at most,
she could give you your own child.

802
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,847
Just to raise and marry off
someone else's children,

803
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:25,183
you're getting married at 50
to an old divorcée.

804
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,898
The more I think about it,
the more it disappoints me.

805
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,610
Are you sure this is what you want?

806
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,612
Aren't there any doubts?

807
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:39,781
No.

808
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:43,702
You should turn in.

809
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,664
You're a perfectly healthy
good-looking man,

810
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,666
so why is your luck like this?

811
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,167
I don't think of it that way.

812
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:55,589
Thanks to you,
I never experience any hardship.

813
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:57,966
I'm sorry.

814
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:03,805
I always hoped that you would
give me my first grandchild.

815
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,056
Take some supplements.

816
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,309
-Supplements?
-That will keep you healthy.

817
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,852
At this age,

818
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:12,564
seeing your kids do well
is all that you need.

819
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,569
How old does he seem?

820
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:21,948
In casual attire,
some might think he's in his 20s.

821
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:23,617
Oh, no.

822
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,536
What if people think
you're his older sister?

823
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:32,334
I'll just have to try harder.

824
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,558
You're here.

825
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,020
Let me.

826
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,694
Do we have to go outside the city?
It's a waste of time.

827
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:01,154
It's only three hours away.

828
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:02,447
Six in total.

829
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,869
-It's nice to get some fresh air.
-I'm a child, you know.

830
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,412
I don't get in the mood for air.

831
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,539
Will Mr. Seo be there?

832
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:13,875
No.

833
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:28,556
I know this is awkward,

834
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,850
but it beats greeting a stranger
at the wedding.

835
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:32,852
Sure.

836
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,981
I'm not comfortable around him
having been separated at a young age.

837
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:39,067
-Even if he is my father.
-Right.

838
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:42,862
When he addresses you,
give him clear and concise answers.

839
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,407
-Sure thing.
-In life,

840
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:48,785
we're forced to go through
uncomfortable situations.

841
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:08,930
Take your seats.

842
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:11,808
He's my father.

843
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,061
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Lee Si-eun.

844
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,939
-I'm Park Hyang-gi.
-And I'm U-ram.

845
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,486
Did you have breakfast?

846
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,447
Yes, a light one.

847
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,742
-Have you?
-Same here.

848
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,413
She looks even older than Ban.

849
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,584
-Should I order for us all?
-Sure.

850
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:44,215
Three A-course meals
and two C-course meals, please.

851
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,550
Sure.

852
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:48,470
-Any wine or beverages--
-There are kids at the table.

853
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,513
-Right.
-Mineral water is fine.

854
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,723
Yes, sir.

855
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,184
Order them some coke.

856
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,602
They don't drink sodas.

857
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:56,770
Don't you want any?

858
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,313
I've learned to fight the urges.

859
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,274
You've taught them well.

860
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:07,113
-I hear you're a freshman in college.
-That's right.

861
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,740
-What do you study?
-English literature.

862
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:11,034
-Do you find it interesting?
-Yes, sir.

863
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:15,121
Don't mind me and talk away.

864
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,418
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

865
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,421
Do you still work at the office?

866
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,590
I do.

867
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:27,175
How do you stay healthy?

868
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,137
I try to walk a lot. Why do you ask?

869
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,889
You seem younger than I pictured.

870
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,057
U-ram, was it?

871
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,059
-Yes.
-What sports are you into?

872
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:39,813
I like all ball games,
but I don't get to play them a lot.

873
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:42,482
And walking isn't something I enjoy.

874
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,817
I figured.

875
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,862
Does your mother cook often for you?

876
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,240
We grew up eating only the best.

877
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,866
Tasty but also healthy.

878
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,701
Those two don't usually go together.

879
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,579
What's the best dish you can make?

880
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,373
You can address me casually.

881
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,210
I'm fairly good with
home-cooked Korean meals.

882
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:03,670
Were you born in Seoul?

883
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,630
-Yes.
-Within the four gates?

884
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:08,591
No, I grew up in Yeonhui-dong,

885
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:11,302
but moved to Daechi-dong in second grade.

886
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:14,889
In fifth grade, my mom and Mr. Seo
briefly attended the same art academy.

887
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,074
Is this the place?

888
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,458
-Are you here?
-Yes.

889
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,383
I'll take your key.

890
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:03,688
-I bet it was a long ride.
-There was hardly any traffic.

891
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,191
Ji-a?

892
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,403
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

893
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,406
It's chilly, so head inside.
The housekeeper's inside.

894
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,118
Lunch will be ready soon.

895
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,088
This place is incredible.

896
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,132
Take off your jacket or it'll get wet.

897
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,151
What is Mr. Seo doing outside?

898
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,778
He's getting lunch ready.

899
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,071
The grill's outside.

900
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,084
But it's chilly.

901
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:07,669
Enjoy the food while it's hot.

902
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,257
-Just us?
-For now.

903
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,399
My gosh.

904
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,276
Mr. Seo came early this morning.

905
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:33,945
Please enjoy.

906
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:45,498
-Have water first.
-There's rice and kimchi too.

907
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,709
This is more than enough. Thank you.

908
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:50,044
All I did was wash the vegetables.

909
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,264
-I bet you were hungry.
-Now that I'm here.

910
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,936
It's good.

911
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:16,738
We can't eat by ourselves.

912
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:19,532
I'll catch up, so dig in.

913
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:26,205
-Ji-a's enjoying the food.
-I'm glad.

914
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:37,842
It's scrumptious.

915
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,847
I thought you'd prefer Korean cuisine.

916
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,807
That I can have regularly.

917
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,520
How's the pasta?

918
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,439
I really love fresh pasta.

919
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,983
Other than studying, what are you good at?

920
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,985
-Eating.
-Me too.

921
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,571
Be polite.

922
01:00:58,655 --> 01:00:59,656
I guess it's true.

923
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,575
Aside from the sick, we all enjoy eating.

924
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,036
You both seem quiet like your mother.

925
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,579
-As in gentle?
-Yes.

926
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,707
-Not my sister though.
-Gosh.

927
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,001
What about you? What are you like?

928
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,212
May I say I'm modestly reserved?

929
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:15,755
Don't be cheeky.

930
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,590
Well, that's what people say.

931
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,180
He must be hungry and cold.

932
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:27,433
-I know.
-Tell him to join us.

933
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,227
He won't listen to me.

934
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,688
Why don't you ask him?

935
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,526
What's boiling over there?

936
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,134
You should join us.

937
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:04,011
Sure. I was just finishing up.
Head back inside.

938
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,146
-Your ears must be freezing.
-I don't get cold easily.

939
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,990
-We've been eating non-stop.
-Charcoal barbecue is always the best.

940
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,033
We ate while you were at work.

941
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:31,080
-Ji-a, do you like tteokbokki?
-Yes.

942
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,166
Is there anyone who doesn't?

943
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:45,595
My gosh.

944
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,555
I had the housekeeper season it for me.

945
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,099
It only needs to come to a boil.

946
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,809
Did you look up the recipe?

947
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,412
Eat it with vegetables.

948
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:14,749
Can't I get a pass today?
I hate to ruin the taste of the meat.

949
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,502
Let her for today.

950
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:30,014
Maybe I should have taken a calming pill.

951
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:36,187
She probably isn't here anymore.

952
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,941
You shouldn't have.

953
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:45,238
Sa-hyeon's father loves pears
and these are delicious.

954
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:47,532
He went out for a walk.

955
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:51,118
Mother, do you have a calming pill?

956
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:53,788
A calming pill? What for?

957
01:03:53,871 --> 01:03:55,373
I thought I should take one.

958
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,085
Aren't you feeling well?

959
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:01,671
-It's not that.
-Did something startle you?

960
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:03,172
No, I'm good.

961
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,675
We only have some back at our place.

962
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:45,256
-Hye-ryung's here.
-I saw her car outside.

963
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,034
What an angel.

964
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:33,179
I must have just been
hallucinating that day.

965
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,100
Jeong-bin.

966
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,811
You'll grow up without a mother.

967
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:43,898
You'll feel her absence soon.

968
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:19,368
-Sorry.
-What for?

969
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:22,163
I'll be right over. I'll be there
in exactly 30 minutes.

970
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:26,584
Why did you end it with Nam Ga-bin?
You seemed so set on marrying her.

971
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:29,086
Did my agency inform you of my address?

972
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,254
Of course not.

973
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:31,714
Maybe fate brought us together.

974
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,431
Let's be honest today.

975
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:43,601
Hyang-gi, don't you think Dad's right?

976
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:45,019
-Yes, Father.
-Is it true that

977
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:46,729
you're looking at wedding venues?

978
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:47,730
How did you find out?

979
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:51,859
My heart aches for my brother.

980
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:54,570
Can you grant me a wish?

981
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:57,948
There's something you should know
about my brother.

982
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:00,201
I will fully understand
if you break off this wedding.

983
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:06,999
