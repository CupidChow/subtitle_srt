00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:00,310
EPISODE 5

2
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:05,940
Ma'am.

3
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,611
-My husband collapsed.
-Sorry?

4
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,237
Over there.

5
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,461
Ji-a.

6
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,589
Let me hear the song you sang
to your friends for money.

7
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,882
I want to hear it.

8
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,803
I can't believe you.
You two tell each other everything.

9
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,763
You'll understand when you get married.

10
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,810
I wonder how good you are
for them to pay to hear you sing.

11
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:45,021
-I'm pretty good.
-I really want to hear it as well.

12
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,155
My grandfather's clock
Was too large for the shelf

13
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,034
So it stood ninety years on the floor

14
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,079
-She has great pronunciation.
-It was taller by half…

15
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,080
Oh, no!

16
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:03,915
Doctor!

17
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:05,959
Open your eyes.

18
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,050
You're incredible.
How did you memorize the lyrics?

19
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,052
Seriously. You're better than me.

20
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,514
She'll succeed in everything
she puts her mind to.

21
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,891
-You're right.
-I think so too.

22
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,398
MS. KIM

23
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,026
Hello, Ms. Kim.

24
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,196
What should I do? Your father collapsed.

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,114
Right now?

26
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,658
Perform CPR right now.

27
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,328
We did, but he's still unconscious.
What should I do?

28
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,246
Which hospital?

29
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,959
Which hospital are we going to?

30
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,169
Joseon Central Hospital.

31
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,213
Joseon Central Hospital's emergency room.

32
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,464
Okay.

33
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,636
My father collapsed.

34
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,182
Let me get a jacket.

35
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,059
I want to go too.

36
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,604
Can you turn off the cooktop?

37
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,999
Dad.

38
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:15,797
Father.

39
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,716
Father.

40
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,679
What happened?

41
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,514
We were at a movie theater.

42
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,600
He was having a good time.

43
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,731
How am I supposed to live now? How?

44
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,047
Whether it be single or divorced men,

45
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,466
all of them have dirty pasts.

46
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,012
They've all dated several people
in the past.

47
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,723
You'll be dating other divorcés anyway.

48
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,268
They say those you've known
for a long time are good people for you.

49
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,566
She's right. Patience is a virtue.

50
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,831
Are you sleepy?

51
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,255
May I take your order?

52
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,715
You can order.

53
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,139
-Set C, please.
-Okay.

54
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,975
-And one coke, please.
-Sure.

55
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,935
-One mojito, please.
-Yes, ma'am.

56
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,948
I'll let it slide just this once.

57
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:11,287
Bring her to me instead.
I need to see her in person.

58
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,247
And promise me you'll end it.

59
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,252
I'm upset enough as it is
knowing you cheated.

60
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,879
But how could you not apologize?

61
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,216
It's up to me
whether or not to forgive you,

62
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,593
but you should still apologize to me.

63
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,847
Staying silent again?

64
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,433
Is it because you can't or you won't?

65
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,060
I can't say sorry a thousand times.

66
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,062
Did you apologize sincerely even once?

67
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,940
I don't think so.

68
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,401
Am I not good enough for you?

69
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,987
You're more than I deserve.

70
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,948
Do all men have to be like that?

71
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,950
But your father never cheated.

72
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,368
I know.

73
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,829
But they're not that close either.

74
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,664
They're close enough.

75
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,165
He just can't express well.

76
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,295
What matters is your sincerity. The bond.

77
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,216
After getting married,

78
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:10,388
I've realized that a strong bond is
more important than our passion.

79
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,852
I'm in so much pain.

80
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,647
I wanted to end everything then and there.

81
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,942
But your mother dissuaded me.

82
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,905
I know I have sinned.

83
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,365
Yes, you'll be punished.

84
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,993
I'll probably get punished for this.

85
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,412
And you'll live a good…

86
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,621
MS. SA

87
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,588
Hello, Ms. Sa.

88
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,798
-Hey.
-Yes?

89
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,801
Is something wrong?

90
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,928
My father-in-law passed away.

91
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,390
-Oh, no.
-We have pre-recorded episodes.

92
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,892
So don't come to work tomorrow.

93
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,561
What happened? Where are you?

94
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,563
I'm at Joseon Central Hospital.

95
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,357
I'm sorry, Ms. Sa.

96
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,904
-Okay, I understand.
-Okay.

97
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,827
Her father-in-law passed away.

98
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,372
He looked so healthy. It's so sudden.

99
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,876
I should eat quickly and go.

100
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,507
-What happened?
-Probably a car accident.

101
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,226
I'd like some butter too. Unsalted butter.

102
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,435
Yes, ma'am.

103
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,818
No one knows what the future holds.
First, it was us. And now…

104
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:56,244
And all the roses falling

105
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,874
It's you, it's you

106
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:07,838
Must go and I must bide

107
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:12,301
But come ye back

108
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:18,641
When summer's in the meadow

109
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:23,938
Or when the valley's

110
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,733
Hushed and white with snow

111
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:34,240
-It's I'll be here
-Look at her wrapping her arms around him.

112
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:39,245
In sunshine or in shadow

113
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,875
You're a street singer
What?

114
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,671
You're a grumpy person
What?

115
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:54,510
I don't care
You always steal my side dishes

116
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:59,223
You eat all the bulgogi and tteokbokki

117
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:03,019
You feed me only pickled cucumber
And bean sprouts

118
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,939
You're so greedy
You're so grumpy

119
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,651
You're a miser

120
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,117
I can't see the lyrics.

121
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,869
-What are you doing?
-Let's dance.

122
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,995
Goodness.

123
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,372
Dance with her.

124
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:37,970
What?

125
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,358
What dance do you dance
when you park a car?

126
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,027
Do you know?

127
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,656
-Do you?
-I don't.

128
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,616
"Ballet" parking.

129
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,411
Isn't it funny?

130
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,998
Why are you so cold these days?

131
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,252
Stop worrying about Sa-hyeon and his wife.

132
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,713
Worrying won't do it any good.

133
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,883
How old is Director Shin's wife?

134
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,302
She's 58 years old.

135
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,012
-Blood type?
-Type A.

136
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,349
So that's why she's so feminine.

137
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,893
Gosh, if you think about it,

138
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,479
blood types do matter.

139
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,068
On the other hand,
you're very straightforward.

140
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,696
You don't know my birthday
or our wedding anniversary.

141
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,658
It's been years since you saw her,

142
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,202
but how do you know her exact age?

143
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,121
It's just her age.

144
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:48,791
Have you been counting all these years
while pining for her?

145
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,544
Pining? Me?

146
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:55,923
Goodness. You must be bored
out of your mind.

147
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,386
When the original Dong-mi was singing,

148
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,805
you seemed to be infatuated with her.

149
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,515
You were even crying.

150
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,016
Crying?

151
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,268
You did cry.

152
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:12,440
It's just that the lyrics sounded
so desperate and tragic,

153
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,526
so I got teary-eyed. I didn't cry.

154
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,945
How could you say that?

155
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,114
You embarrassed me
in front of your first love.

156
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,782
When did I?

157
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,952
You rejected my offer to dance with you.

158
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,288
You were practically trying to hug me.

159
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,372
Exactly.

160
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,543
Was it so wrong for your own wife
to hug you?

161
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,295
Couldn't we slow dance for once?

162
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:38,549
When she was dancing with her husband,
you stared at them the entire time.

163
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,844
I will never forget how you looked at her.

164
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,263
What was so wrong with the way
I looked at her?

165
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,728
If you feel empty inside,
go have some noodles.

166
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,730
Stop nagging me.

167
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,982
Are you jealous these days?

168
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,568
Does your head hurt? Or your heart?

169
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,614
You feel jealous if your first love
is happy. If not, your heart hurts.

170
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,491
And your head hurts if they're single.

171
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,659
I doubt your head hurts

172
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:09,246
since she and her husband
are just happily married.

173
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,000
Right. Goodness.

174
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,462
We have plenty of medication
for your pain.

175
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,256
-Shut it.
-Why? Do you feel guilty?

176
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,634
Are you seriously going to talk back
to me?

177
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:25,054
Yes, I am. From this moment on.
Until I die.

178
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,057
You should age gracefully, okay?

179
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,434
And act your age.

180
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:34,104
You're the one who needs to straighten up
and behave yourself.

181
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,357
Don't do things that irk me.

182
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,447
Goodness, it's Hye-ryung.

183
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,076
I almost get a heart attack
every time she calls.

184
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,706
-Yes?
-Mother.

185
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,416
It's about Ms. Sa's father-in-law.

186
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,044
Okay. Do you mean Director Shin?

187
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,673
What about him?

188
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,383
He passed away.

189
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,845
He passed away?
What are you talking about?

190
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,767
I don't know the details yet.
I just thought you should know.

191
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,270
He's at Sin Central
Medical Center funeral home.

192
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,771
What?

193
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,481
Good night, then.

194
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,857
Okay.

195
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,739
Your first love is a widow now.
My goodness.

196
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,036
You really never know
what the future holds.

197
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,664
What are you thinking?

198
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,917
What do you think?

199
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,712
I'm wondering why he passed away
all of a sudden.

200
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,172
What in the world happened to him?

201
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,932
What a transformation.

202
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,769
He looks wonderful in a suit.
Don't you think so?

203
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,579
This is the head engineer.
And this is my husband.

204
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,749
I'm sorry for your sudden loss.

205
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,209
I don't know what to say.

206
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,839
Thank you for coming
despite your busy schedule.

207
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,299
Of course, I should come.

208
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,259
He collapsed at the movies.

209
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,554
-Was it a horror movie?
-No, it was Your Spy.

210
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,057
-Isn't that a comedy?
-It is.

211
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,768
I heard he's had a heart condition.

212
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,813
By the way, how is his wife so young?

213
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,358
-She's his second wife.
-I see.

214
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,234
She should remarry…

215
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,214
Have some porridge.

216
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,300
It's very watery,
so it'll be easier to swallow.

217
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,680
The helper made it herself.

218
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,640
Have at least a few bites.

219
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,121
I just can't believe it.

220
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,333
I'm sure he's watching you.

221
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:46,213
He won't be able to leave
if you look too heartbroken.

222
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:50,134
If I'd had any bad dreams,
we would've just stayed home.

223
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,179
But I didn't have any dreams.

224
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,641
I know. We didn't either.

225
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,646
Poor Ji-a.

226
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,400
He cherished her so much.

227
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,325
Hi, Ga-bin.

228
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:19,580
Mi, if you're free tomorrow,
can you help me shop for clothes?

229
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,707
I'm not good at it.

230
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,001
I've always been given dresses to wear.

231
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:28,213
I love shopping for clothes.
Should I invite Won too?

232
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,382
-I'll text her myself.
-Okay.

233
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,676
-Are you home?
-No, at a hotel.

234
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,344
I doubt you're alone. With who?

235
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,388
I'm alone. I have a meeting here.

236
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,059
-Hyang-gi.
-What is it?

237
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,982
You'll be getting me
a birthday gift, right?

238
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,068
-You want something in particular?
-A puppy.

239
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,112
Or a kitten.

240
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,739
No.

241
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,075
Why not? You love puppies too.

242
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,328
It's different when you have one.

243
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,205
They're high-maintenance.

244
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,707
Mom's home.

245
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,503
How old was the deceased?

246
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,838
He was 77 years old.

247
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,006
I see.

248
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,759
Should I visit as well?

249
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,260
You should've gone today.

250
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,056
It'll last for five days
since there are a lot of visitors.

251
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,351
It'd be strange for us to go there
separately. I visited, so it's fine.

252
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,977
Did Ji-a cry a lot?

253
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,445
CHAIR OF THE BOARD, SHIN GI-RIM
PASSES AWAY

254
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,288
Why are you getting dolled up?

255
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,083
I'm not.

256
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,544
I have a cowlick,

257
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,629
so I'm pressing it down.

258
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,257
Where's the cowlick?

259
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:05,185
What if he becomes more concerned
about her now that she's a widow?

260
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,023
What if Hye-ryung's there?

261
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,026
I doubt it. She's busy.

262
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,529
That girl must be six weeks pregnant now.

263
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:18,866
What about morning sickness?

264
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,367
I didn't ask.

265
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,036
You had a severe one.

266
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,913
Well, everyone's different.

267
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,291
Ask Sa-hyeon about it.

268
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,001
And then what?

269
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,545
It's not like we can help out.

270
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,719
He can't help it.
It's his grandchild after all.

271
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,396
Even I feel heartbroken.

272
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,024
I can't fathom how you must be feeling.

273
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:57,237
Your mother must be devastated.

274
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,073
She is.

275
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,420
Ji-a, she's your grandmother.

276
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,091
Your maternal grandmother.

277
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,802
From the Philippines?

278
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,388
Yes.

279
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,656
Ji-a.

280
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,326
Take her to the dining area.

281
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,423
I've missed you.

282
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,634
Thank you for the gift.

283
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,474
I feel terrible for Grandpa.

284
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,852
I miss him already.

285
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,988
I won't be around for long either.

286
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,623
Pi-young's mother is here.

287
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,669
Where do you live?

288
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,921
Near Gangnam Station.

289
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,590
-May I visit you?
-Of course.

290
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,135
Come with your mom.

291
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,690
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

292
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,444
I don't know what else to say.

293
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,070
Me neither.

294
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,458
They say some people meet futile deaths,

295
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,377
but I never thought it'd happen to us.

296
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,172
I know age doesn't matter regarding death.

297
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,299
But why him?

298
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,092
Could you

299
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,803
give me some water?

300
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,097
Of course.

301
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:45,072
Don't lose your will to live.
You must overcome this.

302
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,117
I don't know if I can.

303
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:54,790
Grandma, come live with us.

304
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,343
JI-A

305
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:14,184
May your grandfather rest in peace.

306
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,187
Ji-a, hang in there.
Don't be too heartbroken.

307
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,486
Let's bow.

308
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,072
REST IN PEACE

309
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,674
I can't believe this.

310
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,678
We even had a meal with him

311
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,347
and his wife

312
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,432
just a few days ago.

313
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,560
I see.

314
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,689
I know it's hard, but hang in there.

315
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:04,109
Thank you so much for coming.

316
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,153
How's your mother doing?

317
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:10,073
She's still very shook up.

318
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,659
Of course.

319
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,330
They loved each other deeply.

320
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,333
You should eat before you go.

321
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:24,462
He passed away too soon.

322
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,923
He was handsome
and had an imposing presence.

323
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,634
The best ones get taken away first.

324
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,137
Are you saying I'm useless?

325
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,890
What kind of man do you think you are?

326
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,141
A manly one.

327
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,019
Are you sneering at me?

328
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,271
I'm not.

329
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,280
Then why did you scoff?

330
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,450
-Why do you want to know?
-Because I do.

331
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,036
A real man…

332
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,887
I'll let you guys talk.

333
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,395
Goodness. I'm very sorry.

334
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,940
Look at your face.

335
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,237
Force yourself to eat
even though you don't have an appetite.

336
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:35,492
-Did you come all the way here for this?
-Of course. I ought to.

337
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,994
I heard about what happened.

338
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:42,082
You should console yourself
that it was a painless death.

339
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,003
He was laughing in his last moments.

340
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,466
He was watching a comedy.

341
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:54,552
I heard he's had a heart condition.

342
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,889
Yes.

343
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:01,476
Does laughing too much strain
your heart as well?

344
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,104
I should be careful.

345
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:07,816
But then again, I think I heard

346
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:14,072
that feeling too sad or happy
does strain your heart.

347
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,116
From Doctor Cho.

348
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,495
I don't know.
I've never heard that before.

349
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,914
I'll send over some medicine

350
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,708
for you to recover.

351
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,876
I know a good Oriental doctor.

352
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,256
I have no desire to live for long.

353
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,383
Don't say that.

354
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,476
I love how Korea has
so many pretty clothes.

355
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,562
The designs are so detailed.

356
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,358
I think that one will suit you well.

357
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,324
-May we--
-Ms. Nam Ga-bin?

358
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,785
I'm such a big fan. I can't believe it.

359
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,120
Goodness.

360
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:12,881
FUNERAL HALL

361
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,993
Sa-hyeon.

362
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,847
You startled me.

363
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,396
Why? It's not like I'm a stranger.

364
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,692
You're startled because you feel guilty.

365
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,320
Why are you so drunk this early?

366
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,134
Didn't you have any food?

367
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,552
Are you worried about me?

368
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,140
Are you thirsty?
I'll make you honey water.

369
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,142
Don't change the subject.

370
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,603
Does she treat you well?

371
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,148
How well?

372
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,575
-Drink up.
-Sa-hyeon.

373
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,368
Is it a baby that you want?

374
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,455
I give up.

375
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,957
I'll give you one.

376
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,459
Let's have a baby.

377
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,503
Aren't you happy?

378
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:22,677
Here.

379
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,431
-Lie down.
-Drink it.

380
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,933
I said, lie down.

381
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:33,688
How did you treat me when I got drunk
in front of you for the first time?

382
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,398
Don't you remember?

383
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,817
You bought medicine for me,

384
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,611
helped me throw up,

385
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,654
and carried me to the car.

386
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,365
But now, you want me
to get changed on my own?

387
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,992
Then what? Sleep?

388
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,252
I'm Boo Hye-ryung. Don't you know me?

389
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,714
-I do.
-Do you no longer feel the same way

390
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,592
you did back then? Is that it?

391
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:05,970
Answer me.

392
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,264
-I didn't see this coming.
-What?

393
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,769
-Elaborate.
-I never thought

394
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,356
my feelings would change like this.

395
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,441
Imagine how I must be feeling.

396
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,026
Imagine that.

397
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,238
Let's have a baby.

398
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,199
I just can't forgive you.

399
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,738
Change into this.

400
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,413
Do you think you can hit me as you wish?

401
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,582
Use your words, not your hands.

402
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,542
Did you cheat with your words?

403
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,752
Did you date her only with your words

404
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,213
and not get physical at all?

405
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,136
Take this off.

406
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,638
Take it off.

407
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,768
-Don't do this.
-Why not?

408
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,645
We're married.

409
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,482
Your mother urged me several times
to have a baby.

410
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,485
I might as well give her a baby boy then.

411
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,574
Hye-ryung.

412
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,409
I can't end it.

413
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,203
With who? With me, right?

414
00:31:56,623 --> 00:32:00,335
So you can end things with me,
but not with her?

415
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,462
You can't?

416
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,590
Even if I get pregnant?

417
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:14,849
She's pregnant.

418
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,560
Pregnant? She's pregnant?

419
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,274
-How far along is she?
-Six weeks.

420
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,362
I don't believe it.

421
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,113
Bring her to me.

422
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,824
I need to hear it from her.

423
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,266
I'm sorry.

424
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,436
I'll repent for the rest of my life.

425
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,648
You're human garbage. You're trash.

426
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,421
Where are you going, Mother?

427
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,297
To the restroom.

428
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,319
Drink this.

429
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,289
Ask my secretary to drive you home.

430
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,001
I'll drop her off myself.

431
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,170
We should all go together. That's better.

432
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:12,925
She needs to sleep.

433
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:15,970
She's fine.

434
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,307
It won't be past midnight
even if we stop by her place.

435
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,808
Ji-a needs to learn as well.

436
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,273
Are you okay, ma'am?

437
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,026
My head's spinning.

438
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,433
-I really need to go to the bathroom.
-Okay.

439
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,560
Hello.

440
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,319
Sit here.

441
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,367
Would you like something to drink?

442
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:02,994
Water.

443
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,163
Warm water, please.

444
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,250
We're okay.

445
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,713
Can you sleep alone?

446
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,674
I don't know.

447
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,134
I'll spend the night here.

448
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,390
It's okay. You guys should go home.

449
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,402
Are you thinkin about
the original Dong-mi again?

450
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:40,364
Yes. I'm thinking about her.

451
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,202
Will you mourn like her when I die?

452
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,703
Depends on how you treat me.

453
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,414
Maybe you should treat me better
from now on.

454
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,708
Did I ever treat you badly?

455
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,919
Did you ever treat me well? Tell me.

456
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,129
Have you ever remembered my birthday once?

457
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,007
Do I stay home all day and do nothing?
Am I jobless?

458
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,221
Don't you know how hard it was
for me to make that country club?

459
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,931
I had no time.

460
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,351
Anyway, don't you dare send her
the medicine.

461
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,854
Or what?

462
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,899
What if I do?

463
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,193
It's my money.

464
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,487
-Have you ever made any for me?
-No.

465
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,030
You're completely healthy.

466
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,907
I just never complained about it,

467
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,909
but my entire body is aching as well.

468
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,327
Then get it yourself.

469
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,622
Gosh.

470
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,541
Give her the medicine, and you'll pay.

471
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,295
Better yet, just live with her.
I'll divorce you.

472
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,797
That's nonsense.

473
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,674
Exactly.

474
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,551
Then does it make sense
to send another woman some medicine

475
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,220
when your wife is alive and well?

476
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:47,223
You should pity her.

477
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,975
That's not what this is about.

478
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,228
She just lost her husband out of the blue.

479
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,605
She's having a hard time.

480
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,983
She may be, but she won't die.

481
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,735
In that case,
I died a dozen times already.

482
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,154
I was bedridden for a month
after having Sa-hyeon.

483
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,491
When you broke your shin
while riding a motorcycle,

484
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:08,035
I bathed you for two months.

485
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,579
My arms hurt so much,
I couldn't even eat properly.

486
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,664
Do you remember that?

487
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,583
Why are you speaking in a dialect?

488
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:17,420
I picked it up
while living with a hillbilly.

489
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,839
-A hillbilly?
-It's true.

490
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:23,175
It's all thanks to Semyeong City
and your father's land

491
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,387
that you became a chairman.

492
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,515
Or you would've been a farmer
your entire life.

493
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,059
I graduated from a high school in Seoul.

494
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:40,985
It's Hye-ryung.

495
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,363
-What do I do?
-Pick it up.

496
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,117
Hello?

497
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,702
It's me, Father.

498
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,371
-Hey.
-We'll be coming over tomorrow.

499
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,124
Is that so?

500
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,961
-Will Sa-hyeon be coming as well?
-Yes.

501
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,421
Okay.

502
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,798
-Good night.
-You too.

503
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,304
They'll be coming over tomorrow.

504
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,891
Call Sa-hyeon.

505
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,728
-Ask him why they're coming.
-And what if she's next to him?

506
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,023
You should get changed.

507
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,651
You need some sleep.

508
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,285
Mother.

509
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,254
Grandma.

510
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,593
I took great care of his health.

511
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,055
I fed him healthy foods

512
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:54,016
and went swimming with him every morning.

513
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,768
You know that.

514
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,531
It was all to no avail.

515
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,951
It was all useless.

516
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:16,247
How am I to live without him?

517
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,669
Grandma, don't cry.

518
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,380
Grandpa will be sad.

519
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,886
What should I do?

520
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:35,766
Do you need anything?

521
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,518
No, thank you.

522
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,319
Go home with Ji-a.

523
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,239
I'll spend the night here with her.

524
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,367
No.

525
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:56,787
You should all go.

526
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,207
My husband will watch over me.

527
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,042
You should go.

528
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:06,964
That was fun.

529
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,135
-I need to go to the restroom.
-Sure.

530
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,806
Mom, did Dad really watch this alone?

531
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,183
Yes, to clear his head.

532
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,560
But it isn't his type of movie.

533
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,313
Do your preferences change with age?

534
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,398
Is he becoming more feminine now?

535
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,233
What are you doing now?

536
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,695
I'm alone.

537
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,406
Me too.

538
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,366
Should I come over now?

539
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,370
I can.

540
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,145
Don't resent me.

541
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,649
You lived happily for decades

542
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,069
thanks to me.

543
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,834
I've done nothing wrong.

544
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,677
He was going to die soon anyway.

545
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,272
I've done my best until now.

546
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:07,728
Get changed.

547
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,453
Did you have breakfast?

548
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:25,913
We're in no mood for that.

549
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,126
The adulteress is pregnant with his baby.

550
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,589
Did you know about this?

551
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,424
No.

552
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,968
Don't call her that.

553
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,345
Then "mistress"?

554
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,681
Or tell me her name.

555
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,016
Or "Nonhyeon-dong"
like it says on your phone?

556
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,355
He's totally intimidated by her.

557
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,273
It's been six weeks.

558
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:57,528
He even showed me a sonogram
as if he was proud.

559
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,369
Aren't you shocked?

560
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,788
Of course, I am.

561
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,873
My heart's racing right now.

562
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,169
You've always wanted a grandchild.

563
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,340
Father, how do you feel?

564
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:20,342
Are you happy?

565
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,303
You bastard.

566
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,264
He's not a bastard.

567
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,434
He's just terrible.

568
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,686
You're terrible.

569
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,479
Did you have nothing better to do?

570
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,482
Some woman in Nonhyeon-dong is pregnant

571
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,526
with your grandchild.

572
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:42,489
-How does that make you feel?
-It doesn't matter.

573
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:46,618
Who cares how we feel?

574
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,579
Does that make you happy?

575
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,289
Be honest and tell me.

576
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:52,749
We're not happy. We're flabbergasted.

577
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,879
Are we the ones who cheated?
Why are you coming at us?

578
00:45:58,714 --> 00:45:59,840
I'm not blaming you.

579
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,843
I just want to know how you two feel
deep down.

580
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,470
Why does that matter?

581
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:07,806
He suggested that we split up.
He says there's no other choice.

582
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,268
Do you feel the same way?

583
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,812
Should I leave him?

584
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:17,608
No. Why would you do that?

585
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,860
What will you do?

586
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,321
Don't look at her!

587
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,657
What about the baby?

588
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:26,909
What do you think?

589
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,744
It's still a baby.

590
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,497
I won't change my mind.

591
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,959
Tell me what you two think.

592
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,712
Tell me.

593
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:39,963
Give us some time.

594
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,174
Will you do as they say?

595
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:47,012
Do I have to do what they want me to do?

596
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,306
-But my feelings are--
-What about mine?

597
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,308
Do my feelings not matter?

598
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,979
-How did you meet her?
-While going about my daily life.

599
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,314
Don't you dare lie to me.

600
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,732
It's true.

601
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,275
God, I have a headache.

602
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,571
My blood pressure is high as is.

603
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,866
Go back home for now.
We'll think about what to do.

604
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,244
-Would you like some pills?
-That won't help.

605
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,457
You should lie down.
We'll visit an acupuncturist tomorrow.

606
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,128
Have breakfast before you leave.

607
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:28,887
This is Ji-a's mom. Did she eat?

608
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,931
-She did.
-How much?

609
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:34,434
An entire bowl's worth.
She had side dishes as well.

610
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,437
I'm glad.

611
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,147
Her son's here.

612
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,567
-My husband?
-Yes.

613
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,779
I see.

614
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,369
Your son is here.

615
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,715
Does your head hurt?

616
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,635
It feels heavy.

617
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,473
You should stop crying.

618
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,687
-Why are you here?
-I was worried about you.

619
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,189
Don't be.

620
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,525
Is Pi-young here too?

621
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:26,903
She's home.

622
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,947
You don't have to

623
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,825
take care of me anymore.

624
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,119
I'll be fine on my own.

625
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:37,956
Let's go out.

626
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,835
-Where to?
-Let's get some fresh air.

627
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,174
Staying home won't do you any good.

628
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,594
What should I wear?

629
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,389
I can't think of anything to wear.

630
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,099
Just wear something comfortable.

631
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,625
Given Hye-ryung's temper,

632
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:06,962
shouldn't she be furious and demanding
a divorce right now?

633
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,298
You're right.

634
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:14,636
I just can't believe this situation.
I really don't know what to do.

635
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,431
If we keep stalling,
that baby will get bigger,

636
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,849
and, soon, she'll give birth.

637
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,352
What if we never get to see the baby?

638
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,855
That won't happen.

639
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:26,940
We'll see the baby secretly.

640
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,318
-What if her family doesn't let us?
-They will.

641
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:34,489
They may only agree to do so
if we let them marry.

642
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,284
It's best for Hye-ryung to…

643
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,163
Don't you think so?

644
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:43,623
Would you get a divorce easily
if you were her?

645
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,085
What choice does she have?
He doesn't love her anymore.

646
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:50,172
Who knows what will happen?

647
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:53,383
In any case, we must see our grandchild.

648
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,718
Don't you think so?

649
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,052
Do something then.

650
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,471
No, you do something.

651
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,181
What can I do?

652
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:02,267
She'll listen to you.
You're her father-in-law after all.

653
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,395
I can't do it.

654
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,064
This is my first time coming here.

655
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,191
Really?

656
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,362
I can't believe Dad.

657
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,908
He preferred staying home.

658
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,456
Listen.

659
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:26,666
Cheer up.

660
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,794
You're not alone.

661
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:32,672
You have me, Ji-a, and Pi-young.

662
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:42,057
Dad lived a good, happy life.

663
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,268
Let's take comfort in that.

664
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,196
Don't just stay home.

665
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:00,242
Maybe you should learn something
at the cultural center.

666
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,452
Make new friends too.

667
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,748
I don't think I can do it.

668
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,333
Starting is half the battle.

669
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,502
Don't you have any friends?

670
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,046
Yes.

671
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:16,967
Your father…

672
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,471
never liked me going out by myself.

673
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,974
I should keep you company
for the time being.

674
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:29,437
I'll take you around and treat you
to some good food in his stead.

675
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,359
I'm feeling a bit better

676
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,570
now that I'm outside.

677
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:42,951
You must've been very shook up.

678
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,048
Lean on me from now on.

679
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,719
Though I'm not as good as Dad.

680
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,763
I think I should for now.

681
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,392
That's the only way I can pull through.

682
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:29,289
Dad, would you like a foot massage?

683
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:31,791
Sure.

684
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,718
Dad, do you want some music?

685
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,428
No, I'm good.

686
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:48,767
Dad, I've never had a sleepover before.

687
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:49,684
Can I?

688
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,313
-I knew it.
-Knew what?

689
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,856
You just wanted his permission.

690
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,733
-No.
-Who are you to say no?

691
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:58,193
Your older sister.

692
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:00,779
-He shouldn't, Dad.
-Stay out of this.

693
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:02,989
You bring your friends over
from time to time.

694
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,951
It's just Jae-in.
But you want to bring a group of friends.

695
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:08,662
-It'll be too noisy. No.
-Just four of them.

696
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,205
Please, Dad.

697
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:11,831
Okay.

698
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,833
We won't be noisy.

699
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,585
Dad.

700
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,588
We won't be able to sleep.

701
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,382
We'll be quiet.

702
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:22,634
We'll just stay in my room
and chat quietly.

703
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:25,011
What about food? Is Mom a housewife?

704
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:28,014
-Then you can cook.
-Do you think I have free time?

705
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,849
I'm preparing for university.

706
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:33,144
Then why don't you sleep over
at Jae-in's that night?

707
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,521
I can't sleep elsewhere.

708
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:35,939
That's your problem.

709
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,066
And wanting a sleepover is yours.

710
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,609
What are you bickering over?

711
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,444
He wants to have a sleepover.

712
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,071
Dad said I could.

713
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:49,744
None of us drink alcohol or coffee
or even smoke.

714
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,830
-We live alone.
-And we're freelancers.

715
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,957
More like "intermittently unemployed."

716
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,252
I'm the one who's jobless.

717
00:54:57,335 --> 00:55:00,088
You're doing just fine for your age.

718
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:02,257
I was really poor in my 20s.

719
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,510
Is that true? Did you starve?

720
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:10,306
If it wasn't for my parents,
I would've given up already.

721
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,018
I was a headache to them.

722
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,645
But you're a good daughter now.

723
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:18,314
Not really. I haven't done much for them.

724
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:21,026
That's because they're abroad.

725
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:49,471
Pi-young, I'll die soon

726
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,057
just like your father-in-law.

727
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:57,687
My final wish is to reconcile with you,
my daughter.

728
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,522
I'd also like

729
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:04,152
to cook a delicious meal for Ji-a.

730
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,846
Pi-young suggests that you come over
for dinner.

731
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:37,435
I don't have an appetite,
so I don't think I can eat.

732
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,020
I'm okay.

733
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:44,317
She says she's not hungry. Eat with Ji-a.

734
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:52,075
Then how about Sichuan cuisine?

735
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,412
Japanese, then?

736
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,667
That'd be simple and nice.

737
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,823
-Did you have dinner?
-I did.

738
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:35,118
Is Ji-a sleeping?

739
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:42,876
The induction cooktop broke,
so Mom couldn't cook rice.

740
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,463
This is breakfast?
Do we not have an electric cooker?

741
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,673
No. Just make do with it for today.

742
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,384
-It's too cold.
-What is?

743
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,471
I want something warm for breakfast.

744
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,390
Can you make me some toast?

745
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:01,227
Say that to your future wife.

746
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,770
I'm sure she'll love it.

747
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,315
I wouldn't say that to her.

748
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,233
Make it yourself.

749
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,152
How?

750
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:12,363
What's stopping you?
Just put the bread in the toaster.

751
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,621
Hello, sir.

752
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,122
It's been a while.

753
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:22,790
It has been.

754
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,709
The thing is…

755
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,838
A close hometown friend of mine

756
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,758
is going through something terrible.

757
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,301
She's extremely devastated.

758
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:37,847
Could you concoct something
without her having to visit?

759
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,309
-Some Oriental medicine.
-Of course.

760
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:44,354
Use all the good ingredients.
I'd like 10 days' worth.

761
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:46,231
All right.

762
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:49,692
My wife might call you.

763
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:51,819
Don't say anything.

764
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:54,364
I can't be bothered to explain to her.

765
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,032
Yes, sir.

766
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:57,492
When will it be ready?

767
00:58:58,159 --> 00:58:59,452
By tomorrow evening.

768
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,172
What brings you here?

769
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,134
Your lunch.

770
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,637
They do to-go meals at this hour?

771
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:21,432
Usually not. But they made it for me
since I'm a regular.

772
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,982
-Microwave this soup.
-Okay.

773
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,404
Are you taking Oriental medicine?

774
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:35,947
-Yes.
-Why?

775
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,951
-Are you ill?
-You can be healthy and still take it.

776
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,495
You should get going.

777
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,166
Tell me the truth.

778
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,502
I just wanted to strengthen my immunity.

779
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:52,922
THE LIA ORIENTAL CLINIC

780
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,425
You could get stuck in traffic.

781
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:56,467
We'll talk later.

782
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,344
There's nothing to talk about.

783
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,520
-I'll get going then.
-Okay.

784
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:12,150
Thanks for the lunch.
I'll be home late today.

785
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:15,862
The next song is "Obvious Story"
by Viagem.

786
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:29,292
Are you holding the 49-day memorial rite?

787
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,502
-Yes.
-At which temple?

788
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,296
At Ui Temple.

789
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:35,715
We'll air pre-recorded episodes
on Mondays for now.

790
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:37,717
Okay.

791
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,637
LAWYER PAN SA-HYEON

792
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,561
Hey.

793
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,063
DEAR HUSBAND

794
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,148
Having lunch?

795
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,484
I'm done.

796
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:55,652
What did you eat?

797
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:58,571
-A sandwich.
-Was it good?

798
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:00,865
Did you enjoy it?

799
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,369
Aren't you on air?

800
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,413
Does cheating increase your appetite?

801
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:11,668
Why did you call?

802
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:13,878
Why?

803
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:15,963
To curse you out, you bastard.

804
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,258
You're such an asshole.

805
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,636
How could you enjoy a sandwich right now?

806
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:25,223
You've never skipped a meal
after tearing my heart into pieces.

807
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:30,103
I won't divorce you. I refuse to.

808
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:33,356
Why should I become a divorcée?

809
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,234
You should reap what you sow.

810
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:38,319
This is the only choice I have.

811
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,238
You made the wedding vow.

812
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:43,449
You wanted me to play the drums
on your 60th birthday. I'll do that.

813
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,244
Hye-ryung, this isn't like you.
Don't do this.

814
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:50,206
Say that again,
and I'll rip your tongue out.

815
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,668
You better not talk cunningly
like that again.

816
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,920
Who are you to judge that?

817
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,465
Imagine being in my shoes for once.

818
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,385
End things with her.
I'll forgive you and take you back.

819
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,805
-Stop calling me names.
-What? You can't stand it?

820
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:09,183
You deserve it, yet you can't stand it.
Imagine how I'm feeling.

821
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,269
I've done nothing wrong, but look at me.

822
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:20,486
THERE ARE A LOT OF FANS
SENDING ME FLOWERS,

823
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:24,657
AND GUYS WHO ARE MUCH BETTER THAN YOU
ARE QUEUING UP TO HAVE A MEAL WITH ME

824
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,326
DO YOU HAVE A DEATH WISH?
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY SAYING THAT?

825
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:29,579
She's on the phone, right?

826
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,083
Yes.

827
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:37,003
Anyway, I am not getting a divorce,

828
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,337
so that's that.

829
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:51,267
I remember a story that someone sent us
a long time ago.

830
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,728
He returned home from a business trip.

831
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:56,773
His wife was nowhere to be seen
and had left him a letter.

832
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:58,733
She had another man.

833
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:00,693
He must've been heartbroken.

834
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:03,780
Username 2431 says,
"He must've been flustered.

835
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:07,325
That's like breaking up
through a text message.

836
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:09,118
Breakups need to be respectful too.

837
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:14,123
I think his wife was
disrespectful and inconsiderate."

838
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:18,586
Username 3544 says,
"Your wife was a terrible woman."

839
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:23,049
Username 9217 says,
"She probably had her reasons."

840
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,342
Username 7756 says,

841
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:27,053
"That's right. We should hear
both sides of the story."

842
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:30,348
That's true.

843
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:33,100
It's important to listen to both sides.

844
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,769
But this is what I think.

845
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:37,021
Their faults aside,

846
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:40,817
I believe breakups should be
respectful and considerate.

847
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:54,413
What's up there?

848
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:58,084
Do you think

849
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,003
my grandpa is really in heaven?

850
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,923
I'm not sure.
I have a hard time believing that.

851
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:04,841
It's outer space.

852
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,635
Thanks for the text.

853
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:12,723
Do you fart?

854
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:13,683
Why?

855
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:18,104
I loved everything about my grandpa
except for his farts.

856
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,815
Did he stink?

857
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:23,943
We're talking about his farts, not him.

858
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:27,655
Right. Did his farts smell bad?

859
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:30,116
No. They were just really loud.

860
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:34,537
-Like this?
-Hey!

861
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:37,748
I wanted to see
if my farts would be too loud for you.

862
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:39,959
To exaggerate a little,

863
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,003
I dropped my spoon while eating.

864
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,721
This is your mother-in-law, right?

865
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:55,016
I almost got the wrong idea.

866
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:08,154
It's steamed just right.
It's not too tough to chew.

867
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:18,039
Would you like some sake
to help you sleep better?

868
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:24,462
Cheer up. For my sake.

869
01:05:25,963 --> 01:05:27,506
If you don't, I…

870
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:31,552
Okay.

871
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,432
I should get you some Oriental medicine.

872
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,059
Let's get some tomorrow.

873
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,729
-Are you free again tomorrow?
-I can always make time.

874
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:43,481
After all, I'm my own boss.

875
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:28,109
Your husband is cheating on you.

876
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,778
Others can't possibly know
about other couples.

877
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:32,989
There's something sly about Dongmi.

878
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:36,325
That's more of who you are, woman.
Don't be mean to the poor dog.

879
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:39,161
-You saw me. Why didn't you wait?
-How was Mother today?

880
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:40,579
Without me, she'd starve.

881
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:43,374
Cutting back on food for a few days
might be better for her.

882
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:44,500
Grandma!

883
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,714
I'll have a baby as you've always wanted.

884
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,590
If you hurt them,

885
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,300
I'll never forgive you.

886
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:56,012
And if you do,
I'll do anything to get revenge.

887
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:57,013
Where are you, Dad?

888
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,889
I need some time to think.

889
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:02,059
Did she really provide
enough emergency care?

890
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:04,061
She used to be a nurse, remember?

891
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:16,949
