1
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,382
EPISODE 15

2
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,068
STOP STARING

3
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:09,944
NO WAY!

4
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,880
The newlyweds are here.

5
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,590
Okay.

6
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,966
Are you not feeling well?

7
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,969
I was brushing my teeth.
I'll be right out.

8
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,283
They must be hungry.

9
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,911
Go on.

10
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,624
Yes, Father.

11
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,215
By the way,
Ji-a went swimming with Hyang-gi today

12
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,008
and she's asleep now.

13
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,468
She did try to stay up though.

14
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,887
Right.

15
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,353
When exactly is the baby due?

16
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,938
September 20.

17
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,607
-Are you feeling all right?
-I am.

18
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,652
Did you have a conception dream
of some sort?

19
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,989
Draw the curtains.

20
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,036
I blame that damn prayer.

21
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,413
That Buddhism chant.

22
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,417
The monk threw red beans at me,

23
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,168
and it gave me the chills.

24
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,172
Your mom and dad had a monk come and pray,

25
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,757
but it wasn't for the baby.

26
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,135
When? Tell me more.

27
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,344
Why is it just us?

28
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,762
The kids are still asleep.

29
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,890
And Hyang-gi is
at a friend's birthday party.

30
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:02,974
A birthday party?

31
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,311
That's right.

32
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,896
Where's your soup?

33
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,522
I don't feel like it.

34
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,773
The smell put me off.

35
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,199
I see that the meat only came my way.

36
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,334
You should have them.

37
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,587
We need you to be healthy and
be in our lives for many years to come.

38
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,839
I don't like chewing them.

39
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,928
But I love meat because I take after you.

40
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,597
Did you dine out or order room service?

41
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,891
Both, actually.

42
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:52,106
What do you usually prefer?
Korean or Western cuisine?

43
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,191
Everything.

44
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,236
Salmon is also rich in omega-3.

45
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,154
Right.

46
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,698
-And Danchu?
-It's in Ji-a's room.

47
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,617
Did you feed it?

48
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,786
Yes, Father.

49
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,288
The house feels alive
thanks to all the bustling.

50
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,082
Isn't it chaotic for you?

51
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,500
Hardly.

52
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,418
A home should be warm and cozy.

53
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,545
Do we have a variety of fruit?

54
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,925
-Melon, pears, and persimmons.
-Those are only the fruits I like.

55
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,262
Wouldn't you like strawberries?

56
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,306
Now that you mention it,
I am getting a craving.

57
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,767
I'll have some served.

58
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,978
I was only joking.

59
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,354
-Order some.
-It's all right.

60
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:33,815
Ms. Park.

61
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,527
-Yes?
-Get us some strawberries.

62
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,736
But I was only joking.

63
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,862
Don't be ridiculous.

64
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,365
There's a fruit shop
you normally order from.

65
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,658
Can you order some strawberries?

66
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,159
Have it delivered right away.

67
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,452
Yes, sir.

68
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,913
Dig in and put on some weight.

69
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:49,872
Yes, Father.

70
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,508
Did you buy them or were they a gift?

71
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,343
-Why ask?
-Where were you all day?

72
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,680
-I was busy.
-Doing what? Even your phone was off.

73
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,348
I needed some time on my own.

74
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,933
Stop babying me, please.

75
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,893
We look for you because we care.

76
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,186
He's right, Mother.

77
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,856
-Take a photo.
-Got it.

78
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,232
Not you.

79
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:19,610
Here.

80
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,988
One, two…

81
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,868
You look great.

82
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,704
How is it that you look younger every day?

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,585
Stop staring and turn on the TV.

84
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,045
Yes, Mother.

85
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:42,008
What's gotten into you?
They say you change when it's time to die.

86
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,385
Why are you being nice?

87
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,971
She glares like a fish
when you're not around.

88
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,016
Gosh, Mother. How can you call me a fish?

89
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,976
Enough with the quips. It's annoying.

90
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,272
Mother, you're the best!

91
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,413
HOW SOON CAN YOU TAKE A PREGNANCY TEST?

92
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,237
-I'm home.
-Hey.

93
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,197
Is Mom in the kitchen?

94
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,865
She went to get her hair done.

95
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,410
Danchu!

96
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,954
It's the baby of the house.

97
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,333
Do you know what Ji-a said?

98
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,919
That we should get it
a friend to keep it company.

99
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,087
Why would we need one
when it has a big family?

100
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,882
It might get jealous
after having our undivided attention.

101
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,050
Right?

102
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,010
Is there anything you can't do?

103
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,721
You're an amazing cook
and also a great dancer.

104
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,848
I wished I had filmed it yesterday.

105
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,683
Don't violate my portrait rights.

106
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,477
But we're family.

107
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,395
Why not dance with me today?

108
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,231
You'll find me a better partner.

109
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:47,568
Oh, Richard Kang.

110
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,903
Who's Richard Kang?

111
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,740
My old dance instructor.

112
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,619
No wonder
your dancing seemed professional!

113
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,413
Did you take classes with Yu-sin's father?

114
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,665
Are you insane?

115
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:04,168
I took classes in secret
and said that I was going to the gym.

116
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,590
The secrecy gave it thrills, you see.

117
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,759
It was double the excitement.

118
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,263
How old was Richard Kang?

119
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,806
He was eight years my junior.

120
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,350
It must've been fun!

121
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,395
Dance instructors normally
have a good sense of style.

122
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,105
That he did.

123
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,606
He was totally my type.

124
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,441
It's hard to tell what your type is.

125
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,985
What do you look for in a man?

126
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,278
-Men…
-Yes?

127
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,196
…should have broad shoulders.

128
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,031
Yes, of course.

129
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,992
And should have a prominent nose bridge.

130
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,119
No potbellies though.

131
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:42,164
Yu-sin's father got fat like Santa
thanks to all the food I made him eat.

132
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,709
I didn't even want to touch him.

133
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,876
And?

134
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,545
-So--
-Just a second.

135
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,630
You must be thirsty.
I'll get you some juice.

136
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:16,949
VOICE RECORDER

137
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,505
Have some vitamin C.

138
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,475
-So?
-So what?

139
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:46,437
Yu-sin's father got fat like Santa
which put you off.

140
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,190
What did you do about that?

141
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,573
I doubt you slept in separate rooms.

142
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,493
Why are you curious as to
whether or not we shared a bed?

143
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,831
You must have met up
with your dance instructor all the time.

144
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:11,962
Right?

145
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,634
I bet that curiosity of yours
has you hungry.

146
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,889
Take this and leave.

147
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,353
Why don't we go grocery shopping?

148
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,522
-What's in it for me?
-I'll buy you a snack.

149
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,233
Get me a plant that I can put over there.

150
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,170
-Hyang-gi.
-Yes?

151
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,758
You should wash the cup
if you're done drinking from it.

152
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:01,971
Do that anywhere else,
they'll say you have no manners.

153
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,431
Right.

154
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,016
It's not like washing a cup is hard work.

155
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,395
You can leave it.

156
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,699
You don't have to.

157
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,005
Don't make the kids do chores.

158
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,840
I wasn't giving her orders--

159
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,717
They know their manners well enough.

160
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,510
Besides, this is your job.

161
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,887
You get paid to work here.

162
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,891
She has a lot on her plate
with her part-time job

163
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,517
and school work.

164
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,103
She shouldn't waste time
doing household chores.

165
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:55,024
Also, if you have something
to say to the children,

166
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,775
talk to me or Si-eun first.

167
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,112
Yes, ma'am.

168
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,269
Is crying all you do?

169
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,234
Why are you crying
when you haven't wet yourself?

170
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,777
A boy shouldn't be this fussy.

171
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,862
He just wants to be held.

172
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,617
He's lonely.

173
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,118
Babies don't get lonely.

174
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,579
They crave physical touch
more than anyone.

175
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,457
-You should go back to bed.
-He woke me.

176
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,299
I know a reporter,

177
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,886
and she said
that Dong-ma married a divorcée.

178
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,721
No way.

179
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,516
SF Group is trying to put a lid on it,

180
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,937
but everyone is guessing
it's because of the wife's background.

181
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,941
Let's just talk about us.

182
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,026
She's not much better than you.

183
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,655
Maybe she's a young, rich divorcée.

184
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,675
-Hello?
-What are you up to?

185
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,511
Si-eun and I were complaining
about our husbands.

186
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,096
Maybe your ears were itching.

187
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,223
Is Si-eun there?

188
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,517
She just left the room.

189
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,394
Shouldn't we tell her?

190
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,604
That way, she can help.

191
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,522
But I'm embarrassed.

192
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,066
You'll be showing in a few months.

193
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,695
Still, it's not the right time.
We only just got married.

194
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,197
Let me escort you
to your next doctor's visit.

195
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,408
-Got it.
-Father wants you to come out.

196
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,118
He wants to go to a new steakhouse.

197
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,954
-Just me?
-So he can freely take care of you.

198
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,415
I feel bad though and I'd hate to lie.

199
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,709
Use me as an excuse, then.

200
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,923
The promise of a grandson
is what's pulling him out of grief.

201
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,258
All right.

202
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,482
INCOMING CALL
NAM GA-BIN

203
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,151
Hello?

204
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,195
Hello, this is Nam Ga-bin.

205
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,279
Yes, hello.

206
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,866
Did Dong-ma really marry a divorcée?

207
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,411
A rumor has been spreading.

208
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,205
That's right.

209
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,583
Did they date first?

210
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:01,961
Yes.

211
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,006
It's a long story,

212
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,342
but all I can do is wish them the best.

213
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,053
She's divorced

214
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,222
and is the same age as me.

215
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,641
That's right.

216
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,273
Can you drop me off?
My car just broke down.

217
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,942
Got it. Have a good day then.

218
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,195
You too.

219
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,085
She's taking a bath.

220
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,013
I think Mother
went through a dancing phase.

221
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,057
Her instructor was someone
named Richard Kang

222
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,977
who was eight years her junior and fit.

223
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,770
She went behind your father's back.

224
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,481
Isn't it obvious why?

225
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:14,616
From what I can tell,
she had fun doing whatever she wanted.

226
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,369
All her life, she lived in luxury and joy.

227
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,960
I wouldn't say she's led
a respectable life.

228
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,378
-Mind your own business.
-How?

229
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,380
And don't report back to me.

230
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,299
But she's your patient.

231
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,009
You told me to chat with her.

232
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,046
What brings you by?
I'm afraid this is all I have.

233
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,672
Can I sit in one of the classes?

234
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,551
Yours, of course.
Do people still audit classes?

235
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,304
SHE SURE IS OUT OF HER MIND

236
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,267
I'm only joking.
I would just love a chance, that's all.

237
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,268
Anyway, I'm here

238
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,938
to set you up with someone.

239
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,690
Who would be interested?

240
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,567
You're still young enough to date.

241
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,654
Women scare me now.
I can't tell what they're thinking.

242
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:35,948
Including me?

243
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,783
I mean women who I'm not friends with.

244
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,868
She's someone I am dearly fond of.

245
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,121
Someone prominent in her field as well.

246
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,664
Trust me on this.

247
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,666
I doubt she'd go for a divorcé like me.

248
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:49,628
Being in this world for 60 years
has given me the gift of matchmaking.

249
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,506
Sparks will fly
the moment you meet each other.

250
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,884
-Is she pretty?
-She's stunning!

251
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,221
-Her age?
-She's much younger than you.

252
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,974
Knowing too much will only add pressure,

253
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,685
so just meet her for yourself.

254
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:05,936
Have your drink.

255
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,771
I'll set you two up then.

256
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,148
Is she really up for this?

257
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,441
Just trust me.

258
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,573
What is it?

259
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,617
It's nothing.
I just thought I saw Nam Ga-bin.

260
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,871
Why hasn't she married yet?

261
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,998
Wouldn't it have been reported?

262
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,875
-Of course.
-I doubt they broke up.

263
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,295
Her boyfriend seemed sweet and caring.

264
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,046
Maybe she's taking her time.

265
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,258
How old did he seem to you?

266
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,135
He was definitely younger.

267
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,971
-In his early or mid-thirties.
-His parents might disapprove.

268
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,267
Here she comes.

269
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,396
How do we give her our condolences?

270
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,689
Beats me.

271
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,803
Do you believe in fate?

272
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,767
If I think about my mom and aunt,

273
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,561
I can't say that it doesn't exist.
Why do you ask?

274
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,397
What type of fate
do you think I was dealt?

275
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,192
-A flashy one.
-A rough one, if you ask me.

276
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,276
Don't be ridiculous.

277
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,654
It's common to miscarry your first child.

278
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,113
Conceiving it was sheer luck.

279
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,824
My friend with a deformed uterus
gave birth to a child.

280
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,785
Is there a fortune-teller I can see?

281
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,787
You'll only jinx it.

282
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,580
I envy you two.

283
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,458
The fact that we married twice?

284
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,710
I'd marry three times
to men like your husbands.

285
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,711
Curse us, why don't you?

286
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:58,715
Living with only one man
for the rest of your life gets old.

287
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,425
But Sa-hyeon's a great catch.

288
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,261
You should be thankful.

289
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,846
His parents are very understanding
and well off.

290
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,058
Children should get to live
with their birth parents.

291
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,018
It is what's best for them.

292
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,229
Are your children having a hard time?

293
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,313
Of course not.

294
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,233
Marriage joins
two strangers together anyway,

295
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,151
which means we can learn

296
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,487
to be with and love our new spouse.

297
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,072
However, the children are forced

298
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:25,826
to accept complete strangers
as their parents, which isn't easy.

299
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,035
Absolutely not.

300
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,496
Some birth parents
are worse than strangers,

301
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,291
and many stepparents
do right by their kids.

302
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,459
-Just like you.
-Who knows?

303
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,087
As if.

304
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,881
Jeong-bin is the reason
you married Sa-hyeon again.

305
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,844
I'm sure good news
will come your way again. You deserve it.

306
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,325
-Exactly! I thought so too.
-I know!

307
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,618
-Absolutely.
-I bet that was hilarious.

308
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,123
You can't help but look at women

309
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,250
in short skirts.

310
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,419
If your wife catches you,

311
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,713
don't flinch in a way
that makes you look guilty.

312
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,215
"Just look at her!"

313
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:26,011
"What the hell is she wearing?
Be naked, why don't you?"

314
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:29,389
Just say that. If you don't,
then she'll only keep bringing it up.

315
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,481
If he's not your type,
you can always stop seeing him.

316
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:40,525
How can I
when you're the one who set us up?

317
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,779
He's a friend of mine
with the warmest heart.

318
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,697
I didn't tell him it was you though.

319
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,493
I'll think about it.

320
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,245
Nothing bad comes from listening to me.

321
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,457
I played matchmaker twice already,

322
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,044
and both couples are still going strong.

323
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,004
I have a knack for these things.

324
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,341
Looks and personality.
You're compatible in every sense.

325
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,801
He even has a respectable job.

326
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,261
Could I perhaps

327
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,389
see him from a distance first?

328
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,724
While you two talk.

329
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,935
That sounds like a great idea!

330
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,354
He wouldn't know
if you sat nearby with shades on.

331
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,399
Right. Got it.

332
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,208
Is he really here?

333
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,377
What is this?

334
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,254
A late-night snack.

335
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,549
I was actually peckish.

336
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,050
I figured.

337
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,805
Have the broth first.

338
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:52,764
Okay.

339
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,565
This is good anchovy broth.

340
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,027
How precious…

341
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,956
-How about a snack?
-Fried chicken?

342
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,666
Goryeo Chicken is too salty and sweet.

343
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,085
-I'll get Seoul Chicken.
-I want janchi guksu.

344
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,546
-This late?
-It's only 10 p.m.

345
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,048
I'll make some tomorrow for breakfast.

346
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,175
It's not hard to make.

347
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,551
The broth takes time.

348
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,059
Have an apple if you're hungry.

349
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:40,854
Forget it.

350
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:48,278
-What is it?
-Father upset you, didn't he?

351
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,992
I mean, he only cares for Ms. Sa.

352
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,494
It's because she's younger

353
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,039
and no one can help that.

354
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,834
-I'll do better.
-How?

355
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,961
Literally. I'll be better in every way.

356
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:08,006
You're already good enough.
I couldn't ask for more.

357
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,175
Let's eat out this weekend.

358
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,760
The kids would love that.

359
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,638
The food here must not suit your palate.

360
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,764
No, that's not it.

361
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,516
You barely eat these days.

362
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,102
The love you shower me with

363
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,520
keeps me full.

364
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:29,527
Pi-young and I
will start cooking next month.

365
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,197
Live your life comfortably now
and let people serve you.

366
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,868
Mother, breakfast is ready.

367
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,789
What is it?

368
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,880
-By the looks of it, you slept well.
-I did.

369
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,218
-I'm not eating.
-This is all we have.

370
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,345
Don't eat this. It's the same as poison.

371
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,347
Mother, all food is sacred.

372
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,516
People still starve, you know.

373
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,352
Have it all then.

374
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,187
I only made it because Yu-sin asked.

375
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:07,190
Look at you doting on him.
You must do that to everyone you meet.

376
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,194
What can I do with this?

377
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,821
Top it with some kimchi, at least.

378
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,031
But you eat janchi guksu
for its clear broth.

379
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,250
-Don't you like it?
-It's bland without any toppings.

380
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:29,963
Yu-sin, my grandparents said
that it's wrong to be a picky eater.

381
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:32,841
You should always eat with gratitude.

382
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:46,521
Jacob 1:15. "Then the lust,
when it has conceived, bears sin.

383
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:49,816
The sin, when it is full-grown,
produces death."

384
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,028
Gluttony brings illness
and illness eventually

385
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,113
causes death.

386
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,698
Mother, I've lost my appetite.

387
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,243
Having less of an appetite
actually leads to longevity.

388
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,494
Aren't I right, My Lord?

389
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,296
He says that I am.

390
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,218
Hello.

391
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,804
Can I get a pregnancy test kit?

392
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:27,020
99% ACCURACY WITHIN 5 MINUTES

393
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,563
USE 4 TO 5 DAYS BEFORE PERIOD BEGINS

394
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,274
You do have other brands, right?

395
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,359
Sure.

396
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,664
-I have a few things to tell you.
-Sure.

397
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,544
Would you like some tomato juice?

398
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,837
I'm good.

399
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,466
-One glass of fresh tomato juice, please.
-Yes, Ms. Choi.

400
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,223
First of all, we'd all like a raise.

401
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,393
There are six more people,

402
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,979
which means there's
more work around the house.

403
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,649
Mother isn't here, so it's only five more.

404
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:15,318
The housekeepers are exhausted.

405
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:20,073
The three of you
share an apartment unit of 35 pyeong

406
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,367
and receive a hefty salary.

407
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,868
But the workload has increased.

408
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,830
It's true that there are more dishes
and more laundry to wash.

409
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,291
But there is more than one housekeeper.

410
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,918
Besides, you can also lend a hand.

411
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,504
My job is to care for the late Mrs. Seo.

412
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:35,630
What I do is different.

413
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:38,508
But the woman you served has now passed.

414
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:42,178
Besides, Si-eun and I can take over
in terms of what you do.

415
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,139
You can lend the other ladies a hand.

416
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,225
-There's not much for you to do.
-Of course there is.

417
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:50,270
I decide what to cook,
pay the bills, and do the taxes.

418
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,688
It's hard work, you know.

419
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,774
-I order groceries every day--
-We'll draw up the menu

420
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,068
and paying taxes
is a piece of cake for us.

421
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,654
And groceries have
always been a part of our routine.

422
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,197
You're trying to steal my work.

423
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,866
I'm not asking you to resign.

424
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,243
Is it stealing your work

425
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,996
when I'm asking you
to pick up some of the chores?

426
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:08,955
Hardly.

427
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,876
Si-eun and I have led busy lives.

428
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,128
We don't lounge around.

429
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,338
We know how to pick up after ourselves.

430
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,508
I was hired by the late Mrs. Seo.
Only she can--

431
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,219
Only she has the right
to order you around?

432
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:27,098
-That's right.
-Did you sign an employment contract?

433
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,435
-No.
-Then where does it state what you claim?

434
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,561
It's been that way.

435
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:35,565
We'll be managing the housekeepers
and house from now on.

436
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,192
Si-eun and I aren't guests.

437
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,736
We're the chairman's daughters-in-law.

438
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,155
Not even the chairman speaks down to me.

439
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,698
Are you saying that I am?

440
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,117
I'm addressing you with respect--

441
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:50,246
For 12 years, I served the late Mrs. Seo.

442
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:54,584
I never got to meet Gyeong-suk,
but I hear you're the reason she quit.

443
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,711
-Did Master Dong-ma tell you?
-That's not important.

444
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,880
Anyway, you have no right

445
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,758
to order me around as you please.

446
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,176
Then who has that right?

447
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,929
Now that Mother passed away, just Father?

448
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,098
Should I ask Father for it?

449
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,563
And did you cut Mother off when she spoke?

450
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,198
Let me be frank too.

451
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:28,368
Does the housekeepers' salary
come out of your pocket?

452
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,455
It comes from this family,
so only we get to make requests.

453
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,207
They shouldn't even bring you water.

454
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,377
Don't you agree?

455
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,425
You also said
that you manage the household chores.

456
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,387
What are your rules
when it comes to laundry?

457
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,432
How do you order the laundry to be done?

458
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,560
Is there more to laundry?

459
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,727
The machine does the work.

460
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:58,898
See this stain?

461
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:04,362
Towels aren't just for the face.
We use it to dry our feet and our bodies.

462
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,948
You can't just pop them in the machine.

463
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,867
They should be pre-washed.

464
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,996
Why are you biting your lips?

465
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,289
To show your discomfort?

466
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,040
I'm glad you brought it up.

467
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,835
Last week, you grilled Ms. Park

468
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,713
-for telling Hyang-gi off--
-Do you even know what it is to grill?

469
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,466
It's to relentlessly inquire or to scold.

470
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,845
All I did was calmly say a few words.

471
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,639
Did it seem like I was grilling her?

472
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,686
Watch your language
for words can bring hell.

473
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,812
You sound delusional.

474
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,398
Anyway…

475
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:45,153
I'm saying you should talk to me
if you have any complaints about them.

476
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,154
I already have.

477
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,282
I'm not done.

478
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:54,954
You wanted to talk,
so listen to what I have to say.

479
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,498
I was done regarding the housekeepers.

480
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,208
Hey, Si-eun.

481
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:09,594
Complaints like this
should go through Si-eun first.

482
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,307
And for petty issues like this?

483
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:18,519
You'll be asked to resign
should you directly go to the chairman.

484
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,605
Says who?

485
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,316
Father manages a large company.

486
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,069
The decisions he makes daily
are beyond our comprehension.

487
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,904
Going to him with such petty issues

488
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,490
without consulting Si-eun or me first…

489
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,453
will not be tolerated.
There's an order to things.

490
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,918
But Mrs. Seo is the one who hired me.

491
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,962
When will that stop being your excuse?

492
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:50,677
Now I'm done.

493
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,304
This.

494
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,224
It needs to be washed again.

495
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,603
Your juice.

496
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,659
What's going on?

497
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,745
She must think we're pushovers.

498
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,373
Be nice and they try to walk all over you.

499
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,334
She never gave me a good impression.

500
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,296
When you're nice,
rather than being grateful,

501
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,798
people opt to cross the line.

502
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,383
And they end up paying for it.

503
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,052
-What a mean brat. Did you hear her?
-I did.

504
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,138
How can I get her in line?

505
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,015
I doubt it'll be easy.

506
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,559
-We can't tell the chairman.
-This is what we'll do.

507
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,353
Tomorrow, we'll announce our resignation.

508
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,814
-But what if--
-If we all quit, how will they manage?

509
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:47,191
They're clueless
about running a house this big.

510
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,318
Who can cook for eight people
without notice?

511
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,319
You're right.

512
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,821
Those riff-raffs.

513
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:54,657
They act like they've been
in the family for ages.

514
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,118
It's up to us to teach them manners.

515
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,369
Well said.

516
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,996
She's a divorcée,

517
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,124
and from a regular family.
This house is full of old ladies now.

518
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,917
I'm going to turn the tables.

519
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,670
Let's all do this together, okay?

520
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:08,963
Got it.

521
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,133
When they beg us to stay,
I'll ask for a hefty raise.

522
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,303
At least 30 percent!

523
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,597
Ms. Choi!

524
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,223
-Let's do this.
-Good luck!

525
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,938
I'll get married too for revenge.

526
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:29,358
The kids don't even care about me
now that they have a rich stepfather.

527
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,368
-Don't you like it?
-I have enough purses.

528
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,494
Just take it back.

529
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,458
What do you want then?

530
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,293
It's too expensive for you to buy.

531
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,713
Jewelry?

532
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,590
It's meaningless to get one by request.

533
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,644
It's hard for me too.

534
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,106
I didn't say anything.

535
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,944
What did I ever do to tire you?

536
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,114
I was just saying.

537
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,241
That's what you say after ticking me off?

538
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,747
-Am I not allowed to talk?
-Tell me then,

539
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,541
if you're not happy with something.

540
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,880
Go on. Say it.

541
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,256
You may not like the purse,

542
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,176
but I left the office early
by adjusting my schedule

543
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,179
only to be stuck in unusual traffic.

544
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,473
I went from store to store
trying to find you the right one.

545
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,852
If it were me, I'd take that into account

546
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,854
and accept it with grace.

547
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,063
A purse this expensive?

548
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,983
-Ask me in advance first.
-How is that a gift then?

549
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,152
Did you think a purse would make me happy?

550
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,321
I just wanted to make you feel better.

551
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,575
It was my child too.

552
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,870
I'm just as upset about losing it.

553
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,789
I still held back my sorrows
and got you the purse

554
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,666
as a way to comfort you.

555
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,044
I'm sorry.

556
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,678
Enough with NerTube!

557
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,805
I just got home, damn it!

558
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,683
Don't raise your voice.
We're not alone in this house.

559
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,691
Can't you see that I'm trying my best?

560
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,402
Do you think of me as a robot
who doesn't know pain?

561
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,321
A robot that caters to your needs?

562
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,489
You hardly catered to me.

563
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,619
It's not like I caused your miscarriage.

564
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,162
I was wondering when you'd say that.

565
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,707
That's right. I only have a slim chance
of conceiving a baby.

566
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,834
Back in the day,
it'd be grounds for divorce,

567
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,837
so should I sign the papers again?
Is that what you want?

568
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,524
What do you think you're doing?

569
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,284
Stop putting on an act.
I know this is what you want.

570
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,288
My mom and dad are here, you know.

571
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,956
And yet, you yelled first.

572
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,001
I'm sorry.

573
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,298
I was wrong.

574
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,467
Hye-ryung.

575
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,363
Just play dumb.

576
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,159
What are they fighting about
on empty stomachs?

577
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,952
Hunger becomes irrelevant when upset.

578
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,788
Says the man who asked for dinner
after an argument.

579
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,081
Me?

580
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,249
Set the table, please.

581
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,335
Where's the cutlery?

582
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,296
Over there! Don't you have eyes?

583
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,089
Why are you taking it out on me?

584
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,594
I'm not. Doesn't this upset you?

585
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,762
What good does that do?

586
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,434
Where are you going?

587
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,646
I'm too terrified. He was about to hit me.

588
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,398
Sa-hyeon?

589
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:21,859
Come out.

590
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,446
Come out!

591
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,947
You'll wake the baby!

592
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,536
-Were you about to hit her?
-No.

593
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,372
You threw your necktie at the wall.

594
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,456
It's the same thing.

595
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,958
I'm sorry.

596
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,919
I didn't mean it. My emotions took over.

597
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,463
His emotions got to him.

598
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,467
-Take these inside.
-Why do you think that is?

599
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,969
Talk this out instead.
Walking out isn't the way.

600
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,014
He got me a purse
just to rub it in my face!

601
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,975
Maybe you didn't acknowledge
his thoughtful gesture.

602
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,645
Right, but take the high road instead.

603
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,773
Men lack in many ways
and are thoughtless at times.

604
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,608
He does things that turn me off.

605
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,320
Have a seat.

606
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,697
Go on.

607
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,994
People snap when hungry
and he can't tolerate hunger.

608
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,704
The food's almost ready.

609
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,587
Unpack her bags.

610
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,631
It's wrong to argue with women.

611
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:28,509
Nothing good comes out of it.

612
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:33,139
Set aside your ego and pride

613
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,933
and apologize even though
you did nothing wrong.

614
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:40,813
That solves just about anything.

615
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,108
I'm sick of this.

616
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,818
But that's life.

617
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,113
Sometimes you even hate yourself,

618
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:52,825
so how can you understand
a woman when they're from Pluto?

619
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,453
Losing is winning.

620
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,538
It's why men are taught to take punches.

621
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:02,376
Unpack her things and come out to eat.

622
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,023
Hye-ryung?

623
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,985
What's wrong with you?

624
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:29,612
Hye-ryung!

625
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,114
Hurry. Call an ambulance.

626
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,158
Sa-hyeon!

627
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,915
Did he really hit her?

628
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,355
Will I be able to give birth
to a healthy baby?

629
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,651
Please, help me.

630
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:12,154
This baby means the world to me.

631
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,873
-Valet, please.
-Sure.

632
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,690
May I take your order?

633
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,608
-Rooibos tea, please.
-Sure.

634
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,346
May I have some napkins?

635
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,306
Sure.

636
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,387
It's been a while.

637
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,141
Right.

638
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:05,934
May I sit for a moment?

639
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:21,408
I searched your name online
hoping to come across good news.

640
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,122
I heard you had some
medical issues recently.

641
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,376
I'm better now.

642
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,337
We broke up again.

643
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,300
-Why?
-I guess we weren't meant to be married.

644
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,059
You don't want it to get bitter.

645
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,394
That's not your taste.

646
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:52,189
I see you still arrive earlier
than you're supposed to.

647
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:53,774
Are you meeting someone?

648
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,568
A friend.

649
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,487
It's unlike her to be late.

650
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:03,992
Are you waiting for Ms. Kim Dong-mi?

651
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:05,994
Yes.

652
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:09,665
Are you…

653
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,334
That's right.

654
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:14,962
How do you know her?

655
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,422
She's a fan.

656
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,673
I see.

657
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,300
She never mentioned you though.

658
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,510
I met her recently.

659
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,930
Why don't I call her?
She's really not one to be late.

660
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:28,517
Right. Maybe she got into a fender bender.

661
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,310
The number you have dialed--

662
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:31,895
She's not picking up.

663
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,064
Could she be in an accident?

664
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,734
-She would've called otherwise.
-Exactly.

665
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,658
Oh, it's her.

666
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,495
-Hello?
-I see you called.

667
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,206
-Is there a lot of traffic?
-Why would there be?

668
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,458
Are you on your way?

669
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,461
Where are you?

670
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,005
Home.

671
00:45:59,089 --> 00:45:59,923
Home?

672
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:04,136
We agreed to meet today.
I'm at Gangnam Hotel.

673
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:07,055
I'm in a bad mood. I'm hanging up now.

674
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,023
-I guess it's true.
-What is?

675
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,691
Hasn't she seemed off to you?

676
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:22,112
I just thought of her
as someone uplifting and eccentric.

677
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,701
-Did she just pass out?
-Yes.

678
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:29,495
Has she been under stress?

679
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,758
Your ex-wife…

680
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,261
married another man.

681
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,058
The news found its way to me.

682
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:55,854
-I see.
-She must have found a good person.

683
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,274
She did.

684
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,864
Just take it
as an opportunity to refresh ourselves.

685
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,450
It's not exactly news to us.

686
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:18,669
Why don't you treat her
to meals and drinks too?

687
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:21,505
They say she likes that kind of stuff.

688
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,676
Got it. Sure thing.

689
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,276
Is something bothering you?

690
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:46,530
You're sweet, that's all.

691
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:50,117
-Me?
-Yes, you.

692
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:54,913
Is this the welcome I'll be getting
for coming home early?

693
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:56,665
Yes.

694
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,304
She came to.

695
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:13,015
Maybe we were wrong
to chase Song Yuan out.

696
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,809
It's all been a mess since the exorcism.

697
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,520
What if there's brain damage?

698
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,566
I hear that even young people
have strokes these days.

699
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:23,817
I doubt it.

700
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,238
Either way, it's Sa-hyeon
who has to bear it all.

701
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,407
She just got out of the hospital.

702
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,410
Text him and tell him
to get something to eat.

703
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,000
STUDY CAFE

704
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,547
I love that you're taking
time off from work.

705
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,883
It'd be even better if you quit entirely.

706
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,344
Will Director Seo be late?

707
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,429
He'll be home around 10 p.m.

708
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,181
My friends want to see Danchu.

709
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,641
Can I have them over some time?

710
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,185
Of course. It's our house too now.

711
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,395
No one makes you feel out of place.

712
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,689
Your grandfather
cares for you dearly as well.

713
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:03,982
He could smile more often.

714
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:07,611
Being the chairman makes him different
from other grandfathers.

715
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,614
There's an image he built for decades.

716
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:13,867
Besides, the men in that house
aren't the smiling type.

717
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:17,454
Absolutely. I'm aware of it now.

718
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,498
But that's what makes them
charming though.

719
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,550
Is it someone you know?

720
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,177
No. I'm just jealous.

721
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,429
-About what?
-They must be siblings.

722
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:38,642
I'd love to have a baby brother or sister

723
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:39,810
to hold hands with.

724
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:56,910
I have something to tell you.

725
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,371
Is it good or bad?

726
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,123
Let me brace myself.

727
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:03,125
I can't particularly say it's bad news.

728
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:07,629
Although, I'm not sure how you'll take it.

729
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,383
Go ahead.

730
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,724
Are you sick?

731
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,895
We're good then.
As long as you're not sick.

732
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:27,232
You'll have a younger sibling
in September.

733
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,151
Really?

734
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,576
No way! This better not be a joke.

735
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:38,493
It's not.

736
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:41,705
Don't smile. It's embarrassing, you know.

737
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,749
Why would you be when it's good news?

738
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,459
Is that what you really think?

739
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,086
Of course. I love it!

740
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:51,965
Thank god.

741
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,467
Does Stepdad know?

742
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,678
Is that why you rushed the wedding?

743
00:50:57,262 --> 00:51:01,391
No. He actually proposed
when we first went out.

744
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,602
I told him on our wedding night.

745
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,400
Don't tell U-ram yet though.

746
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,319
I'm still not ready to spread the news.

747
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:13,862
You get it, right?

748
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:15,113
It should be celebrated.

749
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,031
Still.

750
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:20,744
I can't believe I'm getting a sibling.

751
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,622
-How far apart will we be?
-Thirteen years.

752
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:27,918
Are you craving anything? It'll be on me.

753
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:38,887
-Mother.
-Yes?

754
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,726
What about Jeong-bin?

755
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,437
There's Sa-hyeon's father
and the housekeeper.

756
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,482
Do you have a headache?

757
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:57,322
Are you not well?

758
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:03,078
It feels as if
something's going to go wrong.

759
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,038
Don't be ridiculous.

760
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:08,083
I just feel that way.

761
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:20,428
Losing the baby has you depressed.

762
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:22,597
If you two hadn't stopped me from leaving,

763
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,642
I would've passed out while driving.

764
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:26,852
Exactly.

765
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:29,604
"One moment of patience
wards off great disaster."

766
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,732
It's never wrong to listen to your elders.

767
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,988
-It's time for your tests.
-What tests?

768
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,073
An ECG and a carotid artery screening.

769
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,659
How about dumplings for dinner?

770
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,160
Father's running late today.

771
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,538
We'll have it when he's around,
like on a Sunday.

772
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,458
How is it that the kids
never get sick of meat?

773
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,295
Is there anything you'd like?

774
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,052
What is this about?

775
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:09,144
We're quitting.

776
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:12,898
Without Ms. Choi around,
there will be no reason for us to stay.

777
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,066
-Is that so?
-When?

778
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:15,984
Today.

779
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:17,527
Sure thing.

780
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,908
It'd be wrong of us to stop you.

781
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,035
-Don't you agree?
-Sure.

782
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:30,957
As a thank you, your final paycheck
will be two months' worth.

783
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,502
You may leave early today.

784
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:37,380
You don't live here,
so there's nothing to pack.

785
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:40,300
-We should at least cook dinner.
-That's right.

786
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,385
I'll do it myself, so don't you worry.

787
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,387
We'll leave when Chairman Seo gets home.

788
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:45,722
-To say goodbye--
-No.

789
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:49,017
There's no need for housekeepers
to say goodbye to him.

790
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:53,021
If he asks,
we'll say you left on good terms

791
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:54,314
not to anger him.

792
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:57,359
Normally, when people quit or get fired,

793
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,362
at least a month's notice should be given.

794
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,577
Then we'll stay for another month.

795
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,412
It's all right. Don't let us keep you.

796
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:18,129
Hand in your keys, please.
To the apartment unit too.

797
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,548
But I have nowhere to go at the moment.

798
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,509
You came to us saying you'd quit.

799
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:26,221
It's not right to live there
when you're not working here.

800
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,684
It was a condition
tied to your employment.

801
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,604
You should all have families to return to.

802
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:37,524
I rented my place out.

803
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,484
It's not like we rented your place out.

804
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,903
You'll have one month
to find a place to live.

805
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,966
Unbelievable. Did they think
we'd beg them to stay?

806
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,843
They messed with the wrong person.

807
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:07,345
I may be a pushover,
but you surely aren't.

808
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:08,930
Where did they get such an idea?

809
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:11,099
Ms. Choi probably instigated it.

810
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:12,809
She didn't know we'd comply.

811
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:14,310
Where can you get a job like this?

812
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,396
Talk about kicking your luck away.

813
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,441
It's true how our lives
are shaped by our personalities.

814
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,651
What do we do now?

815
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:24,571
You should apologize
and get us out of this mess.

816
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,905
That's the only way.

817
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,491
I don't need a raise!

818
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,537
She had no business picking a fight.

819
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,164
I'll find new jobs for you.

820
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:35,665
Is this really the end?

821
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,876
But this is wrong.

822
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:39,836
Then go and ask them
if they'd let you stay.

823
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,004
How can we?

824
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,798
But you egged us on!

825
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:46,134
-What?
-You called her a mean brat.

826
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:48,970
You said we should all quit together.

827
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:51,639
And you both wished me luck!

828
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,664
Young ladies.

829
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,169
From behind, you both look like
you're in your twenties.

830
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:22,170
It's the clothes.

831
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,775
Where did it go?

832
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,111
That's absurd.

833
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,195
It is a hole in one.

834
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,913
You will be very lucky this year.

835
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,836
-What's that?
-Is it a dog or a lion?

836
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:06,089
-A chowchow.
-Goodness, it is.

837
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,053
-Let's take it home.
-What about its owner?

838
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,688
-A serpent?
-Yes.

839
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:05,356
-A yellow one?
-Yes.

840
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,441
How big was it?

841
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:08,359
It was as thick as my fist.

842
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,236
That's an auspicious dream.

843
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,404
Maybe he'll score a hole in one.

844
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,655
Let Dong-ma buy it.

845
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,908
Buy it from him.

846
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,495
It's supposed to be your dream.

847
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,538
He's the one who took the shot.

848
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,373
-That's right.
-Exactly.

849
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,001
Buy it from him this instant.

850
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,628
-For how much?
-Ten thousand won.

851
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,546
-Do your dreams come true?
-Sometimes.

852
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,118
Let's see a movie.
It beats lying down all day.

853
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,249
I know you're not asleep.

854
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:05,959
Ms. Kim?

855
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,548
Is something good on?

856
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,383
Mother, please get dressed.

857
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:14,759
But I'm already dressed.

858
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:16,177
Into clothes for going out.

859
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,473
Pop them in the machine.

860
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,475
-There are only a few.
-Let them stack.

861
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:24,143
Can you turn that off?

862
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:27,772
Is one housekeeper enough?

863
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:29,065
This is a big house.

864
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,317
There's one more
who comes three times a week.

865
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,654
Besides, it's not a hassle
since all we have to do is cook.

866
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,824
I must say that
the food is tastier than before.

867
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,659
And the food doesn't go to waste.

868
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,453
That was enough of a reason
to fire the former housekeepers.

869
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,914
They wouldn't listen
when we told them to cook less.

870
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,544
-Did Dong-ma buy your dream?
-Yes.

871
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:50,962
-How much?
-For 100,000 won.

872
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:52,422
That's steep.

873
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:53,673
It's what he paid me.

874
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,927
Can you pour some for Father?
The cup's over there.

875
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:04,934
Tell him that I brewed
the red ginseng myself.

876
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,312
-It's not store-bought.
-Sure.

877
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:10,940
Are you aware that
Ban had a conception dream?

878
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:14,861
That's what it is.

879
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,988
I thought it was about good luck.

880
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:32,503
This is red ginseng tea
that was brewed for you.

881
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:33,546
Right.

882
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,090
Si-eun brewed it herself.

883
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,655
Are you done?

884
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:03,743
-I'm not going.
-Why not?

885
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:05,912
But it's a fun movie.

886
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:08,581
And laughing promotes good health.

887
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,710
What if I die?

888
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,170
Why would you die?

889
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,381
Yu-sin's father clutched his heart too.

890
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,598
He clutched his heart?

891
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:27,433
At the movie theater?

892
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,060
-That's right.
-And?

893
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:31,562
Isn't it obvious? I looked the other way.

894
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,401
You looked the other way?

895
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,695
That must've upset him.

896
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,822
He glared at me with fire in his eyes.

897
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:45,118
Didn't he say anything?

898
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,954
How can he when he could barely breathe?

899
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,081
I remember it vividly.

900
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:53,459
So what did you do?

901
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:56,421
He grabbed my arm,

902
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:57,755
so I pulled it away.

903
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:04,429
I had no other choice.

904
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,891
I chose not to look his way.

905
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,333
-I'm heading out.
-Where?

906
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:36,127
-To clear my head.
-Does it hurt?

907
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,378
No.

908
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:21,232
Ban's dream is phenomenal.
I scored a hole in one.

909
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,364
That must be your brother.

910
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,159
You paid too much for his dream.

911
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:33,411
It was worth every penny.

912
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:45,089
Is Father in his room?

913
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:32,178
Hye-ryung is hospitalized here.

914
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,095
Do you really not know?

915
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,389
Why did you even tell us
to move in with you?

916
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:37,266
Did you think of me from time to time?

917
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,060
I'd be lying if I said no.

918
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:41,312
-Let's buy another bed tomorrow.
-Let's sleep in separate rooms.

919
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,273
What's your relationship with A Mi?

920
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:47,610
-Did you not like him?
-Don't call for him like a baby.

921
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:49,403
Who are these young men?

922
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:52,198
Let me go! How about you kill me yourself?

923
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:54,992
Fine! I'll let you do it.
Just kill me with your hands!

924
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:58,537
You would've already given birth
the next time we meet.

925
01:05:58,621 --> 01:05:59,455
Yes.

926
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:00,581
Be careful.

927
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,918
Why are you here?

928
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:05,378
-We're here for someone.
-Who?

929
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:18,891
