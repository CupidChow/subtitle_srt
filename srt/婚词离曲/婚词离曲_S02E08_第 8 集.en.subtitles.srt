1
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,476
I was curious how old she is

2
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,019
to have an affair with a married man.

3
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,645
That's why.

4
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,647
You both wronged me.

5
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,777
Infidelity may not be a crime anymore,
but it's still a sin.

6
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,738
How old are you?

7
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,574
I'm 42.

8
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:19,079
I'll be 43 after
the Lunar New Year holiday.

9
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,246
How did you two meet?

10
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,582
-At a gym.
-Is this an interrogation?

11
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,835
I have a right to know.

12
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,670
-I'll tell you--
-How can I trust you?

13
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,964
You said it was over,

14
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,218
but the whole family
was enjoying dinner together.

15
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,886
We already explained

16
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,346
that we ran into each other.

17
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,641
It's not like you ran into us
because you had an appointment.

18
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:42,060
-You two can leave.
-End it today once and for all.

19
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,062
So there will be no more
misunderstandings.

20
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,816
Tell me everything
right from the very beginning.

21
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,734
As members of the same gym, we--

22
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,153
Don't you dare say another word.

23
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,655
Can't you see I'm seeing red?

24
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,369
We just naturally engaged in conversation.

25
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,663
When did you start
meeting outside the gym?

26
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,916
That I don't remember.

27
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,293
It's too far back.

28
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,461
Don't you lie to me.

29
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,713
"I don't remember" won't cut it!

30
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,550
Hye-ryung.

31
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,636
-Yes?
-She's nearly ten years your senior.

32
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,513
Should I treat her with respect?

33
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,976
Should I, old lady?

34
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,063
You're not so young yourself.

35
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:31,317
Besides, all married women
are old ladies in a way.

36
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,695
When did you first meet outside the gym?

37
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,574
Remember the day
I couldn't pay for the soft tofu stew?

38
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,119
After working out one morning,

39
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,831
we met at a restaurant
and sat down for breakfast together.

40
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:48,251
The day you called about
the lump in your mouth.

41
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,211
I was startled and forgot to pay.

42
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,671
I paid for him that day.

43
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,007
To show my appreciation,
I treated her to dinner.

44
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,508
Just dinner?

45
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,594
-Did you also have a drink?
-Sake.

46
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,470
Japanese? Which restaurant?

47
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,764
-Let me think.
-Don't you remember?

48
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:02,682
Im Sushi.

49
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,768
That place is expensive.

50
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,188
That for a cheap bowl of soft tofu stew?

51
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,317
Soft tofu stew is about
7,000 to 8,000 won.

52
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,484
She didn't treat him.

53
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,404
She paid for his breakfast
after he forgot to.

54
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,490
You never took me to Im Sushi.

55
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,744
You're more into Italian or French
than Japanese.

56
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,498
So? Is that when
things started to heat up?

57
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,253
You were after my husband
from the very start.

58
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,423
Because he looked gullible
and had a decent job.

59
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,427
Don't disrespect her like that.

60
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,055
-"Disrespect"?
-I understand how you feel,

61
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,224
but that's not the case.

62
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,683
Then what about now?

63
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,020
This is the bed you made yourself.

64
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:53,441
We could have amicably parted ways
at the restaurant.

65
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,069
What good will come out of
knowing the details?

66
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,864
-Are you sure it's over?
-Yes.

67
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,871
That ring.

68
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,709
-Did you buy it for her?
-What?

69
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,465
I did.

70
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,134
I haven't even received
a necklace from you.

71
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,221
-I got you a bracelet on your birthday.
-That was only 6,000,000 won.

72
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,223
You paid 6,000,000 won for a bracelet?

73
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,684
Maybe you already had the wedding.

74
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,937
-Of course not.
-It was a goodbye gift.

75
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,315
A farewell diamond ring?

76
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,112
I bet you felt like proposing to her!

77
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,740
Whatever it was, it's over now.
He chose you.

78
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,158
But not emotionally.

79
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,828
I'm living with a shell of a man!

80
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,247
I'm trying. Can't you see that?

81
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,291
And it must be dreadful.

82
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,547
This is hard on all of us
and painful for that matter,

83
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,133
so let's end it.

84
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,357
That's exactly why he was drawn to me!

85
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,405
Our affection grew
as I consulted him on your marriage.

86
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,743
You threw away the food

87
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,203
your mother-in-law made for you.

88
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,832
You heated up store-bought seaweed soup
on his birthday.

89
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,335
I think it's distasteful

90
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,879
even when I'm a woman too,

91
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,714
so how would he have felt?

92
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,633
Aren't married couples
supposed to love and cherish each other?

93
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,386
All you want
is to be treated like a queen.

94
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,306
Tell me if you ever put him first instead.

95
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:52,602
He constantly talked about divorce
and his life being too hard.

96
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,522
But I persuaded him otherwise
and defended you.

97
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,649
That's how we ended up liking each other!

98
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,240
Why must men only show kindness?

99
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:10,078
They say what comes around goes around.

100
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,748
Women mostly give back
more than they receive,

101
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,876
but you should do the least you can
to repay his kindness.

102
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,504
So that your partner

103
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,799
feels that he's loved!

104
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,177
There's a cause to every effect.

105
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,098
If he showed interest in me
when you were a devoted wife,

106
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,058
he'd be a bastard who deserves to be beat.

107
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,394
But how could you hit him
in front of his parents?

108
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,355
Imagine your own child

109
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:41,984
being smacked around
by a daughter or son-in-law.

110
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,071
Is that the kind of person you are?

111
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,073
Is that how your parents raised you?

112
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,326
I regret persuading him
not to divorce you.

113
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:54,288
I should've just let him do it.
Who was I to interfere?

114
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,290
It would've made things simpler

115
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,668
and might've saved everyone the heartache.

116
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,795
Something like this
wouldn't have happened.

117
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,845
Fine. Draw up the papers tomorrow.

118
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,223
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:16,477
Mother, I threw out
the side dishes you made for us.

120
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,895
That's just how I am.

121
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,356
How could I possibly
stay being your daughter-in-law?

122
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,483
I should step down.

123
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,362
I'm sorry.

124
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:31,075
I guess I should've received
better education before marrying you.

125
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,347
That's enough.
We didn't gather for a fistfight.

126
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,476
Use your words.
Physical violence can become a habit.

127
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,816
Darn you.

128
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,527
This is all my fault.

129
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,533
I got divorced
because I couldn't get pregnant.

130
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,951
I was dumped, actually.

131
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,954
The doctor said I was perfectly healthy,

132
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,500
but I still couldn't get pregnant.

133
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,794
My in-laws constantly
showed their disappointment,

134
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,796
so I agreed to the divorce.

135
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,800
Then I met Sa-hyeon at the gym

136
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,928
and he seemed pure and innocent.

137
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,472
I wasn't attracted to him sexually.

138
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,600
I guess I wanted to test it out.

139
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,854
"Was it really my fault

140
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,483
that I couldn't get pregnant?"

141
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,320
Truth be told,
that's why I approached him.

142
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,035
I guess God grants you
at least one wish in life

143
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,705
because a miracle happened.

144
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:04,710
I know it's hard to believe,
but it was just that one time.

145
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,589
I swear on my baby's life.

146
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,094
I finally have a baby that I dreamed of,

147
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:16,347
so how could I possibly
want anything more?

148
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,600
It's why I ended things.

149
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,902
It's all my fault.

150
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,947
I'm sorry…

151
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,324
for being selfish.

152
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,329
Including today,

153
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,249
it's my third or fourth time meeting them.

154
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,919
And I had no idea that you were his wife.

155
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,048
I'll move away as quickly as possible.

156
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,634
I don't want to be
tangled in this mess either.

157
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:58,556
I'd rather live a quiet life with my baby.

158
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:05,229
I will do so while living in remorse
over what I did to you.

159
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,775
Once again, I apologize with all my heart.

160
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,738
I'm the one…

161
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,408
who caused all this mess.

162
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,620
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,092
We should get going too.

164
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,013
You don't have to see us out.

165
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,807
-Take care.
-Sure.

166
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,737
You let a cougar lead you on?

167
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,841
Are you all right?

168
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,428
Stress will affect the baby, you know.

169
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,431
-Will it be all right?
-It should be.

170
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:58,843
Miss?

171
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,095
Did you notify Dr. Shin?

172
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,972
I will after I check on her.

173
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,309
Can you hear me?

174
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,626
Try the sikhye I made.

175
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,212
Gosh, it's too much.

176
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,506
It's good for indigestion.
Drink what you can.

177
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,759
-Ji-a!
-Why are you calling her?

178
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,178
To share.

179
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,890
Then she'll have to brush her teeth again.

180
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,934
-It's nothing.
-Am I a dog you're training?

181
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,102
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,687
Is that sikhye?

183
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,481
Yes.

184
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,274
Want to brush your teeth again?

185
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,484
No, that's a bother.

186
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,830
Just how late will he be today?

187
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,168
Hey.

188
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,506
-Hello?
-Ask her to join us!

189
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,798
He's at it again.

190
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,467
Can you join us?

191
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,513
-Where are you?
-Just a second. I'll text you.

192
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,680
Sure.

193
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,724
-Hurry.
-Got it.

194
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:32,853
He needs a driver.

195
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,573
Can you put it in the fridge
so I can have it later on?

196
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:46,784
Sure.

197
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,998
"Mine"? I want to barf.

198
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,011
Do you really want to move away?

199
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,389
Why must it end between us too?

200
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,225
Moving costs money and you're with child.

201
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,979
-Don't wear yourself out.
-She's right.

202
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,566
You did enough.
What more could you possibly do?

203
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,902
-I'd like to think about it.
-What's there to think about?

204
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,489
Hye-ryung won't take issue
with this again.

205
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,617
You know, I was greatly moved…

206
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,661
by your words.

207
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,081
-You took the entire blame.
-And because of that

208
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,834
you were rewarded with Bada.

209
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,962
Exactly. Anyway, forget about
what happened today.

210
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,132
It had to happen sooner or later.

211
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,425
I can't believe

212
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,927
it was Boo Hye-ryung.

213
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,971
She's beautiful

214
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:50,931
but has a temper.

215
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,434
I know she's upset and all,

216
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,019
but how could she do that in front of us?

217
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,022
Well, Sa-hyeon dug his own grave.

218
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,400
How could she dive at him like that
like some thug?

219
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,485
No wonder Sa-hyeon is scared of her.

220
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,906
Just so you know, I was terrified too.

221
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,492
Will you be okay on your own?

222
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,577
Yes.

223
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,247
If you're too tired,
please stay the night.

224
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,292
Gosh, no. It's only a two-hour drive.

225
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,836
Get some rest.
Just forget about what happened.

226
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,839
He's right.
A clouded mind is bad for your health.

227
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,726
Did your secretary take the car?

228
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:36,644
Yes.

229
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,439
-Did you drink on an empty stomach?
-I'll sober up soon.

230
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,860
659-gil Gangnam-daero.

231
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,820
-That's where you want to go?
-Yes.

232
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:47,905
For another drink?

233
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,699
-Who's waiting for you there?
-You'll see.

234
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,034
Pay your driver in advance.

235
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,036
I'll be of service another way.

236
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,162
No can do.

237
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,001
Heavy drinking is bad for your health.

238
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,672
-Today will be my last.
-As if.

239
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,551
-Do you want a detox drink?
-I'm not that drunk.

240
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,100
Aren't you going to sleep?

241
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,062
-I have some files to go over.
-You agree

242
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,065
that it's pathetic
and embarrassing, right?

243
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:44,003
Is that the kind of man you are?
I just can't believe it.

244
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,172
Chasing anything with a skirt, are you?

245
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,969
She's a divorcée who will soon be 50.

246
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,596
Everything about her screamed mediocre.

247
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,224
How were you even attracted to her?

248
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,729
Can't you hear me?

249
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,939
Are you ignoring me?

250
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,276
Was your first girlfriend
you dated in law school

251
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,778
older than you too?

252
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,781
Do you have a thing for older women?
Is that it?

253
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,243
No. Go to bed. It's late.

254
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,286
As if I could sleep.

255
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,790
Are we going to have this issue
every time a woman comes at you?

256
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,043
It won't ever happen again.

257
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,171
Because Song Yuan is
the only woman I love.

258
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:31,091
I'll sweep it under the rug since
it was your first time and you were used.

259
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,469
But what about the kid?

260
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,389
Unbelievable.

261
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,359
I wonder if he ate.

262
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,197
Should we call?

263
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:54,990
Leave them be.

264
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,910
Skipping a single meal won't do any harm.

265
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,706
-Hello?
-It's me.

266
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,585
How are you?
Have you calmed down a little?

267
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,045
I'll have to get myself there.

268
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,797
-And dinner?
-I had some yogurt.

269
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,049
Would that be enough? What about Sa-hyeon?

270
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,258
He…

271
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,554
He didn't even get a sip of water
at the restaurant.

272
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,682
Hello?

273
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,894
Don't worry, Father.

274
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,854
Are you home?

275
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,565
-Almost.
-Good night, then.

276
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,111
You can take it up with him all you want,

277
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,614
but at least feed him while doing so.

278
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,990
Sure.

279
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,079
It looks like only she had some yogurt.

280
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,290
She should feed him at least.

281
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,127
You need energy to fight.

282
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,682
1 UNREAD MESSAGE
DAD

283
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,643
You need energy to fight.

284
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,229
Don't skip your meals.
It'll only ruin your health.

285
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,249
Honey.

286
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,379
-We're at Gangnam Hotel.
-Right.

287
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,631
Have it valeted.

288
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,012
Are the others gathered here?

289
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,514
Are you drinking all night?

290
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,610
Going up.

291
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,655
Is my mom here?

292
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,656
No.

293
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,744
Some shut-eye sobered me up.

294
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,122
I doubt you have something planned.
It's not even my birthday.

295
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,964
They have cameras, you know.

296
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,301
Is it a guest from overseas?

297
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,178
That's right.

298
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,096
That friend you gave the jacket to?

299
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,224
Nope.

300
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,519
If you had told me,
I would have dressed decently.

301
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,980
You look great. Stunning, actually.

302
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,465
-Off.
-Seriously?

303
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:07,975
You too.

304
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:28,787
You've had enough.

305
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,039
I'm sober now and it's just champagne.

306
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,584
What's the occasion?

307
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,462
Each other's company
is a blessing and a joy.

308
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,465
Don't you agree?

309
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,677
Here.

310
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,769
Some go for midnight walks,
but here we are on a midnight date.

311
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,479
-Sure.
-How boring.

312
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,149
We haven't had
a lot of alone time recently.

313
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,277
Our trips always accompany Ji-a now.

314
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,654
Are you suggesting we stay the night?

315
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,781
-Why not?
-I'm not prepared.

316
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,242
All we need is to be here.
What more do we need?

317
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,618
I don't have my pajamas.

318
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,413
There's a bathrobe, lotion, and shampoo.

319
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,956
But they're so stiff.

320
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,584
Then sleep naked.

321
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,628
I'll be your pajamas tonight .

322
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,130
One that's 36.5°C.

323
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,761
I appreciate the surprise and all,
but I would have loved the heads up.

324
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,388
-Then it wouldn't be a surprise.
-Is that what this is?

325
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:35,062
I was going to call you out sooner
had it not been Jun-su's birthday.

326
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,396
Is it his birthday today?

327
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,940
He called you because his family's abroad.

328
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,568
Thanks to you,
I had an excuse to leave early.

329
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,903
What a shame.

330
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,822
If only I was elegantly dressed
for the occasion.

331
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,699
You're elegance itself.

332
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,368
Ms. Kim living with us has its perks.

333
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,788
Let's have a drink and sleep at home.

334
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,791
No. If I wanted to just drink,
I would've gone to a bar.

335
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,667
What would Mother think of us?

336
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,086
But we're married.

337
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,924
We'll head home at dawn.
It'll save us all the explaining.

338
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,844
Turn your phone off too.
Ms. Kim might call.

339
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,232
-Have some galbi.
-I don't have an appetite.

340
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:25,028
I'm the one without an appetite.
You're the one in the wrong.

341
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,032
That's exactly why I don't want to eat.

342
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,076
-Is that sarcasm?
-Of course not.

343
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,327
Your face says otherwise.

344
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,497
You don't seem guilty at all.
You're not sorry at all.

345
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:08,196
Why did you buy her a ring?
A diamond ring at that.

346
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,494
You must be insane
to fall for an old woman like her.

347
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,997
You fell for her tricks
but you say it's love.

348
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,833
Dongmi the dog would laugh
if she could hear that.

349
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,085
How much was the ring?

350
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,629
Why didn't you just give her
money instead?

351
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,854
You look even more handsome here
than at home.

352
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,939
Very classy.

353
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,609
You want to come often, is that it?

354
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,693
Yes.

355
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,908
It's been over a decade
since our honeymoon,

356
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,035
but it feels like yesterday.

357
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:56,661
That night…

358
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:04,586
I had mixed feelings.
Nervous was one of them.

359
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,921
Weren't you happy?

360
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,089
As if you have to ask that.

361
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,342
Many people choose
not to marry these days.

362
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,346
I feel bad for them.
They won't know how lovely it is

363
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,806
unless they experience it.

364
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:21,978
Tell me about it.
Marriage is different from just dating.

365
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,994
In about 20 years, I'll be 60.

366
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,997
Will we fall into a comfortable rut

367
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,041
and drift apart a little?

368
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:47,003
No way. We'll probably love
and cherish each other more.

369
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,756
Then I'd be grateful.

370
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,886
-Don't you nag me for getting too old.
-I'll get old, too.

371
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,223
Unlike me,
you take great care of your health.

372
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:02,060
They say women constantly
change their minds, but wives don't.

373
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,688
Women may change,

374
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,316
but wives remain unchanged as long as
they're loved by their husbands.

375
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,609
Then I'm relieved.

376
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,279
I know my love for you won't change.

377
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:15,407
If I get another chance at life,
I'll marry three times.

378
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,703
Once with Shin Yu-sin,
once with my husband,

379
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:22,289
and once with Ji-a's dad.

380
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,629
-This is nice.
-It's different from being home.

381
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,968
Song Yuan.

382
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,306
I knew she had a classy personality,

383
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,767
but she's so much more than that.

384
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,269
She's wise.

385
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,523
A model woman,
by our ancestors' standards.

386
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,817
For Sa-hyeon's sake,

387
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,279
she took the blame
despite how bad it made her look.

388
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:58,074
That's not easy, you know.
Everyone has pride…

389
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,952
and in front of someone
much younger than her.

390
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:05,707
Any other woman
would've raised her voice at Hye-ryung,

391
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,667
telling her to keep her husband in check.

392
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,794
She must have aged with wisdom.

393
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:13,423
Old age doesn't guarantee wisdom.
Everyone's different.

394
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:18,720
No one kept her husband in better check
than Ms. So.

395
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,764
You kept me in line.

396
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,393
I pretty much let you roam free.

397
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,604
That's how the master does it.

398
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,189
You just can't help yourself.

399
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,068
-Are you accusing me of something?
-Of course not! I take it back.

400
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,491
It's just that your wisdom allowed you
to keep me in line--

401
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,577
Strike that! I just mean you're wise.

402
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,745
Forget it.

403
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,251
The way Hye-ryung is right now,

404
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,295
when she gets older…

405
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,799
What's scarier than a tiger?

406
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:56,966
I don't know.

407
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,721
-A ghost?
-It's your wife.

408
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,641
Who'd have a child with her

409
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,351
when she's so terrifying?

410
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,228
Honey.

411
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:14,359
I've been trying my best
to be good to you,

412
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,362
but I lacked in many ways.

413
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:18,488
Nonsense.

414
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,366
Compared to you, I mean.

415
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,410
Hardly.

416
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,705
From now on,
I'll try harder and be more attentive.

417
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:36,798
If only we could spend
just a few months on our own.

418
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,801
We're still at our peak, right?
How about a month on Jeju Island?

419
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,679
Always stay this way.

420
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,974
Just like the four seasons come and go.

421
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,642
That's how I am.

422
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,395
As you grow older,

423
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,564
you become more charming and handsome.

424
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,275
More than you were in your twenties.

425
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,484
And my love for you?

426
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,820
It's like a stream.

427
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,322
Is that better than love that's like silk?

428
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,866
Of course.

429
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,493
Silk is just an object,
but a stream is a part of nature.

430
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:09,539
Out of all that nature provides us with,
water fascinates me the most.

431
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:13,877
You can see it with your eyes
and touch it,

432
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,171
but you can't grab onto it.

433
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:20,091
My love for you is like a stream
that only flows to you.

434
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,885
It overflows.

435
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,556
-You know that, right?
-Yes.

436
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,894
And that love of yours
tickles my heart every now and then.

437
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,771
-How much does it tickle?
-Adequately.

438
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,481
That's nowhere enough.

439
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,744
They're still not home?

440
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,122
Mom made it herself.

441
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,833
I rarely eat at home.

442
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,126
This will change that.
For Mom's sake, okay?

443
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,297
I'll come by to have some when I can.

444
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,389
Can I get a cup of coffee?

445
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,142
I bet you desperately want to talk.

446
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,895
About Ga-bin, I mean.

447
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,190
Did you say hi to her?

448
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,608
I doubt you did.

449
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:05,655
She can date someone briefly,
but it can never be true love.

450
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:06,906
I know this for sure.

451
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,158
Why not?

452
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,744
Because she's addicted to me.

453
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,830
No one can ever quit me.

454
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,165
Do you believe
that the world revolves around you?

455
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,501
Not the entire world,

456
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,296
but women at least. Especially Ga-bin.

457
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,881
She seemed happy and at ease.

458
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,924
She's an actor. She can put on a show.

459
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,092
She wants me to see it.

460
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:30,054
You'll be in shock if she really
gets married judging by your ego.

461
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,681
I'm right.

462
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,106
Why weigh yourself every day?

463
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,524
Why am I not losing weight?

464
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,693
Not eating enough hinders weight loss.

465
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,197
Maybe I should choose another dress.
I'm going to look fat.

466
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,451
Your waist is barely a few inches wide.

467
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,203
We will begin the morning briefing.

468
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,166
There was a newly admitted patient.

469
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,211
Name, A Mi. Age, 27.

470
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:05,506
She had drowned herself in wine
and whiskey for the past few days.

471
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,426
She came in on her own accord
saying she couldn't sleep.

472
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:11,679
During admission, she showed drowsiness,
lost consciousness,

473
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,097
and was taken to the ER.

474
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,016
A liter of saline was administered

475
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,976
and she regained consciousness.

476
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,228
In a highly agitated state,
she asked to be put to sleep.

477
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,813
A vial of Ativan was injected

478
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,399
and Dr. Lee Jeong-min
confirmed the admission.

479
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,901
The general ward or the recovery room?

480
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,570
The recovery room.
Four cuts were found on her left hand--

481
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:28,863
Not her wrist?

482
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,740
No, it didn't seem suicidal.

483
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,533
The wounds will be checked once--

484
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,119
-And sutures?
-They weren't necessary.

485
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,331
Next is Han Hun, a ten-year-old boy.

486
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,375
While playing with his sister,
he suffered…

487
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,586
We can't notify her family
until she wakes up.

488
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,171
Her phone is password protected.

489
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:49,217
We can't call anyone on their behalf
unless they're lucid which is an issue.

490
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,551
Exactly.

491
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,306
I heard you got some sleep.

492
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,059
Yes, the new medicine must be working.

493
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,228
-Is your family coming in today?
-Yes.

494
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,731
Walk the hallway about ten times instead,
since it's cold outside.

495
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,441
-You need to walk.
-Sure.

496
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,485
-I'll be back to check.
-Got it.

497
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,995
-Is she on medication?
-Yes.

498
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,373
-Let me know when she wakes up.
-Yes, doctor.

499
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,821
Like I assumed,
she's the daughter of a friend.

500
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,948
I see. That must be why she came here.

501
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,705
-The dressing?
-It was done in the ER.

502
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,000
-Should I wake her?
-No.

503
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,670
-Do we have a vacant single room?
-Yes.

504
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,298
Please move her there.

505
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,531
Are you on your way to work?

506
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,617
I just left Ban's place.

507
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,912
I truly admire you, Dad.

508
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:45,583
In every aspect.
You're even emotionally stable.

509
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,959
Right.

510
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,006
DIRECTOR SHIN YU-SIN

511
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,140
Grandma, come on. We'll be late!

512
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,391
No, we won't.

513
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,852
Text your mom and tell her we're leaving.

514
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,359
No way. You look totally different today.

515
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,070
-Then don't call me Grandma today.
-What should I call you?

516
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,780
Just don't call me anything.

517
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,325
Let's go.

518
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,328
-No traffic, right?
-Right.

519
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,331
I love your jacket, Mother.
When did you buy it?

520
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,500
-I've always had it.
-It looks new though.

521
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,544
I bought it a while back.

522
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,963
She doesn't look like a grandma, right?

523
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,715
Remember what I said
about calling me as one.

524
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,092
Got it.

525
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,553
They all know you're my grandma though.

526
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,804
Still.

527
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,515
-U-ram's here.
-Really?

528
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,437
-Hello.
-She's my mother-in-law.

529
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:54,235
I'll call you back later.
I'm at the broadcasting station.

530
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,153
Hi.

531
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,488
My daughter-in-law
is a radio show producer.

532
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,950
I wanted to see how they're produced.

533
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,160
You have to be quiet.

534
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,953
-Sure.
-Got it.

535
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,334
Mother, he's our engineer.

536
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,294
Hello.

537
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,755
Goodness. I'm sorry for intruding today.

538
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,591
Nonsense. We have guests all the time.

539
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,551
-Say hello.
-Hello.

540
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,636
-Right. You must be U-ram.
-Hello.

541
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,305
And I'm Ji-a.

542
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,348
I see you take after your mother.

543
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,933
Like two statues from one mold.

544
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,436
-Mister--
-It's Mr. Seo.

545
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,479
Mr. Seo, can I film the show on my phone?

546
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,981
-Me too!
-Sure thing.

547
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,200
Boo Hye-ryung's Love, Memories,
and Music begins now.

548
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,893
-My gosh!
-Hello there. Why are you so startled?

549
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,938
Most visitors
don't use the stairs, you see.

550
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,273
What brings you by?

551
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,067
Is a family member here?

552
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,402
My eldest niece. The one I adore the most.

553
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,737
Which department?

554
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,490
This is from Mr. Park Cheol-su.

555
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,450
"Hello, everyone.

556
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:27,411
I'm a single male who turned 49 this year.

557
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,664
Why am I still not married?

558
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,918
Because I have yet to find a woman
I wish to spend the rest of my life with.

559
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,629
But just like a drizzle
that wets your clothes,

560
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:40,466
a colleague at work
found her way into my heart.

561
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:43,344
I work with three professional women

562
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,472
that are 49, 40,
and 32 years old respectively.

563
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,682
I fell for one of them.

564
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,600
They're all married though.

565
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,061
I'm sure you can see how that's a problem.

566
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,772
She's a happily married workingwoman,

567
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,191
so I don't know what to do.

568
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,611
My feelings for her are deepening

569
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,155
and I'm losing sleep over this matter.

570
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,700
I don't know how to tell her my feelings

571
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:09,245
and telling her
could disrupt our team's dynamic.

572
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:14,417
The more I think about it,
the more I'm certain of my feelings.

573
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:19,005
Should I just be content with
seeing her at work?

574
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,758
Or should I tell her how I feel?

575
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:26,595
After much pondering,
I ask you for advice."

576
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,433
It must not have been easy to tell us,

577
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,685
so thank you for writing to us.

578
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:36,272
Since this woman you like is married,

579
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:39,567
I don't think I can tell you
to tell her how you feel.

580
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:44,530
User ID 2719 says,
"Honesty is the best policy."

581
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,907
User ID 8347 says,
"Don't make a rash decision.

582
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,160
You might end up
with a slap across your face."

583
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,664
Here's what I think.

584
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,334
She may seem happily married,

585
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,919
but it might be a different story.

586
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:03,341
Her marital life might not be
what she makes it out to be.

587
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,969
Some couples aren't as happy as they seem.

588
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:10,056
-Starting with her.
-She sounds unfazed though.

589
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,183
I think there's a chance

590
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:15,144
that there are more miserable couples
than those who are happy.

591
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,355
How about this then?

592
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,774
Ask her out for a drink

593
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,151
and hint your feelings toward her.

594
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,614
User ID 3411 says, "Women are the same.

595
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,826
Even though they're happily married,
they don't hate being liked by others."

596
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,204
Sounds true to me too.

597
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,373
We all like being loved.

598
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,709
Although, it might differ
depending on who the other is.

599
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:43,172
Anyway, I advise you
to tell her how you feel.

600
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,465
How about a song?

601
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,805
As you know,
young age means faster recovery.

602
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,223
You don't have to worry.

603
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,642
I told the doctor
to follow her up closely.

604
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:55,768
Thank you.

605
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,645
I didn't want to make a fuss.

606
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,146
It was my pleasure.

607
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,317
It's my first time
visiting a neuropsychiatrist.

608
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,069
It's called a psychiatry clinic
these days.

609
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,529
Yes, of course.

610
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,574
Is it your day off today?

611
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,868
I hired a talented doctor
to share my workload

612
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:16,205
which is why I know
it's hard to run a hospital of this size.

613
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,583
I owe it to my father
for setting up an effective system.

614
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,256
Are you really
taking time off horseback riding?

615
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,966
It feels empty without you there.

616
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,968
It reminds me of Chadol too much.

617
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,637
I know. I've been there too.

618
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,360
Your cousin should keep riding though
since she's improving.

619
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,238
I know.

620
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,615
But she's been busy lately.

621
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,703
Doctor, Chairman Seo Min-ho
just came into the ER.

622
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:56,912
You should get going.

623
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,998
-We should grab a drink.
-Sure.

624
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,755
About that letter I read today.
Don't you think Mr. Seo sent it?

625
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,300
The three women sounded just like us.

626
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,302
That thought crossed my mind briefly too.

627
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:14,013
The situations are too similar
for it to be random.

628
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:17,558
Exactly. From the women's age
to them being workingwomen.

629
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,101
The ages are a year off though.

630
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,520
It could be that
he deducted a year to throw us off.

631
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,898
But I doubt it's from him.

632
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,108
Could he have sent it as a joke?

633
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,486
As if he doesn't have
anything better to do.

634
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,279
The women are married

635
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,573
and he doesn't know about you yet.

636
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,910
Who out of us three do you think it is?

637
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,454
-The one he likes.
-Hye-ryung.

638
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,332
-Why not you?
-Oh, gosh.

639
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,792
You never know. You're the same age.

640
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,295
That's exactly why it can't be me.

641
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,588
It could be you, Ms. Sa.

642
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,758
He's a tall man,
so he'd like someone tall and lean.

643
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,301
Like you or Si-eun.

644
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,095
Why don't we get him to talk over drinks?

645
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:58,182
What if it isn't him? It'd be humiliating.

646
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:02,019
I tried to read his face
but I couldn't tell.

647
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,604
He doesn't show his emotions.

648
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:07,483
I hear that players
are masters at hiding emotions.

649
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,442
Maybe he is one.

650
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,113
My mom's amazing and so is your mom.

651
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,950
U-ram, what do you dream of becoming?

652
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,286
It changes constantly,
but the engineer we met

653
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,039
made me want to study engineering
and do what he does.

654
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:23,541
Sounds good.

655
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,627
He said he studied
electronic engineering too.

656
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,004
He looks like
he'll be popular among women.

657
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,215
Right. He's as fit as your dad.

658
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,176
-Why do you think he's not married?
-Isn't he?

659
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,636
Not according to my mom.

660
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,013
-He's unmarried. A bachelor?
-Yes.

661
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:41,058
No wonder he's stylish.

662
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,816
We should go.

663
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,986
What's the rush? Stay for a while.

664
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,238
You should. The gelato tastes good.

665
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,282
It's just like the one I had in Italy.

666
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,746
-Won't you eat tomorrow either?
-I'm not hungry.

667
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,473
Drink this when it's less cold.

668
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,310
You need the energy.

669
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:34,653
I told the employees that you're
the daughter of a friend in the US.

670
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,619
-What happened to your hand?
-I don't know.

671
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,454
I only remember a broken bottle.

672
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,748
Where? At home?

673
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,086
It's been tough for me too.

674
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,512
-Are you heading home?
-Later.

675
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,310
Chairman Seo's asking for you.

676
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:24,745
I saw that.

677
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,750
-Where did you get it?
-The radio show engineer.

678
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,088
100,000 won?

679
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,965
-I want half.
-No way.

680
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:40,386
Isn't 100,000 won a bit too much
for a kid in elementary school?

681
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,179
The engineer gave it to him.

682
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,473
Well, he didn't know.

683
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,266
Know what?

684
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,977
He must have just found U-ram adorable.

685
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:52,272
I'd rather just consider it
as him being generous.

686
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,692
-He's a bachelor, right?
-Right.

687
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,318
-How old is he?
-51.

688
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,445
-He's the same age as you.
-Right.

689
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,739
U-ram says he's quite stylish too.

690
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,868
-What are you getting at?
-Nothing.

691
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,122
Why isn't he married?

692
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,165
It's rude to ask such a question.

693
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,627
Some hesitate to get back on the horse

694
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,504
after being burned in a relationship.

695
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,714
-Is he dating someone?
-How should I know?

696
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,260
He must be
since he has a lot going for himself.

697
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:22,970
I should've been there too today.

698
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,271
We should go grocery shopping
for the Lunar New Year.

699
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,690
We already have sikhye,
so let's make sujeonggwa.

700
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,944
Yu-sin enjoyed it as a boy,
but not so much now.

701
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,280
We'll make it if your mother likes it.

702
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,408
She doesn't care for sweet beverages.

703
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,160
It's me who likes it.

704
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,787
I like the soft texture
of dried persimmons.

705
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,497
It's soaked in cinnamon.

706
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,667
Right. Ji-a must take after me
since she likes it too.

707
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,628
Then make some. It's not hard
and we have good persimmons.

708
00:45:57,796 --> 00:46:00,257
We should serve dumpling soup
for the memorial service.

709
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,884
Father liked them.

710
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,679
I thought of that too.

711
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:07,848
MINE

712
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,309
It's Yu-sin.

713
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,396
Don't tell me we cooked
when he's running late.

714
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,399
-Hello?
-Sorry, but I'll be late today.

715
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,775
For what reason?

716
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:20,986
Patient consultations.

717
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,198
Two VIP patients
were admitted to the hospital today.

718
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,282
Got it.

719
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:32,831
Sir, can you help me load my bags
in the elevator for a little extra?

720
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:33,749
Sure.

721
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,293
Please, turn it off.

722
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,086
-It's not here.
-No?

723
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,087
No.

724
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,885
I should be home for the Lunar New Year,
you know.

725
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,136
Go ahead.

726
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,846
Will you be all right on your own?

727
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,598
I'm going to take my shot

728
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:53,101
and be at my daughter's house.

729
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,563
Are you expecting anyone?

730
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,527
-Who is it?
-Open up!

731
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:05,322
-Who may you be?
-I'm Seo-hyang's little sister, Seo-ri.

732
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,698
I see.

733
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:07,991
It's your younger sister.

734
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,246
Can you take these?

735
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,166
My sister's not in bed, is she?

736
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,334
No.

737
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,753
-Are you the sister from the Philippines?
-Yes.

738
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,549
Seo-hyang!

739
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,430
Is she tired or sick?

740
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,682
She's not well.

741
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,480
How did you get here?

742
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,149
You didn't even call.

743
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,986
Seo-hyang? My goodness!

744
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:45,904
What's wrong with her?

745
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,073
Did she lose consciousness? Oh, no.

746
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,951
-Should I call an ambulance?
-Of course.

747
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,412
911 EMERGENCY RESCUE

748
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:03,714
I was told to take her
to Sin Central Medical Center.

749
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,132
Has Pi-young been by?

750
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,133
-Ji-a's mother.
-Her daughter?

751
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,634
-Yes.
-I haven't met her.

752
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,888
-Not even once?
-No, I only heard of her.

753
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,933
Has her family not been by?

754
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,560
-Not even her son-in-law?
-One time,

755
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,562
I heard her on the phone with him.

756
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,912
Dinner ran a little late.
I bet my puppy was hungry.

757
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,790
-I had gelato earlier, remember?
-Oh, right.

758
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,627
It's squid stew, your favorite.

759
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:47,466
AUNTIE

760
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,594
-Hello?
-Hey!

761
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:51,887
Auntie?

762
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,348
Don't "Auntie" me.
Your mother has collapsed!

763
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,683
I heard you haven't even been by.

764
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,352
Are you in Korea?

765
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,729
Yes, and I'm taking her
to your husband's hospital!

766
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:05,817
How did this happen--

767
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,862
It looks really bad.
She's almost on the brink of death!

768
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:11,073
And yet I hear
you haven't been visiting her.

769
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:13,825
I'll be right there, Auntie.

770
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,960
Did Grandma collapse?

771
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:25,921
Have your dinner.

772
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:37,349
MY LOVE

773
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:42,187
MY LOVE

774
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,278
Your call cannot be…

775
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,539
911 EMERGENCY SERVICE

776
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:03,542
I asked her numerous times
whether she should be hospitalized

777
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:06,169
-since her son-in-law is a doctor.
-And?

778
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,380
She said her illness was beyond treatable.

779
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:13,927
Seo-hyang, is it an incurable illness?
Is it?

780
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,348
-Hello, Ms. Sa.
-Has my mother arrived?

781
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,266
Your mother?

782
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,187
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

783
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:31,403
Auntie!

784
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,618
How could you?

785
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,704
Even dogs are looked after
when they get sick.

786
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:44,249
She's your mother and she's almost dying!

787
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:47,461
How could you have not looked in on her
when you live so close by?

788
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:53,717
We're heading in.

789
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,764
I didn't get married because I was
afraid to have a child like you!

790
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,606
Seo-hyang…

791
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,361
-Where's Yu-sin?
-The family room is empty, right?

792
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,780
-Yes.
-Where's Yu-sin?

793
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,823
-Please move her there.
-He's still here.

794
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,658
If anything happens to her…

795
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,910
She needs to be moved.

796
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,545
-You may head home.
-Are you sure?

797
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:31,880
Yes, we'll be here for her.

798
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:33,840
I'm worried about her.

799
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,468
She hasn't been
in the best of shape lately.

800
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,445
Where's Dr. Shin?
He's not answering his phone.

801
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,949
He's with Ms. A Mi right now.
VIP ward, Room Number Three.

802
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,787
Do you have a headache?

803
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,373
It's still numb.

804
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:10,961
Here.

805
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,213
A sip at least.

806
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,716
-Maybe later.
-How many days did you drink for?

807
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,344
Can I lean on you?

808
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,813
Of course. No, it's fine.

809
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:36,069
Goodness, I got the wrong room.
I'll call you back later.

810
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:42,278
Pi-young, get up.

811
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:45,240
What's up with you? Get on your feet.

812
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,218
Honey?

813
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,888
What on earth is going on?

814
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:51,264
What happened?

815
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,643
Her mom was brought in

816
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,063
and I arrived in Korea a few hours ago.

817
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,193
Pi-young, my goodness.

818
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:07,238
My gosh.

819
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,409
It must be because of her mother.

820
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,828
She's in complete shock.

821
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,848
All right. Sure thing.

822
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:39,562
Ji-a, your mom will stay
at the hospital today.

823
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,690
Your dad asked me to pack her things,
so stay home.

824
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,150
I want to go too.

825
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,319
You'll only risk being infected there.

826
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:47,904
I won't be gone long.

827
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,053
-Is she awake?
-Not yet.

828
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:14,222
-Can you get her phone?
-Sure.

829
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,477
It's Ji-a.

830
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:24,190
Hello, Ji-a. It's your great-aunt.

831
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,859
The one from the Philippines?

832
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:28,862
That's right. Your mom just fell asleep.

833
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,114
Your father's here,

834
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,868
but he's busy so can you call back later?

835
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,912
-All right.
-Ji-a, your mom's toothbrush.

836
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,664
Actually, I'll just buy one.

837
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:42,375
What should we do for the Lunar New Year?

838
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:45,753
Song Yuan will be all alone.

839
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,549
-Pan Mun-ho.
-Yes?

840
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:52,260
Just be the way you've always been.

841
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,345
This new attitude doesn't suit you at all.

842
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,431
Doesn't it? I quite like it though.

843
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,893
-The words roll off my tongue
-You sound cheesy.

844
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,438
Well, that's not good.

845
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,774
It'd be nice

846
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:10,320
to have Song Yuan
spend the holiday with us.

847
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:13,490
We can have fun
playing yutnori with Byeol-hui.

848
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,533
What would our eldest son say?

849
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:16,868
We're all family,

850
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,871
and blood is thicker than water.

851
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,040
Wives adore their brothers-in-law.

852
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:25,210
They say that mothers adore
their sons-in-law and fathers

853
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,962
adore their daughters-in-law.

854
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:31,382
But there's no such thing
as what you just said.

855
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:34,969
Well, it's true that Byeol-hui's mom
adores Sa-hyeon.

856
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,971
Family takes priority though,

857
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:40,391
so she'd take Hye-ryung's side
once she finds out

858
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:42,101
being a first wife herself.

859
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,396
The truth will have to come out
once the baby's born.

860
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,315
It's best to get it over with,

861
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:52,028
so let's tell the family
when they come to cook tomorrow.

862
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:53,196
I'll do the talking.

863
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,867
Hye-ryung would love
not to be invited anyway.

864
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:02,121
She reluctantly comes by, stays the night,
and hurries home.

865
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,416
She tries her best
not to eat the holiday food too.

866
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:10,004
A few more bites of food made with love
won't make her fat.

867
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,965
People want to claim their rights

868
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,801
despite not wanting
to fulfill their duties.

869
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,929
It'll only make things worse for Sa-hyeon.

870
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:21,349
-Is that so?
-I have no affection left for her now.

871
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:25,270
How dare she beat up her husband
in front of his parents?

872
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:28,273
Even though Dongmi's only a dog,

873
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,859
I've never laid my hands on her.

874
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,532
She's just vile by nature.

875
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:39,534
She'll know how we feel

876
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:44,330
once she sees her own grown son
getting beat up to a pulp.

877
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:47,500
It gave me the chills
when I saw him get beat up like that.

878
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,670
She thinks we're pushovers.

879
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,672
We weren't good to her because of her job.

880
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,009
We pitied her
since her family lives abroad,

881
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:59,012
so we took her in
as if she was our own daughter.

882
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:02,056
She keeps crossing the line
that shouldn't be crossed.

883
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,891
How could she beat Sa-hyeon like that?

884
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,895
You should have put her in her place,

885
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,273
like you did with me recently.

886
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:14,944
-Are you upset about that?
-Of course not! Why would it be?

887
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,864
I'm truly grateful.

888
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,657
I doubt that's the case.

889
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:22,910
You made me reflect on myself and my ways.

890
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:27,540
If you hadn't, I would have kept
hurting you without realizing it.

891
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,500
You know…

892
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:34,172
I've become a new man.

893
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:39,177
I've reflected on what I did.

894
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,889
She didn't know
about her mother's condition.

895
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,183
I hear she hasn't been by at all.

896
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:48,936
How could I possibly
have been nice about it?

897
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:52,607
I told her off
and she left not wanting to hear it.

898
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,234
I thought she was crying,

899
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,696
but I found her completely shocked
on the floor.

900
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,658
Of course she was shocked.

901
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,451
She thought her mother was all right.

902
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:07,246
Every time she'd call,
she told her not to worry.

903
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,040
I heard it myself.

904
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:12,377
We agreed to spend the holiday together.

905
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,337
She seems to have a serious illness.

906
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:18,383
According to the housekeeper,
she said it's untreatable.

907
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,635
She should've told us.

908
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:22,345
Her son-in-law is a doctor.

909
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:23,638
Tell me about it.

910
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:28,935
Will you be staying?
I should check in on my sister.

911
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:35,274
I thought you had gone home
without telling me.

912
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,151
You'll move to
Shinseocho Jeil Hospital tomorrow.

913
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:39,112
I'll put in a good word.

914
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,030
My wife was just admitted.

915
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:44,200
-Why?
-She seems to be in shock

916
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:45,618
over her mother's illness.

917
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,537
She passed out.

918
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,498
What a mess.

919
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,337
I'll visit in the evening. Get some rest.

920
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,216
I'd rather go home.

921
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:03,010
Do so if it's over between us.

922
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,563
Dr. Shin asked me to care for the patient

923
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:15,106
and relieve you.

924
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:20,361
I should be by her side.

925
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,573
You should get some rest
and come back tomorrow.

926
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:25,116
Sleep comfortably at least.

927
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,451
Right, of course.

928
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,077
I bet you didn't have dinner yet.

929
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:30,747
I ate at the cafeteria earlier.

930
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,540
Please call me if something happens.

931
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,126
Sure thing.

932
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:40,882
I'm sorry.

933
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:44,844
I wasn't too hard on her,
but I was pretty upset.

934
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,430
I should have held back.

935
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:52,310
She's not the type to collapse
just because of a few harsh words.

936
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,645
It must be due to her mother.

937
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:58,191
My sister can be a little harsh too,

938
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:02,153
so their relationship
was never that amicable.

939
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:05,072
-So I heard.
-You did? From who?

940
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,899
I could've gotten rid of both in one day.

941
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:44,755
Wake up.

942
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:48,301
I said, wake up.

943
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,244
Who's A Mi?

944
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:20,333
The patient in VIP Room Three.

945
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:53,449
Come have some tteokguk with us
for the Lunar New Year.

946
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:54,450
You don't have to bow to them.

947
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:56,869
I'll just end up making things awkward.

948
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,413
-I was right.
-She said it wasn't like that.

949
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,415
She's close friends with Nam Ga-bin.

950
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:04,377
-The director's wife is hospitalized?
-Yes.

951
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,045
Could it be that she's…

952
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,630
She must have been badly shocked.

953
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:09,131
Really?

954
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:11,133
-It seems that way.
-My goodness.

955
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,093
How shocking.

956
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:14,011
Which program are you in charge of?
