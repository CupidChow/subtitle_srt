1
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,268
Who are you
to tell my husband about our family?

2
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,062
You have no right.

3
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:06,316
I know he's your husband,
but he's also my son-in-law.

4
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,903
And Ji-a's not just your daughter.

5
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,781
She's my one and only granddaughter--

6
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,115
Did I have two dads then?

7
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,911
I only had one,

8
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,580
but you never let me
talk to him or see him.

9
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,498
Because of that,

10
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:27,837
I wasn't even able
to breathe properly around you.

11
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,422
Is that why

12
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,133
you made me look like a liar
to my husband?

13
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,177
I couldn't explain in detail.

14
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,845
You made me a liar.

15
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,390
-How--
-I said my parents got along well.

16
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,726
But a car accident took Dad's life.

17
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,605
I pretended to have come
from such a happy two-parent family.

18
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,441
You know how hard I worked
not to seem fazed

19
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,443
despite being raised by a single parent!

20
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,988
It's nothing to be proud of
or beneficial to me,

21
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,033
but you still told him
everything about our family.

22
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,494
He thought
loneliness was the only issue I had!

23
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:02,831
Actually, you don't have any issues.

24
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,917
Is that what you think?
Do I seem to have no issue?

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,293
Probably in your dreams.

26
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,337
You grew up well.

27
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,756
-You never broke my heart or--
-What a liar.

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,343
Just a second ago, you said
you couldn't breathe properly around me.

29
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,845
I'm aware

30
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,430
that I'm mean and abnormal.

31
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,058
-That's not true.
-He'll be put off by me.

32
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,894
He now knows
I've been wearing a mask for ten years.

33
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,647
-I'm sure he understands--
-Did you read what he's thinking?

34
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,900
He may not say so,
but that's how he'll feel.

35
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,986
But you've done so much for him.

36
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,028
You got that right.

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,742
All these years, I worked my butt off
to be a perfect wife and daughter-in-law.

38
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,454
But you ruined it. Why did you mess it up?

39
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,667
When will you stop ruining my world?

40
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,171
"What could she have learned
from a broken family?"

41
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,339
He'll wonder that for sure now.

42
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:55,884
If I was him, I would.

43
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,722
He must think I'm negative towards men
because of my dad's affair

44
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,976
and that I'm naggy and hysterical
because I was raised by a single mother.

45
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,229
I kept it all in
so that no one would see me that way.

46
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,441
If you were me,
wouldn't you be just as resentful?

47
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,196
All this because
your husband cheated on you?

48
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,448
Ending your marriage was enough.

49
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,658
Why tear me and Dad apart too?

50
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,328
You've always been selfish.

51
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,872
Only your feelings matter to you.

52
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:27,916
If you cared about others

53
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:32,003
and the pain it would cause me,
you wouldn't have done that.

54
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,964
-You know now that you're married, too.
-Know what?

55
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,759
Once you marry someone,

56
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:42,138
cheating becomes the one thing
you can't forgive.

57
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,265
-Can't you still understand me?
-Fine.

58
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,268
What Dad did was unforgivable.

59
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,020
But why did I have to suffer too?

60
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,940
I didn't force you two to marry.

61
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,568
You two fell in love and had me.

62
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,029
And he was still my dad.

63
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,822
We were connected by blood.

64
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,033
You could've divorced him,

65
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,702
but still let him be my dad.

66
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,582
Instead,

67
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,086
you'd whine in tears
about how your poor choice in men

68
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,130
made you a divorcée.

69
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,342
I was tired of it.

70
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,595
Dad adored me, you know.

71
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,223
He cherished me.

72
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,017
I know he cheated on you,

73
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,937
but how could you tear us apart?

74
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,357
How could you stop him
from seeing his only daughter?

75
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,485
He had rights, you know.

76
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,280
It's you he wronged, not me.

77
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,825
But you packed him a bag
and kicked him out.

78
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,743
You wouldn't understand,

79
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,623
since your parents lived long enough.

80
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,668
You can't even imagine.

81
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,421
Before my very eyes,

82
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,967
while walking towards me
with his arms open…

83
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,932
I won't forget it until the day I die.

84
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,736
Grandma defended you from time to time.

85
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,157
"You can tolerate the food you hate,
but not the person you loathe."

86
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,036
I understand
why you can't forgive your husband

87
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,371
who cheated on you.

88
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,459
Still, you shouldn't have kept
a father and daughter apart.

89
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,253
Having Ji-a and raising her
makes me feel that way even more.

90
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,050
My friends bragged about
their dads taking them on trips,

91
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,218
buying them cosmetics,

92
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,805
and treating them to delicious meals.

93
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,726
Imagine how I must have felt hearing that.

94
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,396
Instead of a dad I can brag about,

95
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,025
I had a dad I could never see again.

96
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,944
It kills me to think

97
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,949
that I can never hold
his warm hands again.

98
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,162
Have you ever apologized to Dad
for what you did?

99
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,332
Do you even feel sorry?

100
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,501
I'm sorry for telling him,

101
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,629
but Yu-sin's too sweet

102
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,423
to ever betray you like that. But--

103
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,384
You led Dad to his death!

104
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,886
You not only kicked him out,

105
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:30,390
but kept him from seeing
or talking to his own daughter.

106
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,892
That's why he came to see me at school

107
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,312
and died in an accident!

108
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,565
So what's with all the excuses again?

109
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,235
Are you saying that I'm wrong?

110
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,862
Fine! It's all my fault!

111
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,158
Your father did nothing wrong,

112
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,994
and I'm the only one to blame.

113
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,333
Fate decides who gets to live.

114
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,087
He died because it was his time to go!

115
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,854
I have nothing more to say.

116
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,023
Resent him until the day you die.

117
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,026
You did nothing wrong,

118
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,196
and Dad got what he deserved.

119
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,156
Happy now?

120
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,707
You'll never see Ji-a again.

121
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,002
Just like you took Dad from me,
she'll be taken from you too.

122
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,337
You have some nerve.

123
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,299
Even God disapproves of adulterers!

124
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:51,554
You'll never understand the sense
of betrayal unless you experience it.

125
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:56,976
The feeling of betrayal
that only gives you shudders.

126
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,358
Aren't you just as responsible?

127
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,069
Don't you think you drove him to that?

128
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,282
I acknowledge the fact
that he betrayed you.

129
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,867
But you're not entirely innocent.

130
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:21,209
Dad must have been fed up with you,
just like me.

131
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,377
What did you say?

132
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,629
As always,

133
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,673
just like this time,

134
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,135
you refuse to think of others
even at that age.

135
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:35,848
You married a man out of love
and elevated his social status,

136
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,060
but he had the audacity
to cheat on you with his secretary.

137
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,646
Of course, your blood boiled.

138
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,441
But has it ever crossed your mind
that you drove him away?

139
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,277
You look down on people

140
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,571
and consider yourself a queen.

141
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,324
-What?
-You were worse back in the day.

142
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:58,371
You used to constantly tell me
how people won't be grateful

143
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,708
but will try and cross the line
if you're too nice to them.

144
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,794
You always looked down on people.

145
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,963
How did you treat Dad?

146
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,215
Did you treat him with respect?

147
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,676
All I remember

148
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,720
is that he always had to walk
on eggshells around you.

149
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,765
You'd get annoyed
over such frivolous matters,

150
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:21,519
so he had to spend his time
trying to make you feel better.

151
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,813
Not even a kid should be that way.

152
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,566
Do you know what my colleagues say?

153
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,320
"Pretty faces only last a month.
Kindness matters more in the end."

154
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,614
Think in his shoes for once.

155
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,577
Think from his perspective.
You know, don't you?

156
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,162
I'm sure you do.

157
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,540
You just don't want to admit it.

158
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:47,211
Even I would be swayed
by a sweet, kindhearted secretary

159
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,381
if I had to come home to a difficult wife.

160
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,008
It's only natural.

161
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,801
People think alike.

162
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,262
-How dare you!
-Think about it.

163
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,556
If you had an abusive husband

164
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,893
and a sweet, kind and young man
showed interest, you'd be drawn to him.

165
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,562
It's only natural.

166
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,606
Rather than being a snob,

167
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,859
if you had respected Dad as your husband,

168
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,360
he wouldn't have…

169
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,238
We both know how earnest and kind he was.

170
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,949
He never would have cheated on you.

171
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,996
Even if someone coaxed him to betray you,
he wouldn't have broken your trust.

172
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,833
What about you then?
Is it me that you take after?

173
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,337
Is that why you're this heartless?

174
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,631
That must be it.

175
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,927
Forget how Dad must have felt then

176
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,388
and think about how your daughter

177
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,557
must have felt.

178
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,852
I wouldn't have the nerve
to ask to see Ji-a.

179
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,854
I'd stay away until summoned.

180
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,273
That's how guilty I'd be.

181
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,755
-Jae-yu!
-What's up?

182
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,177
I thought about it, U-ram.

183
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,304
-You saved up some money, right?
-Yes.

184
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,515
-How much?
-I haven't counted it yet.

185
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,433
Hundreds of thousands of won, right?

186
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,478
Buy your mom something pretty to wear.

187
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:32,358
You don't like how your mom looks old,
so it should make her look younger.

188
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,651
KOREAN LANGUAGE

189
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,279
Hyang-gi.

190
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,115
Did you knock?

191
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,408
It slipped my mind.

192
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,785
Let's buy something for Mom together.

193
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,578
But her birthday's far away.

194
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,956
And Dad will get her an anniversary gift.

195
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,667
Mom doesn't have much to wear.
She only wears pants.

196
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,129
-I hardly have any clothes myself.
-In that case, what are those?

197
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,381
Your closet's packed as well.

198
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,967
They're cheap clothes I bought online.

199
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,262
-How much did you save up?
-You?

200
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,556
I asked you first, so spill it.

201
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,391
Good night, both of you.

202
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,394
-You too, my daughter.
-Sure.

203
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,313
Turn the lights off before going to bed.
Don't read tonight.

204
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,314
Got it.

205
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,035
Can I get you anything?

206
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,662
I'm good.

207
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,083
I heard you went to my mother's place.

208
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,215
It's a painful memory for me,

209
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,093
so I didn't want to tell you details

210
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,345
about my family.

211
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,305
I understand.

212
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,601
And it made me think
how hard it must have been for you.

213
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,607
Do you resent your father?

214
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,817
If he hadn't cheated on my mom,

215
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,945
he wouldn't have died such a sudden death.

216
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,742
Rather than resenting him,
I just feel bad for him.

217
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,036
Try to forgive your mother
for what she did.

218
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,413
Everyone makes mistakes.

219
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,250
Besides, her actions were the result
of her denial rather than a mistake.

220
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:14,752
Well…

221
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,587
Yes?

222
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,131
I'm going to try,

223
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,510
but I'd like you
to turn a blind eye for a while.

224
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,929
Don't take Ji-a over there to see her.

225
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,972
Call me heartless all you want.

226
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,141
But I need more time.

227
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,643
If that's what you want.

228
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,772
All right.
Your well-being is my priority anyway.

229
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,440
Thanks.

230
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,943
I'm also sorry.

231
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,654
Yes, you should be sorry.

232
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,784
Am I not your husband?
Don't you trust me enough?

233
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,037
You shouldn't have any secrets from me.

234
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,456
It's just something

235
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,584
I have a hard time talking about.

236
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,881
I didn't have any siblings
to fill the void my dad left.

237
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,600
You have me, darling.

238
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,687
Cry whenever you want to.

239
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,939
But only in my arms.

240
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,403
What if I want to cry,
but you're not around?

241
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,446
Should I hold back my tears?

242
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,578
I'll come running to you,

243
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,913
so call me whenever you need me.

244
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,748
I need you often.

245
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,002
When the frame dropped the other day

246
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,880
and when the window screen came off.

247
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,759
I know. I'm your servant of love.

248
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,350
The one you'll forever be with

249
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,478
is neither your mom nor Ji-a.

250
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,147
It's me.

251
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,108
Let's age gracefully together.

252
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,757
I'll

253
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,843
fill the bathtub.

254
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,389
Okay with what?

255
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,518
When's the last time
we scrubbed each other's backs?

256
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,895
That's embarrassing.

257
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,648
Hold on, little lady.
We're married, you know.

258
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,775
Why should you be embarrassed?

259
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,652
You always decline.

260
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,446
-I need to select songs for the show.
-That's an excuse.

261
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,575
It isn't. Check the website.

262
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:53,661
Darling!

263
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,706
Yes?

264
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,458
How silly of me.

265
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,670
I bought your favorite citrus pound cake,
but I left it in the car.

266
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,588
Passenger's seat.

267
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,506
All right.

268
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,415
I love you as always.
Your devoted husband, Yu-sin.

269
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,049
Nice music.

270
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,721
May I have a glass of wine?

271
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,436
You're the best.

272
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,949
I can't contain my pounding heart.

273
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,869
Then don't drink it.

274
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,289
No, I don't mean the wine.

275
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,417
Just looking at you excites me.

276
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,758
Do you remember
the first time I kissed your forehead?

277
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,599
Aren't you cold? Get in here.

278
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,228
I'm not.
Why would it be cold in the bathroom?

279
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,984
Join me in the tub, my dear Sa Pi-young!

280
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,991
The name your father gave you proves

281
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,494
how romantic and witty he was.

282
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,335
Still, I'm more handsome
than he was, aren't I?

283
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,423
Why aren't you answering me?

284
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,845
The shirt's wet now, so just join me.

285
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:18,889
Close your eyes.

286
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,475
To throw your wine at me?

287
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:23,811
No.

288
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,940
Don't you dare disappoint me.

289
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,086
I'll spill the wine. Let me go.

290
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,630
I won't. I'm your husband.

291
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,424
Join me, Sa Pi-young!

292
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,512
My gosh!

293
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,354
Don't wait up for me.
I have piles of work to do.

294
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,577
ALARM, 6:30 A.M.

295
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,101
I'll take that sandwich.

296
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,489
I couldn't sleep knowing you'd be hungry.

297
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:11,079
-But you have work tomorrow.
-I only have one show to do.

298
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,375
Korea's probably the only country
with 24-hour open cafes.

299
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,293
True.

300
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,087
-What did you have for dinner?
-Soup and rice.

301
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,049
My poor lawyer husband.

302
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,177
Later. I'll eat it once I'm done.

303
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,181
Aren't you happy to see me?

304
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,058
Of course, I am.

305
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,519
You don't seem to be.

306
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,107
Will it kill you to lay off me for a day?

307
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,525
Of course.

308
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,704
You can review those at home.

309
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,749
I can't focus at home.
Besides, I need to revise these.

310
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,272
Should I wait outside on the couch?

311
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,151
Go home and go to bed. I'll wrap up soon.

312
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,959
You know you need your beauty sleep.

313
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,643
I brought you something.

314
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:04,985
It's an herbal pill.

315
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,531
Like Ji-a said,
this makes me look like a joke.

316
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,699
In what way?

317
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,952
What will people say
if they find out I take herbal medicine

318
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,913
when I have been a doctor for decades?

319
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,875
It's only an energy booster.

320
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,377
Take your time chewing that.

321
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,256
What if this leads to a prolonged life?

322
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,717
Of course, you should live long.

323
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,261
You're the only one I have.

324
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,597
Don't be silly. You have Yu-sin

325
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,849
and sweet Pi-young--

326
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,058
Of course,

327
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,187
they're my family whom I love.

328
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,065
But you're more than just family.

329
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,447
All my friends,

330
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,408
although only half of them
are still alive,

331
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,412
reckon I saved the world in my past life.

332
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:01,750
Didn't Vice Chairman Hwang
marry a woman who's 42 years old?

333
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,252
Who cares
if she's 40 years old or 30 years old?

334
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,088
No one comes close to you.

335
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,348
Dong-mi.

336
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,558
Yes?

337
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:23,647
Are you sure you won't resent me
for living a long life?

338
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,441
I will if you leave me behind.

339
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,985
I'll hold onto you forever.

340
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,656
All right.

341
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:36,868
These days,
I feel like I can make it to 100 years.

342
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,704
Really?

343
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,792
Yes, I feel great, thanks to you.

344
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,007
No, let me.

345
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:54,261
But I'm not aching anywhere.

346
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,972
Come on.
You'll feel lighter once I'm done.

347
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,477
Let's not forget
the rule of give and take.

348
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,232
You have so much
love and affection to share, Doctor.

349
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,653
When will you stop calling me "Doctor"?

350
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,657
Maybe I won't until I die.

351
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,836
Want some warm milk?

352
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,592
Would you like to tell the kids?

353
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,472
Or should I?

354
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,312
Are you serious about this?

355
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,274
You've fallen ill, haven't you?

356
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,610
You can be honest with me. I'm your wife.

357
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,612
I told you that's not the case.

358
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,289
Was there an incident?

359
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,334
Is someone accusing you
of sexual harassment

360
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,835
when it was an accident?

361
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,962
Is it about money?

362
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,049
Will your name be dragged through the mud?

363
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,760
No and no.

364
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,596
Like I said, we've been married
for too long. That's enough.

365
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,059
"Enough"?

366
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,895
"Too long"?

367
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,694
What about other old couples then?

368
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,571
You really want to end this?

369
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:40,200
I'll tell the kids myself
and draw up the papers.

370
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:41,993
Divorce papers?

371
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,346
Is this what I devoted my life to?

372
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,890
I endured our tough marriage

373
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,185
just to be tossed aside like this.

374
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,609
What about the pain
our kids will go through?

375
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,574
Let's just be separated then.

376
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:22,992
No divorce.

377
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,414
Si-eun, this isn't like you.

378
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,207
You're never clingy.

379
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,751
I wouldn't be
if this only involved us two.

380
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:36,214
We can't shock our children.
They're going through a sensitive period.

381
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,298
In other countries…

382
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,386
Even in Korea,
many parents get divorced these days.

383
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:45,765
While some kids from two-parent households
end up causing trouble,

384
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,727
others raised
by a single parent still lead model lives.

385
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,019
You're having an affair.

386
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,523
That's the only explanation.

387
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,109
-That's not it.
-Then convince me.

388
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,487
Make me understand,
and I'll sign the papers.

389
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,992
To be honest,

390
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,290
I hate the smell of your patches.
I don't want to smell them anymore.

391
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:15,128
Typing for decades
and managing all the housework by yourself

392
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,005
led to weakened wrists.

393
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,301
Seeing medicated patches
on your wrists and fingers

394
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,805
and smelling them even in bed

395
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:30,810
reminds me
what an incompetent husband I am.

396
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,023
If you didn't marry me,

397
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,693
you would have aged more beautifully.

398
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,363
I can finally see that.

399
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:47,118
I should have realized
before dragging you into the pit I'm in.

400
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,039
I wish to be free from the guilt now.
It's exhausting.

401
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,376
This is how pathetic I am.

402
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,255
This is all I can give.

403
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,968
I didn't want to say this

404
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,679
since I knew it will hurt you.

405
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,851
I won't take anything.

406
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:16,105
Your hard work and tears
are what paid for this house.

407
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:20,068
My salary is only enough
to pay the kids' tuition anyway.

408
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:25,365
You've never been able to carry
a designer bag like everyone else.

409
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,283
When have I ever wanted that?

410
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:31,454
You only wore cheap clothes
you bought on the streets and worked hard.

411
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:37,293
That way, you bought a house
in Gangnam with the money you saved.

412
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,922
I'm only human, and I'm a man.

413
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,385
Continuing this marriage
while feeling guilty

414
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:50,515
has now become too much of a burden
that I wish to escape from.

415
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,058
It's exhausting.

416
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:57,438
I've always thought
that you must have wanted

417
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,984
to wear pretty clothes
and shoes just like other women.

418
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,319
You're tired all the time

419
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,281
from your job and all the housework,

420
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,325
and I haven't seen you smile
in a long time.

421
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,203
You only smile at the kids.

422
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,291
This isn't resentment.

423
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,334
Unless I win the lottery,

424
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,422
I don't have what it takes
to provide a good life for you.

425
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,219
I'm sorry.

426
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,267
I'm so sorry.

427
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,047
All right.

428
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,716
Draw up the papers.

429
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,970
It's best if the kids hear it from me.

430
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,339
Good morning, my son.

431
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:49,300
-Can I wash my hair?
-Sure.

432
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,887
If Hyang-gi gets up,
tell her to use the master bathroom.

433
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:54,389
Got it.

434
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,796
-Where's Si-eun?
-I thought she was with you.

435
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,049
She left while I stayed back for a while.

436
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,217
-I'll try calling her.
-She's not answering.

437
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,844
-Did the call go through?
-Yes.

438
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,097
She wouldn't have left
without saying anything.

439
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,099
Didn't she seem gloomier than usual?

440
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,770
-Maybe they didn't make up last night.
-That must be it.

441
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,651
First floor. The doors are closing.

442
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,694
Going down.

443
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,739
Is Dr. Shin still just as fit
with no belly fat?

444
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,366
-Yes.
-You need to be on your toes.

445
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,410
He's so handsome.

446
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,329
The patients and nurses
might flirt with him.

447
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,580
My husband…

448
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,877
-Go ahead.
-He's only sweet at home with me and Ji-a.

449
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,880
At the hospital,
he's known to be as scary as a tiger.

450
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,173
How nice.

451
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,509
Isn't your husband like that too?

452
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,844
My husband's too sweet and innocent.

453
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,888
He's just soft-hearted and kind.

454
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,390
That's what made me want to marry him,

455
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,976
but now I want something more.

456
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,728
In what way?

457
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,814
-I wish…
-First floor.

458
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,398
He was more masculine.

459
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,570
Were you still here?

460
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,697
-Have you seen Ms. Lee?
-I haven't.

461
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:26,499
SIN CENTRAL MEDICAL CENTER

462
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,299
Thank you.

463
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:52,775
Yes?

464
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,113
Not today. I have other plans.

465
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:00,616
Sure.

466
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:20,887
Hello?

467
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:24,765
How?

468
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:27,727
Do you have a fever?

469
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,021
Did you eat anything?

470
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,401
Don't eat, and sweat it out.

471
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,444
I'll stop by later.

472
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:38,779
Sure.

473
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:51,918
All right.

474
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,630
Ma'am!

475
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,424
Aren't you buying beets today?

476
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,261
-Ta-da!
-My gosh.

477
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,264
What are you doing here?

478
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:09,185
I've been craving
Sa Pi-young's beet salad.

479
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,899
-All right.
-Really?

480
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,109
You could have just texted me.

481
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:20,196
-You came here to buy the ingredients?
-Yes.

482
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,831
Be honest with me. What's going on?

483
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,168
We haven't shopped together for a while,

484
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,795
and I know you shop here.

485
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,674
-What if our paths didn't cross?
-I believed in my hunch.

486
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,550
I had a feeling we'd meet.

487
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,471
Aren't you happy to see me?

488
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:47,974
I am.

489
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,061
I almost didn't come
since you had other plans.

490
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,646
-Was it canceled?
-No.

491
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,648
This was what I had planned all along.

492
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,572
-Did you buy everything?
-Except for meat.

493
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,869
Your daughter's favorite,
or your husband's ultimate favorite?

494
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,539
My husband's ultimate favorite.

495
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,376
Off we go!

496
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,337
Welcome.

497
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,506
One kilogram each of steak and roast beef.

498
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:24,010
I'm afraid it will take 20 minutes
to bring you fresh cuts.

499
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,721
If you could come back later…

500
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,638
Sure thing.

501
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:36,439
Can you buy me some spicy rice cakes
for running all the way here?

502
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,400
I saw it earlier and it looked good.

503
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,073
It's good.

504
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,993
-Isn't it?
-Yes.

505
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,454
It tastes better
because you're having it with me.

506
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,331
Tell me about it.

507
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,128
-How was the random date?
-I want you to do it often.

508
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,173
But my dear husband's too busy.

509
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,927
I'll try.

510
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,809
All right. Have some soup.

511
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,020
Here you go.

512
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:22,985
Here.

513
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,409
-Isn't this happiness?
-It's more than that.

514
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,620
Husbands like me are rare.

515
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,705
I know.

516
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,375
And there's no wife like you

517
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,002
in the universe.

518
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:42,713
Do you mean that?

519
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:44,715
I do.

520
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,513
I love you.

521
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,485
People are watching!

522
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:08,322
Who cares? Young couples are way worse.
We're young ourselves though.

523
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:16,872
All right.

524
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,921
-I'll see you soon.
-Sure thing.

525
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,278
-Good evening.
-Bye!

526
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,780
-Bye.
-You did great today.

527
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,490
-Bye.
-See you.

528
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,117
Bye, U-ram.

529
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,870
-Ta-da!
-What's up?

530
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,746
Mom told me to kidnap you.

531
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,723
HUSBAND

532
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:24,231
I'm sorry,
but my friend's father passed away today.

533
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,150
I'll be stopping by the funeral.

534
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,902
Got it.

535
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,949
I'll expect my meat when I get home.

536
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,159
Sure thing.

537
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,874
Mom, when did you get here?

538
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,125
About ten minutes ago.

539
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,170
-You must be hungry.
-Yes.

540
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:49,006
Mind your manners,
or it will become a habit.

541
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,509
-You're just as bad sometimes.
-Don't be cheeky.

542
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,720
-Try to be genteel always.
-What does "genteel" mean?

543
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,722
To be polite and refined.

544
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,684
Can I order anything I want?

545
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,311
Sure.

546
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,687
Is Dad running late?

547
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,148
It will be just us today.

548
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,175
Is it a great day today?

549
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:38,138
-Here, Mom.
-You'd better divide that fairly.

550
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,099
But it will get mushed.

551
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,684
Share it among you two.

552
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,484
But it's good.

553
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,861
Mom, have a bite.

554
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,322
We women always leave room for dessert.

555
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,207
MOM TOOK US TO A RESTAURANT!
JOIN US NEXT TIME, DAD

556
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,919
-Dad hasn't checked the photo yet.
-He must be busy.

557
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,754
Listen while you eat.

558
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,800
Your dad and I

559
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,848
have been together for too long,
so we decided to live apart for a while.

560
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,768
We met in our high school senior year.

561
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,271
It's been 31 years already.

562
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,984
Living together for three decades

563
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,945
is rare among couples these days.

564
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:39,908
We'll be separated for most of the time,
but we'll meet up once in a while.

565
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,536
Maybe on weekends,

566
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,914
we'll get together for dinner like this.

567
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,250
What are you saying?

568
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,795
It's just as you heard.

569
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:55,174
Your father can easily move out anyway.

570
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:58,802
But you never know.

571
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,098
We could be back together next year.

572
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,603
Anyway,
that's what we decided to do for now.

573
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,774
I hope you'll understand.

574
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,445
People die,

575
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:20,199
and some end up getting injured
in random accidents.

576
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,662
Compared to that,
this really isn't a big deal. Right?

577
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,290
Living apart

578
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:31,627
might even teach us
how precious our family is

579
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,337
and strengthen our relationship.

580
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,133
Your dad seems to be stressed out,

581
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,886
so let's let him take a break.

582
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:46,100
-Did he say it's tough living with us?
-It's his job that's drained him.

583
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:50,104
Teaching students isn't all that he does.

584
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,690
There are other tasks he's expected to do.

585
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,651
He has it easier than you, though.

586
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,946
I'm a freelancer,
so it's different for me.

587
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,823
But he doesn't do chores around the house.

588
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,367
There are different ways of life.

589
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,287
Look at you, for example.
You're retaking the CSAT

590
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,707
despite being accepted
as a Theater and Film major.

591
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,209
We respected your wishes, remember?

592
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,836
How is this the same?

593
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,924
You're not getting a divorce, are you?

594
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,807
You are?

595
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,812
Only on paper.

596
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,274
This isn't happening.

597
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:40,446
Grown-ups have complicated lives, you see.

598
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:46,785
You've each put your dad and me
through the wringer too.

599
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:47,870
Right?

600
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,205
This time, it's our turn.

601
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,375
Think of it

602
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,336
as us briefly giving you a hard time.

603
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,297
You didn't do anything wrong though.

604
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,550
This isn't about one being at fault.

605
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,804
We've just been together for too long.
But we're not fed up with one another.

606
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,725
As you know, we barely even argue.

607
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,981
We just want to live
a different life from now on.

608
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:23,238
I'm sorry to ask this in front of U-ram,

609
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:25,991
but is he seeing someone?

610
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:29,119
No, there's no chance in hell.

611
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:30,788
Trust me on that.

612
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:36,043
Just like women experiencing menopause,

613
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:39,880
men also go through
what's called a midlife crisis.

614
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:44,009
So let us try and be understanding.

615
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:48,055
He's your dad
who devoted his life to this family.

616
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,325
Anyway, let's eat.

617
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,412
It will be easier on me anyway

618
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,957
to only have my two puppies
to take care of.

619
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,875
Is that what you truly think?

620
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,252
Of course.

621
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,755
I'm sorry to say this about your dad,

622
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,132
but I feel liberated.

623
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,989
MOTHER-IN-LAW

624
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:55,664
Yes, Mother.

625
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,165
Where are you?

626
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:00,127
-Home?
-No, not yet.

627
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,757
My friends gather
in different cities each time.

628
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:09,428
-Was it in Seoul this time?
-Yes.

629
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,847
Does Sa-hyeon still come home late?

630
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,266
I thought changing firms
meant more free time.

631
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,935
He works out after work
to lose his belly fat.

632
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:20,564
What belly fat?
He couldn't look better in his suit.

633
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,609
If he doesn't work out,
he'll turn fat in no time.

634
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,486
He's not a public figure like you.

635
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,280
Are you forcing him to do it?

636
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:31,241
I only made a suggestion
for your son's health.

637
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,285
A few more hours of sleep is better.

638
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,203
His former law firm
kept him working nonstop.

639
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:39,041
Exactly. Working out
has improved his health lately.

640
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,001
Speaking of which,

641
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:44,838
why don't you guys reconsider things?

642
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:47,507
While he's in his best condition,
have two…

643
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,469
No, just have one.

644
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,221
You'll hit 40 before you know it,

645
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:56,516
which will be too late.
Now's the perfect time.

646
00:48:57,142 --> 00:49:00,270
You know where we stand.
That's what we decided before marrying.

647
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,397
That's what you decided, isn't it?

648
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,817
My boy never said anything
about not wanting kids.

649
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:07,694
In middle school,

650
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:11,406
he said he wanted
two sons and two daughters.

651
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,408
That's too cruel on the kids.

652
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,620
How? You can provide a good life for them.

653
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:17,537
They say

654
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,706
that the mom's intel,
the dad's indifference,

655
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,668
and the grandfather's wealth
are what get kids into university.

656
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,253
You're smart, and so is your husband.

657
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,714
Your child will have
a rich grandfather. It's perfect.

658
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,841
It all comes down to you.

659
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:36,515
It could be a boy or a girl,
but I would prefer a boy.

660
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:40,018
-Who will take over the golf club?
-Byeol-hui and Hae-ri, of course.

661
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,854
Where's your ambition?

662
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,564
Once Byeol-hui and Hae-ri marry,

663
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,776
everything my husband reaped
will be handed to another family.

664
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:48,860
Here you go.

665
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,072
Don't disregard what I said,
and think about it.

666
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,157
Your father-in-law
sighs from time to time.

667
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:58,328
You know how fond he is
of your husband for being the youngest.

668
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,956
Wouldn't he be thrilled
to hold his own grandchild?

669
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:05,752
He might even let you
and your child have everything he has.

670
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,880
-You know what he's like.
-Of course.

671
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,467
Besides, your elders know best.

672
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,261
What conception dream did he have?

673
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,406
Hello?

674
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,658
-It's me.
-Hey, Mom.

675
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,702
I'm leaving without seeing you.

676
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,336
Dong-mi, here you go.

677
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:52,716
Dong-mi!

678
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,433
I wonder

679
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,772
how well the real Dong-mi is doing.

680
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:15,864
Dong-mi!

681
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,367
-Dong-mi?
-Coming!

682
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,831
It's been a while since we danced.

683
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,668
Why don't we go on a cruise?

684
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,796
We definitely have
the dancing skills for it.

685
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:32,798
Sounds good.

686
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,384
Won't a cruise be exhausting, though?

687
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,178
Of course not.

688
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,721
All right.

689
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,559
Wouldn't it be nicer

690
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,354
to go with Yu-sin and his family too?

691
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:49,815
Yu-sin could make time,

692
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,943
but Pi-young can't take time off
from work that easily.

693
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:57,197
Then why don't we just take
Yu-sin and Ji-a?

694
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,414
I told the kids.

695
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,842
-What did Hyang-gi say?
-Not much.

696
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:20,929
Then, I'll move out this weekend.

697
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:28,478
Were you that desperate
to get away from me and the kids?

698
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:32,023
-No.
-Then what?

699
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:34,359
I've been living on eggshells.

700
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,180
Will I be able to make
perfect egg rolls like you when I grow up?

701
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,891
I'm sure yours will be even better.

702
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,438
-I must be getting old.
-How so?

703
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,274
I'm growing fond of this grass.

704
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,614
It's not that you're getting old.

705
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,741
It's because
your mom is an excellent cook.

706
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:26,786
-I don't like other people's salad.
-Starting with the dressing!

707
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,246
-Right, Dad?
-Yes.

708
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,208
I'm already in a good mood
thanks to you guys.

709
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:35,837
Thanks to the delicious breakfast,
Dad and I feel energetic.

710
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:42,928
Dad, I'm taking English classes again
starting today.

711
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:45,889
-Is the teacher male or female?
-Female.

712
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,391
I'll probably be asked
to introduce myself.

713
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,310
Don't get the jitters.

714
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,270
I won't.

715
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,911
-The ratings are up.
-Thanks to you.

716
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,996
No, it's all thanks to you and Ms. Lee.

717
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,207
It's a good collaboration.

718
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:15,293
Ms. Boo fits in better
than I expected too.

719
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:17,963
Ms. Lee is a veteran in this industry.

720
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,257
That's why everyone
wants to work with her.

721
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,767
-Good job, everyone.
-Good job.

722
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:31,685
Good job.

723
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,562
-Good job.
-Thanks.

724
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,790
Did you remove all of your hair pins?

725
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,335
-Yes.
-Those aren't dentures, right?

726
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,380
We'll go from A to B.

727
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:09,848
READ TWO OR THREE STORIES
SEND OUT MOBILE COFFEE VOUCHERS

728
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,402
Ms. Lee, did my advice work?

729
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,241
What did I leave behind?

730
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,577
-At the studio?
-Yes.

731
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,830
What a joke he is.

732
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,458
"You dropped something."

733
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,626
"Drop what?" "Your beauty."

734
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,380
-Is that from Choi Min?
-Yes.

735
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,675
He must be insane.

736
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,136
Is he flirting with you?
He must know you're married.

737
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,931
-You're not close enough to make jokes.
-Exactly.

738
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,100
What does he take me for?

739
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,229
I guess marriage isn't a deal-breaker
for those who are beautiful.

740
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,231
As if you're not pretty yourself.

741
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,194
CHOI MIN

742
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:06,654
-He says I dropped my lip gloss.
-I knew it.

743
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:08,615
Sexual harassment isn't a joke, you know.

744
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,995
Did you and your husband talk things out?

745
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:16,915
He wants a divorce.

746
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,544
And I agreed.

747
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,429
What do you want to be when you grow up?

748
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,347
Someone who keeps promises.

749
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:16,433
Someone loyal.

750
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:19,310
I meant what kind of a job you want.

751
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,188
-Ji-a.
-Yes?

752
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:26,025
Even if I become poor and pathetic,

753
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,154
will you still be my friend?

754
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:31,781
Once a friend, always a friend.

755
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,825
As long as we don't fight.

756
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:36,202
We can still be friends even if we argue.

757
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:48,131
I'm too distracted
to hit the ball straight.

758
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,717
-Same here.
-It doesn't make sense, does it?

759
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:59,392
Professor Park is still in his prime.

760
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,145
Maybe a female student
has been seeking his attention.

761
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,898
A lot of women fall for their teachers.

762
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,650
My first love was my English teacher too.

763
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,569
But that will show.

764
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,863
You can't hide it
from someone you live with.

765
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,281
Women can sense these things.

766
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:18,161
He must no longer feel
attracted to Si-eun.

767
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,289
But can it be the reason
to want a divorce?

768
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:25,168
I told her numerous times to doll up.

769
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:30,757
You're right. Just between you and me,
she is a little too dowdy.

770
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,261
Couldn't you talk to Professor Park?

771
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,472
You've had dinner with him several times.

772
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,849
That doesn't give me the right to meddle.

773
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,434
It will seem disrespectful.

774
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,938
No one has been as hard-working as her.

775
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,565
And she has never spent
good money on herself.

776
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:51,402
You don't necessarily need money
to make yourself presentable.

777
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,238
You're one to talk.

778
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,281
I have cheap clothes too.

779
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,909
-From Rodeo Street.
-As if they're actually cheap.

780
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,871
If I were Hyang-gi, I'd throw a fit.

781
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,665
The kids are sweet just like their mom.

782
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,459
Professor Park is a gentleman too.

783
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,294
What kind of gentleman does that?

784
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,422
Well, a gentleman shouldn't abandon
his devoted wife.

785
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:24,686
Where are you visiting?

786
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,188
Building 105, Unit 501.

787
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,649
I'm Ji-a's grandmother.

788
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,734
Dr. Shin's place?

789
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:33,778
That's right.

790
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,960
Can I come in?

791
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:40,053
Yu-sin must still be out.

792
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:46,059
Where's Ji-a?

793
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,312
Could you call her out?

794
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:53,733
I brought a few things for her
from the Philippines.

795
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:59,656
-Ji-a?
-She went swimming with her dad.

796
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:07,747
You've always believed
that people couldn't be fixed,

797
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:10,375
but you still came here
despite my warning.

798
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:12,293
It's not like

799
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:15,546
I have many years to live.

800
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,049
I understand how you feel,

801
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:21,219
but I'm sure Ji-a misses me
every now and again.

802
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:22,845
It's not like you bonded.

803
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,181
Whether I see her often or not,

804
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:28,309
you can't deny our familial bond.

805
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:31,145
Her paternal grandparents
couldn't dote on her more.

806
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:33,272
But…

807
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,902
she's not her real grandmother
to be exact.

808
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:41,906
They may not be related by blood,
but she adores Ji-a.

809
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:50,665
Only one of my friends got divorced.
Because of an affair like you.

810
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,877
She wanted to keep their son away
from her husband like you did,

811
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:57,797
but I told her not to sever that kinship.

812
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,091
Mothers can never replace fathers.

813
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:04,345
There's a special relationship
between a child and their mother.

814
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:07,473
It's different from the bond
shared with a father.

815
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:08,599
Don't you get that?

816
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,104
I feel lucky

817
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,857
to have been born in Korea.

818
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,317
Parents sleep with their newborns.

819
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:23,740
After spending months
in a mother's soft, warm womb,

820
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:26,826
babies are forced into a cold world.

821
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,955
Imagine a newborn
sleeping alone in an empty room

822
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:34,792
where no warmth or love can be felt.

823
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:37,336
How would it feel?

824
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:40,089
It might be in panic.

825
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:43,968
Even grown-ups wither in loneliness,

826
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:47,430
so what would it be like
for babies who miss being caressed?

827
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:51,267
That's how I felt whenever I missed Dad.

828
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:54,645
It may sound like I've overcome it,
but I haven't.

829
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:57,356
I'll miss him until the day I die.

830
01:02:58,441 --> 01:02:59,442
And then some.

831
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:05,323
Daughters watch
how their mothers treat their fathers

832
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:09,827
and learn what it is to be a wife
and what to look for in a man.

833
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:12,955
Meanwhile, sons learn how to be
a real man through their fathers.

834
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,291
What gives you the right

835
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:19,086
to only think of your revenge
and neglect your child?

836
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,965
We require two kinds of nutrients.

837
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:25,551
The kind we get from food

838
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,304
and the kind we receive from love.

839
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,891
I could have been fully loved,

840
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,853
but you snatched it away from me.

841
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:40,024
You ignored my opinions and my needs.

842
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:43,861
That loss of love hurts
more than you can imagine.

843
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:48,199
Were you happy since Dad left us?

844
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:52,453
If you had been,
you wouldn't have sighed in my presence

845
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,082
or drowned yourself in alcohol
from time to time.

846
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:59,418
You suffered from the loss of a husband

847
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:01,754
and I from the loss of a father.

848
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:06,008
Dad didn't want to get a divorce.
He never let you divorce him.

849
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,177
Because he'd have to step down as CEO.

850
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:11,764
With his qualifications,
he would have easily found another job.

851
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,185
You're not one to change.

852
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:20,648
Dad wanted full custody of me.

853
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:23,442
But due to your stubbornness,

854
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:26,070
he asked you to let him see me
once every two weeks.

855
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:28,239
I heard you two talking
in the living room.

856
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:30,783
You wouldn't agree to even once a month

857
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,786
or a few times a year.

858
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:35,830
Dad cried.

859
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,877
I would have let him, you know.

860
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,462
It's not like he killed your parents.

861
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,089
In some ways,

862
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,759
he was just as cruel as a killer.

863
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,928
What he did might be even worse.

864
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,473
You have to be cheated on to realize that.

865
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,559
So you want me to experience it myself?

866
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,228
Just so that

867
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,439
I can understand you--

868
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:02,899
Don't be absurd!

869
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,110
Do you want respect

870
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:08,863
from your successful son-in-law?

871
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,495
I think of you
whenever Ji-a does something nice.

872
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:19,040
If only you had sucked it up

873
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:22,209
and forgiven Dad just that once,

874
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:28,049
I would have been able
to proudly walk down the aisle with him.

875
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:33,471
Watching Ji-a grow up
would have brought me more joy.

876
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,099
A generation gap is too wide to cross,

877
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:39,602
but you still miss your granddaughter.

878
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:41,896
So a father and his child?

879
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:45,274
How would it have been for Dad?

880
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:47,818
Have you thought about it?

881
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:51,072
I'm not blindly taking his side.

882
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:54,408
I would have called him out
on what he did after growing up,

883
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,035
telling him he made a mistake

884
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:59,080
and he should make up for it
for the rest of his life.

885
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:03,960
In the end, all it brought us was pain.

886
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:07,546
You never met a nice man to marry.

887
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:12,426
Don't you dare say
that you didn't remarry for my sake.

888
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,679
I know you dated the golf coach.

889
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:17,181
I know you paid him too.

890
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:20,601
Even though happiness has come to me,

891
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,437
I can't fully enjoy it.

892
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:27,483
Yu-sin says
that I seem sad once in a while.

893
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:31,362
I just deny it

894
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,489
saying that I'm happy.

895
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:37,743
Have you ever regretted it?

896
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:44,458
You have no idea

897
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:48,295
how much love I had for your father.

898
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:51,757
That's why I could never forgive him.

899
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:53,592
Even now?

900
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:55,761
Even now.

901
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,017
Whenever I miss Ji-a,

902
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:05,813
whenever I worry about you
wondering how you're doing,

903
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,025
I resent him even more.

904
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:32,817
Nicely done. You'll get a hole-in-one.

905
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,194
I'll count on you
getting a hold in one today.

906
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:44,036
-What on Earth?
-Did you see that?

907
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,663
-Come here.
-Eighty yards.

908
01:08:45,746 --> 01:08:47,832
-Did you see that?
-No way.

909
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,041
There.

910
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,335
That's your ball right there.

911
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:54,213
Are you kidding me? How am I this good?

912
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,424
-This can't be true.
-You have a knack for sports.

913
01:08:57,508 --> 01:09:00,719
That's absurd.
I've never been known to be athletic.

914
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:06,475
You should be worried.

915
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,563
-About what?
-A lot of guys hit on me.

916
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,898
-How?
-Some send me texts.

917
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:15,025
Saying what?

918
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,570
They're letting me know
that they're interested.

919
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:18,946
Does it feel good?

920
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:22,908
Is that all you have to say?
Aren't you jealous?

921
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:26,036
Not when I don't know who they are.
Who's hitting on you?

922
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,038
It's nothing serious.

923
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:29,790
I ignore them all.

924
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:33,794
It's too loud.

925
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,721
Remember the writer of my show
who's way older than me?

926
01:09:43,804 --> 01:09:45,222
She might get a divorce.

927
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:49,351
-Why?
-Can't you focus on what I'm saying?

928
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:58,235
Her professor husband asked for a divorce.

929
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:01,197
He didn't cheat on her. He just thinks
they lived together long enough.

930
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,656
What do you think?

931
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:04,658
I'm not sure.

932
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:08,037
-Do you understand him as a man?
-I'll need to hear from both sides.

933
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:11,957
Objectively speaking,
my colleague is the issue.

934
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:13,751
Her personality?

935
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:15,377
No, her sex drive.

936
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:18,172
-What?
-I'm kidding.

937
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:22,051
It's great that she works hard,
but she rarely dolls herself up.

938
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,428
Because she's busy.

939
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:27,348
I'm busy too, you know.
I even host a home shopping show.

940
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:30,267
I also shoot commercials
and lend my voice sometimes.

941
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:33,312
Despite being busy,
I always manage to look decent.

942
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:35,397
You dress casually at home.

943
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:38,275
That may be true, but I don't wear

944
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:41,695
men's boxers or worn-out t-shirts
like a lot of other women do.

945
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:45,866
Besides, I'm still young,
which means I look good in anything.

946
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,493
But she's 50.

947
01:10:47,993 --> 01:10:50,496
She's 50 years old,
but she doesn't even wear makeup.

948
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,456
That's how she comes to work.

949
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,875
She always wears the same clothes too.

950
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:57,253
No wonder her husband's fed up with her.

951
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:01,006
-I feel bad for the kids.
-They have two, right?

952
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,592
Yes. Can you imagine how hurt they'll be?

953
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:07,304
Their son is in fifth grade
and a classmate of Ms. Sa's daughter.

954
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:11,016
Shouldn't a professor explain things
logically and solve the issue?

955
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,018
Asking for a divorce
after all these years?

956
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,229
What about his wife's life?

957
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:21,819
It's my mom.

958
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:28,909
I hope I didn't wake you up.

959
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:31,620
I wouldn't sleep this early.
It's only 10 p.m. here.

960
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:34,790
Did you catch a cold?

961
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:37,960
No, it's morning here,
so my voice hasn't warmed up yet.

962
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:39,670
How has my son-in-law been doing?

963
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:42,381
Good, of course. I even give him facials.

964
01:11:55,936 --> 01:11:58,105
Sure thing, Mom. Take care.

965
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:18,917
RECENT CALLS

966
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:22,546
MY WIFE, PROSECUTOR KIM, BROTHER

967
01:12:36,977 --> 01:12:37,895
Mom.

968
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,147
I'll get a divorce.

969
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,232
What are you talking about?

970
01:12:43,984 --> 01:12:47,029
-Please persuade Dad for me.
-Are you out of your mind?

971
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:52,785
They both left early today.

972
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:57,373
To golf?

973
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:59,083
No, to Busan.

974
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:00,876
They have a wedding to attend.

975
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:03,420
I see.

976
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:05,506
Didn't you call them?

977
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:08,050
I thought they'd be home on the weekend.

978
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:13,305
-Did you come alone?
-Yes.

979
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:19,436
You're Nam Ga-bin, right?

980
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:23,816
Gosh. I'm a fan!

981
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,025
Can I get your autograph?

982
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,948
-What's your name?
-It's Jung Su-gil.

983
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:36,954
I WISH YOU GOOD HEALTH!

984
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:43,877
Could I perhaps take a photo with me?

985
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:46,880
-I'm sorry, but no.
-But I'm a fan.

986
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:50,843
I don't have any makeup on
and I don't want to be seen this way.

987
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,302
But you look even better.

988
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:55,055
I'm really sorry.

989
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:56,098
Come on.

990
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:59,476
All right. One, two…

991
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:08,527
What a snob.

992
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,737
Will taking a photo hurt you?

993
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:13,740
You recognized me with this mask.

994
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:15,951
What's so bad about that?

995
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:19,746
You're hardly a top celebrity,
so be grateful that I recognized you.

996
01:14:20,497 --> 01:14:22,791
Don't force someone against their will.

997
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:25,878
-Stay out of it.
-Who do you think you are anyway?

998
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:28,589
Musical actors are human, too.

999
01:14:28,672 --> 01:14:30,841
They have a right to privacy, you know.

1000
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:32,843
Do you want to fight with me?

1001
01:14:32,926 --> 01:14:34,803
How dare you?

1002
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:39,683
Leave.

1003
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:41,768
Someone might film this.

1004
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:56,408
Talk about a bad day.

1005
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:05,626
Consider me a hater now!

1006
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,099
Thank you.

1007
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,184
Don't mention it.

1008
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:24,019
This happens from time to time.

1009
01:15:24,102 --> 01:15:26,605
I saw you in Natasha.

1010
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:27,814
I see.

1011
01:15:28,398 --> 01:15:29,942
It's a bit crowded here,

1012
01:15:30,734 --> 01:15:33,987
so why don't we go someplace else?
It will be on me.

1013
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:38,450
-It doesn't matter who's buying.
-I'll be honored.

1014
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,832
Did you both drive here?

1015
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:46,917
-Yes.
-Yes.

1016
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:55,008
I was craving grilled meat,
and that place serves single portions.

1017
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:57,135
I know. I was there to get my fill too.

1018
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:58,929
Same here.

1019
01:15:59,846 --> 01:16:03,016
I've spent a long time overseas,
so I didn't recognize you.

1020
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,852
I actually prefer it that way
when I'm offstage.

1021
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:07,104
Especially in this state.

1022
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:09,106
You still look great, though.

1023
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:12,067
That jerk fan had
every reason to recognize you.

1024
01:16:13,193 --> 01:16:15,195
Thank you for your help today.

1025
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:16,905
Anyone would have done the same.

1026
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:19,408
People rarely stand up
for others these days.

1027
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:21,785
Individualism is more widespread, I guess.

1028
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:42,658
I thought you'd be late.

1029
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:00,133
Explain.

1030
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:35,377
He came because he missed my food.

1031
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,087
-How do you know?
-Want to make a bet?

1032
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:39,548
You shouldn't expect anything
from your child.

1033
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:40,841
Not every child is like that.

1034
01:18:40,924 --> 01:18:42,259
-Do you love her?
-Yes.

1035
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:43,677
Stop talking nonsense!

1036
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,805
You're so stylish, Mother.

1037
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,849
Are you Kim Dong-mi by any chance?

1038
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:52,144
"Dong-mi"?

1039
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:54,646
On one condition.
I want to see her in person.

1040
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:57,149
-My name's Nam Ga-bin.
-I'm A-mi.

1041
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:59,276
-I'm Song Won.
-Your names are so pretty.

1042
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:02,237
Even if we go broke and have to starve,

1043
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,156
we'll never turn our backs on you.

1044
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:06,616
-You dyed your hair, right?
-I got him a wig.

1045
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:10,036
-I knew it.
-Did you two used to date?

1046
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:25,677
