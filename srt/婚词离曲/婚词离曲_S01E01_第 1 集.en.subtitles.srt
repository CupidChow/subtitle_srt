EPISODE 1

2
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,401
-U-ri.
-Hello.

3
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,694
Loved your comment yesterday.

4
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,489
Thanks, I love your show too.
Let's get together sometime.

5
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,157
-I'll call you.
-Okay.

6
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,001
BOO HYE-RYUNG'S
LOVE, MEMORIES, AND MUSIC

7
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,418
Turn right.

8
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,878
Turn right.

9
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,506
-Go straight.
-Straight.

10
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,508
Are you happy with the pace?

11
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,595
-Aren't I heavy?
-What?

12
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,806
Not at all.

13
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,353
-Then why did you toss me?
-No, I didn't.

14
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,983
All right.

15
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,238
You went through so much to get married.

16
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,698
Yes, I sure did.

17
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,494
That's why I won't get married twice.
No, I can't.

18
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,667
Do you know when I first fell for you?

19
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,460
When you saw me working.

20
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,130
-To be honest--
-Tell me now.

21
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,343
It was when we met for the first time
at Jong-su's studio.

22
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,095
What was I wearing?

23
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,598
We didn't even say hi.

24
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,267
You were wearing bell-bottoms.

25
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,811
And you looked amazing.

26
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,063
With those pants--

27
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,025
I'd only seen women cross their legs.

28
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,652
Anyway, you were playing the drums.

29
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,906
I was just speechless.

30
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,825
You were totally sexy.

31
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,074
Hello?

32
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,075
Hey.

33
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,494
Okay.

34
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:11,019
Every time I reminisce about that day,
I become excited.

35
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,688
Goodness.

36
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,940
Is there anything you want me
to keep in mind?

37
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,442
Any wishes, perhaps?

38
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,321
Never change.

39
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,699
Ask me the same question.

40
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,368
Is there anything
you want me to do for you?

41
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,748
Could you dress up the same way
and play the drums for me

42
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,915
on my 60th birthday?

43
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,918
When you turn 60, I'll be 62.

44
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,963
Will a grandma look nice in those clothes?

45
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,258
If it's you, then yes. You won't look old
even at the age of 100.

46
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,885
-Do you know why?
-Why?

47
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,720
Because I won't let that happen.

48
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,973
As long as her man loves her,
a woman will never age.

49
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,308
-How do you know?
-My mom.

50
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,684
Then why did she age?

51
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,644
What? That's--

52
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,899
That's because my dad lacked
a bit of love.

53
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,445
-You're dead meat if you ever trouble me.
-I won't.

54
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,500
This way, please.

55
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,794
Take your seat.

56
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,922
You can sit here.

57
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:24,175
Could you sit in the top row?
You can sit here.

58
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,138
Please take an empty seat.

59
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,933
You can sit there.

60
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,893
Yes, you can sit there.

61
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,064
BOO HYE-RYUNG'S
LOVE, MEMORIES, AND MUSIC

62
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,155
Going down.

63
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,417
Who's the guest singer?

64
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,503
It's a band called April Second.

65
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,587
It's a new band.

66
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,880
Who's the fan?

67
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,257
Sorry?

68
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,008
Among the producer, DJ, and writer.

69
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,637
I wanted to liven up the mood.
People are responding well to us.

70
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,865
-Hello.
-Hello.

71
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,336
I can't change the songs, can I?

72
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,547
No, the songs and stories go together.

73
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,721
Hello, sir.

74
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,849
-Please applaud a lot.
-Okay.

75
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,438
-You're so beautiful.
-Thank you.

76
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,939
Are you her aunt?

77
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,151
-No, I'm her mom.
-Gosh, you look so young.

78
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,862
-Mr. Yoon Cheol-wan?
-Yes.

79
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,866
When you ask your question later,
don't grab here, but here.

80
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,117
Okay.

81
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,536
-Ms. Joo Mi-hye?
-Yes.

82
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,623
She's the friend in question.

83
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,999
Hello.

84
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,335
You'll be talking for about three minutes.

85
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,629
-Three minutes?
-How do I measure it?

86
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,464
A story that long takes three minutes.

87
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,924
I see.

88
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,842
Ma'am.

89
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,261
May I ask you a question?

90
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:33,721
Sure.

91
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,642
What did you like about my husband?

92
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,437
His looks, personality, or money?

93
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,148
Park Jae-hun is my husband.

94
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,150
-Husband?
-Is it an affair?

95
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:49,111
Answer me. You must have a reason
for dating a married man.

96
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:54,242
You have an older brother,
and both of your parents are alive.

97
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,160
Do your parents know

98
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,497
that their youngest daughter
is a mistress?

99
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,167
You guys aren't just chatting buddies.

100
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,295
You recently went on a trip
to Singapore, didn't you?

101
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,964
A trip to Singapore?

102
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,676
You may think it's a relationship,
but it's an affair.

103
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,719
What's the definition of an affair?

104
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,056
You should know since you're
a Korean literature major and a writer.

105
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,559
Why aren't you saying anything?

106
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,269
She's unbelievable.

107
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,523
Is that what your parents taught you?

108
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,526
To seduce a married man
and become a homewrecker?

109
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,656
-No.
-Ma'am.

110
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,575
Let's talk after the show.

111
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,034
Then who taught you?

112
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,995
You don't learn about love.

113
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,372
Love?

114
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,334
-Is that what you just said?
-Take her outside.

115
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,752
Your fellow employee

116
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,297
is seeing my husband in secret.

117
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,674
What's your take on that?

118
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,303
I heard you're married, Ms. Boo.
So what would you do if you were me?

119
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,014
I understand, but--

120
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,016
I came here out of curiosity.

121
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,187
Well, isn't she just charming?

122
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,107
-I'm sorry, but--
-She's not the only one in the wrong.

123
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,900
He's the first one to blame.

124
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,320
Then is it okay to date a married man?

125
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,196
You shouldn't do what's morally wrong.

126
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,448
You don't know men.

127
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:19,118
I may not know men well,
but I know how a dad should act.

128
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,037
My dad also left us

129
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,123
because of a woman like her.

130
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,960
The show will begin in ten.
You should go outside and--

131
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,463
We're done talking. You may begin.

132
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:36,344
It's tastier to eat someone else's food,
but that's about food.

133
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,013
What makes you different
from other animals?

134
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:43,517
If you don't end it, I'll humiliate
your entire family, Ms. Lee Yeon-hui.

135
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,112
I heard you married him after dating
three men at once, Ms. Park.

136
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:59,367
I heard he was dating your friend,
but you seduced him while drunk.

137
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,661
And you intentionally got pregnant.

138
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,872
You stole your best friend's boyfriend.

139
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,457
So what makes you any different?

140
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:11,045
He couldn't ask you to get an abortion.
He wanted to take responsibility,

141
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,505
so he married you.

142
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,173
But he just couldn't love you.

143
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,217
You're barely awake
when he leaves for work.

144
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,553
You only made breakfast for him once
when his parents had visited,

145
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,555
and it was just fried eggs and cereal.

146
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,266
I heard your closets are full
of luxury items

147
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,769
and that you're a VIP
at luxurious department stores.

148
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,355
He also bought luxury items for himself.

149
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,898
He says he likes me.

150
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,985
He says I look pretty in worn-out jeans
and stretched out knitwear.

151
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,238
I know nothing about fashion.

152
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:41,492
I'm poor and tacky. But one day,
he noticed me and couldn't forget me.

153
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,412
He tried to forget me, but it wasn't easy.

154
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,914
I feel the same way. To be honest,

155
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,334
I was in a huge dilemma.

156
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,503
I've been beating myself up all the time.

157
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,255
But not anymore.

158
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,049
Of course, I knew this was an affair.

159
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,302
But I won't care anymore.
I'm going to do what he wants.

160
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,639
I rejected him out of fear
when he wanted to come to me.

161
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,808
Let me ask you.

162
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,686
What will you do? Will you divorce him?

163
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,230
Did your father,
a director at Hanyang Dairy,

164
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,858
and your mother, a music professor,
teach you that?

165
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,152
Did they tell you to shop around for men

166
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,903
and pick the wealthiest one?

167
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,534
Wait.

168
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,537
Please take a video.

169
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:31,834
Hit me.

170
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,670
I know I did wrong. I know I sinned.

171
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,132
But you should've never bad-mouthed
my parents.

172
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,482
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,088
Where are you from?

174
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,840
-Gwangju.
-Gyeonggi Province?

175
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,050
No, Jeolla Province.

176
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,844
-Did you arrive here today?
-Yes.

177
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,638
Just to attend our broadcast?

178
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,473
Yes, I came along with my friend.

179
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,860
I truly apologize for today.

180
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,863
I hope you still laugh a lot
and give good reactions.

181
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,074
-Okay.
-Okay.

182
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,005
Oh, right.

183
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,721
Ms. Woo Jin-ju, are you up?

184
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,181
I'd like to think so.

185
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,475
Thanks to April Second,

186
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,979
both our listeners and I
felt a bit more cheerful.

187
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,607
Thank you. I'd like to end our show

188
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,860
with one last song.

189
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:24,655
Sa Pi-young is the producer, Seo Ban is
the engineer, and I'm Boo Hye-ryung.

190
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,077
One iced Americano.

191
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,455
What's gotten into you?

192
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,165
I can't drink anything hot.

193
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,254
You can never judge someone
by their looks.

194
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,464
She looked so naive.

195
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,593
Maybe her naivete was the reason
she fell for a married man.

196
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,888
-How old is he?
-I don't even care.

197
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,139
Find a replacement soon.

198
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,476
Did Bo-gyeong join the morning show?

199
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,811
She's doing it alone.

200
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,188
She and Min-gyeong are going
to switch roles.

201
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,859
Last time, she said she was single.

202
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,361
She knew we'd ask questions.

203
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,114
Thank God nothing happened
during the live broadcast.

204
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,158
If we didn't lock the door after she left,

205
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,660
she could've barged in and caused a scene.

206
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,457
Word will spread anyway,
so I told the director myself.

207
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,169
-What did he say?
-He was relieved.

208
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,879
We now have a reason to fire her.

209
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,590
She got humiliated
and inconvenienced our show.

210
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,800
That wench can't stay.

211
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,935
We should verify the stories from now on.

212
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,604
I read hers again, and it sounded so real.

213
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,898
She's talented.
She made up such a good story.

214
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:44,193
-Yes.
-She may have copied some story.

215
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,236
Could he be the CEO of a small business?

216
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,239
Will Yeon-hui become a wife
of a wealthy man?

217
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,576
Men don't get divorced that easily.

218
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,119
Especially if they have kids.

219
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,914
My husband cherishes Ji-a so dearly.

220
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:01,460
For men, kids always come before wives.
They're all about their bloodline.

221
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,004
She didn't seem like the type
who'd divorce him.

222
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,925
She's probably even more determined
not to divorce him now.

223
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,805
I'm telling you, most men get caught
because they're simple-minded.

224
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,515
Are you speaking from experience?

225
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,351
My husband's a professor,
so he can't cheat.

226
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,603
He's still a man. Of course he can.

227
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,481
But your husband is a very ethical man.

228
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,942
He only leaves home for work.

229
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,945
Everyone else loves golfing,
but he says it's boring.

230
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,947
He won't be wasting his money.

231
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,408
Take better care of yourself.

232
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,285
-What?
-You should care about your appearance.

233
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,082
Isn't this normal?

234
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,459
Most writers dress like this.

235
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,421
It never hurts for women to transform.
You should give it a try.

236
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,548
When you're my age, and you'll know.

237
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:50,759
Si-eun, you were the same as now
when you were my age.

238
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,973
You guys have housekeepers,

239
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,558
but I have two kids.

240
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,852
Who should we side with?

241
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,313
We should side with the wife, right?

242
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,275
I'd divorce him right away.

243
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,861
-It's easier said than done.
-How could I live with him?

244
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:12,322
Would you be able to live together
as if nothing ever happened?

245
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,158
Of course not.

246
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,325
Exactly.

247
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,411
You can't live
with someone you don't love.

248
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,289
Once the love is gone,
you stick together through your bond.

249
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,499
Our mothers were like that too.

250
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,793
Women weren't self-sufficient enough
back then,

251
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,628
so they just put up with it.

252
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,550
We shouldn't provide a reason
for them to cheat.

253
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,053
I believe it can be prevented
with enough effort.

254
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,930
You're right.
Men are not totally simple-minded too.

255
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,432
If their wives are trustworthy,

256
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,101
they may cheat for a moment
but will never get a divorce.

257
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,352
It's all relative.

258
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,772
If you want to be loved, be lovable.

259
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,483
Women also have responsibilities
and duties.

260
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,234
If you don't want a divorce,

261
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,737
it's best just to turn a blind eye.

262
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,573
-Is that easy to do?
-Not at all.

263
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,867
But if you're hesitant to endure them all,

264
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,369
you shouldn't get married
in the first place.

265
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:12,132
I always miss Ji-a
a few days after she's visited.

266
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,343
Me too.

267
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,429
Why don't you call her over
for dinner, then?

268
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,474
-She has to go to an academy.
-She can skip it once or twice.

269
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,852
Our youngest kid skipped school
all the time

270
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,854
and even got into fights

271
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,272
but still got into college.

272
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,732
And Hankuk University at that.

273
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,775
Call her.

274
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,653
YU-SIN

275
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,404
He's calling.

276
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,657
-Pi-young?
-No.

277
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,451
Hello?

278
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,702
That was quick.

279
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,957
-What were you doing?
-We were talking about Ji-a.

280
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,709
Your dad wants
to invite you over for dinner.

281
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,919
Okay.

282
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,879
Will Pi-young be free too?

283
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,007
I just spoke with her, and she is.

284
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,278
Si-eun.

285
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,488
What?

286
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,699
What do you think?

287
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,951
About what?

288
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,412
About getting a divorce?

289
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,642
HEAD OF DEPARTMENT, THEATER AND FILM
PARK HAE-RYUN

290
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:51,356
Mom, I want Grandpa to stop
giving me kisses.

291
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,985
I'm 12 years old now.
I'm no longer a baby.

292
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,153
Don't you think so?

293
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:02,284
I'm going to tell him today.
"Grandpa, I'm no longer a kid."

294
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,703
"Then what?"

295
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,914
"I'm a young woman."

296
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,042
"We should shake hands instead
of kissing each other from now on."

297
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,002
He'll feel hurt. Don't say that.

298
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,629
Isn't a hug enough?

299
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,631
That's what I think.

300
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,634
What's so bad about a peck on the cheek?

301
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,635
I don't like it.

302
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:24,932
Dad must be home.

303
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,316
I forgot Mom was also young once.

304
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,568
Don't ever age.

305
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,403
I can't control that.

306
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,073
You can take good care of yourself
from now on.

307
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:44,201
Look who's talking.
Men age faster than women.

308
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,746
Honestly, Mom looks older

309
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,873
than Dad.

310
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:56,755
Mom, did Dad cry during your wedding?

311
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,757
Yes. Did you see the wedding photos?

312
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,008
Why did he?

313
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,802
He was touched.

314
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,098
In dramas, brides are normally
the ones who cry.

315
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,391
Your dad felt

316
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,395
a lot of emotions.

317
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,898
He felt very grateful to me.

318
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,942
He said it felt surreal.

319
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,653
It was the best day of his life.

320
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,738
Can you seriously cry due to happiness?

321
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,324
-You better not cry at your wedding.
-I won't.

322
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,161
Dad should treat you like a queen forever.

323
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,372
There's no woman like you.

324
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,249
-There are many.
-I've never seen one.

325
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,751
Dad's home.

326
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,968
-Welcome home, Dad.
-Hi.

327
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,594
Take his lunchbox.

328
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,723
I left some.

329
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:51,393
Were you too busy or had no appetite?

330
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,477
I was busy.

331
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,479
It's obviously the latter.

332
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,733
-How expensive is this wine?
-I'm not sure.

333
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,445
Are you not feeling well?

334
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,324
I'm fine. I just got full
from eating the fruit. That's all.

335
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,703
It's talbot wine. It must be good.

336
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,204
Let's have it with dinner.

337
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,123
It's for your mom and me.

338
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,459
Fine. Enjoy the wine then.

339
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,252
If you can, leave me a glass.

340
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:29,931
She's sleeping.

341
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,560
She should close her mouth.

342
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:34,728
It's a short ride.

343
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,938
School life must be exhausting.

344
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,608
It sure is.

345
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,361
You had a band today.

346
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,906
You weren't busy?
Did you have time to listen to the show?

347
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,324
For a bit.

348
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,327
If you were the DJ,
I'd be able to hear your voice.

349
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,037
At times, the producer deejays too.

350
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:53,955
Then do it.

351
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,709
No. You'll become even busier then, right?

352
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,421
-Probably.
-Then forget it.

353
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,763
What's a marital ennui?

354
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,973
Have you heard of it?

355
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,892
A few times.

356
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,605
You laugh so easily.

357
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,816
Do I look like a fool?

358
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:24,528
Goodness. I could never live
with a straight-faced woman.

359
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,540
It must be your mom.
Tell her we're almost there.

360
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,752
Hello, Ms. Mo.

361
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,216
Can you talk right now?

362
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,260
Of course. How are you doing?

363
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,555
I'm doing well. What about you?

364
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,765
Pi-young takes great care of me.

365
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,976
I could never get sick.

366
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,061
That's just a load of hot air.

367
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,021
You heard, right?

368
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,108
That I've come back to Korea for good?

369
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,569
-When?
-I arrived today.

370
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:10,115
You should've told us sooner.
You couldn't pick her up, right?

371
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,370
I didn't tell you
since I knew you'd be busy.

372
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,872
I would've sent a chauffeur.

373
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,999
Are you home?

374
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:23,128
Yes. I've just unpacked.

375
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,504
We'll stop by later.

376
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,424
You're going to be tired.

377
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,217
Not at all.

378
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,511
We're going to my parents' for dinner.

379
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,972
All of you?

380
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,182
Yes.

381
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,810
You've spoken with Pi-young
on the phone, right?

382
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,147
Yes.

383
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,691
Ji-a is asleep in the backseat.

384
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,610
She'll be happy to hear you're back.

385
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,738
Then I'll see you later.

386
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:50,906
Okay.

387
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,534
Okay. See you.

388
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,786
Wake Ji-a up.

389
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,954
Why didn't you tell us?

390
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,582
Ji-a, get up. We're almost there.

391
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,126
I forgot.

392
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,212
You know how chatty Ji-a can get.

393
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,423
Ji-a, your grandma's in Korea.

394
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,218
The one from the Philippines?

395
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,511
Yes.

396
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,126
Dad, Jae-in is here.
She'll be sleeping over.

397
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,006
You guys can drink the wine.

398
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,007
Really?

399
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,052
It's open.

400
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,557
Hi.

401
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,434
-You brought your pajamas?
-Yes.

402
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,728
I could've lent you a t-shirt.

403
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,188
Dad, this is Jae-in.

404
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,649
-Hello.
-Hey.

405
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,942
Let's go.

406
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,318
Are we having tteokbokki?

407
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,862
-No, pizza.
-Let's just have tteokbokki.

408
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,077
I'm writing well tonight.

409
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,249
-Why don't we go out?
-Where?

410
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,002
It's been a while since we've gone out.

411
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,420
For a walk?

412
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,255
Yes.

413
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,506
What's gotten into you?

414
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,633
Is Jae-in here?

415
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,552
Yes.

416
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:38,722
She has a boyfriend now. A med student.

417
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,191
I haven't heard you sing in a long time.

418
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,029
I wish I was a good singer too.

419
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,655
Maybe in my next life.

420
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,955
KARAOKE

421
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,207
REMIND KARAOKE

422
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:09,961
Let's go in.

423
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:22,015
You don't smile as much
since you've become the head.

424
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,601
Tell me if something's troubling you.

425
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,229
Nothing in life is easy.

426
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,065
That's true.

427
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,695
This place is nice.

428
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,530
The walls are soundproof.

429
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,616
Sing a song for me.

430
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,495
I still remember your favorite song.

431
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,436
CANCEL

432
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,110
Si-eun.

433
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,654
Will you…

434
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,741
let me leave?

435
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,618
Leave where?

436
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:25,954
Leave you.

437
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,416
What? Is this a joke?

438
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,834
No.

439
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,128
What are you on about?

440
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,480
I don't want to live with you.

441
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,651
You want a divorce?

442
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,198
Why?

443
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,033
I just want to.

444
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,040
Tell me the reason.

445
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,297
You must have one.

446
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,175
Are you seeing someone?

447
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,721
Then?

448
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,516
We met when we were 19
and have been together for 31 years now.

449
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,229
Let's end it here.

450
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,070
Are you sick of me? Is that it?

451
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,656
It's not that simple.

452
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,741
It's just,

453
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,161
being the head of the family
is too much for me.

454
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,085
Then take a break.

455
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,631
I'll get you a studio apartment.
You can stay there for a bit.

456
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,383
I don't want to live this way anymore.

457
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,136
You were never the irresponsible type.

458
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,263
I'm sorry.

459
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,934
It's been tough for me.

460
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,815
You always listened to me.

461
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,611
Could you do the same this time too?

462
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,077
I know this is shameless of me.

463
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,460
What about the kids?

464
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,756
Are you dying or something?

465
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,633
Just--

466
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,221
I beg you.

467
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,685
I want to live a different life now.

468
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,437
If you want a reason,

469
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,482
I guess we've lived together for too long.

470
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:04,988
Even parents stop living with their kids
once they turn 30.

471
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,123
MY LOVELY SON

472
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:19,711
Take it.

473
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,427
Hey.

474
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,636
Where are you?

475
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,973
Your dad and I are out.

476
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,767
I want to wear this hoodie tomorrow,
but it's wrinkly.

477
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,604
Okay, I'll iron it.

478
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,563
Okay.

479
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,321
I arrived in Korea just now.

480
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:14,450
Give me a call when you have time.

481
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,663
Are you in there?

482
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,873
-Yes.
-Ji-a is getting sleepy.

483
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,481
Drop me off at my mom's.

484
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,942
Just you?

485
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,444
You can say hi next time.

486
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,655
Will ten minutes do?

487
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,867
That's not enough.
Ji-a will get cranky if she wakes up.

488
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,577
You can go home first.

489
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,802
Where's Ji-a?

490
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:32,361
I've prepared some melons.

491
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,156
Why are you back?

492
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,452
Because I missed you.

493
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,040
And I'm quite old now, you know.

494
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,126
Go back.

495
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:54,175
-I know how you feel.
-Then say no more.

496
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,722
I'll tell Yu-sin that your sister's sick,

497
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,557
so purchase your ticket.

498
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,310
You know me.

499
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,270
Don't make me repeat myself.

500
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,314
What should I do to make up with you?

501
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,276
Don't call Yu-sin ever again.

502
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,323
I'll tell him that you left in a hurry
after your sister called.

503
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,408
Pi-young.

504
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:23,037
I'm going to do what I want this time.

505
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,582
You have

506
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,253
always had your way all your life.

507
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:35,383
I'm just telling you not to interfere
in my family or my marriage.

508
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,886
And don't cry in front of me.

509
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,038
Hello.

510
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,548
Where to?

511
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,632
DREAM INTERPRETATION

512
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,728
Why are you up?

513
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,521
I had a dream.

514
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,273
What dream?

515
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,027
Are you trying to find out
the meaning behind it now?

516
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,071
It must be one grand dream.

517
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,285
I dreamed of a pig.

518
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,830
-Were your dreams ever precognitive?
-At times.

519
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,166
Tell me in detail.
I'm good at interpreting.

520
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:41,050
The pig was as big as a calf.

521
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,551
But it was a pig.

522
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,845
Then it came into my arms.

523
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,556
I petted it as it was oinking.
Then I woke up.

524
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,767
You should purchase a lottery ticket
tomorrow.

525
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,735
Next time, just wait until the morning.

526
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,903
Don't wake me up.

527
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,128
It would've been a conception dream
if we were trying.

528
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,069
Have a good meal.

529
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,487
Okay.

530
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:05,319
Your dad has a breakfast meeting.

531
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,032
-At this hotel?
-No, at Prince One Hotel.

532
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,701
Door opening.

533
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,710
-Where's your car?
-Over there.

534
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:22,837
I see.

535
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,052
All right.

536
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,271
-Have a good day.
-Okay.

537
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,474
Hello?

538
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,185
How are you feeling?

539
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,353
Did you sleep well?

540
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,483
I had a conception dream last night.

541
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,235
I'm serious. I definitely had it.

542
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,864
I was walking on the beach,
and from far away--

543
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,453
I'll tell you later.
I should tell you in person.

544
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,165
Around 6:30 p.m.

545
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,334
Are you craving anything?

546
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,213
Okay.

547
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,789
-You've gotten better.
-Really?

548
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,791
Yes. You're doing well.

549
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,754
Stop that.

550
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:34,677
Come here.

551
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,238
Keep swimming like that. Continue.

552
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,073
That's it.

553
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:17,553
Could you hand me my phone?
I need to take that call.

554
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,640
Here.

555
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,145
Hello, ma'am.

556
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:29,189
-Are you up?
-Yes, I'm at the salon.

557
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,816
I'm getting makeup for work.

558
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,526
You must be busy.

559
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:38,032
Your father-in-law just told me
that he had a dream last night.

560
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,993
We were wondering if you had good news.

561
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,036
What news?

562
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,496
It was definitely a conception dream.

563
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,664
No way, Mother.

564
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,708
You should check.

565
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,501
I'm sure it wasn't.

566
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,879
No? Are you really sure?

567
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,715
Yes, we won't change our decision.

568
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,719
-But it was a conception dream.
-Right.

569
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,597
I have such dreams
right before my period too.

570
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,684
-Maybe it's your other daughter-in-law.
-I've already asked.

571
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,019
She said no.

572
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,937
She should have another kid.

573
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,731
What if it's a daughter again?

574
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,441
Did he dream about a daughter?

575
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:15,653
All right, then.

576
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,821
Okay. Have a nice day, Mother.

577
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,992
Did Sa-hyeon have breakfast today?

578
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:25,120
Of course. He had your side dishes

579
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,623
with hot scorched rice soup.

580
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,917
-Okay.
-Okay, then.

581
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,418
No?

582
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,590
MOTHER-IN-LAW

583
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,764
They must be waiting for a grandchild.

584
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:44,765
Yes.

585
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:48,894
Every now and then,
she calls and gives me stress.

586
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:55,859
PRECAUTIONS IN EARLY PREGNANCY

587
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,125
PRECAUTIONS IN EARLY PREGNANCY

588
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,883
I can't see Grandma then?

589
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:21,468
No.

590
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,430
Does her sister need a surgery?

591
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,223
I think so.

592
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,685
It must be terrifying.

593
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,105
Have you ever had surgery?

594
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,441
Not yet.

595
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,609
I wish I'd never have to have one

596
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,653
in my lifetime.

597
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,365
Then you should stop being a picky eater
and eat what I give you.

598
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,409
That way, you'll stay healthy. Okay?

599
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,454
But eating what I want is
the sole enjoyment I have.

600
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,873
That's hurtful to hear.

601
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,626
That means your entire family
means nothing to you.

602
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,754
Those two are different.

603
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,339
Not all meaningful things are enjoyable.

604
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,884
It's very meaningful
to help kids in Africa.

605
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,677
But it's not enjoyable.

606
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,055
Do you burst into laughter
as you donate to them?

607
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,142
Goodness, I can never beat you.

608
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:13,771
What gives you meaning in life
and happiness?

609
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,355
There are so many.

610
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,398
Pick the best one.

611
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,442
My family.

612
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,110
What about you?

613
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,876
Goodness, thank you.

614
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,628
I didn't add any syrup.

615
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,713
This hotel has the best waffles.

616
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,508
They make them so crispy.

617
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,719
They're tasty too
even though they didn't use much butter.

618
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,392
I should invite your mother-in-law over.

619
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,769
Are you free this weekend?

620
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,148
It's her.

621
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,277
Hello, ma'am.

622
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:06,031
I'm sorry for calling
so early in the morning.

623
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,533
It's okay.

624
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:11,537
Can I see you for a minute today?

625
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,623
Sure. I'm free in the morning,
so I'll stop by.

626
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:16,792
See you then.

627
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:21,547
Eat up.

628
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,109
When did this all begin?

629
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,319
It's been a while.

630
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,447
How long?

631
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:00,669
I'm sorry.

632
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,796
I truly am.

633
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:43,837
Pi-young thinks

634
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,341
her dad died because of me.

635
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,510
To tell the truth,
she's not entirely wrong.

636
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,431
Her dad…

637
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,561
had an affair with a fellow employee.

638
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,357
I couldn't forgive him.

639
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:07,069
So I started the divorce proceedings.

640
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:10,113
Then while going to see Pi-young
at school,

641
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,575
he had an accident.

642
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:19,539
I pretended to be cheerful
in front of everyone else,

643
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:23,168
but always walked on eggshells around her.

644
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,588
She said she'd never
let me see Ji-a again.

645
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:30,342
And she wants me to go back
to the Philippines.

646
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,720
It must've been hard.

647
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,055
I can't--

648
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,726
Who knows what will happen to me?

649
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:43,605
I just want to see you and Ji-a
once a month--

650
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:48,568
No, even once every few months
is enough for me. So I came back.

651
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,572
If she finds out about this,

652
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,158
she'll be upset with me.

653
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:00,080
She'll understand
if you tell her the truth.

654
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,416
She refuses to sit down and talk.

655
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,962
If you also want me to go back,

656
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,089
I will.

657
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:14,553
You should stay. I'll talk to her
and try to convince her.

658
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:15,846
Don't worry too much.

659
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,018
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

660
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,895
I wanted to lessen her burden.

661
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,899
But I just can't take it anymore.

662
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,986
I had no idea.

663
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:35,323
Now that I know,
I'll bring Ji-a over often.

664
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,910
She misses you a lot as well.

665
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:40,954
Really?

666
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,999
She can spend the weekend here.

667
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,088
She must've grown so much.

668
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,768
How pretty.

669
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:05,896
She's so beautiful.

670
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:30,670
From the moment we are born,
we are placed in the ring called life.

671
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:36,093
I'm sure you've never heard of anyone
who has knocked out their opponent

672
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,386
without getting hit even once.

673
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:42,265
Even Mike Tyson, the renowned boxer,

674
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:46,353
said that one should expect to get hit
when stepping into the ring.

675
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,898
Boo Hye-ryung's Love, Memories, and Music
begins now.

676
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:18,593
Maybe the dream was about Dongmi.

677
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,263
What are you on about?

678
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:22,848
About her having puppies.

679
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,725
Why would I dream
about a dog's conception?

680
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,396
Both of our daughters-in-law said no.

681
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,356
But it was definitely a conception dream.

682
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,400
That's why.

683
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,862
Besides, you dote on Dongmi so much.

684
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:40,532
You're definitely a grandma now.
You say the strangest things at times.

685
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:43,618
Nowadays, they consider 60-year-olds
middle-aged women.

686
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,871
-Who does?
-Everyone.

687
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,247
Dream on.

688
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,000
If I'm a grandma, then you're a grandpa.

689
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:54,629
All the club members thought I was
in my 30s before they found out my age.

690
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,048
-How so?
-Because of my body.

691
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:01,636
I wore a hat and a pair of sunglasses,
and they thought so.

692
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,098
Your body shape matters the most.

693
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,643
You should golf. Many people
don't have the chance to do so.

694
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,315
He's handsome, well-educated,

695
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,734
and a competent lawyer.

696
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:18,945
It would be perfect if they had a baby.

697
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,197
Don't change the subject.

698
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,742
I'm not. I'm just upset about it.

699
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,994
Aren't you?

700
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,830
How could I not?

701
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,540
Just thinking about it--

702
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,960
Dongmi is much better than my two sons.

703
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:38,298
How could you compare them to your dog?

704
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,549
But it's true.

705
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:43,637
She gave birth to puppies on her own.

706
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,138
Our oldest son has two kids.

707
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,349
It doesn't matter. They're girls.

708
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:50,227
They'll practically become strangers
once they get married.

709
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,479
You better not say that in front of them.

710
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,982
In this day and age,
demand a specific gender,

711
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,026
and you'll never get to see them.

712
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,488
Sure, if we were like any other parents.

713
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,241
But they can't treat us like that.

714
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,244
They better not be impudent.

715
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:10,705
-And if they are?
-Then I'll donate everything.

716
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,165
All my property, that is.

717
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,216
-Good work.
-You too.

718
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:22,634
Good work.

719
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,806
The opening comments
were exceptionally good today.

720
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,357
Are you not feeling well?

721
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,984
You look down today.

722
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:44,072
Go home and rest up.
It must be tougher without an assistant.

723
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,079
My husband…

724
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,041
wants to end it.

725
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,460
End it?

726
00:54:59,045 --> 00:54:59,921
He does?

727
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,050
You mean your marriage?

728
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:13,393
Did you two fight?

729
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,189
HEAD OF DEPARTMENT, THEATER AND FILM
PARK HAE-RYUN

730
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:25,196
I TOLD HER YESTERDAY
THAT I WANTED A DIVORCE

731
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:31,536
LEE:
DID YOU TELL HER ABOUT ME?

732
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,832
NOT A WORD. I NEVER WILL.

733
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:38,001
LEE:
DID SHE AGREE TO IT?

734
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:52,724
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. TRUST ME.

735
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:58,730
Just because you've been living together
for too long? Really?

736
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,190
Ridiculous, right?

737
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,943
Have you checked his phone?

738
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,947
You should.

739
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,159
I think he's seeing someone.

740
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:15,997
He's never cheated on me before.
He's just not interested in it.

741
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:18,750
I may be out of line here,

742
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,961
but have you guys
been having sex regularly?

743
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:26,758
Why not?

744
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,551
It's too tiring

745
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:30,804
and bothersome.

746
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,348
Did you refuse?

747
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,725
Or was he uninterested?

748
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:42,816
I said no a few times,
then he stopped asking.

749
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:43,983
How long has it been?

750
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,529
It's been almost two years.

751
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:50,240
You didn't have sex for two years?

752
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,576
I think so.

753
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,538
That must be why. Don't you think so?

754
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:01,418
I'm not sure. Many married couples
are like that these days.

755
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,212
You too? No, right?

756
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,340
I'm certain.

757
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:10,718
You've hurt his pride by rejecting him.

758
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:14,389
After bottling it up all this time,
he can't take it anymore.

759
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,935
You've lived with him for 30 years.
How could you not know that?

760
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,604
We've lived together for 20 years.

761
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:25,066
We started dating 30 years--
no, 31 years ago.

762
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:32,365
Don't tell me you regretted your marriage
right on your honeymoon.

763
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:37,370
Set the mood tonight.
Everything will be fixed.

764
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,455
What if that's not it?

765
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,957
I'm sure it is.

766
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,083
Animals--

767
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:47,797
Do you think maybe he can't get it up?

768
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:52,051
I heard anything you don't use atrophies.

769
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,846
Maybe he doesn't want you to find out.

770
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,932
She never bothered him about it.

771
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:01,978
Anyway, listen to me and try that tonight.

772
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:04,564
She's right. I think that could be why.

773
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,902
He's the only man you've ever been with

774
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,028
since 12th grade.

775
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,656
You're so naive.

776
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,283
You may be a writer,

777
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:18,411
but you seem more ignorant
than young girls in that aspect.

778
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:23,374
You should do it even if you're tired.
It actually rejuvenates you.

779
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,294
Is that the case for you?

780
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:27,712
She's still a newlywed.

781
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:31,799
We have no kids,
so we focus more on each other.

782
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:33,676
Hold on.

783
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,471
We haven't had sex in a while either.

784
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,140
I should set the mood as well.

785
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,644
He's been putting it off,
saying he's busy.

786
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,360
Never.

787
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:53,404
I told you last week
that I'd be using that studio.

788
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:56,366
Yes. Okay.

789
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:13,299
Which age group is this clothing for?

790
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,260
My granddaughter is 12.

791
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,307
How tall is she?

792
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,600
One minute.

793
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,728
MESSAGES
DAUGHTER

794
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:26,813
At the airport?

795
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,382
I didn't go.

796
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:58,011
And I told Yu-sin everything.

797
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:29,167
-It's perfect, isn't it?
-Yes.

798
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,169
We have somewhere to go.

799
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:33,421
Right now? Where?

800
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:34,797
You'll find out.

801
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:40,303
Goodness, take off this pain-relief patch.

802
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:42,138
You can't do this all of a sudden.

803
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:44,599
Did someone invite us over?

804
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:46,142
Yes.

805
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:49,354
Goodness, look at your hair.

806
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:50,480
All right.

807
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,441
Let's go.

808
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:54,984
Take off the tag.

809
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:57,862
Goodness.

810
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:02,492
How much did this dress cost?

811
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,327
It's a gift. You shouldn't ask.

812
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,746
Is it over 500,000 won?
Then I won't keep it.

813
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:07,830
It's not.

814
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,256
You took the price tag off. Why?

815
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,133
They took it off because it was a gift.

816
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:25,765
Ms. Lee, you're looking great in it.

817
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,267
The dress really compliments you.

818
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:31,813
-Hyang-gi, check out your mom!
-She's washing her hair.

819
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:34,649
-We should hurry.
-What?

820
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,443
Let's go.

821
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,487
We're meeting someone I know, right?

822
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,699
This bag is empty.

823
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,826
Oh, gosh.

824
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,423
We're going to the outskirts?

825
01:01:58,506 --> 01:01:59,465
Yes.

826
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,135
Someone must be having a barbecue
for their housewarming.

827
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,720
We're having lamb chops.

828
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:06,347
Then we should've bought a bottle of wine.

829
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:08,725
-You did, right?
-They said I shouldn't.

830
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,852
Who are they?

831
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:13,187
Nap a bit. You didn't sleep much.

832
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,996
You slept so soundly in such a short time.

833
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:32,373
Did I sleep with my mouth open?

834
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:35,126
Of course. I even wiped your drool once.

835
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:41,716
I'm just kidding. You just snored a bit.

836
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:43,634
Really? I did?

837
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,053
Is that a big deal?

838
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:48,097
It's not, but--

839
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,057
That was a joke.

840
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,148
I thought we were going
to someone's house.

841
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:11,245
-How beautiful.
-Let's go inside.

842
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:20,254
It's not our wedding anniversary.

843
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:23,466
Do we have good news to celebrate?

844
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:26,010
I just wanted to spend some time
with you alone.

845
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:28,054
It would've been better if our kids came.

846
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:30,139
They'll be eating
countless delicious dishes.

847
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:35,937
How do you know this place?
Who did you come here with?

848
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,021
With my students.

849
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,273
Female students?

850
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:40,900
Yes.

851
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,986
I guess they're more important
to you than I am.

852
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,531
You're too busy with work.

853
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:50,868
Why would I come here with them?

854
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,496
I'd just have pork belly
and fish soup near the campus.

855
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:56,499
-Then with who?
-I asked my blogger friend.

856
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,585
I'm serious.

857
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,297
Excuse me.

858
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:10,888
Hyang-gi loves lamb chops as well.

859
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:14,684
Focus on us for now
and forget about our kids.

860
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,227
Okay.

861
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,521
I have a surprise for us.

862
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:19,856
This isn't it?

863
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,984
Do you think we came all the way here
for some lamb chops?

864
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:24,360
It's a nice place to eat.

865
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,738
We should have some wine.

866
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:30,199
Have some house wine. I'll drive.

867
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:31,742
I don't want to drink alone.

868
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,661
The chauffeur fee must be too expensive.

869
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:36,622
Expensive or not,
I just don't want a stranger in our car.

870
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:37,999
Then just drink at home.

871
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:39,792
The bread's tasty.

872
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:41,627
Aren't you going to eat?

873
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,588
I like watching you more.

874
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,342
I'm certain.

875
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:49,510
About what?

876
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:52,054
You've done something wrong.

877
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,765
I did. I've committed the original sin.

878
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:57,018
I fell in love with you.

879
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:04,108
I haven't received clothes
as a gift in a long time.

880
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,319
Thank you.

881
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:09,322
I know I picked it out,
but it's truly beautiful.

882
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:11,741
I am a discerning man indeed.

883
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:14,619
I agree. And that's why you met me.

884
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:19,999
I have to say you've made me
a better man on so many levels.

885
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:22,752
I used to be so tacky and shabby.

886
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:25,671
-You weren't shabby.
-Then just tacky?

887
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,757
A 12th grader shouldn't be dressing up.

888
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,800
If so, I wouldn't have liked you.

889
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:30,885
You liked me?

890
01:05:34,388 --> 01:05:36,849
I thought it was one-sided.

891
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,893
Why were you so cold to me?

892
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:41,103
I went through so much.

893
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,980
We had to study.

894
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:46,317
I wasn't interested at first
then your earnestness moved me.

895
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,319
Earnestness? It was love.

896
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:50,613
-Don't be absurd.
-It was.

897
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:52,573
Let's get that straight.

898
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,367
Be honest. That wasn't love.

899
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,368
It was for me.

900
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:57,703
If not, then what?

901
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:01,791
Just an innocent feeling of fondness.

902
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:05,503
What do you think love is?

903
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:07,546
It's more than liking someone.

904
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:09,298
And you?

905
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:11,759
Being head over heels
and crazy for someone.

906
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:14,011
Then I guess we're not in love anymore.

907
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:16,097
You're not crazy for me. Right?

908
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,891
Of course not.
We're living under the same roof.

909
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,102
I'd go crazy if we're living apart.

910
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:24,397
That's why I've brought you
out here today.

911
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:26,315
Thank you.

912
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,777
Let's have a special day today.

913
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,153
How?

914
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:33,280
I've booked a motel.

915
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:37,868
-A motel?
-Yes.

916
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:40,246
-You're kidding.
-I'm not.

917
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:41,998
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

918
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,791
We've never been to one before.

919
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:46,002
-How could we?
-Why not?

920
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:49,005
We're not strangers. We're married.

921
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:52,842
Just close your eyes and try it out.

922
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:56,137
Everyone else goes there.
Even Professor Hwang.

923
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:58,639
Really? He and his wife?

924
01:06:58,723 --> 01:06:59,640
Yes.

925
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:02,852
That's a surprise.

926
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:04,520
No, that's normal.

927
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:08,941
-Here are your dishes.
-Okay.

928
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:18,909
Let's just go home.

929
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,412
Why?

930
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:25,041
This isn't right.

931
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,001
Why not?

932
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:28,878
Let's spice things up.

933
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:31,547
You're a professor. You teach students.

934
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:33,299
We're human too.

935
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:36,010
Is it morally wrong for a married couple
to go to a motel?

936
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:38,304
-I'm not into it.
-I am.

937
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:41,307
Listen to your husband for today.

938
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:46,062
Listening to me will only benefit you.

939
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:06,332
I'm really not into it.

940
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:11,712
Let's just go. I'm sorry.

941
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:16,175
Just like how wearing new clothes
makes you feel good--

942
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:18,135
Is this why you bought this?

943
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,303
Yes.

944
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:24,517
It wasn't the only reason, though.
You don't have many nice clothes.

945
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,435
I don't get you.

946
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,312
I don't get you either.

947
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:31,107
All the other couples enjoy
going to these places.

948
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,567
-Don't you know?
-I do.

949
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:36,445
-Then?
-Some people like beef

950
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:39,490
while others like pork or fish.

951
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:41,992
I've wanted to come here.
I've been curious.

952
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:43,244
They say it's great.

953
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:44,870
What's so great about it?

954
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,832
-They have nice facilities and--
-Does that matter?

955
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:50,501
With love, even a small room is enough.

956
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:51,877
I know. We were like that.

957
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:54,213
But everything needs a change.

958
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,173
You get sick of the same food.

959
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:58,717
-You'll never get sick of eating.
-You do.

960
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,929
We met 30 years ago
and lived together for 20 years. I know.

961
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:04,890
You're a great eater..
You could even eat five times a day.

962
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,143
Fine, but that's about food.

963
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:09,895
Let's have some intimate time tonight.

964
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:15,234
Please? I'm asking you.

965
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:18,487
We're like roommates these days.

966
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,781
-Are you unhappy about that?
-No.

967
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:22,950
That's what happens if you have kids.

968
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:24,952
And I'm busy.

969
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:26,912
That's why it's just for today.

970
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:32,084
Do we have to?

971
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,295
I'm not asking for much.

972
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:37,047
I'd be happy holding hands with you
at this place.

973
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,425
You came all the way here
just to hold my hand?

974
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:41,427
The dress was expensive.

975
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:44,138
We had so many lamb chops
and spent so much money.

976
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:49,810
Let's go home. Think of our kids.
This isn't right.

977
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:52,438
If I was in their shoes,

978
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:54,940
I'd be disgusted.

979
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,275
What's so bad about this?

980
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:58,444
I think I'd freeze up.

981
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:01,238
Let's go in and find out.
Let's talk again then.

982
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:03,657
Lie down on the bed and see for yourself.

983
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,576
-Don't you know me?
-I don't.

984
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:08,996
There could be hidden cameras.

985
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:11,582
Or people may recognize us
and have a misunderstanding.

986
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:17,254
Obviously, we're not in the mood
right now.

987
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,376
So?

988
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:40,004
Yu-sin

989
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,923
understood everything.

990
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:46,176
He said I didn't need to leave.

991
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:49,138
Who are you to tell my husband
about our family?

992
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:51,307
You have no right.

993
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:33,349
You have me, darling.
Cry whenever you want to.

994
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:35,100
But only in my arms.

995
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,020
Don't wait up for me.
I have piles of work to do.

996
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:42,316
Dong-mi. Are you sure you won't resent me
for living a long life?

997
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:46,612
-You really want to end this?
-I'll tell the kids and draw up papers.

998
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:49,782
-Husbands like me are rare.
-I know.

999
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:52,576
And there's no wife like you
in the universe.

1000
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:53,952
What's so bad about that?

1001
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,955
-Don't force someone against their will.
-Leave.

1002
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:00,042
Your dad and I decided
to live apart for a while.

1003
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:02,628
You're not getting a divorce, are you?
You are?

1004
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,380
It could be a boy or a girl--

1005
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,048
What conception dream did he have?

1006
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:07,132
Mom.

1007
01:13:08,258 --> 01:13:09,551
I'll get a divorce.

1008
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:33,325
