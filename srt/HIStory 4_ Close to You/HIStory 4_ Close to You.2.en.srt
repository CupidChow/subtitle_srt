I'm not late, am I?

16
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,916
No. I arrived early.

17
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:52,082
You order first.

18
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,759
Xiao Yeh...

19
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,850
- Hsing Ssu said you have something to tell me.
- Yes.

20
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,416
You should order first.

21
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:01,432
When I tell you, I'm afraid you won't want to eat.

22
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,350
We are old friends.

23

Whatever you want to say can't be that bad, can it?

24
00:02:09,183 --> 00:02:14,000
Hsiao Yay, I know you're very popular at the company and everyone likes you.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,649
I also know you've changed and aren't the same as when we were children.

26
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:19,567
- But I don't want to get involved–
- I'm a fudanshi!

27
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:20,841
I also like BL.

28
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,075
- You aren't a fudanshi.
- I am!

29
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:25,440
Which TV station aired the BL drama "Make Our Days Count"?

30
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,009
- I don't watch dramas.
- Name three BL mangas you like.

31
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:29,499
I don't remember book titles either.

32
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,482
Then what are "attacking, receiving, kichiku, chu chieh, and kua chieh" (BL terms)?

33
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:40,490
I don't know why you're trying to get close to me.

34
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,083
I also don't know if you'll play pranks on me again.

35
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,367
I just want to live in peace.

36
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,916
You're right. I'm not a fudanshi.

37
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,383
But I am interested in men.

38
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,183
I don't mean it in that way.

39
00:02:53,183 --> 00:02:54,874
What I mean is...

40
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,082
I can try to develop an interest in BL.

41
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,583
I can try to be a fudanshi.

42
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,291
Then we can discuss a common interest,

43
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,475
and restart our relationship as friends.

44
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:05,208
We can share things and be fans of BL together.

45
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,200
You're very lonely.

46
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:11,492
You think no one understands what's in your heart.

47
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:12,666
Wh-What?

48
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:16,141
You're actually empty on the inside because you know your true nature,

49
00:03:16,141 --> 00:03:17,374
but you're afraid to face it.

50
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:22,599
So you hide yourself in a closet... and close the door.

51
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,975
Actually, I don't really understand what you're saying.

52

You like Teng Mu Ren!

You've had a hard time, right?

00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,916
No, no, I think you misunderstand.

Weren't you afraid of mistakes with that topic?

Did she notice your slip-ups (errors)?

68

Of course, she did.

She then became very enthusiastic about helping me.

Wow, she even set up a fan club.

Now you have a chance to get closer and get to know one another.

78
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,475
You also have to show your strengths to her.

No problem.

Why did you drink so much?

00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:28,124
It's rare that Li Cheng is so serious about a girl. I'm very happy.

96
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:31,958
What's wrong?

97
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,457

You're amazing.

- Of course.

How was your sales performance?

112
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,150
It's better.

113
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,800
You're not hiding a big case from me, are you?

114
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,217
Did you actually let go of me by yourself?

115
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,745
Are you pretending to be a gentleman?

116

00:06:35,492 --> 00:06:40,100
Teng Teng! Has my bite wound on your neck healed?

118

Why do you mention that all of a sudden?

119
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:45,066
And so loudly too.

120
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:47,801
I just thought about it and wanted to check.

121
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,374
I have to go and make a battle plan

Don't eat at that place.

It's so far away.

Their variety is great with large servings.

But I don't want to walk there.

- Are you getting it for me?
- Yes!

There's something in your hair.

Is there? Help me get it out.

All right.

What's going on with that Liu Mei Fang?

140
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,823
She's deliberately not looking at me.

141
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,391
She's probably embarrassed.

142
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:54,442
You're so good looking.

It's annoying.

146

Bear with it. He probably really likes Mei Fang.

147

I have plans. You go home first.

Okay. Don't come home too late.

00:09:47,323 --> 00:09:49,008
Let me help you up.

165
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,150
Come on.

166
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,042
Be careful.

167
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:13,608
Are you feeling better?

168
00:10:13,608 --> 00:10:15,317
Does it still hurt?

169
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,542
It doesn't hurt anymore. I don't need this.

170
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:20,083
No way!

171
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,165
Just before, it hurt so much you couldn't even walk.

172
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:25,666
I think you should go to a hospital.

173
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:29,542
Why a hospital? You should go to the police.

174
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:33,925
Mu Ren... Have you offended anyone recently?

175
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,842
No.

176
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:43,249
But when he got close to me, I smelled

177
00:10:43,249 --> 00:10:46,800
that strange scent like at home a few days ago.

178
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,700
Do you mean that the person, who recently broke into our house, attacked you today?

179
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:57,875
From now on, you can't go out alone.

180
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,875
Xiao Yeh or I need to be with you.

181
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,100
I got hit today because I wasn't prepared.

182
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,200
Even if you're prepared, he might have a weapon.

183
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,399
I think you're right. I should call the police.

184
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,834
Unfortunately, there were no security cameras nearby

185
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:17,165
so there's no proof I was attacked.

186
00:11:17,165 --> 00:11:18,624
I'm a witness!

187
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:22,000
I have evidence as well. Look.

188
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:25,517
Show me.

189
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,041
Are you sure it's from the attacker?

190
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,492
It definitely is.

191
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:33,750
He went flying after I punched him.

192
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,750
It probably fell from him then.

193
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,800
Hsing Ssu... Do you know who owns this necklace?

194
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,570
[Sampo]

195
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:03,500
Nowadays, young people fight so violently and

196
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,858
each time it becomes more brutal.

197
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,542
It's really scary.

198
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:10,791
They don't worry about how their families feel.

199
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,716
The parents of the kids fighting out there

200
00:12:14,716 --> 00:12:18,959
should self-reflect on themselves.

201
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,900
Fu Yung Chieh, come and have dinner!

202
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,090
Here, Daddy.

203
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,359
Thank you, Mommy.

204
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,792
Yung Chieh, why is your face bruised?

205
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,959
Did you run into something?

206
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,174
I was beaten.

207
00:12:42,174 --> 00:12:43,583
How did you get beaten?

208
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,500
Did you offend anyone?

209
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,149
I attacked someone, thinking that he was alone,

210
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:51,250
but his friend came along and beat me.

211
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,875
Are you trying to get in the news?

212
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,300
How would your dad and I face people?

213
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,200
Your sunames are Yeh and Lee. Mine is Fu.

214
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Even if my whole name was reported, it still wouldn't affect you two.

215
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,874
Before you attacked this person, you thought of everything, right?

216
00:13:05,874 --> 00:13:10,191
No wonder you said no when I asked if you wanted to have the same surname as Dad.

217
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:13,125
I have other plans. That's why I didn't change it.

218
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,450
What other plans do you have?

219
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:25,209
Your dad asked you a question.

220
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:30,999
Fu Yung Chieh!

221
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,500
Mommy.

222
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,375
He usually answers questions.

223
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,475
If he doesn't want to tell us,

224
00:13:39,475 --> 00:13:41,125
it's useless to ask.

225
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,458
It's not like you don't know that.

226
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:48,750
Daddy, I'm just afraid he will do something illegal. You heard him, too.

227
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,133
He's already attacking people on the street.

228
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,567
Yung Chieh... Did anyone see your face?

229
00:13:58,567 --> 00:13:59,875
I wore a mask.

230
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,075
There were no security cameras nearby.

231
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,208
My goodness.

232
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,542
Daddy, listen to this!

233
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:08,217
This was all planned.

234
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,934
This evil has to be stopped at the beginning.

235
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,834
- Daddy...
- All right, all right.

236
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:16,909
Let him eat breakfast.

237
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:21,959
Hsing Ssu has probably come back.

238
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,458
That's strange! Didn't you say you were busy? Why suddenly come home?

239
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,374
I knew there would be plenty of breakfast

240
00:14:29,374 --> 00:14:30,825
so I specially came to eat.

241
00:14:30,825 --> 00:14:32,375
Smart boy. I will get a bowl.

242
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,542
Okay.

243
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:35,833
- Dad.
- Sit.

244
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,860
- Here.
- Thanks, Mom.

245
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,866
Eat more!

246
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,125
After breakfast, I need to discuss something with you.

247
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,625
All right.

248
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:02,083
The fish tastes very good.

249
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,583
Okay.

250
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,000
I really didn't expect that guy to be Xiao Yeh's little brother.

251
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,066
It's his stepbrother. They're not related by blood.

252
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:14,166
It doesn't matter if he came with a stepmom,

253
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,875
they're still family.

254
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,333
What I really don't understand is

255
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,709
why attack his brother's friend for no reason?

256
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:22,358
Also, he attacked me and not you.

257
00:15:22,358 --> 00:15:25,450
That's because you are soft and delicate,

258
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,142
unlike me.

259
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,817
Do you think he has a death wish?

260
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:36,358
I told you to eat Chocola BB Pure (supplements) regularly.

261
00:15:36,358 --> 00:15:39,208
It has Vitamin B2, which maintains energy and metabolism.

262
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,791
It keeps you healthy.

263
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:44,000
In conclusion, men shouldn't only know how to speak.

264
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,709
Lost nutrients need replenishing.

265
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:48,249
I, for example, take these tablets daily.

266
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:49,183
Really?

267
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:52,692
When we ran the marathon last time, you lost to me by 27 minutes and 8 seconds.

268
00:15:52,692 --> 00:15:55,500
That means that my power and endurance

269
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,959
are greater than yours by 27 minutes and 8 seconds.

270
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,500
You have no shame.

271
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,874
Men should have thick skin.

272
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:05,166
Whether you have nice skin or thick skin, no one will want you.

273
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:08,300
This also has Vitamin C, which promotes collagen production

274
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,958
and keeps my skin in top condition at all times.

275
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,332
Come on. Feel it.

276
00:16:12,332 --> 00:16:13,499
It's free to touch.

277
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:15,559
There's no need to touch you.

278
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,566
If you don't touch me, then don't eat it.

279
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,342
Why do you have that expression on your face?

280
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:33,309
Someone asked me out for a meal.

281
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:35,517
Who?

282
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,792
I knew it fell to the ground at that moment.

283
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:55,625
Why did you attack my housemate?

284
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,959
I don't like him.

285
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,792
Even if you don't like him, you can't hit him!

286
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:02,458
Besides, you don't even know him.

287
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,542
He and Li Cheng take good care of me.

288
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:05,792
I can care for you too.

289
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:09,350
Fu Yung Chieh, I'm being serious right now.

290
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,700
I'm sorry.

291
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,065
I'm not the one you need to apologize to.

292
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:22,283
Okay. I will apologize to him.

293
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:37,817
- Did you come to my place a few days ago?
- Yes.

294
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,375
How come you have a key?

295
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,291
You left the key here once.

296
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,792
Before I returned it, I made a copy.

297
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:51,333
Whenever you want to visit my place, I will welcome you.

298
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,924
You don't need to copy a key secretly.

299
00:17:53,924 --> 00:17:56,625
I don't like your two housemates.

300
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:59,542
Where is this hostility coming from?

301
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:01,683
I like you.

302
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,624
I know you like me.

303
00:18:06,624 --> 00:18:09,700
We are family. I like you, too.

304
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:37,083
Daddy! What are you doing?

305
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,609
I want to ask you that question.

306
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:42,709
Let's go, let's go.

307
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,940
Hsing Ssu has been in

308
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,275
Yung Chieh's room for more than ten minutes. They still haven't come out.

309
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:53,300
They're talking.

310
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,391
That's why I'm trying to hear what they're saying.

311
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,608
Lately, Yung Chieh has been aggressive and

312
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:02,458
I'm afraid he will get angry at any moment.

313
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,208
I have to monitor Hsing Ssu's safety.

314
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,208
Mommy... Yung Chieh is your son.

315
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,458
How can you talk about him as if he's a criminal?

316
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,667
I'm not treating him like a criminal.

317
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:17,033
I'm afraid his humanity will slowly disappear.

318
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:21,375
It's not that scary.

319
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:25,125
I know my own son best.

320
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,875
His dad died early.

321
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,917
Before I married you,

322
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,174
he and I had a life

323
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:32,583
where we were disliked and rejected by relatives.

324
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:36,392
Now he's indifferent toward family.

325
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:39,583
Actually, he's indifferent to relationships in general.

326
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,983
He doesn't trust people.

327
00:19:41,983 --> 00:19:44,290
Also, because he's studying Medicine,

328
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:48,709
he sees people as just carbohydrate complexes.

329
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:50,708
I'm really scared!

330
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,567
Mommy...

331
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:55,917
Don't make it seem like Yung Chieh has no feelings, okay?

332
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:59,625
At the beginning, while he was very cold and indifferent,

333
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,666
he gradually improved.

334
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,249
He warms to people slowly.

335
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:05,350
Give him a little time.

336
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:10,583
All right, all right.

337
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,792
She asked you to dinner.

338
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:26,741
Why did you bring me?

339
00:20:26,741 --> 00:20:28,110
I...

340
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,583
To avoid discomfort.

341
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,641
The more, the merrier.

342
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,370
[Drummer]

343
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:03,967
Oh, I know!

344
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:07,133
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

345
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:23,997
Why would I have this sort of feeling?

346
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,692
What type of feeling, exactly?

347
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,208
You aren't enjoying that recent moment, are you?

348
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,891
Me? How is that possible?

349
00:21:37,891 --> 00:21:39,820
I just can't figure it out.

350
00:21:40,491 --> 00:21:42,317
Figure out what?

351
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,270
Nothing.

352
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,710
[Mei Fang: Be careful when you ask about his feelings.]

353
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,370
[Mei Fang sent you a photo.]

354
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,467
Teng Teng!

355
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:55,901
- There's nothing–
- "You must be happy to touch him,"

356
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:58,500
"but don't make it too obvious."

357
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,276
- "First, find out if he's in the closet, too."
- No. It's a misunderstanding!

358
00:22:01,276 --> 00:22:04,874
"I've attached a picture to give you some joy."

359
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,625
Why would she take such a photo? She even said it's to give you some joy.

360
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,457
Why would that make you happy?

361
00:22:15,457 --> 00:22:17,859
Happy? Am I?

362
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:19,582
Teng Teng, Mei Fang is waiting for us.

363
00:22:19,582 --> 00:22:21,367
Let's go back.

364
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,458
Answer me.

365
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,959
I will confess everything once we're home, all right?

366
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:30,892
I will tell you the truth.

367
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:42,175
Teng Teng! Teng Teng!

368
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,542
When did you touch my butt?

369
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,100
I never actually touched it. I just pretended to.

370
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:57,333
What about this picture of you touching my chest?

371
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,710
It doesn't look like a pose.

372
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,800
That photo? I secretly took it last time we compared chest sizes.

373
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:16,050
Why did you take a picture of my eyes?

374
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,291
Mei Fang asked what I think your sexiest part is.

375
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:21,442
So I randomly took a picture.

376
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:24,975
But your eyes are indeed really charming.

377
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:31,417
Teng Teng... Don't be angry.

378
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:33,625
Mei Fang misunderstood and thinks I have a crush on you. She's helping me.

379
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:37,458
But this beautiful misunderstanding made her initiate adding me on Line.

380
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,509
Did you know that she

381
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:40,792
originally planned to have nothing to do with me?

382
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:43,525
So I had no choice but admit to it.

383
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,959
If we don't interact, how do I pursue her?

384
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,139
This is just a strategy to gain time.

385
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:51,583
Besides, we're men.

386
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:54,558
Helping me with your chest and butt is not a big deal.

387
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,740
No!

388
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,917
How would I face anyone if the pictures were leaked to the public?

389
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:02,001
Relax.

390
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:04,567
In this scenario, it's my secret crush so all pictures are secret.

391
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:06,625
You know nothing. Even if they get leaked,

392
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:09,425
you won't be affected at all.

393
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:13,291
Have you ever thought about

394
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:16,375
how to end this scenario of you secretly crushing on me?

395
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,834
Yes. Simple.

396
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:20,649
With time, Mei Fang and I will interact and develop a deep connection.

397
00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:22,541
This act of me liking you will end naturally.

398
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:26,575
Then I will confess everything to Mei Fang. She will think I put my heart and soul into it

399
00:24:26,575 --> 00:24:29,501
and made great sacrifices.

400
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:32,083
How is it your sacrifice?

401
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,333
It's you who sacrifices.

402
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,641
Your sacrifice is the biggest.

403
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:41,700
Teng Teng... We are "good brothers."

404
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,625
Aren't you looking forward to standing on the wedding stage with me?

405
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:47,850
Please help me.

406
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:51,208
I will definitely regret this decision in the future.

407
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:52,291
You won't regret it!

408
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,125
If I'm happy, you'll have good karma.

409
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,925
"Helping others" is the foundation of happiness.

410
00:24:56,925 --> 00:24:58,458
Let's go!

411
00:24:58,458 --> 00:24:59,625
Why?

412
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,908
To execute the battle plan!

413
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:05,583
Come on.

414
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:07,675
Put your hand here.

415
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,833
Okay!

416
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:14,357
Close your eyes and pretend to be asleep.

417
00:25:14,357 --> 00:25:15,875
What exactly are you trying to do?

418
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:18,500
The scene is like this... You're asleep,

419
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,458
and I quietly sneak into your room and steal a kiss.

420
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:23,834
Kiss! I won't do it!

421
00:25:23,834 --> 00:25:25,542
Don't be scared. It's not real.

422
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:26,917
It's only pretend. Okay?

423
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:28,666
There won't be any contact.

424
00:25:30,191 --> 00:25:32,041
I have a bad feeling about this.

425
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:34,124
No bad feelings. Don't think too much about it.

426
00:25:34,124 --> 00:25:36,667
Just act a little more natural. I will keep my distance.

427
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:38,692
Look!

428
00:25:38,692 --> 00:25:41,008
My core strength is really good.

429
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,620
Hey.

430
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,834
You're too close.

431
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:47,458
We have to be close for the result.

432
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:48,375
Just this distance.

433
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:50,025
Don't move around. I won't touch you.

434
00:25:50,025 --> 00:25:51,883
Close your eyes.

435
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,866
Just pretend to sleep. Why are you frowning?

436
00:25:57,866 --> 00:26:00,191
I'm having a nightmare.

437
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:02,499
Relax, relax!

438
00:26:02,499 --> 00:26:06,500
This photo has to be beautiful and romantic for Mei Fang to like it.

439
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:22,691
Mu Ren, the attacker last time—

440
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:36,125
Should we go and find Fu Yung Chieh?

441
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:37,792
Of course, we should look for him!

442
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:39,709
Please, he's a medical student.

443
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:42,734
If he comes and joins us...

444
00:26:48,834 --> 00:26:51,834
See. I told you that Fu Yung Chieh studies here.

445
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:53,166
What's there to be so happy about?

446
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,750
Even though we found him, he might not join our club.

447
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,583
Let's just try.

448
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:59,650
Maybe he will give me face (respect) as his senior.

449
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,417
Let's go.

450
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:07,458
Hi, Fu Yung Chieh. I'm your senior sister.

451
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:09,375
Do you remember me?

452
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,750
Do you want to join the Dance Club?

453
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,850
I'm the president. I will take good care of you.

454
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,692
I'm not interested.

455
00:27:18,692 --> 00:27:20,667
Then are you interested in the Debate Club?

456
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:22,125
I don't have the time.

457
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:25,750
- The Debate Club doesn't involve too much–
- This is a place for reading.

458
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,908
Please stop talking.

459
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,700
Let's leave.

460
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,499
Fu Yung Chieh is the "Lonely Bird" of the Medical Department.

461
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,249
He won't join any clubs.

462
00:27:56,249 --> 00:27:58,332
We had to try.

463
00:27:58,332 --> 00:27:59,708
I thought he was arrogant.

464
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:01,666
I didn't think he'd be an iceberg.

465
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:03,399
He didn't even look at us.

466
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:05,292
Could it be that he likes...

467
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:07,999
Have you seen him get close to anyone in the department?

468
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:10,558
No, but let's start carefully watching him.

469
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:11,916
Indeed, let's go.

470
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:13,817
Let's go.

471
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,460
♫ Missing you, missing you, missing you ♫

472
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,220
♫  Shoulder to shoulder together ♫

473
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,090
♫ Missing you, missing you, missing you ♫

474
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,700
♫  An alternative kind of long distance ♫

475
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,520
♫ Missing you, missing you, missing you ♫

476
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,360
♫  This distance between our love  ♫

477
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,530
♫  The scenery of us holding hands, the significance of our embrace  ♫

478
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,020
♫  How we... how we are ♫

479
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,490
♫  Are so far ♫

480
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,700
Brother... What are you doing here?

481
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,350
Am I dreaming?

482
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,650
Let's talk outside.

483
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,207
I made arrangements with Mu Ren.

484
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:49,900
You need to apologize to him in person.

485
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,600
Okay.

486
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,124
You're not allowed to make any faces.

487
00:30:53,124 --> 00:30:55,399
It must be a sincere apology.

488
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:57,241
I will do that.

489
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:01,082
It's good that you're studying hard,

490
00:31:01,082 --> 00:31:03,425
but don't get too tired.

491
00:31:03,425 --> 00:31:06,400
Just now you fell asleep.

492
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,791
I understand.

493
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:12,708
Also, don't focus on only studying.

494
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:16,049
You should participate in clubs occasionally and meet some new people.

495
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:18,792
Having you is enough for me.

496
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,207
Brothers are brothers. Friends are friends.

497
00:31:25,207 --> 00:31:26,858
I don't care.

498
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,933
All right.

499
00:31:29,933 --> 00:31:31,124
Don't be late tonight.

500
00:31:31,124 --> 00:31:32,942
I will get going now.

501
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,300
Brother, I'm really happy you came to see me.

502
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,624
Okay.

503
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:58,025
When I have time, I'll see you more often.

504
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,316
I will be going now.

505
00:32:00,316 --> 00:32:01,208
Okay.

506
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:03,550
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

507
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,659
Don't tire yourself out.

508
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:11,091
Okay, I understand.

509
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:23,060
[Da Bar]

510
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,649
Wow, I'm so happy!

511
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:31,159
Do you want to eat together tomorrow?

512
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:33,566
Of course, that'll be great!

513
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,867
You sacrifice a lot for his love.

514
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,367
I was soft-hearted in the moment.

515
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:47,316
If he doesn't end up with Mei Fang, I will make him pay!

516
00:32:47,316 --> 00:32:49,332
I won't fail.

517
00:32:49,332 --> 00:32:53,575
Mei Fang just asked me to eat together tomorrow.

518
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,700
Bingo!

519
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,760
In order to thank Teng Teng, today's meal is my treat.

520
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:03,217
Let Yung Chieh treat us.

521
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:07,400
How can we let our new friend treat us?

522
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,040
I already confirmed the scent.

523
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,225
Do you still not recognize him?

524
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:22,833
Is it you?

525
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:25,017
L-Li Cheng.

526
00:33:25,017 --> 00:33:26,541
He's here today to apologize.

527
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:29,040
For my sake, can you please not hit him?

528
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,958
That's a different matter.

529
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:33,582
He hit Teng Teng so his debt must be repaid.

530
00:33:33,582 --> 00:33:36,082
But in consideration of you, I will do it softer.

531
00:33:36,082 --> 00:33:37,659
Let go of me.

532
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,082
Mu Ren, I'm really sorry.

533
00:33:41,082 --> 00:33:42,457
Please forgive my younger brother.

534
00:33:42,457 --> 00:33:45,374
He's a bit stubborn so he hit you.

535
00:33:45,374 --> 00:33:46,749
I promise, it won't happen again.

536
00:33:46,749 --> 00:33:48,457
Begging Teng Teng is useless.

537
00:33:48,457 --> 00:33:50,016
I promised to beat him.

538
00:33:50,016 --> 00:33:52,158
And I'm true to my word.

539
00:33:52,158 --> 00:33:53,700
Forget it.

540
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,980
He's just over possessive and scared of losing his brother.

541
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,900
As adults, we shouldn't be petty.

542
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,559
Okay!

543
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,624
Since Teng Teng says we shouldn't be petty, let's forget it.

544
00:34:07,624 --> 00:34:09,874
One day, let's fight fair and square.

545
00:34:09,874 --> 00:34:11,190
What do you say, Kiddo?

546
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,207
Okay.

547
00:34:12,207 --> 00:34:14,332
Li Cheng trains. You can't beat him.

548
00:34:14,332 --> 00:34:15,374
Hurry up and apologize.

549
00:34:15,374 --> 00:34:16,666
I will apologize after fighting.

550
00:34:16,666 --> 00:34:18,499
Fu Yung Chieh.

551
00:34:18,499 --> 00:34:20,275
Not bad.

552
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,410
[NT$1000 ($35 U.S.)]

553
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,482
This is all my money.

554
00:34:34,482 --> 00:34:36,124
Let's order.

555
00:34:36,124 --> 00:34:38,025
Anything more and you can pay for yourselves.

556
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,207
Are you really going to sleep there?

557
00:34:49,207 --> 00:34:51,908
You can come into my room and squeeze in with me.

558
00:34:51,908 --> 00:34:55,200
If you want to sleep together, there will be many future opportunities.

559
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,575
My birthday is coming up.

560
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:09,033
That's right, it will be your birthday soon.

561
00:35:09,033 --> 00:35:11,375
You're turning twenty this year, right?

562
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,675
Time passes by so fast.

563
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,617
Celebrate my birthday with me.

564
00:35:26,617 --> 00:35:28,659
Just the two of us.

565
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,667
Why "Just the two of us"?

566
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:34,874
Think of it as my birthday present,

567
00:35:34,874 --> 00:35:36,633
and taking me out to play.

568
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,367
Okay.

569
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,017
I'm full.

570
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,183
It's a good thing we have instant noodles at home.

571
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,457
I tell you, this is what's bad about letting "kids" pay for dinner.

572
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,416
They don't have much money and we fear hurting their pride.

573
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:03,617
We can't possibly be full from just this.

574
00:36:03,617 --> 00:36:07,100
I don't think he really wants to apologize sincerely.

575
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,941
He was just scared of Hsing Ssu getting angry.

576
00:36:09,941 --> 00:36:10,874
Why is that?

577
00:36:10,874 --> 00:36:12,916
He values Hsing Ssu a great deal.

578
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:15,274
He was happy when Hsing Ssu was worried about him,

579
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:18,200
but got angry when Hsing Ssu lowered his head to us because of him.

580
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,416
That's a brother complex.

581
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:21,374
No.

582
00:36:21,374 --> 00:36:24,391
It's a very serious brother complex.

583
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,582
Why are you covering my hand?

584
00:36:32,582 --> 00:36:35,243
I want to send another picture to Mei Fang before bed.

585
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,958
Thanks for your cooperation. Just leave the dishes.

586
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:43,499
I will wash them after I go to the bathroom.

587
00:36:43,499 --> 00:36:45,058
Good night.

588
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,833
Why are you just standing there instead of sleeping?

589
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:04,666
I was thirsty and needed water.

590
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:06,499
I dared not upset you two's little world.

591
00:37:06,499 --> 00:37:08,500
I was scared you'd be angry.

592
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,858
Helping him like that,

593
00:37:11,858 --> 00:37:14,416
could it be you really have feelings for him?

594
00:37:14,416 --> 00:37:15,582
What are you saying?

595
00:37:15,582 --> 00:37:18,283
No one helps his friends like that.

596
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,500
Are you looking for something to hold against me so you'll feel more at ease?

597
00:37:26,383 --> 00:37:27,916
You're overthinking it.

598
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:30,917
I like women.

599
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,700
I'm not overthinking.

600
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:46,700
When it comes to having feelings for a guy, I'm way more experienced than you.

601
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,391
Stop moving.

602
00:38:10,391 --> 00:38:13,383
You have to pretend not to feel it. Otherwise, Mei Fang will realize it's fake.

603
00:38:13,383 --> 00:38:16,207
I'm not a block of wood. How can I not feel it?

604
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:17,874
We can't always use pictures.

605
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:20,582
At the company, we need to interact periodically.

606
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:23,183
Then Mei Fang will think I'm making progress with you.

607
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,542
Not there! It's ticklish.

608
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,175
Why is it ticklish?

609
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:36,082
Is your neck your sensitive area?

610
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:37,342
It's not!

611
00:38:37,342 --> 00:38:39,666
In any case, you're not allowed to touch there.

612
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,547
Okay, I will find a different spot.

613
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:48,624
Stop dodging me.

614
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:50,416
You have to get used to my touch.

615
00:38:50,417 --> 00:38:52,499
We are both men! How can I get used to it?

616
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,900
Hsing Ssu, am I right?

617
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:58,083
I...

618
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,691
Let me try.

619
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:28,542
Is it uncomfortable,

620
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:30,459
or do you not like it?

621
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,750
It feels fine.

622
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,683
But maybe it is because we are brothers.

623
00:39:42,834 --> 00:39:45,874
Hey, Kiddo, I booked a place.

624
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:47,065
Let's fight a round.

625
00:39:47,065 --> 00:39:48,416
Do you mean now?

626
00:39:48,417 --> 00:39:49,900
Okay.

627
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,300
Why does Li Cheng have to fight?

628
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,208
Yung Chieh will never beat him.

629
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:10,433
Don't worry.

630
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:13,100
Li Cheng will know when to stop.

631
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,583
One round is three minutes long.

632
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:16,000
Three rounds.

633
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,400
Okay.

634
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,600
Hey!

635
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:43,982
Didn't you say Li Cheng would know when to stop?

636
00:40:43,982 --> 00:40:47,091
Your brother sneakily attacked Li Cheng first.

637
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,600
Hsiao Li Cheng, be gentle!

638
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:16,559
Are your legs weak?

639
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,200
Yung Chieh!

640
00:41:44,017 --> 00:41:46,250
Hsiao Li Cheng, didn't I say to be gentle?

641
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,200
I punched gently.

642
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,200
If I used my regular strength, he would have passed out already.

643
00:41:52,892 --> 00:41:54,475
He doesn't know boxing.

644
00:41:54,475 --> 00:41:55,975
You're bullying the weak.

645
00:41:55,975 --> 00:41:57,250
Do I bully the weak?

646
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,075
He attacked me when I wasn't prepared.

647
00:42:01,433 --> 00:42:02,966
We are even now.

648
00:42:05,642 --> 00:42:07,725
Yung Chieh, are you okay?

649
00:42:09,266 --> 00:42:11,406
I didn't expect you are someone who holds a grudge.

650
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:13,082
You kept punching the same spot.

651
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:14,483
That's a given.

652
00:42:14,483 --> 00:42:16,666
I hit him where he hit you.

653
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,808
I'm very protective.

654
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:42,917
I'm not in pain.

655
00:42:42,917 --> 00:42:44,417
It's painful! How can it not be?

656
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:46,717
If it's not painful, why did you fall on your knees in the ring?

657
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,470
Press down on this.

658
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:25,083
Why follow me in here?

659
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:27,342
It will swell without ice.

660
00:43:28,542 --> 00:43:30,242
Sorry.

661
00:43:30,242 --> 00:43:32,667
I lied.

662
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:34,725
I'm in a lot of pain.

663
00:43:34,725 --> 00:43:36,391
Can you blow on it like

664
00:43:36,391 --> 00:43:38,133
you used to?

665
00:43:48,391 --> 00:43:50,225
You're not a child now.

666
00:43:50,225 --> 00:43:52,141
But it really works.

667
00:43:52,141 --> 00:43:55,883
After you blow on it, it doesn't hurt anymore.

668
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,708
Yung Chieh.

669
00:44:21,709 --> 00:44:23,083
What happened?

670
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:25,643
Did someone hit you or did you fall down?

671
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:28,200
How about I help?

672
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:36,375
We have to be quick.

673
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:39,833
If Mommy comes back and sees you like this,

674
00:44:39,834 --> 00:44:41,808
she will be furious.

675
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:46,325
Can I help?

676
00:44:57,959 --> 00:44:59,359
Come on.

677
00:45:00,475 --> 00:45:01,457
Bear with me.

678
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:04,483
In a little while, I have a powerful magic trick.

679
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:10,775
Okay.

680
00:45:16,975 --> 00:45:18,375
Come.

681
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,950
Okay.

682
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:27,008
Next, I'm going to show you some magic.

683
00:45:29,558 --> 00:45:33,875
Pain, fly away. Fly to the sky and disappear!

684
00:45:39,892 --> 00:45:41,292
Done.

685
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,417
If you're hurt in the future, or you feel uncomfortable,

686
00:45:45,417 --> 00:45:47,000
you can always come and find me.

687
00:45:47,001 --> 00:45:48,833
I'll use the magic for you.

688
00:45:48,834 --> 00:45:50,234
All right?

689
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:02,300
Now let me help with the injury on your arm, okay?

690
00:46:03,433 --> 00:46:07,125
At that time, I thought you were really funny.

691
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:09,000
I was already ten years old,

692
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,100
not three.

693
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,308
That was my first time coaxing a child.

694
00:46:15,308 --> 00:46:16,749
When I think about it now,

695
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,825
I also feel a little silly.

696
00:46:18,825 --> 00:46:20,700
After that,

697
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,800
I picked times when you were on the phone with friends,

698
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,809
when you were watching the most exciting scenes on TV,

699
00:46:26,809 --> 00:46:28,416
or when you stayed up studying

700
00:46:28,417 --> 00:46:29,917
to prepare for exams.

701
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:31,877
"Help me blow on my injuries."

702
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,332
No matter what you were doing,

703
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:38,041
you always blew on my injuries.

704
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:40,333
So was it all on purpose?

705
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:42,441
Yes.

706
00:46:42,441 --> 00:46:44,383
I did it on purpose,

707
00:46:44,383 --> 00:46:46,583
and I paid the price for it.

708
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:47,959
I came to really like,

709
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:49,966
really like you.

710
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,509
I really like you, too.

711
00:46:54,266 --> 00:46:56,292
What I want isn't that.

712
00:46:57,892 --> 00:46:59,625
Then what do you want?

713
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:05,080
♫  Through this experience  ♫

714
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,010
♫ I don't have that natural gift in this life ♫

715
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:14,420
♫  Possessing a scar ♫

716
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:19,270
♫  I forgot to... ♫

717
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:27,780
♫ A promise tied to the chest ♫

718
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:32,780
♫ Paralyzed in place, unable to walk ♫

719
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:41,450
♫ Insomnia under the night sky with only one excuse ♫

720
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:47,090
♫ In the end, you don't concern me ♫

721
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:53,960
♫ Later on, it won't exist anymore ♫

722
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,640
♫ My eyelid brims are suddenly hot ♫

723
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:00,800
♫ I can only cherish the memories that drift in the sea of my mind ♫

724
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:08,460
♫ Later on, I laugh as I'm filled with emotions and thoughts ♫

725
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:13,690
♫ I'm content to finally understand for once ♫

726
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:17,090
♫ Even breathing is torturous ♫

727
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:20,460
♫ Lost within my heart ♫

728
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,450
♫ I've looked for all the exits ♫

729
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:27,400
♫ Yet I didn't find a reason to give up ♫

730
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,840
♫ All the fantasies have been broken ♫

731
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:36,350
♫ The memories will no longer flow ♫

732
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:47,500
♫ Turns out that the wounds you can't see are the most painful ♫
