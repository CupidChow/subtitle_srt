Just a second.

Come here.

18
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,450
Did you have time with your brother, like you wanted?

19
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,360
Did you get hit?

20
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,520
Were you hated for it?

21
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,210
You did such a mean thing. It's natural to be hated for it.

22
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,050
You have to be a little bit mean when taking the first step.

23

Do you feel like you were wronged?

24

If I get to be with him, I don't feel wronged.

25
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,420
I have no idea where your stubborn personality came from.

26

Happy twentieth birthday.

May I come in and talk?

00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,730
Thanks.

29
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,920
Are you okay?

30
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,420
I'm okay.

31
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,240
This stuff happened so suddenly today.

32
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,079
I'm sure you and Li Cheng are already aware–

33
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,700
That you're gay, right?

34
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,120
You like guys. So what?

35
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,699
I didn't mean to hide it from you both.

Hsing Ssu...

37
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,350
Do you think I came in to talk about your sexuality?

38
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,619
If you like guys or girls, how is it any of our business?

39

Your happiness is what's most important.

40
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,819
Must you really talk like that?

41
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:37,169
Do you even know how to make conversation?

42
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,819
The reason for talking to Xiao Yeh is not about liking guys.

43
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:41,359
We still have work tomorrow.

44
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:44,880
Get to the point and let Xiao Yeh get some rest.

45
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,080
Thanks, Guys.

What are you going to do with that boy?

47
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,549
Do you want help beating him?

48
00:04:56,549 --> 00:04:58,420
I'm not against it.

49
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,220
No need.

50
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,270
I just never thought that he'd be influenced by me.

51
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,320
"Influenced by you," how?

52
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,960
I'm guessing he knew about my sexuality early on.

53
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,459
His personality is cold. It's not easy for him to get close to anyone,

54
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:20,460
and his relationship with me is good.

55
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,220
But because we aren't related by blood,

56
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,480
I must have bewitched him,

57
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,570
and he thought that it was love.

58
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,410
What should I do?

I heard that Team 2 signed a celebrity contract.

65
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,770
They're going to beat us again this month.

66
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,269
By how much?

67
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:19,650
Because it's all inclusive, it will probably be by ten percent.

68
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,350
I'm asking about how much you bet.

69
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,370
Five hundred.

70
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,629
Do you have such little faith in yourself?

71
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:28,571
Increase the bet. Five thousand!

About the celebrity contract, not only did the company profit a lot,

80
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,419
but it even acted as an advertisement.

81
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,829
It helped out the company a great deal!

Yes. And let me tell you,

90
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:11,149
I heard that Vice President Kao sexually harasses the male employees.

91
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,949
Also, since Manager Teng is so attractive, rumors have increased recently.

92
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:17,140
He will definitely harass him. You need to protect him well.

93
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,130
- Okay.
- Okay. Thanks.

- That way everyone will work harder!
- Of course, that's fine.

- The more, the merrier.
- Great!

Shall we go to karaoke tonight?

103
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,309
Thank you, Manager Teng.

104
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,700
Are you that hungry?

105
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,120
- Manager.
- Eat up.

106
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,330
Vice President Kao has an agenda for me.

107
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,209
Believe me.

108
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,819
Mei Fang said he's sexually harassed male employees before.

109
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,599
How come I've never heard of it?

110
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,170
I've never heard of it, either.

111
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,019
Actually, I didn't know, either.

112
00:07:56,019 --> 00:08:01,380
From what I see, Vice President Kao's actions toward you are definitely obscene.

113
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,299
I think that after being with Mei Fang for so long, you've been brainwashed.

114
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:08,140
Now you think that every guy has a thing for another guy.

115
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,210
Any guy could fall in love with another guy.

116
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,700
Exactly!

117
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,639
It's not like that!

118
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,239
I think there's definitely a problem with Vice President Kao.

119
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:18,659
You should be careful.

120
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,949
Don't get into trouble.

121
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,690
I’m a man. How could I possibly be taken advantage of?

122
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,689
I think Li Cheng has a point.

123
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,210
Although we didn't hear rumors, there's "no smoke without fire" (a reason for rumors).

124
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,120
You should be more cautious.

125
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,250
Did you hear that?

126
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,169
Anyway I will also be there tonight.

127
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,996
You just stay away from Vice President Kao.

People will think you're trying to stop Vice President Kao and me from having a good relationship.

161
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,949
We work in sales. What's the point of having a good relationship with upper management?

162
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:54,350
Promotion and an increased salary are based on performance.

163
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,790
So are you trying to please Mei Fang again?

164
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,950
What does this have to do with Mei Fang?

165
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,669
You sneakily took photos or videos

166
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:06,309
to show that you're the top and I'm the bottom.

167
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:08,389
So it will match what you told Mei Fang.

168
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:09,880
Isn't that right?

169
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,090
Teng Mu Ren... I'm really just worried about you!

170
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,530
Don't make everything about tops and bottoms.

171
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,170
But by causing a scene like this, you're clearly labeling me as a bottom.

172
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,660
Never mind.

173
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,510
Whatever.

174
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,190
Good intentions really aren't rewarded!

175
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:51,171
Everything is tangled and he's still thinking about tops and bottoms!

176
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:56,460
Oh my gosh, how can there be such a narrow-minded person?

177
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,969
Nothing bad better happen to him.

178
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,850
Idiot!

179
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,670
So annoying!

180
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,320
Quick! Quick! Come!

181
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,440
Yes!

182
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,480
Not bad. Not bad.

183
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,660
You can't lose.

184
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,350
Come on.

185
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,369
Where's Manager Teng?

186
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,719
I don't know.

187
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,880
I think he wasn't feeling well so Vice President Kao took him home.

188
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,850
Whose home?

189
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,726
I think...

190
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,629
I asked you where they went!

191
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,300
I don't know, Manager. I really don't know.

192
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,660
Manager, what's wrong?

193
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,811
Teng Mu Ren! Hurry and pick up, Teng Mu Ren!

194
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,780
Vice President Kao's car!

195
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:57,500
Hey!

196
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,700
You b*stard!

197
00:13:08,593 --> 00:13:09,600
Careful...

198
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,300
Come on... come on...

199
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,800
Where is this?

200
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,500
Get on the bed. Lie down.

201
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,300
This isn't my home.

202
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,780
Here.

203
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,800
Over here.

204
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,500
Are you okay?

205
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,100
I feel very hot... (burning) hot.

206
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,800
Indeed. This isn't your home.

207
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,450
Sweetie. Are you hot?

208
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,900
Let me help you undress.

209
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,721
Good.

210
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:55,200
Sweetie, come here. I'll help you undress.

211
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,100
Go away!

212
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,700
Why are you crying? Hey!

213
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,600
Go away!

214
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,700
You don't want it, right?

215
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,000
You're mine.

216
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,000
Come on. Come on, my dear.

217
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,770
Go away!

218
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,200
- No!
- Give it to me.

219
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,400
No. Li Cheng.

220
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,600
No, no, no.

221
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,480
Go away! No. Li Cheng.

222
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,100
Li Cheng.

223
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,900
Who's there?

224
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,400
Wait for me to return.

225
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,600
That's enough! Who's there?

226
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,350
Who's there?

227
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,770
- Where's Teng Teng?
- How come you're here?

228
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,030
- Where's Teng Teng?
- I don't know–
- Out of my way!

229
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,530
- I really don't know.
- Get out of my way!

230
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,820
Teng Teng!

231
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,700
This is a misunderstanding.

232
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,500
You monster!

233
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't want this to be a big deal.

234
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,500
It's a misunderstanding... a misunderstanding.

235
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,300
You better get out of here!

236
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,000
This really is a misunderstanding.

237
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,300
Teng Teng.

238
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,000
Go away!

239
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,900
Are you still refusing my help now?

240
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,100
How much longer are you going to struggle?

241
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,000
No.

242
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,400
Li Cheng. Li Cheng.

243
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,100
I'm here.

244
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Teng Teng.

245
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,500
I'm Li Cheng.

246
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,800
Teng Teng.

247
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,300
Teng Teng. I'm Li Cheng.

248
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,400
It's me.

249
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,990
Li Cheng.

250
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,800
I fought off Vice President Kao.

251
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,400
It's okay now.

252
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,500
You're safe now.

253
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,700
I feel very hot.

254
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,760
Hot?

255
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
I will take you for a cold shower.

256
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,100
I'm so hot.

257
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,700
Come on.

258
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,000
One, two, three.

259
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,800
Come.

260
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,000
Sit here first.

261
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,100
I will run the water.

262
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,700
It will be ready in a moment.

263
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,300
I will wet the towel first.

264
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,680
- So was Vice President Kao transferred?
- Yes.

265
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,500
Mandy from Human Resources told me.

266
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,070
- Isn't that sudden?
- It is.

267
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,200
I heard he was reported for something,

268
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,700
and the boss was immensely angry.

269
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,000
But I don't know what happened.

270
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,600
Whats up?

271
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,400
Is something on your mind?

272
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,900
No, there isn't.

273
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,790
I'm just thinking about sales performance.

274
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,400
It's almost the end of the month.

275
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,780
Sales performance?

276
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,900
Speaking of sales performance, did something happen at the celebration party?

277
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Why would you ask that?

278
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,400
Are there more rumors?

279
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,950
Its not a rumor, but I just heard

280
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,980
that you returned to look for Manager Teng,

281
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,789
but he had already gone with Vice President Kao.

282
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,603
And you were so worried.

283
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,800
I heard this, too.

284
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,600
They said your face was as pale as a ghost.

285
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,450
That's an exaggeration.

286
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,900
It was because of what you said regarding the rumors about Vice President Kao.

287
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,420
I was worried.

288
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,870
So was there an incident?

289
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,240
Definitely not.

290
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,480
I arrived in time to take Manager Teng home.

291
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,100
Even if Vice President Kao wanted to do something, he didn't have a chance.

292
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,430
The Hero saving the Beauty.

293
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,700
There was no choice. I'm pursuing him, right?

294
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,320
That's not right. If you want to chase him, why keep having lunch with us?

295
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,960
You should be taking advantage of the opportunity and create good feelings.

296
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,000
What are you thinking?

297
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,100
I would love to do that.

298
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,900
- But...
- But what?

299
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,700
But recently, he's a bit shy.

300
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,600
Shy?

301
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,080
We will be using this hotel next season. You should take a look.

302
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,690
Okay.

303
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,750
President Qi.

304
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,070
- After that night where I acted as the Hero to save the Beauty,
- I think with your capabilities, will you want some special options?

305
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:13,181
- Manager Teng seemed to be wary with me.
- Without doubt, weddings must be special. That's great, President Qi!

306
00:19:13,181 --> 00:19:15,641
- We could always seem to keep a distance.
- Long time no see.

307
00:19:15,641 --> 00:19:18,511
- He didn't stand with me at the company.
- President Qi, relax. Manager Hsiao will

308
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:21,600
- As long as I moved a little close, he would move away.
- arrange a great wedding for you.

309
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,040
Sorry, President Qi.

310
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,100
- I wanted to ask him, but he didn't give me the chance to explain.
- Something came up. Someone will go over the details with you.

311
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,800
Fine.

312
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,030
- But would always watch me secretly, noting my every move.
- Sorry, President Qi.

313
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,770
Regarding the wedding-reception style, have you decided yet?

314
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,830
Whatever the wife wants is fine.

315
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,900
Then is there a style that you like?

316
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,560
This time Junwei is in charge of the project.

317
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,900
Wenqi, you and Daqiang should cooperate with him.

318
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,810
- Recently, even when I want to talk to him about business matters,
- Okay.

319
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,540
- he won't even look at it.
- Thanks, Manager.

320
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,001
Right, no problem.

321
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:55,920
- Whenever I called him, he would purposely walk out of my sight.
- And ask him later at the venue.
- Li Cheng, if there is anything...

322
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,281
- and pretend to talk to someone else.
- Okay.

323
00:19:58,281 --> 00:19:59,790
- So...
- Remember to set a time for a Design Team meeting.

324
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,500
- I just directly stood in front of him.
- I received your recommendation last time.

325
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,460
Wenqi.

326
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,530
- Then he found a random excuse and ignored me.
- Manager. Here's the information from the last event.

327
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,600
- Check over the report.
- Hi.

328
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,000
- Then tomorrow–
- Hsiao Li Cheng.

329
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,400
I'm busy.

330
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,900
Hsiao Li Cheng.

331
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,100
Sales Team 1. Conference room meeting.

332
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,700
Roger that (surely).

333
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,910
Success!

334
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,500
I think there's a spark.

335
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,300
What do you mean?

336
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,190
Manager Teng has feelings for you.

337
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,460
Are you sure?

338
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,800
Of course!

339
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,800
The more something bothers him, the more obvious it is.

340
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,410
You shouldn't be eating with us.

341
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,450
You should be with Manager Teng.

342
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,750
Indeed.

343
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,250
He's so shy. I don't want to pressure him.

344
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,060
This isn't pressure. It's wanting him to face you.

345
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,460
Showing him that you exist.

346
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,400
It's to let him know that where you are in his heart has already changed.

347
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,190
Fine. I get it.

348
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,700
I will keep at it.

349
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,900
Fighting!

350
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,400
Fighting.

351
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,700
Let's eat.

352
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,410
Yes.

353
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,800
If I eat a lot, my stomach will bulge.

354
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,400
Hsiao Li Cheng.

355
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,720
I have something to say to you.

356
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,300
Do you have time?

357
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,800
I don't.

358
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,300
I don't have a problem with that.

359
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,900
Let's go to the rooftop.

360
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,500
Rooftop, they go to the rooftop.

361
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
What's going on lately?

362
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,700
What do you mean?

363
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,700
Like right now.

364
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,120
Right now, how?

365
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,500
Isn't right now normal?

366
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,700
Are you still angry?

367
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,900
Angry about what?

368
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,100
The problem with tops and bottoms.

369
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,200
If this is what you wanted to tell me, then I swear that I'm not angry.

370
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,900
And whatever Mei Fang thinks is not important, either.

371
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,900
That's good then.

372
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,000
Let's choose a day. I will treat you to a meal.

373
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,860
Why treat me to a meal?

374
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,600
Because of that thing with Vice President Kao, I haven't properly thanked you yet.

375
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,600
There's no need.

376
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,840
- It's nothing much.
- Don't be so modest.

377
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,320
- Whatever you want to eat--
- I really don't need it.

378
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,440
We can eat at the teppanyaki place on Zhongshan Road.

379
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,600
- Haven't you wanted to try that place?
- No need!

380
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,700
It's about time to go.

381
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,600
I still have things to do.

382
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,600
Hsiao Li Cheng.

383
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,300
What's wrong with you?

384
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,770
What do you want?

385
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,900
You say you're not angry, but you keep making a weird face.

386
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,300
If it really upsets you that much,

387
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,100
I will be the "bottom."

388
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,400
Will you be the "bottom"?

389
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,800
You're only talking about it so Mei Fang can hear.

390
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,200
It's not like it's real.

391
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,700
Letting you pretend to be top is no problem.

392
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,700
Do you want to or not?

393
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,640
Hsiao Li Cheng!

394
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,900
What's his problem?

395
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,310
I've already stopped arguing and let him be top.

396
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:00,100
I want to invite him out to thank him, but he refuses

397
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,200
with a rude attitude. He's also impatient with me.

398
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:08,300
We've been friends for many years, but this is the first time I've seen him like this.

399
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,210
Maybe he doesn't want to be friends anymore.

400
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,640
That's not true.

401
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,200
When Li Cheng first came to the company, you mentored him.

402
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,340
Your lives are intertwined.

403
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,930
I'm sure you've seen his attitude toward me recently.

404
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:25,200
He acts as if I'm a disease, and he runs away as soon as he sees me.

405
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,940
Even in private he doesn't call you Teng Teng anymore.

406
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,700
See? I'm not overthinking it.

407
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,890
He's making it too obvious.

408
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,020
This feeling is really terrible.

409
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,000
Are you still angry?

410
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,200
Can we meet and talk?

411
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,100
What?

412
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,200
Nothing.

413
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,130
I think Li Cheng's change in behavior started that night.

414
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:06,500
That night at the hotel, did anything happen?

415
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,230
That night when I wasn't feeling well, he just kept me company.

416
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,540
Think carefully.

417
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,200
I think it was definitely then that something happened,

418
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,300
but you've forgotten.

419
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,460
That night... Vice President Kao drugged me,

420
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,400
and Li Cheng appeared.

421
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,900
I had a cold bath for a few hours.

422
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,270
You were drugged and you took a cold bath. Is that all?

423
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,800
Of course not. I also used my "right hand."

424
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,400
What about Li Cheng?

425
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,000
Was he always by your side?

426
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,900
Teng Teng.

427
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,300
Li Cheng.

428
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,800
What?

429
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,700
I don't feel so good.

430
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,550
I will help you adjust the temperature.

431
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,200
You help yourself out.

432
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,900
Li Cheng...

433
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,300
I...

434
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,100
I can be bottom.

435
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,400
What am I doing?

436
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,700
Why would I dream about that?

437
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,310
Yung Chieh.

438
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,860
What's wrong with you? You don't look so well.

439
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,710
I awoke in the middle of the night, and didn't get back to sleep until 6:00 a.m.

440
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,800
You woke up, why? Was it a nightmare?

441
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,900
Yes, I had a dream–

442
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,700
What was the dream?

443
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,200
Nothing.

444
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,530
Do you have so much time today that you cooked breakfast?

445
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:13,100
I have an important meeting this afternoon so I need to get to the office early and prepare.

446
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,300
Since I awoke early, I thought I'd make breakfast.

447
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,280
Here.

448
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,990
Try this health supplement.

449
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:28,050
Sometimes when things get busy, and I don't sleep well or feel great, I take this to feel better.

450
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:36,060
It has Vitamins C and B, and it can promote collagen production to help maintain healthy skin.

451
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,010
The small pill is easy to swallow too. Three pills a day is enough.

452
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,100
It's about time. I will get going.

453
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,780
Thanks.

454
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,210
Hsing Ssu. Just leave it.

455
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,200
I will clean up later.

456
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,600
Okay. Thanks.

457
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,800
Bye bye.

458
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Then I'm going... to wash up.

459
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,000
Right–

460
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,600
Yesterday I talked with Hsing Ssu about your recent changes.

461
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,500
I think it's probably "that" night which has made you feel awkward.

462
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,400
What do you mean "awkward"?

463
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,450
Weren't you by my side the whole time?

464
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:37,200
When I was doing that "thing," you were probably there.

465
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,500
Even if you didn't watch,

466
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,500
you probably heard some noises or something.

467
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,600
When I heard just now that you'd had a nightmare,

468
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,800
you didn't dream about me, did you?

469
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,900
Did you actually dream about me?

470
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,000
How would that be possible?

471
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,400
If I dreamed about you, how could it be a nightmare?

472
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,100
That night I was with you the whole time,

473
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,520
and I did see some 18+ (adults only) images.

474
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,790
But we're all guys, which means it's fine.

475
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,040
Right?

476
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,240
Of course, it was nothing. I'm very confident about my body.

477
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,330
I was just scared that you saw me and became envious or jealous.

478
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,230
Your figure is definitely quite good.

479
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:26,100
Your past girlfriends were very fortunate.

480
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,060
It seems you're "smaller" than me by just a little bit.

481
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,410
Who's smaller than you?

482
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,880
Don't you believe me? Let's compare.

483
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,920
Let's do it. Who would be scared of you?

484
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,740
Don't run away. Whoever is scared to compare is a little dog.

485
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,610
- You're probably the one who would run away.
- I'd never run away.

486
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,191
You're the one that shouldn't run away. Little dog.

487
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:46,020
You only have a small, small, small, small bird.

488
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,660
Hsiao Li Cheng. Are you an idiot?

489
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:53,300
Why are you touching a sore spot (sensitive issue)? Are you crazy?

490
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,800
That night, did he actually see everything?

491
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,600
When I was in "that" state–

492
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,600
So embarrassing!

493
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,900
How can we still be friends?

494
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,800
Please pick up.

495
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,920
Director, this is the floral arrangement I designed.

496
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,491
I considered the comments and made some adjustments.

497
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:30,910
Please take a look to see if it's okay.

498
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,150
Fine. I will take a look after the meeting.

499
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,800
Director, it's time for our meeting with the Photography Department. Let's go.

500
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,300
Okay.

501
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,400
Director, have you not been resting well recently?

502
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,790
There are dark circles under your eyes.

503
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,660
Director, you must take proper care of yourself.

504
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,180
Don't repeat what happened last time and get sick again.

505
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,081
Thank you for all your concerns. I'm feeling fine.

506
00:32:51,081 --> 00:32:53,770
Recently the department is more active, and it's busier.

507
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:54,990
I'm fine.

508
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:58,370
Sister Wang... Please make two copies of this document for the meeting.

509
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,800
- Sure.
- Shaofen, Yongxiang, the meeting is starting.

510
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,300
Okay.

511
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,070
[Photos from Fu Yung Chieh]

512
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,100
Director!

513
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,000
Fu Yung Chieh! What are you doing?

514
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,900
You came.

515
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,000
What the h*ll are you doing?

516
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,860
Are you just doing this to get my attention?

517
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,900
Fine! You got me here!

518
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,150
So get down right now!

519
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,270
Come up here.

520
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:57,800
What nonsense are you saying?

521
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,500
Get down from there right now!

522
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,010
I'm not jumping.

523
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:06,560
I just want you to clearly understand my feelings toward you.

524
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,700
Please come up, I'm begging you.

525
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,610
Come up.

526
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,190
Is it scary?

527
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,130
Of course. It's so high up here. If you fall, you'll die.

528
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,400
How can you still smile?

529
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,450
This is how I feel.

530
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,020
What?

531
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,600
When I was seven years old, I felt this way.

532
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,190
Dad suddenly died.

533
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,820
And for the sake of living, Mom was busy every day earning money.

534
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:26,280
I had to stay at my unwelcoming relatives' homes.

535
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:31,490
My whole world collapsed instantly.

536
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:38,170
It was like standing on the edge of a high place like this...

537
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,323
with strong winds...

538
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,350
but with no one holding me.

539
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,440
I was really scared,

540
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,440
but I couldn't show it because it would make Mom worry.

541
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,140
I could only stand there,

542
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,400
all alone, until I was ten years old.

543
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,220
And then you appeared.

544
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,990
Yung Chieh.

545
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,580
Yung Chieh.

546
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,309
When my mom passed away,

547
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:45,510
I would often come here by myself as well.

548
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:49,280
Dad was busy with work and didn't have time to take care of me.

549
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,200
Sometimes I felt lonely as well.

550
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,880
I was scared that if my dad remarried, my stepmom wouldn't like me.

551
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,230
But what scared me most was my mom being forgotten.

552
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,926
When Dad brought you guys to our home,

553
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:13,070
I realized that I was worried for no reason.

554
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,840
I like you guys. You're my family.

555
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,280
Brother.

556
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,040
Yung Chieh...

557
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,910
From now on, I'm your brother.

558
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,960
You can count on me.

559
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,110
I will never let you go.

560
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,430
Then let's go, okay?

561
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,540
I'm still standing here...

562
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,450
the wind is still blowing...

563
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,070
but you automatically held onto me...

564
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:29,200
repeatedly telling me that I can count on you.

565
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,800
That you won't let go.

566
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,720
Even if I'm completely frozen...

567
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,260
your hand is warm.

568
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,930
No matter how strong the wind blows, or how cold it is,

569
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:47,410
I can still feel the warmth you give me.

570
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,360
So please don't ignore me, okay?

571
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,970
I really like this warmth (you've given me).

572
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:02,130
I'm already unable to live without this warmth.

573
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:05,220
So don't leave me, okay?

574
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,990
Hi.

575
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,060
Are you going down?

576
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,950
I'm going to the client's place for a meeting.

577
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,540
So am I.

578
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:45,860
Hsing Ssu sent a message saying he won't be home tonight.

579
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,940
I know. I saw.

580
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,620
So there's only the two of us tonight.

581
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:58,269
No, I mean, there's only the two of us sleeping together... together at home.

582
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,869
Every time you're nervous you bite your fingernails.

583
00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:30,180
The elevator won't speed up even if you keep pressing it.

584
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,080
It's really cute.

585
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,380
What did you just say?

586
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,270
Me?

587
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:40,270
I didn't say anything. You must have misheard.

588
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,770
You can let go of his hand now.

589
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:34,220
This boy is like a pig once he's asleep. There's no waking him.

590
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,340
He slept all afternoon.

591
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,440
It's nothing.

592
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,449
He hasn't slept well for a few days.

593
00:41:40,449 --> 00:41:42,789
He's had only a few hours of sleep each day.

594
00:41:42,789 --> 00:41:48,170
It's probably caught up with him right now. He won't wake until morning.

595
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,060
Let go of his hand.

596
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,010
What if he suddenly wakes?

597
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:56,340
You can't let him hold it all night and not even eat dinner.

598
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,391
Mom.

599
00:41:57,391 --> 00:41:59,900
See. Nothing happened, okay?

600
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:03,470
At least finish eating and then put your hand back.

601
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,420
All right, let's eat.

602
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,970
Fine.

603
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:36,200
It's so rare for you to come back during the week. Have a drink with your dad.

604
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,320
All right.

605
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,670
Daddy, Hsing Ssu has to work tomorrow.

606
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,551
One drink. Just one drink.

607
00:42:42,551 --> 00:42:43,949
Mom, it's fine.

608
00:42:43,949 --> 00:42:46,430
Okay, you guys drink.

609
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,040
Look how happy your dad is.

610
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,540
When you have time, you should come back often.

611
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,059
Don't pressure him.

612
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:00,609
Work is busy so if you have time, get more rest.

613
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:03,050
You don't have to run home.

614
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,599
I will come back often in the future, Dad.

615
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,740
Don't force yourself.

616
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:12,310
But if you are coming back, let Mom know ahead of time

617
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:14,290
so she can make you good food.

618
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,740
All right.

619
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,959
Here.

620
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:22,130
Eat something first. This way drinking won't hurt your stomach.

621
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:23,830
I understand.

622
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:27,570
Mommy, you should save some leftovers for Yung Chieh.

623
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:29,640
Okay, I know.

624
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,241
Dad. Cheers.

625
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,379
Just this one drink, no more.

626
00:43:44,379 --> 00:43:46,830
You're so strict.

627
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:49,830
- How else should I be?
- It's only an occasional drink.

628
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,420
- Then you have a drink too.
- Mom, do you want one?

629
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,151
No, thanks. Watching you two drink is already making me happy.

630
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,940
Good morning.

631
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,140
Why are you so dazed?

632
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,200
Look at how you scared him.

633
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:51,289
Fu Yung Chieh, are you awake?

634
00:45:51,289 --> 00:45:53,590
Hurry and go wash up.

635
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,260
Are you still here?

636
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:03,410
Your brother slept here last night.

637
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:06,160
So have you come home?

638
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,260
Only for one night.

639
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,319
Not just for one night.

640
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:13,369
There will be lots and lots of nights.

641
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:15,540
I will let you come home.

642
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,009
Did you sleep until you became dumb?

643
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:20,799
If he wants to come home, he can do so anytime.

644
00:46:20,799 --> 00:46:24,040
Who needs you to let him?

645
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,540
Mommy...

646
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:29,020
your son slept too much. It's rare he's so dumb.

647
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:32,160
Do you mean dumb and cute, as the young folk say?

648
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,020
Not cute!

649
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,059
Fu Yung Chieh, hurry up!

650
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,230
Go to the M.R.T. (Taipei Metro) with your brother.

651
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:40,540
You'll be late for school.

652
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:44,979
Did you hear that?

653
00:46:44,979 --> 00:46:48,320
I said I'll let you come home. You don't need to be scared of anything.

654
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,810
Here. Sit down and eat breakfast.

655
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:23,100
What's wrong?

656
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,011
His eye hurts. An eyelash got stuck.

657
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:04,210
♫ A promise tied to the chest ♫

658
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:09,170
♫ Paralyzed in place, unable to walk ♫

659
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:17,860
♫ Insomnia under the night sky with only one excuse ♫

660
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:23,480
♫ In the end, you don't concern me ♫

661
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:30,300
♫ Later on, it won't exist anymore ♫

662
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,060
♫ My eyelid brims are suddenly hot ♫

663
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:37,190
♫ I can only cherish the memories that drift in the sea of my mind ♫

664
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:44,850
♫ Later on, I laugh as I'm filled with emotions and thoughts ♫

665
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:50,090
♫I'm content to finally understand for once ♫

666
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:53,510
♫ Even breathing is torturous ♫

667
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:56,890
♫ Lost within my heart ♫

668
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:59,840
♫ I've looked for all the exits ♫

669
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:03,820
♫ Yet didn't find a reason to give up ♫

670
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:07,180
♫ All the fantasies have been broken ♫

671
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:12,710
♫ The memories will no longer flow ♫

672
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:24,500
♫ Turns out that the wounds you can't see are the most painful ♫
