Manager, your package has arrived.
[Muse Weddings]

16
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,932
- Thanks.
- This was just sent over by the client.

17
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:37,501
Just take a look to see if there is anything that needs to be fixed.

18
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:39,866
Okay, no problem.

19
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:46,166
Hey, Chun Wei!
- Yes.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,332
Ask Zoe later.

21
00:01:49,332 --> 00:01:51,366
- I-I'm going out for a bit.
- Okay.

22
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:53,966
- Full cooperation.
- No problem, understood.

23
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:10,200
Why is it such a big bottle?

24
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,833
Manager Hsiao, long time no see.

25
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,200
Why such a serious face?

26
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,965
I just came back for a meeting.

27
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:38,700
I haven't been transferred back.

28
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,299
I understand now. It turns out he was your target, too.

29
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,665
No wonder you were so angry back then.

30
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:51,833
You made such a big deal out of the situation that I couldn't stay.

31
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,233
About the transfer,

32
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,033
I will pay you back for it.

33
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,933
Boss, there's new information.

34
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:16,598
What? Are you in a spy or cop movie?

35
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:20,332
Didn't you give me NT$5000 ($180 U.S.) to monitor Manager Teng's every move?

36
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:22,965
Speaking of which, give it back to me.

37
00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:25,332
He's already my baby now. Why would I need you to monitor him?

38
00:03:25,332 --> 00:03:26,532
You could say that,

39
00:03:26,532 --> 00:03:28,734
but there are always little secrets between couples.

40
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:33,466
Zoe told me that Manager Teng received a package this morning, and he had a weird facial expression.

41
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:34,966
- A package?
- Yes.

42
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:37,065
As soon as he received the package, he rushed out with a nervous look.

43
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:41,266
He also locked the package in a drawer.

44
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:43,033
What?

45
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:50,400
He is avoiding me on purpose.

46
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,532
Yes, there really is a problem.

47
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,332
So about those five thousand dollars…

48
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:55,665
You don't need to return it.

49
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:58,965
Tell Zoe to continue keeping tabs. Every piece of information is another thousand for you.

50
00:03:58,965 --> 00:04:00,566
Yes, Sir.

51
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,470
Chen Ming Chen is not lying.

52
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,140
If I were a girl, I would probably fall in love with him.

53
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,060
This picture is not bad.

54
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,610
Are you two dating? You seem very compatible.

55
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,940
- Not yet.
- Not yet?

56
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,650
Then you must quickly pursue her. She's so pretty, she'll be taken by someone else.

57
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,840
Do you like photography?

58
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,400
Why do you ask that?

59
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,200
I just want to know.

60
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,033
Teng Teng,

61
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:33,299
do you still remember when we said we would be honest about everything?

62
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:35,700
- That we wouldn't hide anything.
- Yes.

63
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:42,633
Then what was in the package you received today?

64
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,299
How do you know I got a package?

65
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:50,030
Don't worry about how I know.

66
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,700
Can you tell me what was inside?

67
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:58,666
Nothing important.

68
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,366
Don't lie to me.

69
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,934
Someone said when you got it, you looked nervous.

70
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,065
Don't overthink things.

71
00:05:11,065 --> 00:05:12,699
I'm going to take a shower first.

72
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:14,500
You're not allowed to run away!

73
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:17,633
Are you being blackmailed?

74
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:20,633
Did Vice President Kao send something to threaten you?

75
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:22,365
What nonsense are you talking about?

76
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:24,733
What does Vice President Kao have to do with it?

77
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:26,633
I ran into him today.

78
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:28,932
He already knows we are together.

79
00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:31,133
He even said he will pay me back.

80
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:33,065
Right now, you are the most important thing to me.

81
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:35,666
He will definitely target you.

82
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:39,600
I think he still isn't done with you.

83
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,433
Vice President Kao?

84
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:47,166
Could it be possible that he was behind the video of you and Mei Fang?

85
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,466
- After all, within the company—
- I don't care if it was him!

86
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,033
I just want to know what was inside.

87
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:57,765
That package really has nothing to do with him!

88
00:05:57,765 --> 00:05:59,966
Then tell me!

89
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,500
Okay, I-I will show you.

90
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,366
Did you buy all these?

91
00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:16,332
Did you buy this for...

92
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:19,466
That's right! It is exactly what you think.

93
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,499
Hsing Ssu wanted me to talk to you.

94
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:24,665
Didn't we have a fight because of that?

95
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:28,599
We are together now but the problem still isn't resolved.

96
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,032
Do you think it was easy for me to buy that?

97
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:35,367
I did so much research. I mustered up so much courage.

98
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:38,399
You insisted on asking. What is there to ask about?

99
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,065
Okay, don't be angry.

100
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:44,365
I shouldn't have forced you to answer.

101
00:06:44,365 --> 00:06:47,300
It was because I saw Vice President Kao at the company.

102
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,666
I was worried about you.

103
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,732
But I didn't want you to know about it so soon.

104
00:06:51,732 --> 00:06:55,266
I'm still finding a way to discuss it with you.

105
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:57,266
Yes, I'm at fault!

106
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:59,099
I was too anxious.

107
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:01,300
Stop being angry, okay?

108
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,966
I'm not that angry.

109
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,032
As long as you're not angry, that's good.

110
00:07:07,032 --> 00:07:10,566
Then... should we discuss it?

111
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,700
Okay.

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,799
About that problem...

113
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:20,665
Actually, I talked to Po Hsiang in private and got an understanding of the situation.

114
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,465
I think that since we are together,

115
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:26,900
then we shouldn't get too caught up in the issue of positions.

116
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,065
You... Are you saying you're willing to let me—

117
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:34,366
Honestly, I'm not very willing.

118
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:38,065
But since we are in love, some sacrifices have to be made.

119
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:40,000
Besides, you are the other person.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,333
I can mentally prepare myself.

121
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,399
I will think about it, too.

122
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:49,332
Anyway... Anyway, we just started dating.

123
00:07:49,332 --> 00:07:51,900
We still have a lot of time to discuss things.

124
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,032
That's right. There is still a lot of time in the future.

125
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:55,866
Let's take it slow.

126
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,033
Dad.

127
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:19,266
Are you feeling okay?

128
00:08:26,566 --> 00:08:28,533
I'm fine.

129
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,599
Have you come back to see your mom?

130
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,900
No, I came to see you.

131
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:38,732
I want to talk to you.

132
00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:43,100
If it is about you and your brother, there's nothing to talk about.

133
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,900
If you really care about your son, then you should talk to me.

134
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:03,066
Why are you always like this?

135
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:05,099
People who don't know you and people who aren't familiar with you

136
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:07,767
will think you're picking a fight.

137
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:11,066
I understand you so well, yet I still get upset when I hear you speak like that.

138
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:14,166
Sorry.

139
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,566
Okay.

140
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:23,266
Let's talk.

141
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,566
Why did you especially choose this place for a talk?

142
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,165
Because this place is where I called you Dad for the first time.

143
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:56,100
Right here.

144
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:02,665
At that time, you, mom, and my brother came to ice skate with me.

145
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,500
The three of you were like a family,

146
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,800
and only I hadn't assimilated (fit in).

147
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,032
You and my brother tried really hard to get close to me.

148
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:24,800
Sorry, I really can't remember this.

149
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,566
That's okay.

150
00:10:29,566 --> 00:10:32,466
The first time I called you Dad was just to try it out.

151
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,633
I didn't mean it.

152
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,933
I saw that you and my brother had a good relationship, and I suddenly became envious

153
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,966
so I wanted to try calling you that.

154
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:47,600
But it was different.

155
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,766
His voice contained his feelings,

156
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:53,366
but mine didn't.

157
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,999
Yung Chieh.

158
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:07,300
The two of us aren't blood-related,

159
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,666
but you know, I think of you as my own son.

160
00:11:13,433 --> 00:11:15,633
It has been so many years.

161
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,799
Do you really have no parental feelings about me?

162
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:21,799
How could you scheme against your brother like that?

163
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:25,166
Dad, I do have feelings for you,

164
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,566
but I just love my brother more.

165
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:31,633
You guys are brothers.

166
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:35,166
My brother likes me, too. He is willing to be with me.

167
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:41,166
Dad, you know my brother's sexual orientation.

168
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,966
He will be with only men.

169
00:11:43,966 --> 00:11:50,633
Instead of letting another man join this family, I am the best choice for him and this family

170
00:11:50,633 --> 00:11:53,600
because we're originally a family already.

171
00:12:06,366 --> 00:12:10,299
I originally thought that he would reject me for your sake

172
00:12:11,266 --> 00:12:13,733
because he clearly cares most about you.

173
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,966
But he's willing to be brave for me.

174
00:12:20,966 --> 00:12:23,800
He even said he wants to face this together with me,

175
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:26,833
to get you to accept us.

176
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:33,700
Dad,

177
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:39,232
is it that hard for you to accept us being together?

178
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,366
You're back.

179
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:17,232
Where did you go? I kept calling your phone, but you didn't pick up.

180
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,599
I thought something happened...

181
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,566
What's wrong?

182
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:26,466
S-Sit down first.

183
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:36,366
What's wrong?

184
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:42,033
Did you run into Yung Chieh?

185
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,100
What did he say to you?

186
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:02,865
That stinking brat! Didn't Hsing Ssu tell him not to tell you yet?

187
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:21,766
This family...

188
00:15:23,566 --> 00:15:26,033
You know about everything:

189
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,966
Hsing Ssu's sexual orientation,

190
00:15:29,966 --> 00:15:32,433
and the two of them being together.

191
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:38,100
I'm always the last one to find out.

192
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,233
Daddy, I'm sorry.

193
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,900
I...

194
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:55,866
We didn't mean to hide it from you. We...

195
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:59,033
We were scared you wouldn't be able to handle it if we told you.

196
00:15:59,033 --> 00:16:01,866
Lately, your health...

197
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:05,600
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

198
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:25,433
How long did you plan to hide it from me?

199
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:49,233
Is Li Cheng really willing to let you be on top?

200
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:54,300
Then he truly loves you.

201
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:57,166
I think so, too.

202
00:16:57,166 --> 00:17:00,832
Because when he was dating girls, he was always quick to make his move.

203
00:17:00,832 --> 00:17:05,732
This time he's going slow just so that you can be the top.

204
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:08,633
Teng Teng.

205
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,100
- Hsing Ssu.
- Yes.

206
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,799
How did your first time feel?

207
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,866
W-Why would you ask that all of a sudden?

208
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:35,266
Because... Li Cheng has this much resolve,

209
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:37,000
I should also.

210
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,732
There's no rush anyway. Both of us can think about it some more.

211
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:44,665
I can tell that you two are really in love.

212
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:46,900
I'm really happy for you guys.

213
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,466
You and your brother are, too.

214
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:51,333
You guys are happy together. I can tell

215
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,066
that he's very adamant about you.

216
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:56,266
He will definitely love you for a lifetime.

217
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,333
I believe he will.

218
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,666
Yung Chieh went to see your dad to "lay down his cards" (hide nothing).

219
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,533
Your dad is in a really bad mood.

220
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:16,066
He won't eat anything and is just staying in the room.

221
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:32,167
Manager, you came back at the perfect time.

222
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,900
I was thinking about calling you just now.

223
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,300
What's so urgent? Does Ms. Wong want to cancel the contract?

224
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,100
No, something happened with Manager Hsiao.

225
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,832
I didn't make profit as a middleman nor cause any losses for the company.

226
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,899
It doesn't matter what you say. The evidence is right here.

227
00:18:48,366 --> 00:18:51,599
Vice President Kao, where did this proof come from?

228
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:53,833
Someone who couldn't stand your arrogance

229
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,799
secretly collected the evidence to hand to me.

230
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,666
Then tell the person to come forward and confront me.

231
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,799
Let's see if this evidence is real or not!

232
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,932
Well, I have to protect my righteous colleague.

233
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:07,200
In any case, the evidence is here.

234
00:19:08,699 --> 00:19:12,599
Vice President Shen, how do you think we should handle this?

235
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:15,665
It is almost NT$5 million ($178,840). It is not a small number.

236
00:19:15,665 --> 00:19:20,866
To be fair and impartial, the company will hire a third party to investigate.

237
00:19:20,866 --> 00:19:25,966
Manager Hsiao, I think you should stay home for the duration of the investigation.

238
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:27,733
No!

239
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:30,732
Since you are conducting an investigation, Manager Hsiao has to continue to work.

240
00:19:30,732 --> 00:19:34,132
By not letting him into the office, aren't you insinuating that he is at fault?

241
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:38,798
Manager Teng, due to your current relationship with him, I suggest you don't speak up for him.

242
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:40,766
Otherwise, our colleagues will think you're an accomplice.

243
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:43,633
Nothing has been confirmed so don't make such casual accusations!

244
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:45,633
I agree.

245
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:48,866
I won't come to the office during the duration of the investigation.

246
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:51,133
Hsiao Li Cheng.

247
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:55,265
Vice President Kao, please keep this evidence safe.

248
00:19:55,265 --> 00:19:58,133
It will be important to prove my innocence.

249
00:19:58,133 --> 00:19:59,866
I will.

250
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:06,266
- No way.
- Does this mean that Manager Hsiao is fired?

251
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:09,766
- He wouldn't do such a thing.
- Li Cheng.

252
00:20:19,433 --> 00:20:21,733
You can't just leave like this.

253
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,766
It is fine.

254
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:29,700
We'll talk once you're home.

255
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,866
- Manager Hsiao!
- Manager!

256
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:39,266
What should we do?

257
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:41,866
That's enough. Everyone, go back to work.

258
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:45,500
Go back to your desks. It's nothing.

259
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,166
[Ji An - Food and Bar]

260
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:50,565
I already took Vice President Kao's evidence to the finance department for verification.

261
00:20:50,565 --> 00:20:53,000
It was very skillfully planted.

262
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,900
All the evidence is indeed closely or directly related to Li Cheng.

263
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:02,332
So what you mean is that Li Cheng's own cases, as well as the ones he helped with, all have problems?

264
00:21:02,332 --> 00:21:04,466
Yes, that's right.

265
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,133
That b*stard!

266
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:11,998
It definitely took him a long time to fabricate the evidence.

267
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,798
He was probably busy with that this whole time he's been transferred.

268
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:22,300
Do you even have a sense of crisis?

269
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,666
Mu Ren, don't be so angry.

270
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,166
How can I not be angry?

271
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:33,166
We are so worried but look at his attitude.

272
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,100
Hsiao Li Cheng, do you understand how serious this is?

273
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,333
If we don't clear this defalcation (theft) up, you'll not only have to leave Muse,

274
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,700
but also won't be able to work at any other company.

275
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:47,933
It is not that I don't care. I just think "the truth will speak for itself."

276
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:50,333
I didn't do it so the truth will definitely come out during the investigation.

277
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,133
How will you prove your innocence?

278
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:55,665
Vice President Kao brought his evidence. Where's your evidence?

279
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:00,100
Li Cheng, "gossip is a fearful thing."

280
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,465
You can't use the same attitude as before to face this situation.

281
00:22:04,465 --> 00:22:07,365
After all, Vice President Kao came prepared this time.

282
00:22:07,366 --> 00:22:10,365
I will find the evidence that proves I didn't embezzle the company's money.

283
00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:12,966
You have to take action!

284
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:17,265
I don't need to work for a while anyway so I will try hard and take action.

285
00:22:17,265 --> 00:22:19,233
Don't be angry, okay?

286
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:28,000
Which hand did you use to wipe your mouth just now?

287
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:31,866
This one.

288
00:22:34,966 --> 00:22:38,333
There are tissues here.

289
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:02,033
- Mom.
- You're back.

290
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:03,866
Is Dad okay?

291
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,400
He's asleep.

292
00:23:10,966 --> 00:23:12,766
Did you eat yet?

293
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,599
Yes. I've eaten already.

294
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:15,900
Okay.

295
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,665
Hsing Ssu, sit down. I want to chat with you.

296
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,433
Come.

297
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,598
You still haven't answered my question from last time.

298
00:23:34,598 --> 00:23:36,300
What question?

299
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:41,799
Is it because you sympathize with that brat,

300
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:43,200
see that he's pitiful,

301
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,466
and know that he has an unsocial personality

302
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:49,632
so you agree to be with him out of pity?

303
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,766
Mom.

304
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,100
Do you know what hurt me the most the day

305
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,433
after I slept with Yung Chieh?

306
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:07,366
Of course, it would be how he got you drunk and schemed against you.

307
00:24:07,366 --> 00:24:09,666
Didn't you even slap him?

308
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,000
Twice.

309
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,700
Well done!

310
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,033
The thing that hurt me most...

311
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,166
was he said that I'm not his brother

312
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,466
and he doesn't want to call me that either.

313
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,400
We aren't related by blood.

314
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:36,065
If I'm not his brother, then I'm nothing to him.

315
00:24:42,466 --> 00:24:46,000
Mom, I have a friend who once said,

316
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,133
"Love can occur from different perspectives,"

317
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:52,433
"at any time, and in any relationship."

318
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,366
What does that mean?

319
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:06,465
The love I have for Yung Chieh started out as me caring for him.

320
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:08,900
Those feelings

321
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,233
eventually became love.

322
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:16,333
In my heart

323
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:19,233
I really care about him.

324
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:24,266
I think I do love him.

325
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:30,500
Okay,

326
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,366
I understand.

327
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,033
Rest assured.

328
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,199
Love is forever.

329
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:39,333
I won't underestimate myself.

330
00:25:45,733 --> 00:25:51,833
- Okay then. It's late now. You should shower and sleep since you have work tomorrow.
- Okay.

331
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:57,000
Then about Dad…

332
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,766
Don't worry.

333
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:02,833
I will keep an eye on him and comfort him all the time.

334
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:04,533
Thanks, Mom.

335
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:06,066
You get some rest, too.

336
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,034
Okay.

337
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:09,566
- Good night.
- Good night.

338
00:26:37,966 --> 00:26:40,633
Dad, did you hear everything?

339
00:26:44,466 --> 00:26:48,299
Well, I helped you ask everything you wanted to know.

340
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:50,633
What are your thoughts now?

341
00:27:09,966 --> 00:27:11,800
Daddy.

342
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,833
When Hsing Ssu was going back to his room just now,

343
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,666
he kept looking at our door.

344
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:20,633
He really cares about you

345
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:22,966
and worries about you.

346
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:34,000
Do you think I care less about him

347
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,166
than he cares about me?

348
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:46,366
I think if you're still against it, then I suggest we continue the current situation.

349
00:27:46,366 --> 00:27:49,565
Let Hsing Ssu stay at home, and Yung Chieh continue to live elsewhere.

350
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:51,600
Out of sight, out of mind.

351
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,899
I just have one thought;

352
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:09,133
Hsing Ssu is my only flesh and blood.

353
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:12,600
I hope he is happy and blessed.

354
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:17,566
I hope that one day when I pass away,

355
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:24,700
there is someone by his side to keep him company.

356
00:28:26,966 --> 00:28:29,533
I know.

357
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:35,033
But that person doesn't have to be Yung Chieh.

358
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,866
Hsing Ssu is a really caring child.

359
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:45,500
He really, really cares about your feelings.

360
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,066
There are so many people who have come out of the closet nowadays.

361
00:28:49,066 --> 00:28:52,533
Why else would he have been afraid to tell you?

362
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,099
Daddy.

363
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,666
But you shouldn't change for them, either.

364
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,133
Your feelings are important as well.

365
00:29:05,866 --> 00:29:10,599
You first have to be okay with it yourself before we can discuss anything else.

366
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:33,866
Then... can you stop being angry?

Hello, Chun Wei, is there any news from the finance department?

369
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,733
Okay, I understand.

370
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:14,333
Thanks.

371
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,633
Po Hsiang, the file I sent you a couple of days ago, did you look at it?

372
00:30:20,633 --> 00:30:22,200
How is it?

373
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,266
Did you find anything?

374
00:30:27,366 --> 00:30:29,400
Okay, that's fine.

375
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,700
Thanks.

376
00:30:43,866 --> 00:30:45,766
Idiot.

377
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:48,433
Acting so carefree in front of everyone...

378
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:54,900
I have to find the evidence.

379
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,766
[Thank you. From Flower Studio]

380
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:06,065
Before, you said that there was a male employee who was sexually harassed by Vice President Kao.

381
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,166
Can you help me find that person?

382
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:10,799
I also only heard about it.

383
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,799
Actually, everyone has been very vague about whomever it is.

384
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,166
There's no way of finding out who he is.

385
00:31:18,866 --> 00:31:20,766
That makes sense.

386
00:31:20,766 --> 00:31:23,266
None of us had heard about it before.

387
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:27,800
That must mean the matter was kept a secret.

388
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:35,665
Manager Teng, are you trying to "get dirt on" (report) Vice President Kao to "turn the tide" (reverse) on him?

389
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:41,200
But if we can't find out who he is,

390
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,400
then it is all just talk.

391
00:31:45,733 --> 00:31:49,800
Well... is Hsiao Yay okay?

392
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:55,733
He says everything is fine, but he cares a lot.

393
00:31:57,933 --> 00:32:00,199
I'm really worried about him.

394
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,466
Did Manager Hsiao really embezzle money?

395
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:09,966
- I never expected that.
- Yes.

396
00:32:09,966 --> 00:32:11,633
One may know a person for a long time without truly knowing him.

397
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:15,632
Sometimes the person who looks the least harmful is the scariest.

398
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,166
Things are still being investigated,

399
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:24,298
yet they are already saying that Hsiao Yay is embezzling. They are too much.

400
00:32:24,298 --> 00:32:25,566
Don't try to reason with them.

401
00:32:25,566 --> 00:32:26,700
Why not?

402
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,165
"Gossip is a fearful thing."

403
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:31,000
After you confront them, there's going to be another person and another.

404
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,933
As long as there's no evidence to prove his innocence,

405
00:32:32,933 --> 00:32:35,533
in the end, everyone will conclude that Li Cheng really stole the company's money.

406
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:38,966
Then what do we do? Where do we go to find evidence?

407
00:32:44,433 --> 00:32:48,665
Solving a problem doesn't always mean tackling it head on.

408
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,833
We are almost at the office. This isn't good.

409
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:14,865
What's not good about letting them know that you like me?

410
00:33:14,865 --> 00:33:16,799
I don't mean it like that.

411
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,166
It is just a bit embarrassing to be seen.

412
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,966
Then just tell them that I'm your lover.

413
00:33:27,866 --> 00:33:30,799
Now you know how to flirt so well.

414
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,033
You're my boyfriend.

415
00:33:33,033 --> 00:33:35,000
You are, too.

416
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:39,960
You'll always love me, right?

417
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:43,666
So there's no need to feel insecure.

418
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:47,499
I've already accepted you, and that won't change easily.

419
00:33:48,633 --> 00:33:51,666
I'm actually still very worried

420
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:53,866
because Dad still hasn't approved.

421
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:56,999
I value you, and I value Dad as well.

422
00:33:56,999 --> 00:33:59,099
Equally?

423
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,032
If it was not so,

424
00:34:03,033 --> 00:34:07,965
then I should be very angry at you for going to see Dad yourself and I'd ignore you.

425
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,900
Sorry.

426
00:34:13,033 --> 00:34:14,699
Idiot.

427
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:17,966
I can't really get angry at you anymore.

428
00:34:17,966 --> 00:34:20,865
You're just the kind of person who doesn't play by the rules,

429
00:34:20,866 --> 00:34:22,700
but believe me,

430
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:28,733
you and Dad are equally important to me, all right?

431
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:33,500
I believe you.

432
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:40,366
Then this weekend let's go back and talk to Dad together.

433
00:34:40,366 --> 00:34:42,033
- That soon?
- Yes.

434
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:46,032
I'm already prepared and don't want to delay it any longer.

435
00:34:46,032 --> 00:34:48,366
This time we will do it together.

436
00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:50,733
Okay, together.

437
00:34:56,966 --> 00:34:59,533
All right, enough, we are almost at the office.

00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,266
What do you want?

443
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:15,166
Are you back?

444
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:16,866
It is so late.

445
00:36:19,633 --> 00:36:21,566
I'm a bit tired.

446
00:36:21,566 --> 00:36:25,998
Today I went to see a few people who have participated in similar cases.

447
00:36:25,998 --> 00:36:28,100
It took up some time.

448
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,000
Are you hungry?

449
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,666
- I will go cook noodles for you.
- Hey.

450
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:38,266
No need.

451
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,140
I'm fine with you just keeping me company.

Enjoy.

459
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:46,366
Did you make all of this?

460
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:49,933
Yes! My special love breakfast.

461
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,166
Then I will definitely finish everything.

462
00:38:08,966 --> 00:38:10,400
What's wrong?

463
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,266
Is it not to your taste?

464
00:38:12,266 --> 00:38:16,400
No, it's good, very good.

465
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,100
That's good then.

466
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,440
You've been working so hard the past few days.

467
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:25,965
Even though I don't cook often, I wanted to cook you breakfast to boost your spirits.

468
00:38:25,965 --> 00:38:28,033
Teng Teng,

469
00:38:28,033 --> 00:38:32,199
I've caused such a big mess yet you're still so good to me.

470
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:37,032
Don't worry. We will definitely find the evidence to prove your innocence.

471
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,466
I thought you cooked it only for me.

472
00:38:46,466 --> 00:38:48,465
What do you mean?

473
00:38:48,466 --> 00:38:51,698
Can I not eat the breakfast I made?

474
00:38:52,266 --> 00:38:53,933
You can.

475
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:02,600
It tastes so awful. How did you eat it?

476
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,233
Everything you make tastes good.

00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,166
Really!

479
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:12,332
After eating the breakfast you made, I'm like a video game character

480
00:39:12,332 --> 00:39:14,400
with full health.

481
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,932
Why are you forcing yourself to eat it?

482
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:20,066
I'm not. Although the "anhei" (dark or terrible) cuisine you made…

483
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,599
No, it is "an" (means safe) "hei" (means hey) cuisine.

484
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:25,832
It can keep you safe and also make you laugh, "Hey, hey, hey."

485
00:39:25,832 --> 00:39:30,799
I find myself full of energy, and I will definitely find the evidence soon.

486
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:37,666
I have faith in you.

487
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:50,833
Prepare to take action tonight.

488
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:52,600
Got it.

489
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,432
Who is that?

490
00:39:56,433 --> 00:39:59,633
Why do you suddenly look so somber?

491
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:01,866
It is nothing, just a client.

492
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:04,266
I have a meeting with a client later.

493
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:06,033
Take your time to eat.

494
00:40:07,466 --> 00:40:09,166
I'm leaving.

495
00:40:55,266 --> 00:40:59,966
Fu Yung Chieh, who angers their dad like this?

496
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:04,265
If you can't even handle holding hands, then what's there to talk about?

497
00:41:05,466 --> 00:41:08,900
Do you understand the feelings of being a parent?

498
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:13,365
Why is it that you only think about yourself? You're so selfish.

499
00:41:13,365 --> 00:41:15,933
Mom, don't blame him. He's still young.

500
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:18,066
Young, my butt.

501
00:41:18,966 --> 00:41:20,633
Mommy.

502
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:30,233
Whatever you want to say...

503
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:33,066
just say it.

504
00:41:46,433 --> 00:41:49,666
Dad, Mom,

505
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,733
Yung Chieh and I mutually like each other.

506
00:41:58,566 --> 00:42:00,866
We've decided to be together.

507
00:42:03,266 --> 00:42:05,400
It is not a rash decision.

508
00:42:05,966 --> 00:42:09,000
It is a decision we made after seriously thinking it through.

509
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,066
I hope you two can give us your blessings.

510
00:42:51,533 --> 00:42:53,500
Truthfully

511
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:57,966
tell me,

512
00:42:58,666 --> 00:43:00,666
in this world,

513
00:43:01,433 --> 00:43:05,133
how many people would be able to accept this reality?

514
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,833
I watched Yung Chieh grow up,

515
00:43:10,566 --> 00:43:13,300
from when he was a child,

516
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,199
little by little until now, where he's all grown up.

517
00:43:16,766 --> 00:43:21,533
He went from being a stranger to calling me "Dad."

518
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,533
He's my son.

519
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,666
Both of you are my sons.

520
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:41,766
Dad, I'm sorry.

521
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:27,066
I can't accept this...

522
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,433
but I'm willing to give you my blessing.

523
00:44:42,966 --> 00:44:45,166
Because as a father,

524
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:50,699
my love for you two is more important than my own feelings.

525
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:54,300
Hsing Ssu,

526
00:44:55,433 --> 00:44:57,833
liking men

527
00:44:57,833 --> 00:45:00,066
is how you were born.

528
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:05,200
I chose to continue to love you

529
00:45:08,766 --> 00:45:11,066
so because of your choice,

530
00:45:13,566 --> 00:45:15,466
I will love him.

531
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,733
There's one thing that will never change.

532
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,333
You are my son.

533
00:45:32,366 --> 00:45:34,699
We will always be a family.

534
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,730
♫ Even breathing is torturous ♫

535
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:52,080
♫ Lost within my heart ♫

536
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,000
♫ I've looked for all the exits ♫

537
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,920
♫ Yet I didn't find a reason to give up ♫

538
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,320
♫ All the fantasies have been broken ♫

539
00:46:05,666 --> 00:46:10,166
Dad, thank you.

540
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:19,900
Dad, believe me,

541
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,666
I will definitely take good care of Hsing Ssu,

542
00:46:25,233 --> 00:46:27,600
as well as be filial toward you and Mom.

543
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,200
Okay, enough. Why is everyone standing while talking?

544
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,333
Come, come, sit.

545
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:59,166
All right.

546
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:03,100
Now that Daddy's done talking, it is my turn.

547
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:09,965
As your mother, there are some rules you two must respect.

548
00:47:09,965 --> 00:47:13,399
Fu Yung Chieh is only 20 years old so he's still young.

549
00:47:13,399 --> 00:47:16,166
Besides, wanting us elders to see

550
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,765
you two being all lovey-dovey is asking for too much.

551
00:47:19,765 --> 00:47:22,800
We need some time to get used to it.

552
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,799
So before Fu Yung Chieh graduates with a medical degree,

553
00:47:26,799 --> 00:47:32,532
no indescribable things can happen here at home.

554
00:47:32,532 --> 00:47:35,233
I still have four years until I graduate.

555
00:47:36,799 --> 00:47:41,865
Daddy, four years should be enough time to slowly get used to it.

556
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,333
If nothing can happen at home then I will move out.

557
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:55,532
We just said we are a family, and a family should live together!

558
00:47:55,532 --> 00:47:56,965
You're moving back in today.

559
00:47:56,966 --> 00:47:58,333
Why are you like this?

560
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:01,065
One moment you say I'm still young. The other moment you say, "Young, my butt."

561
00:48:01,065 --> 00:48:02,366
You are contradicting yourself (literally slapping one's own mouth).

562
00:48:02,366 --> 00:48:07,333
So what if I do? Daddy is still the one who is earning money to support this family

563
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:09,999
so surely, what we say goes.

564
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,333
I have money, too.

565
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:14,033
Don't think you can act smug just because you have money.

566
00:48:14,033 --> 00:48:17,499
Do you have enough money to spend for the next 50 to 60 years?

567
00:48:17,499 --> 00:48:20,066
Don't forget, there's inflation in this world.

568
00:48:20,066 --> 00:48:21,900
What kind of person gives her son a hard time like this?

569
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,832
Me! What about it?

570
00:48:23,832 --> 00:48:26,033
Did you really give birth to me?

571
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:27,799
"I picked you up from the street"!

572
00:48:27,799 --> 00:48:31,200
I knew it. No wonder you yell at me all the time!

573
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,733
I-I don't yell at you.

574
00:48:32,733 --> 00:48:36,066
Dad, look at Mom.

575
00:48:36,066 --> 00:48:38,233
Look at her.

576
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:50,650
♫ A promise tied to the chest ♫

577
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:55,780
♫ Paralyzed in place, unable to walk ♫

578
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:04,430
♫ Insomnia under the night sky with only one excuse ♫

579
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:10,020
♫ In the end, you don't concern me ♫

580
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:16,900
♫ Later on, it won't exist anymore ♫

581
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,570
♫ My eyelid brims are suddenly hot ♫

582
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:23,710
♫ I can only cherish the memories that drift in the sea of my mind ♫

583
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:31,350
♫ Later on, I laugh as I'm filled with emotions and thoughts ♫

584
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:36,650
♫ I'm content to finally understand for once ♫

585
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:40,080
♫ Even breathing is torturous ♫

586
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,460
♫ Lost within my heart ♫

587
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:46,390
♫ I've looked for all the exits ♫

588
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:50,420
♫ Yet I didn't find a reason to give up ♫

589
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,710
♫ All the fantasies have been broken ♫

590
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:59,210
♫The memories will no longer flow ♫

591
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:09,810
♫ Turns out that the wounds you can't see are the most painful ♫
