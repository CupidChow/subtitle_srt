This can't continue.

My sudden departure yesterday caused trouble for everyone.

I'm truly sorry. Here...

Director, it's fine.

Fortunately, everything for the meeting was well prepared.

It all went smoothly for us.

I'm really sorry.

Are you okay?

00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,507
It was a false alarm. I probably scared you all.

Why do I feel this way about Mu Ren?

I even have feelings about those little things.

- Also, these feelings are very weird!
- Okay, okay.

Calm down a little.

48
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:39,075
All right... I will calm down.

49
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:43,750
Actually, Mu Ren has talked to me.

He also thinks you're being weird.

You don't call him Teng Teng in private anymore.

You call him Mu Ren.

I can't seem to call him Teng Teng

54

Can I ask, what exactly happened that night at the hotel?

58
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:11,509
Mu Ren said he doesn't remember anything.

59
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:15,350
Not all that much happened.

60
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,208
I just watched him masturbating all night.

61
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,017
You watched him masturbate all night. Are you serious?

62

- Why?
- "Why?"

63
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:27,108
How would I know "why"?

64
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:30,042
What's so great about watching a man masturbate?

65
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:32,066
Maybe I was possessed.

66
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:36,617
In the bathroom, I watched his every expression and his every reaction.

67
00:04:36,617 --> 00:04:40,483
Then... I even had a sex dream (literally "spring dream").

68
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,966
What? You "even had a sex dream"!

That's not it.

71
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,541
Maybe... you have feelings for Mu Ren.

00:04:57,108 --> 00:04:59,501
I knew it!

73
00:05:00,358 --> 00:05:03,016
I even watched my precious Yua Mikami and Asuka AV (adult videos).

74
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:04,166
The start was fine,

75
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,759
but when I had that tingly feeling, I instantly thought of Mu Ren's face.

76
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,459
Consequently,

77
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,192
I had even more feelings.

78
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:13,901
Don't feel so torn up (distraught).

79
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:15,650
Maybe that night bewitched you.

80
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,208
It was a just a moment.

Liking men is not that easy either.

84

Maybe you were just influenced by Mei Fang.

85
00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:37,302
You've been trying hard to create the illusion that you're pursuing Mu Ren.

86
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:40,000
So you're probably slightly confused.

Is that it?

88
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,825
Then how do I confirm it?

Before, you refused my offer to treat you.

Who would have thought you had a restaurant already booked?

94
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:06,625
Only an idiot would turn down a free meal.

95
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,734
Besides, I've already thought of a gift in return.

96
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:10,650
Could it be that you'll treat me to a meal in return?

97
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,525
Back-and-forth meal treats are so uncreative.

Not too many girls like that genre.

While I enjoy the horror-movie ambience,

Especially "Battle of Armageddon."

Is that true?

119
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:05,375
Did you find that the "human stupidity" described in the movie makes one think?

120
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,408
Exactly. That scene is very shocking.

121
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,458
Did the movie describe something about "human stupidity"?

122
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:17,101
The scene Gill probably means is where everyone sings together.

123
00:07:17,101 --> 00:07:18,891
Bingo!

124
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:20,166
You understand!

I didn't think we would be so similar.

126
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,453
If we get a chance, we can talk more.

127
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,974
All right. Let's not just talk. Let's order.

128
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:38,191
This restaurant is famous for—

129
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,691
- Dry—
- Dry-aged steak.

130
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:42,575
Its special characteristics are–

131
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:44,650
The juices and oils are more concentrated

132
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,650
so the beef is sweet and juicy.

133
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,191
It has better flavor and is more tender.

134
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:50,458
The recommended cut is–

135
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,483
T-bone.

136
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:56,133
One side of the bone is New York Strip Steak and the other side is a part of the fillet.

137
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:59,150
So you get to eat two types of cut.

138
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,850
You're an expert.

139
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,442
I really like steak.

140
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:04,500
I recommended this place to Li Cheng.

Thanks for today.

00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:20,859
There's no need for thanks. I'm happy, too.

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,775
I can't.

00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:53,100
Perfect. You two lonely singles can spend time together alone (idiom for "spend the night together").

What nonsense are you saying?

160
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:59,434
I'm creating an opportunity for you right now.

161
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:04,750
Then... let's go.

00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:30,958
I'm not okay.

166
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,275
What do you mean?

167
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:35,025
I'm very melancholic and upset.

168
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:38,559
I really want to punch myself and ask why I invited Gill.

169
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,875
When we ate just now, I didn't dare talk.

170
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,650
I just kept forcing myself to smile.

171
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,358
I was afraid I'd flip the table.

172
00:09:45,358 --> 00:09:48,941
So have you confirmed that you actually like Mu Ren?

173
00:09:48,941 --> 00:09:52,166
Xiao Yeh, it's not like I've never been in a relationship.

174
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:55,400
I know I'm already feeling possessive about Mu Ren.

175
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,250
I really want to hold him tightly by my side, and not let anyone else near him.

176
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,875
I still think that it's best to be careful.

177
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:06,050
Didn't you say that you don't want to lose Mu Ren as a friend?

178
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,567
What do you want me to do?

179
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:14,859
Do you want me to suppress and hide my feelings?

180
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:20,665
Sometimes, liking a friend doesn't lead to a happy ending.

181
00:10:20,665 --> 00:10:25,300
One mistake may lead to a lost friendship.

182
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,925
It can also lead to painful memories.

183
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:41,125
I got it!

184
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:44,692
The way to not lose a friend is not to suppress or hide my feelings,

185
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:46,842
but to get him to be mine!

186
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,400
Let's go.

187
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,575
Let's head home and think of a battle plan.

188
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:03,267
I'm sorry! I lied to you.

189
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,417
But it wasn't because I tried to trick you.

190
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,941
I just...

191
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:10,692
At first, I really wanted to pursue you,

192
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:12,050
but you were very against me so I—

193
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,959
Stop. No explanation is needed.

194
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,017
You've already said everything once.

195
00:11:18,983 --> 00:11:22,483
So... have you really fallen for Manager Teng

196
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:25,824
when you were pretending to like BL in order to pursue me?

197
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,233
Yes.

198
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:29,500
Oh, my gosh!

199
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,959
I want to share this with friends.

200
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,217
Can I take a picture with you and send it to them?

201
00:11:33,217 --> 00:11:36,941
Rest assured, our group is united. No one will forward it.

202
00:11:36,941 --> 00:11:39,683
I will send it and then immediately delete it.

203
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:41,417
Even if you keep it, that's fine.

204
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:43,250
One should be honest about love.

205
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,859
I don't hide things. Liking someone isn't shameful.

206
00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:47,483
So manly!

207
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:49,108
I know I'm very manly,

208
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,983
but don't be happy so fast!

209
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:52,858
I haven't gotten Teng Teng yet.

210
00:11:52,858 --> 00:11:56,741
Besides... I've never pursued a guy before

211
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:59,132
so I want to ask you for some methods and advice.

212
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:00,208
Of course,

213
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,150
I will definitely not hesitate,

214
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,941
and I will tell you all I know!

215
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:05,950
My friend will help you too.

216
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,500
Then I will be counting on you!

217
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,666
Once I get him, I will treat you all to a meal

218
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,083
and thank you properly.

219
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:15,166
There's no need. Thank us by chasing Manager Teng successfully.

220
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,542
- Fight!
- Fight!

221
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:18,691
- Here. Let's take a picture.
- Okay.

222
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,725
One, two, three.

223
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:32,473
All right... the first step is to get on his good side by buying him something he likes to eat.

224
00:12:32,473 --> 00:12:33,417
That makes sense.

225
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:34,692
Let's go.

226
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:37,782
Let me tell you, afterward, you need

227
00:12:37,782 --> 00:12:39,025
to be unexpected.

228
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,925
Make him feel...

229
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,058
What? You forgave him!

230
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,150
What happened has already happened.

231
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,317
Besides, he promised me

232
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:54,234
that he'd take me home.

233
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:56,792
If you want to, you can go home anytime.

234
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:59,934
He purposely got you drunk and took advantage of you.

235
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,342
Going home isn't that easy.

236
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,834
My mom passed away when I was in elementary school.

237
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:13,083
Dad and I relied on one another.

238
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,041
We have a very good relationship.

239
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:19,683
My dad always says, "A home with only two people is too lonely."

240
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,541
He hopes I will find a wife

241
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,118
and have some children so home will be more lively.

242
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:28,592
We've even discussed if it will be three or five children.

243
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:33,650
Is your Dad... still unaware you're gay?

244
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,817
I was afraid he would find out.

245
00:13:35,817 --> 00:13:39,458
That's why I moved out during college.

246
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:45,442
If we lived under the same roof, it would have been difficult to hide.

247
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:48,233
Can't you be honest with him?

248
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:52,083
I am really scared of seeing his disappointed look.

249
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,775
I'm afraid that my liking men

250
00:13:57,775 --> 00:14:00,208
will make him heartbroken.

251
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,450
I don't think...

252
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,583
I can bear his look of despair.

253
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,534
But you can't hide it forever, right?

254
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,183
I know.

255
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,249
But that's how cowardly I am.

256
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:24,330
I choose to escape and endure each passing day.

257
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,830
You're probably quite disappointed in me.

258
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,417
No!

259
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,617
How can I be disappointed in you?

260
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,083
Everyone has difficulties.

261
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,417
Something that might be easy for me

262
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:56,775
may be very difficult for you.

263
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:58,859
I won't criticize.

264
00:14:58,859 --> 00:15:01,000
My heart aches for you.

265
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,217
Thank you, Mu Ren.

266
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:15,717
But...

267
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,750
your brother getting you drunk is still unforgivable.

268
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,891
He's using your weakness to coerce you.

269
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,000
Yung Chieh isn't like that.

270
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,260
He doesn't want to coerce me.

271
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,734
He simply likes me too much.

272
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:36,734
Since he was little, he was protective of everything he likes.

273
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:40,959
For example, he wouldn't let anyone touch the toys he liked.

274
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,808
Even now, he still has those toys.

275
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:49,825
Hsing Ssu... you don't "like" your brother, do you?

276
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,859
I like him,

277
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:56,019
but not in the way you're thinking.

278
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:57,859
Are you sure?

279
00:15:57,859 --> 00:16:03,075
Love can arise from different perspectives anytime and in any relationship.

280
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,150
You two are whispering and excluding me!

281
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,417
As it happens, I don't care! I even bought you dessert.

282
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:16,750
I'm great, right?

283
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,434
Here, your chestnut cake.

284
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,000
It's really hard to get a cake from this place.

285
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,283
For Teng Teng, nothing is too hard to get.

286
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,417
You haven't called him that for a while.

287
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:31,900
How can that be?

288
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,400
Even though I've never said it aloud, it's always in my heart.

289
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,582
Has drinking coffee given you caffeine poisoning?

290
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:39,875
No!

291
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:44,108
My life has opened up and become clear. I've finally found a goal to pursue.

292
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:48,017
Also, I've even reached an agreement with Mei Fang.

293
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,726
So it's because you got closer to Mei Fang.

294
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:59,041
You can understand it that way.

295
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,250
It seems that the awkwardness between us is gone.

296
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,458
Awkwardness?

297
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,750
Was there any?

298
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,792
Definitely.

299
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:08,709
A few days ago, you didn't come home to sleep. Wasn't that because you felt awkward?

300
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:10,583
I even booked a hot-spring hotel online

301
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,024
so I could drag you along.

302
00:17:12,024 --> 00:17:16,400
I wanted us to be frank with each other and fight fire with fire (confront our problem).

303
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,542
Hot springs?

304
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:20,359
That's great! I like hot springs!

305
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:40,692
Here, eat some more.

306
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,750
Xiao Yeh... What you can't finish, give to Teng Teng.

307
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,750
This is mine.

308
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,900
Selfish b*stard!

309
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,650
♫ At the last second, love was still traveling through the city ♫

310
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,430
♫ In the next second, when the doors open, you and I meet by pleasant surprise ♫

311
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:09,250
♫ Calculating it, this probability may be one in ten million ♫

312
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,792
I can't anymore... too tired.

313
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:14,525
Men shouldn't say "I can't" so easily.

314
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:18,842
Only if he perseveres will a man's "other half" (partner) be happy.

315
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,041
Manager. Your strength is too good.

316
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,833
Sweating so much, your whole body gives off a manly scent!

317
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,333
What are you doing?

318
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,875
It's improper for two men, who aren't related, to touch each other (the normal idiom is a man and woman).

319
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,917
But your manly scent smells really good.

320
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:41,000
That's because I have a secret weapon.

321
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,792
This spray has long-lasting antibacterial effects.

322
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,608
It prevents body odor.

323
00:18:48,608 --> 00:18:50,709
The scent is from a French essential oil.

324
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:53,417
It's a woody scent.

325
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,442
How is it?

326
00:18:56,442 --> 00:18:58,150
Bonjour (French: "good day").

327
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,983
I also have a bath mousse that moisturizes the skin.

328
00:19:00,983 --> 00:19:02,982
It washes the body and face.

329
00:19:02,982 --> 00:19:05,163
It's light and non-sticky.
- Wow.

330
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,541
It does feel really smooth.

331
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:09,700
Don't touch.

332
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:14,680
♫ On the love line, the coordinates are ABCD ♫

333
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,301
♫ Two people, hand in hand, willing to bypass cryptic language ♫

334
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:19,835
Manager. Good news!

335
00:19:19,835 --> 00:19:22,000
Mr. Chen, to whom we spoke,

336
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,291
will let us handle the domestic and overseas weddings.

337
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:27,650
This means that for this month's sales performance, we will beat Sales Team 2.

338
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,483
We won't take the case.

339
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:30,626
"We won't"?

340
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:32,858
Manager, it's "Mr.Chen" who used to ignore us.

341
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:36,692
It's "Mr. Chen" who, if we sign the contract, will shock the company.

342
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:39,884
No matter how much we wanted this case before, I don't want it now.

343
00:19:39,884 --> 00:19:44,191
Why not? If our sales performance is great, there will be many bonuses.

344
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:45,542
Bonuses?

345
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:46,960
They'll wait till next time.

346
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,667
Manager, how can you have the heart to make yourself look good,

347
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:51,083
but delay bonuses?

348
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,750
Also, the NT$5,000 ($175 U.S.) bet I made

349
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,817
will be all gone.

350
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:57,983
Don't ever say I'm not good to you.

351
00:19:57,983 --> 00:20:00,191
This is for you. You'll be admired.

352
00:20:00,191 --> 00:20:01,834
I will repay your NT$5,000.

353
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,083
Anyway,

354
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:06,001
I can't steal my other half's spotlight. It's an iron rule.

355
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:09,141
"Other half"? Aren't you single?

356
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,050
Soon I won't be.

357
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:30,250
So perfect.

358
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,383
He will definitely like it.

359
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,660
[Li Cheng sent a picture]

360
00:20:57,417 --> 00:20:58,709
What is this?

361
00:20:58,709 --> 00:21:01,089
Why is he sending me such a picture?

362
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,075
I want to go, too.

363
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:08,041
You can't.

364
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,150
I won't be home this weekend anyway.

365
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,430
I wanted to let you know.

366
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,908
I want to also go with you!

367
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,567
Mu Ren only booked a room for three.

368
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:21,550
Which hotel? I will make a reservation right now.

369
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:25,617
Yung Chieh...

370
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,667
Stop chasing after me.

371
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:33,460
What happened before...

372
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:39,275
Let's pretend it never occurred and still be a family.

373
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:40,775
All right?

374
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:49,200
I thought that you'd never again mention that we slept together.

375
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:56,417
But now I'm hoping you won't mention it again.

376
00:21:57,542 --> 00:21:59,500
I can't pretend it never happened.

377
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,167
You're mine now so I will not let go of you.

378
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,842
You've just imprinted (recognize an object of trust) on me.

379
00:22:07,842 --> 00:22:11,566
Or maybe you're infatuated with me because of a moment of dependency.

380
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:14,592
That's not love.

381
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,378
You don't know me at all.

382
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,225
Yung Chieh...

383
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,392
What's up?

384
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:45,566
Zoe told me that your team purposely gave up a big client.

385
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:47,709
Is that true?

386
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:48,858
How can that be true?

387
00:22:48,858 --> 00:22:53,959
As salespeople, if we had a big client whom we pursued then gave up, wouldn't we be crazy?

388
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:57,150
Look at me. Do I look like a crazy person to you?

389
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:01,400
He's a well-known political businessman. I remember you mentioned him a few months ago.

390
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,402
You were even highly confident about getting him as a client.

391
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:07,500
Do you mean Mr. Chen?

392
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,333
He's indeed my target, but I haven't secured him as a client yet.

393
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm currently working hard to get him.

394
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,959
You know that those people with money and power don't even see us as humans.

395
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:20,700
They come and go as they wish.

396
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,800
But don't lower your guard yet. I haven't forgotten our PK (player knockout) battle.

397
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:28,634
Maybe I overthought things.

398
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,200
After all, you're a very competitive person so you wouldn't lose on purpose.

399
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,117
Do you know me that well?

400
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,100
Then tell me, in your eyes, what kind of person am I?

401
00:23:44,817 --> 00:23:46,100
You are considerate of your friends.

402
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,400
You don't worry about details, and you're very manly.

403
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,650
What else?

404
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,817
You do what you say.

405
00:23:52,817 --> 00:23:56,000
There is no changing your mind once you've decided on something.

406
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,233
That manly!

407
00:23:58,233 --> 00:23:59,833
What else?

408
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:02,991
Why do you keep wanting me to praise you?

409
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:05,201
Do you have so little confidence?

410
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:08,166
It's probably because your words more easily encourage me.

411
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:10,200
Oh, right!

412
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,800
You haven't told me what you think of my figure yet.

413
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,650
Speaking of which... What is up with you?

414
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,858
Why spam (digital junk mail) me with those half-naked photos?

415
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:24,000
How did I spam you? I only sent eleven photos.

416
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,300
I took over a hundred photos, but I only chose the good ones to send.

417
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,834
Why am I your background (wallpaper)?

418
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:32,174
Because you look handsome in this photo.

419
00:24:32,174 --> 00:24:34,100
Look at my wallpaper.

420
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,492
It's a picture of us.

421
00:24:36,492 --> 00:24:39,208
Two handsome guys, and they look like a couple.

422
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,650
But I think there's another photo that's better.

423
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:45,200
It's just that the picture is too dark.

424
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,900
Teng Teng... Do you want one for your cellphone's wallpaper?

425
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:51,501
No.

426
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,692
Why not?

427
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,692
Come on!

428
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:00,709
Manager!

429
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:03,150
Manager, don't kill me!

430
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:09,500
How dare you tell Zoe about our team's secrets.

431
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,800
I will not keep a traitor.

432
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,417
Manager, it wasn't on purpose.

433
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:15,609
Zoe is my girlfriend.

434
00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:17,542
We secretly have an office romance.

435
00:25:17,542 --> 00:25:19,525
An "office romance"?

436
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:22,100
That's great!

437
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,500
Let me tell you. I fully support people's office romances.

438
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:29,333
But... she's in Sales Team 2.

439
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,709
So what?

440
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:32,792
My future other half is also in Sales Team 2.

441
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:35,734
This way, we can mutually help one another.

442
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:39,125
From now on, get Zoe to tell you all the movements of Manager Teng in Sales Team 2.

443
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:43,000
Then report back to me, understand?

444
00:25:43,734 --> 00:25:45,334
Good boy.

445
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,600
Here... here is NT$10,000 ($350 U.S.)

446
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,042
NT$5,000 is to pay you back. The other NT$5,000

447
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:55,375
is a thank-you bonus for helping me keep an eye on Manager Teng.

448
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:57,609
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

449
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:03,500
Don't you think Li Cheng is acting weird lately?

450
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,225
I don't really think so.

451
00:26:06,225 --> 00:26:08,400
His purpose is quite clear.

452
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,900
If you think it's weird, try talking to him.

453
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,500
You're right.

454
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,875
When we go to the hot springs this weekend,

455
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,577
I will clear the air with him (have a frank discussion).

456
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:22,800
If this continues, I...

457
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,117
What will you do?

458
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,033
What are these?

459
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:39,100
My diaries.

460
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,400
From the moment I started liking you, I wrote in these diaries daily.

461
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,291
Everything is about you.

462
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:47,351
Your happiness, anger, and sadness.

463
00:26:47,351 --> 00:26:51,400
You can decide whether or not I know you after reading them.

464
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,500
This is the first time I've heard of someone keeping a diary to record another person's life.

465
00:27:28,591 --> 00:27:30,458
Today is Dad's birthday.

466
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:33,150
We all went out to celebrate over dinner.

467
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,275
Older Brother drank a few cups of alcohol with Dad.

468
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:41,390
When he's drunk, he starts to speak very loudly and laughs senselessly.

469
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:46,800
His movements are slower and his face is red. It's very cute.

470
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:52,200
From what I see, he gets drunk after three-and-a-half cups of Kaoliang (sorghum liquor).

471
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:58,100
So that's how he knows my alcohol tolerance.

472
00:28:04,741 --> 00:28:06,921
Recently, my brother has been very happy.

473
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:08,775
He is especially happy.

474
00:28:08,775 --> 00:28:11,950
He seems to smile every second of every minute.

475
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,475
I can feel that he's in love.

476
00:28:15,475 --> 00:28:17,359
He likes sky-blue

477
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:22,000
so he bought a sky-blue shirt as a gift for the person he likes.

478
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,308
I also want one.

479
00:28:24,308 --> 00:28:28,166
But right now, I can only look at the sky

480
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,908
and get nothing.

481
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:34,292
His cooking isn't very good.

482
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:38,400
He has tried to make pasta many times and has failed every time.

483
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,091
I will learn to cook in the future.

484
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:46,400
♫ All the fantasies have been broken ♫

485
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,810

486
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,600
"That" person came.

487
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,200
Today, I wasn't feeling well so I went home early.

488
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,633
I saw him kissing "that" person.

489
00:29:01,633 --> 00:29:03,817
It's a man.

490
00:29:03,817 --> 00:29:08,676
When I went to bed tonight, I heard him crying.

491
00:29:08,676 --> 00:29:10,521
He was really quiet,

492
00:29:10,521 --> 00:29:13,057
but I still heard him.

493
00:29:13,057 --> 00:29:17,267
I think it's because he has confirmed that he likes men.

494
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:20,108
That's why he is so upset and cries.

495
00:29:20,108 --> 00:29:25,700
I wanted to comfort him so I went to his room to squeeze into his bed.

496
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,700
He thought I'd had a nightmare so he didn't chase me away.

497
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,559
I held him, and he stroked my head.

498
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:35,883
He was smiling.

499
00:29:35,883 --> 00:29:40,171
I know he needs someone by his side.

500
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:48,359
That was second year of college.

501
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:04,633
He says he's moving out.

502
00:30:04,633 --> 00:30:08,268
Dad objects, and mom doesn't support it, either.

503
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:10,575
He's in a difficult position,

504
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,600
and I don't like it.

505
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,183
So I said that I wanted his room. It's bigger than mine.

506
00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:18,620
And as I'm nearly in middle school with extra work,

507
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,050
I need a big desk.

508
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:24,100
I threw a tantrum and said they favored him more.

509
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,790
Mom hit me, but I continued my tantrum.

510
00:30:28,733 --> 00:30:32,266
Today, Dad finally agreed.

511
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:34,725
Now his room is mine,

512
00:30:34,725 --> 00:30:37,483
and he can move out.

513
00:30:37,483 --> 00:30:42,158
Perhaps he will be less sad this way.

514
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:03,458
Did you sleep well last night?

515
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:05,183
It was okay.

- Is that little devil coming with us?
- Yes.

522
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:22,417
I asked him to come.

523
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:24,017
He's here.

524
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,509
This is for you. I made this fruit-and-vegetable juice this morning.

Thanks.

526

How come there's only one bottle?

527
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,825
There are three of us.

I don't know what vegetables and fruit you guys like.

No. Yung Chieh is right.

531
00:31:45,692 --> 00:31:47,332
He knows Hsing Ssu better.

532
00:31:47,332 --> 00:31:49,817
He knows Hsing Ssu "like the back of his hand" (thoroughly).

533
00:31:49,817 --> 00:31:51,917
Isn't that right, Hsing Ssu?

534
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,275
Are you jealous and spiteful because I understand him?

Too high in what aspect?

There are a lot of... body gestures.

that he's especially happy.

But I don't know why.

Do you know why?

570

I suppose that you could say I do.

571
00:34:41,983 --> 00:34:43,683
So what's the reason?

572
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:48,675
I think it's better if he tells you himself.

573
00:34:48,675 --> 00:34:51,042
Anyway it has something to do with you.

574
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:54,075
- Is it something to do with me?
- Yes.

575
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:06,400
Could he be trying to make amends?

576
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,792
"Make amends"?

577
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:10,608
Yes. He recently avoided me like the plague (kept his distance).

578
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,000
Now he's very physical with me.

579
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,250
Perhaps it's a way of making amends

580
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,950
so I will overlook the past.

581
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,400
It seems he cares quite a lot about me as a good friend.

582

Your brother actually forgave you?

That's really unbelievable.

It's because of love.

651
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:52,734
Before going into the hot spring, we need to wash our bodies.

652
00:40:52,734 --> 00:40:54,334
I know.

653
00:40:54,334 --> 00:40:56,292
Then you shower first.

654
00:40:56,917 --> 00:40:59,617
It's okay. I will wait for you.

655
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:20,683
Are you that shy?

656
00:41:20,683 --> 00:41:23,125
Be honest. Are you really small?

657
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:24,200
Who's small?

658
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,710
You're small. Your family is small.

659
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,233
Okay, don't get angry!

660
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:29,166
I've seen "it." Did you forget?

661
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:31,166
Whether it's how it looks when normally tamed,

662
00:41:31,166 --> 00:41:33,083
or when it's all powerful and fierce.

663
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:34,866
I'm very familiar with it.

664
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,760
Time to shower!

665
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,000
[(Rooms) 3210-3221, 3310, 3322-3323]

666
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:55,525
Have you read all of them?

667
00:41:55,525 --> 00:41:57,225
Not yet...

668
00:41:57,225 --> 00:41:58,709
but I trust you.

669
00:41:58,709 --> 00:42:00,875
You really do know me well.

670
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:03,525
Whether it was the heartbreak I faced when leaving home,

671
00:42:03,525 --> 00:42:06,367
or the sadness I felt after my first kiss,

672
00:42:06,367 --> 00:42:08,333
you understood them all.

673
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:13,850
Aren't you happy?

674
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,341
What's wrong?

675
00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:21,041
Am I wrong to say that you understand me?

676
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,959
Or are you upset because I said the words,

677
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:32,701
"first kiss"?

678
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:45,666
I didn't imprint on you!

679
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:48,490
And I'm definitely not infatuated due to a moment of dependency.

680
00:42:49,417 --> 00:42:52,041
Your effort to gain my trust

681
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:54,808
is why I fell in love with the warmth you gave me.

682
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:58,700
I don't know what love is.

683
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,800
I only know that with you, I'm content.

684
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,583
I want to keep holding your hand like this and never let go.

685
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:15,875
It's honestly that simple.

686
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,100
Listening to your words, I'm truly very touched.

687
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,700
But I don't know if my feelings for you are love or soft-heartedness. Yung Chieh—

688
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:35,100
As long as you give me the chance to pursue you, I will definitely make you fall in love with me.

689
00:43:38,834 --> 00:43:41,108
Are you that confident in yourself?

690
00:43:41,108 --> 00:43:43,659
It's because I'm your best choice.

691
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:54,933
What are you doing?

692
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,358
Your back is very luminous. It even reflects light.

693
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:01,975
So I wanted to feel it.

694
00:45:01,975 --> 00:45:06,600
If you want to touch me, then do it openly. Why do it in such a weird manner?

695
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:09,175
You're the one who said it.

696
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:12,525
I will openly touch you then.

697
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,900
I think we need to have a talk.

698
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,900
Sure. I have something to talk to you about, too.

699
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,000
You go first.

700
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Otherwise, I'm afraid that after I speak, you won't get a chance.

701
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,042
Okay.

702
00:45:56,667 --> 00:45:58,817
What's going on with you lately?

703
00:45:58,817 --> 00:46:03,900
Before, it was because you were pursuing Mei Fang so I was able to understand your behavior.

704
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,920
But haven't you and Mei Fang become closer already?

705
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,900
So your intimate actions toward me now are unnecessary.

706
00:46:13,792 --> 00:46:15,700
You're right.

707
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:20,900
If it were to pursue Mei Fang, then these actions are indeed unnecessary.

708
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:28,417
At some point, I thought you were trying to apologize to me.

709
00:46:28,417 --> 00:46:30,950
After all, you recently avoided me for so long.

710
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,483
Teng Teng... avoiding you before was my fault.

711
00:46:36,483 --> 00:46:38,701
I apologize to you!

712
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,500
Stop joking around! I'm very serious.

713
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,208
What are you doing?

714
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:48,700
Did you know that if I were a girl,

715
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:52,700
what you did to me moments ago in the hot spring would be sexual harassment?

716
00:46:56,709 --> 00:47:00,692
So since you are a guy,

717
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,008
then it wouldn't be sexual harassment, right?

718
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:24,150
♫ A promise tied to the chest ♫

719
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:29,120
♫ Paralyzed in place, unable to walk ♫

720
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:37,830
♫ Insomnia under the night sky with only one excuse ♫

721
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:43,450
♫ In the end, you don't concern me ♫

722
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:50,280
♫ Later on, it won't exist anymore ♫

723
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,020
♫ My eyelid brims are suddenly hot ♫

724
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:57,160
♫ I can only cherish the memories that drift in the sea of my mind ♫

725
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:04,820
♫ Later on, I laugh as I'm filled with emotions and thoughts ♫

726
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:10,060
♫ I'm content to finally understand for once ♫

727
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:13,480
♫ Even breathing is torturous ♫

728
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,840
♫ Lost within my heart ♫

729
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,800
♫ I've looked for all the exits ♫

730
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,780
♫ Yet I didn't find a reason to give up ♫

731
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:27,180
♫ All the fantasies have been broken ♫

732
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:32,690
♫ The memories will no longer flow ♫

733
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:44,120
♫ Turns out that the wounds you can't see are the most painful ♫
