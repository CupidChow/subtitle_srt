♫ No echo on a road that gets gradually farther ♫

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:18,700
♫ I wish for days with you in them, yet my wish can't come true ♫

3
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:25,870
♫ You were once my dance partner, someone who could read my mind ♫

4
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,810
♫ What a beautiful illusion! ♫

5
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,510
♫ Only you are worth my wandering faraway land that you mentioned earlier♫

6
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:42,520
♫ You're not by my side ♫

♫ Within my memories, I'm still revolving ♫

8
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:53,270
♫ In the quietness of late night, I'm revolving ♫

9
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,920
♫ With nothing to do, I'm revolving ♫

10
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:09,220
♫ Within my memories, I'm still revolving ♫

11
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,570
♫ You smile brightly, and I'm revolving ♫

[Episode 7]

15
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:38,500
We have tomorrow off.

16
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,433
Even if we drink till we pass out, no need to worry about being hungover at work.

17
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:43,533
You felt horrible last time, didn't you?

18
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,365
Yes.

19
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:48,400
From now on, let's not drink if we have to work the next day.

20
00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:55,466
Are you opening your treasured red wine for us?

21
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,465
What's the occasion today?

22
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,365
Before, when I wanted you to take it out and share with me,

23
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:02,433
you said I wasn't worthy.

24
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:05,400
I'm opening it because of Hsing Ssu.

25
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,640
Well... I have something I want to talk to you about later.

26
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,933
About what?

27
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:13,933
You can talk to me right now.

28
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:20,565
Mu Ren probably has something private to tell you.

29
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:22,300
Don't you want to hear it?

30
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,133
Yes! Of course, I want to hear it!

31
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:26,300
I'll listen attentively.

32
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,733
Then... can you bring out the most expensive bottle?

33
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,866
You're still not worthy of the most expensive bottle.

34
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:44,932
Brothers, Mei Fang just asked if I am free.

35
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:47,266
She has a friend who needs help. I'm going to go.

36
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:49,401
- Is it serious?
- Do you want us to go with you?

37
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:52,833
That's okay. I can take care of it myself. I'll be back later.

38
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:56,599
Oh, right! Don't drink all the red wine. Save some for me.

39
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,166
That depends on how quickly you can return.

40
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,666
I will be right back!

41
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,166
I'm leaving now.

42
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:10,466
The red wine will start oxidizing as soon as it's in contact with air.

43
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:13,599
- We should probably wait for him to return before opening it.
- Okay.

44
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,566
Of course. No problem.

45
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:17,366
Let's eat.

46
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:34,632
Should we call him to ask when he's coming back?

47
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:35,933
No need.

48
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:38,233
We didn't finish eating anyway.

49
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:58,000
Li Cheng just replied.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,300
He said not to wait for him.

51
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:05,806
Then let's not wait any longer.

52
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,466
Let's drink all the red wine and not save a single drop for him.

53
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:16,066
Sorry for waking you up.

54
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,133
Did you come home just now?

55
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:24,700
Mei Fang's friend is going through... I guess you can consider it a breakup.

56
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,333
We stayed with her the whole night.

57
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,733
What "consider it a breakup"?

58
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,533
What does that mean?

59
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,500
It's a long story.

60
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,166
I'll tell you later.

61
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,932
We consoled her until morning and barely slept.

62
00:05:35,932 --> 00:05:38,566
I'm super tired right now so I'm going to catch up on sleep.

63
00:05:38,566 --> 00:05:40,599
Did you shower already?

64
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,300
Yes.

65
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,333
I became very sleepy halfway through so I showered to stay awake.

66
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:50,133
To tell you the truth, your nose is really sensitive.

67
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:07,900
It's the scent of a hotel shower gel.

68
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,600
One bag.

69
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:14,932
My parents like to eat this, too.

70
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:16,533
Hey, I'm going to look over there.

71
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:18,333
Okay.

72
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,166
- If they like it, then take it back with you for them.
- Okay.

73
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,333
What else is missing at home?

74
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,533
Toothpaste?

75
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:29,333
We still have toothpaste.

76
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:33,833
If we still have toothpaste, then...

77
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:36,799
supplements.

78
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,166
You can buy Centrum (multivitamins). The name is auspicious ("cherished kindness" in Chinese).

79
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,853
Old people can take it, and you can take it as well. You're always staying up late.

80
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:44,333
Centrum…

81
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,900
Here.

82
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,233
For adults.

83
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,865
Studying medicine, Yung Chieh was really tired recently, too.

84
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:55,266
When I send him a message, he doesn't reply until the middle of the night.

85
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:57,000
He's probably staying up late every day.

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,700
Speaking of him, that little devil didn't come to see us for a long time now.

87
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,166
That's why I'm going home today to see them.

88
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:07,665
I might stay home and not come back for the night.

89
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:11,966
Are you missing your little brother?

90
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:14,265
He's family so I miss him, of course.

91
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:16,333
I never saw you miss him this much before.

92
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,933
You're even planning on staying home for the night.

93
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:24,032
Before, I just... kept it to myself. Now, it's all the same.

94
00:07:24,032 --> 00:07:26,866
Okay. Whatever you say.

95
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:32,399
What's he doing?

96
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:38,265
He seemed a bit unhappy when you didn't return yesterday.

97
00:07:38,265 --> 00:07:40,233
He drank the whole bottle of red wine by himself.

98
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:43,200
The whole bottle? Was not a single drop of wine left?

99
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:46,766
Xiao Yeh,

100
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,200
why didn't you save some for me?

101
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,266
I can't drink that well. So he drank it all by himself.

102
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,299
So is he angry right now?

103
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:03,133
That's not right. He doesn't seem unhappy.

104
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:08,433
If he were truly angry, he'd glare at you the whole time. It would freeze you to death.

105
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:16,399
H-He doesn't seem angry, just a bit unhappy.

106
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,000
What's there to be unhappy about?

107
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,833
I got it!

108
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,465
Last night, didn't he say he wanted to talk to me about something?

109
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:26,533
I ended up not coming back all night.

110
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:29,066
That's right. You should quickly go ask him what he wanted to tell you.

111
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:30,533
All right.

112
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:39,966
It's not this scent.

113
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:45,366
That scent seemed a bit cheap, as if it came from the shower of a hotel or motel.

114
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,866
But didn't he go see Mei Fang and her friend?

115
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:59,533
Rose scented?

116
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:02,366
Don't you dislike such strong scents?

117
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:05,066
You like the pomelo scent.

118
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:08,566
I just... want to change it from time to time.

119
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,466
By the way,

120
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:16,366
this morning, I smelled the shower gel you used.

121
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:18,000
The scent was not bad.

122
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,266
I wonder what the brand is.

123
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:23,100
I didn't pay attention to the brand.

124
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,366
I just used what was there.

125
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:26,900
By the way,

126
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,532
didn't you have something to tell me last night? What was it?

127
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,933
This isn't a good place to chat.

128
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:38,500
Here...

129
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,833
You're right. Let's talk when we get home.

130
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:47,665
- Xiao Yeh won't be home tonight so we can have a good talk.
- Okay.

131
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:48,766
Let's go.

132
00:09:48,766 --> 00:09:50,866
Xiao Yeh probably finished shopping.

133
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:58,433
Manager Teng.

134
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:01,699
I'm not spreading rumors. They really are together.

135
00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:04,499
They even booked a hotel room.

136
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,699
Xiao Yeh, did you finish shopping?

137
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:32,765
Did you see the video sent to the company's group chat?

138
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,533
What video?

139
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:38,333
You and Mei Fang were filmed.

140
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,633
Who would be so bored to film this?

141
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:48,166
Did you and Mei Fang really get a room last night?

142
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,666
Of course not. Mei Fang's friend was staying at this hotel.

143
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:55,265
We went to see her, but she had just gone out and left the key at the front desk.

144
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,366
I'll explain later. I'm going to call her.

145
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:03,966
Hello, Mei Fang.

146
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:05,966
Yes, I saw it.

147
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,666
Okay. Calm down first.

148
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,166
I will meet you.

149
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,100
See you later.

150
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,332
Before, there were already negative rumors about Mei Fang.

151
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:15,865
You need to be careful when dealing with this.

152
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:17,766
All right. I know. I'll get going first.

153
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:19,333
Mu Ren...

154
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,966
Where's Mu Ren?

155
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:23,400
You go ahead. I will tell him for you.

156
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,940
I'll leave it to you then.

157
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,799
Hsu Shao Fen really went too far in sending it directly to the company's group chat.

158
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,399
She clearly wants me to die.

159
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,733
I, the empress, will not surrender.

160
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:36,600
Empress?

161
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,132
You're watching too many palace dramas.

162
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,465
No, I don't.

163
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:45,133
Anyway, when I fought with her before, she went around saying I was pestering you.

164
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:48,666
She even took pictures of us as proof. She's so clueless!

165
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,440
What's wrong?

166
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,632
I'm thinking...

167
00:11:56,632 --> 00:12:00,666
about how she could follow you all day and film us.

168
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,265
I think it's very strange, too.

169
00:12:02,265 --> 00:12:03,965
How does she know my schedule?

170
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:06,966
Would she be free to follow me all day?

171
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:10,766
Or did she plant a tracking device on me?

172
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,432
We must investigate this matter thoroughly.

173
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:19,766
Someone is definitely viciously attacking you.

174
00:12:19,766 --> 00:12:22,899
Then what do we do now? We need to clarify this quickly.

175
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:26,200
Right now, the more we say, the more mistakes we will make. There's no need to clarify things.

176
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,500
After all, the harsh reality is that we were filmed.

177
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,699
I think we can pretend to be together for now.

178
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:34,065
No way!

179
00:12:34,065 --> 00:12:35,399
What's wrong?

180
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,267
We'll just pretend to be together. Why are you so upset?

181
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:39,065
Did you forget about Manager Teng?

182
00:12:39,065 --> 00:12:41,866
You two just improved your relationship a bit and resumed your friendship.

183
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:44,432
Now you want to say you are with me.

184
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:47,934
If he really misunderstands, then you won't have a chance with him!

185
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,866
I had no chance long ago.

186
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,866
He is only willing to be friends with me.

187
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,000
But…

188
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,200
Now's not the time to discuss Mu Ren and me.

189
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,466
I think there's something very wrong with this situation.

190
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:09,200
So what we must do first is define who the enemy is.

191
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,666
Do you have a plan?

192
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,066
I think a junior schoolmate of mine can help.

193
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,300
Li Cheng.

194
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,966
I'm here.

195
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,034
Don't make a fool of yourself.

196
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:09,967
Why are you so sure I'm making a fool of myself?

197
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:12,947
If you thought it was disgusting, you would've already punched me.

198
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:18,430
I don't want to lose a friend.

199
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,633
So I will end things here.

200
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,830
♫ Lost within my heart ♫

201
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,820
♫ I've looked for all the exits ♫

202
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,800
♫ Yet I didn't find a reason to give up ♫

203
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,120
♫ All the fantasies have been broken ♫

204
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,660
♫ The memories will no longer flow ♫

205
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:52,470
♫ Turns out that the wounds you can't see are the most painful ♫

206
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,820
♫ Even breathing is torturous ♫

207
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,210
♫ Lost within my heart ♫

208
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,110
♫ I've looked for all the exits ♫

209
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:12,120
♫ Yet I didn't find a reason to give up ♫

210
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,500

♫ Turns out that the wounds you can't see are the most painful ♫

213
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,730
♫ Your love is just like the wind ♫

214
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,550
♫ Once you've passed it, you can soothe your sorrows ♫

215
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,600
♫ Yet I can't unreasonably ask for ♫

216
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:47,900
♫ You to stay one more minute with me ♫

217
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:56,799
If you want to come home, just come. Why buy so many things?

218
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:58,466
We don't lack anything.

219
00:15:58,466 --> 00:16:03,533
I know you don't lack anything. I just bought some supplements.

220
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:06,633
I even bought beef short ribs. Yung Chieh likes to eat them.

221
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:10,365
He's been working hard lately so I want to reward him a bit.

222
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,566
But he won't be home for dinner tonight.

223
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:18,599
That's okay. I'll stay here tonight and make it for him tomorrow.

224
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,833
But he isn't... staying home lately.

225
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,333
Is he that busy?

226
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,166
Yes, he...

227
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,133
He moved out.

228
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:35,665
Why did you come out?

229
00:16:35,665 --> 00:16:39,933
Didn't the doctor say you shouldn't be moving around too much, but rest instead?

230
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:42,233
Dad, what's wrong?

231
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:53,033
Did something happen?

232
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,000
Does it have to do with Yung Chieh?

233
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,433
I know about you two.

234
00:17:35,766 --> 00:17:40,032
Hsing Ssu. Hsing Ssu, it's not your fault.

235
00:17:40,032 --> 00:17:41,732
It's all because Yung Chieh forced you into it.

236
00:17:41,732 --> 00:17:43,365
Besides, the day you said you would celebrate his birthday with him,

237
00:17:43,365 --> 00:17:46,450
I already knew what he wanted to do. It's nothing to do with you. All right?

238
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,166
Lee Ching Fang.

239
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,600
I didn't stop him so I'm an accomplice.

240
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:04,333
I knew Yung Chieh likes Hsing Ssu long ago.

241
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,899
Daddy. D-Daddy,

242
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:21,033
listen to me, listen to me.

243
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:26,066
I wanted to tell you about it a long time ago,

244
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:28,200
b-but I really didn't know how to.

245
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,699
I-I was scared telling you would be too much for you. So I didn't.

246
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:34,699
You can blame me or hate me.

247
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:37,100
I have no excuses.

248
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,566
I even have the divorce papers prepared.

249
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:44,833
It is I and my son who wronged you.

250
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:50,701
I'm sorry.

251
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:53,099
Dad, it's not like this. It's not Mom's fault.

252
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,734
It's my problem.

253
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,265
I like men. It's my problem.

254
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:58,966
It's not Mom's fault. It's not Yung Chieh's fault, either.

255
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,566
I don't want to hear all this right now.

256
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:22,066
Daddy! Daddy...

257
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:54,733
Did you drink all of this?

258
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,533
Why did you drink so much? Are you unhappy?

259
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,332
I'm not unhappy.

260
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:05,700
I'm very happy.

261
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:14,099
Come on. Let's celebrate you.

262
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,433
You reek of alcohol. Don't drink any more.

263
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,333
I want to drink!

264
00:20:19,966 --> 00:20:22,966
Look. This is the bottle you most wanted to drink.

265
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:24,565
It's the most expensive one!

266
00:20:24,565 --> 00:20:26,066
Fine. Let's drink it another day.

267
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:28,199
Drink it today!

268
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:29,499
I need to congratulate you

269
00:20:29,499 --> 00:20:33,599
for finally making Liu Mei Fang fall for you

270
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,260
and getting together with her.

271
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:37,800
Don't talk nonsense.

272
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,800
It's because of that video in the company's group chat, right?

273
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,500
You misunderstood. That's actually not–

274
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,532
Don't lie to me.

275
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:46,030
I thought it through.

276
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:50,933
I can give you my blessing because it was me who rejected you.

277
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:53,333
So you gave up on me

278
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,966
and continued to pursue, as well as like, Mei Fang.

279
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,432
You don't like me now.

280
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:03,333
I understand.

281
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,899
I really understand.

282
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:06,867
- It's not that I don't like you—
- Don't talk.

283
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:09,033
Listen to me!

284
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:13,899
That day when you suddenly confessed to me,

285
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:15,966
I was scared.

286
00:21:15,966 --> 00:21:20,400
I didn't acknowledge you because I was too afraid to.

287
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,800
I didn't know what to do.

288
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:26,266
I...

289
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:28,433
I even lied to Gill.

290
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,266
What did you lie to her about?

291
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,500
I said I wanted to chase her,

292
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,400
but I don't like her at all.

293
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,865
She invited me to her place, but I didn't go.

294
00:21:42,566 --> 00:21:47,366
I didn't want to come home too early and face you

295
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:49,666
so I wandered around outside.

296
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,386
I wandered around until 3:00 a.m. before I came home.

297
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:57,366
Teng Teng, are you saying

298
00:21:57,366 --> 00:22:01,633
you actually like me a bit?

299
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:04,966
It's the first time I lied.

300
00:22:04,966 --> 00:22:07,733
I never lied before.

301
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,300
I was even punched.

302
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,599
Did she hit you?

303
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,659
I'll tell her to apologize to you.

304
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,633
I'm sorry.

305
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,832
Why are you saying sorry?

306
00:22:25,832 --> 00:22:27,265
You didn't do anything wrong! It was me who was wrong.

307
00:22:27,265 --> 00:22:30,366
I liked you too late.

308
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:32,266
It's already too late.

309
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:34,700
It's not too late. Nothing is too late.

310
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,165
No!

311
00:22:36,165 --> 00:22:39,933
You already slept with Liu Mei Fang. You can't cheat!

312
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:42,266
I also don't want to be a mistress!

313
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:45,233
- Why would you be the mistress?
- You always eat with Liu Mei Fang.

314
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:47,934
You eat so happily with her. You two even hug.

315
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,366
I see it every day!

316
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:52,600
I already told you, Mei Fang–

317
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:59,590
♫ Will you let me gently kiss you? ♫

318
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,300
♫ It's all so sweet and beautiful ♫

319
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,866
Teng Teng,

320
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:08,100
I don't like Liu Mei Fang.

321
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,200
I like only you.

322
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,000
Do you like me?

323
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:23,470
♫ You're the only person I want to know ♫

324
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:29,480
♫ I want to loudly say those affectionate words to you ♫

325
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,510
♫ Will you let me gently kiss you? ♫

326
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,600
♫ It's all so sweet and beautiful ♫

327
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,700
I like you.

328
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,830
♫ My baby ♫

329
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,760
♫ Baby, Baby, Baby, yes... ♫

330
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,940
♫ Baby... Baby ♫

331
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,050
♫ Be my baby... be my baby ♫

332
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,150
♫ Baby... ♫

333
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,900
You slept for a long time. It's already noon.

334
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,200
Does your head hurt?

335
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,600
Are you hungry?

336
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,000
Then I'll make some noodles for you.

337
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,900
That's good.

338
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,100
You didn't forget what you said yesterday, did you?

339
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:35,700
Did you forget?

340
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,400
No...

341
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
I didn't forget.

342
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,760
[Asakusa (Japanese district and temple)]

343
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,600
Dad, it's time for your medication.

344
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,600
Dad,

345
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,200
I want to talk to you.

346
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,900
Dad, I'm sorry.

347
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,300
I like men.

348
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,800
Are you willing to accept me like this?

349
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,000
Come back home to live.

350
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,800
Your mom passed away early.

351
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,500
We lived together for so long.

352
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,700
No matter how inattentive I am,

353
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:45,866
there's no way I didn't notice

354
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,100
you liked men.

355
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,100
When did you find out?

356
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,600
In your first year of college.

357
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,300
At the time, you didn't have a girlfriend,

358
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,900
but you were very close to a male classmate.

359
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,600
I saw you were happy every day. It was as though you were in a relationship.

360
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
At that time,

361
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,400
I probably knew.

362
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,500
Are you very disappointed in me?

363
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,100
When you first moved out, I didn't stop you.

364
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,300
The reason for that is very simple.

365
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:48,400
I felt I also needed time to think it through.

366
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,700
I just didn't think

367
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,400
so many years would pass meanwhile.

368
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,200
Dad, I'm sorry.

369
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
I'm sorry.

370
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,400
There's nothing to be sorry about.

371
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,800
Your life is your own.

372
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,500
Living honestly and happily are more

373
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,500
important than anything else.

374
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,100
Come back home to live.

375
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:37,200
They talked it through. Your dad wants him to move back home.

376
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:53,500
Do you feel like you have all the attention today?

377
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:58,600
If it were a boyfriend and girlfriend getting a room, then it would be an office romance.

378
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,166
If it wasn't boyfriend and girlfriend, then it's just a fling.

379
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:05,200
Which of the two describes you and Manager Hsiao?

380
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,433
It's neither. He and I only went there to see a friend.

381
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:11,966
You should at least be more sincere in making up an excuse.

382
00:32:11,966 --> 00:32:13,900
The truth is the truth.

383
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,900
Explaining everything is already very sincere of her.

384
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,000
Is Hsing Ssu not here yet?

385
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,566
The director took today off. He told me to go to this afternoon's meeting in his place.

386
00:32:25,566 --> 00:32:27,500
I would like to seriously clarify things with everyone.

387
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:33,200
Mei Fang and I indeed went to a hotel. But it was to see her friend.

388
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,100
What I'm more interested in is... How did you get the video?

389
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,500
Well... someone sent it to me.

390
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,300
Who?

391
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,200
Hsing Ssu didn't pick up.

392
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,800
He's probably busy. You should message him.

393
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,700
He'll reply once he sees it.

394
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,600
You still didn't tell me who sent you the video.

395
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,500
I don't know who sent it to me.

396
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,466
Manager Hsiao, questioning me like this is too suspicious.

397
00:33:08,466 --> 00:33:11,433
If you and Mei Fang were open and honest,

398
00:33:11,433 --> 00:33:14,300
why would you care about who sent the video?

399
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:19,530
Manager Hsiao, if you want to protect Mei Fang, just admit you two are dating.

400
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,100
Of course, I can't do that.

401
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,866
Right now, I'm a man who has his other half.

402
00:33:24,866 --> 00:33:27,066
I'm asking about the video not to protect Mei Fang,

403
00:33:27,066 --> 00:33:28,866
but to eliminate any doubts my other half might have.

404
00:33:28,866 --> 00:33:30,166
I'm afraid he won't be happy.

405
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:32,400
Manager Hsiao, do you have a girlfriend now?

406
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,600
It's not "girlfriend." It's "boyfriend."

407
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,100
Manager Hsiao, why would you tell such a lie for Mei Fang's sake?

408
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,500
Why would I lie?

409
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,700
It's so annoying!

410
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,966
"Those who are wise do not buy into rumors."

411
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:16,500
You never listen.

412
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,600
Even if there's another video in the future, carefully verify facts before publicizing it.

413
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,500
Just like this ironclad (absolute) truth.

414
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,600
I will openly send it to the group chat.

415
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,166
Let's go.

416
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:32,300
Okay!

417
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,800
Bye bye.

418
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,400
G-Get back to work. The director took the day off.

419
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,000
Focus on work. Get to work.

420
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:55,700
Aren't you worried about Hsing Ssu?

421
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:59,033
Xiao Yeh is an adult. Taking a day off once in a while is nothing.

422
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:01,533
But in the past, he always told us beforehand.

423
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,300
He didn't say anything this time.

424
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,900
Don't you think it's strange?

425
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,900
If you're concerned, let's go find him after work.

426
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Why do you keep smiling?

427
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,600
Am I?

428
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,300
Your teeth are even showing.

429
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,200
I'm just happy!

430
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:26,100
Teng Teng, you were so manly just now. You just directly publicized it.

431
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,966
Are you not happy?

432
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:34,300
Do you regret it?

433
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,000
It's not that.

434
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,800
What is it then?

435
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,900
In that video, you and Mei Fang really did go to a hotel.

436
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,800
Come with me.

437
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,200
Come on. Sit.

438
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,400
Do you still think I like Mei Fang?

439
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,800
Not really.

440
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,100
Teng Teng, we are finally together.

441
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,166
If you have anything to say, just speak.

442
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:21,000
Don't hide or guess anything.

443
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,100
As long as you ask me, I'll tell it as it is.

444
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,000
I won't lie to you.

445
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,200
So don't keep it all to yourself, okay?

446
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:34,200
Last time when I asked you about it,

447
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,300
you told me it was a long story and that you'd tell me later.

448
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:43,700
But you never told me what happened that night with you and Mei Fang.

449
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,400
Sorry. I keep forgetting to tell you.

450
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,466
You know Mei Fang is a fujoshi.

451
00:36:52,466 --> 00:36:55,033
So she has a whole group of friends who are all fujoshi.

452
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:56,900
When she truly believed I like you,

453
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,566
she introduced me to them so we all know each other quite well.

454
00:36:59,566 --> 00:37:01,700
This time, a girl named Xiao Yun

455
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,800
was upset over a CP (couple).

456
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,033
CP?

457
00:37:07,033 --> 00:37:09,100
In one of the BL dramas she likes,

458
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,200
one of the guys in the CP died, and she couldn't accept it.

459
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,700
So she came north to find friends to comfort her. Mei Fang asked me to come over.

460
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,100
Then what were you able to do with them?

461
00:37:19,766 --> 00:37:22,666
At that time, I'd lost the battle with you.

462
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:25,200
So I used my own sorrow that is similar to hers to comfort her.

463
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,000
We stayed with her all night for her mood to improve a little.

464
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,300
But... you even took a shower at the hotel.

465
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,900
Don't worry. I got another room.

466
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,800
I even have a receipt. I'll show you when we get home.

467
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,900
I made up my mind to like you. There's no way I'd let go.

468
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,600
So you have to promise me you won't abandon me, either.

469
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,000
What nonsense are you saying?

470
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,400
By the way, just now, you were talking about the video.

471
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,200
Do you think someone is deliberately targeting you or Mei Fang?

472
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,300
Mei Fang just joined the company so the target is probably me.

473
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,300
Is the target really you?

474
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,900
Are you worried about me?

475
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:14,533
I won't let that person succeed.

476
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:16,200
I already asked a friend for help.

477
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,400
Once we find the inbox address from which the video originated, he can uncover who the person is.

478
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,200
Then I'm going to find that person and teach him a good lesson.

479
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,266
I can help, too.

480
00:38:24,266 --> 00:38:25,800
Can you help, too?

481
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,900
