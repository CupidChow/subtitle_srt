[Episode 6]

15
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,980
At some point, I thought

16
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,490
you were trying to apologize to me.

17
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,140
After all, you recently spent so long avoiding me.

18
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,210
Teng Teng...

19
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,780
avoiding you before was my fault.

20
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,420
I apologize to you!

21
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,330
Can you please forgive me?

22
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,190
Stop joking! I'm being very serious.

23
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,740
What exactly are you trying to do?

24
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,210
Did you know that if I were a girl,

25
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,480
what you did to me moments ago

26
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,210
in the hot spring would be sexual harassment?

27
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,260
So since you are a guy,

28
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,530
then it wouldn't be sexual harassment, right?

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,540
♫ Missing you, missing you, missing you ♫

30
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,190
♫ We're clearly shoulder to shoulder ♫

31
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,500
♫ Yet I'm still missing you, missing you, missing you ♫

32
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,260
Does this count?

33
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,990
If this still doesn't count,

34
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,540
then how about this?

35
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,270
♫ The significance of our embrace ♫

36
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,840
What I wanted to say to you is that I love you.

37
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,510
Hsiao Li Cheng! Stop joking around!

38
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,280
I'm not joking.

39
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,340
Didn't you just ask me why I was avoiding you?

40
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,790
I was avoiding you because I kept thinking about you that night at the hotel.

41
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,050
♫ Never want to be like that ♫
♫ Take a minute and you will realize ♫

42
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,550
I can't forget how you were "trapped" in that passion.

43
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,400
I even dreamed about you telling me,

44
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,420
you were willing to be the bottom.

45
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,510
What's wrong?

46
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,340
He said that he loves me.

47
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,730
Was Li Cheng really so direct?

48
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,910
How do you know it was Li Cheng?

49
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,990
He told me earlier that he likes you and wants to pursue you.

50
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,010
When it comes to feelings, I have no right to say anything.

51
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,430
But if you don't like him,

52
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,050
you should reject him directly and clarify things with him.

53
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,520
I don't think that he will make things difficult for anyone.

54
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,990
Where's Teng Teng?

55
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,600
You made your move too quickly and aggressively. You scared him.

56
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,910
I only kissed him, licked him a little, and confessed my feelings.

57
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,700
I didn't do anything else.

58
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,670
Do you call that "nothing"?

59
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,860
Young Man, was that too aggressive?

60
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,200
You really didn't go easy on him.

61
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,120
I mean, his reaction just now...

62
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,190
Was it okay or not?

63
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,380
He's so shy that he can't face you.

64
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,270
- Okay, then it should be okay.
- Yes!

65
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,820
Don't mislead him.

66
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,130
Mu Ren isn't shy.

67
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,440
He just needs time to think about it.

68
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,030
Maybe

69
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,340
he is thinking about how to reject you.

70
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:48,300
Xiao Yeh, just because you're in a happy situation doesn't mean you should curse me.

71
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,080
Don't touch what's mine.

72
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,300
Yours?

73
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,960
Xiao Yeh, don't accept him yet.

74
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,700
Otherwise, I won't even be able to look at you in the future.

75
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,460
Go away, you!

76
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,750
What did I do?

77
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,710
- I can't touch him, is that right?
- That's right, you can't touch him.

78
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,630
I live together with Xiao Yeh every day. I will touch whatever I want to touch.

79
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,580
I don't care! You just don't get to touch!

80
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,610
- I will touch!
- Go away!

81
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,410
Love me?

82
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,020
How could this be?

83
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,790
What I wanted to tell you is that I love you.

84
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,720
Didn't you ask me just now why I avoided you?

85
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,960
I avoided you because I kept thinking about how you were that night.

86
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,100
I can't forget how you were "trapped" in that passion.

87
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,020
I even dreamed of you telling me,

88
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,010
you were willing to be the bottom.

89
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,554
What am I doing?

90
00:06:39,554 --> 00:06:41,580
He is just my friend.

91
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,660
I've been affected. I've been affected.

92
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,380
I can't be like this.

93
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,700
I can't be led on like this.

94
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,660
It must be because it has been too long since I had a girlfriend.

95
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,960
Yes.

96
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,130
I like girls.

97
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,920
I still like girls.

98
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,210
Hello? This is Teng Mu Ren.

99
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,562
Long time no see.

100
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,970
Do you have time tomorrow night?

101
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,130
Do you guys think I should take the initiative, knock on his door, and bring him dinner?

102
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,800
Or give him some space, and let Xiao Yeh bring it to him?

103
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Don't bug him for the rest of the day.

104
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,410
Strike while the iron is hot.

105
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,421
Fu Yung Chieh.

106
00:07:39,421 --> 00:07:41,910
I actually wanted to be in the same room as you.

107
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,860
You can't.

108
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,329
Before I've thought things through, nothing can happen.

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,250
Okay, fine.

110
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,970
Then for dinner, I will trouble you to bring it to him.

111
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,970
What happened?

112
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,150
Gill text messaged me.

113
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,840
She thanked me for introducing a boyfriend to her.

114
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,220
Boyfriend?

115
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,990
Did you introduce other people to her?

116
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,150
Of course not!

117
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,484
That person is Teng Mu Ren!

118
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,050
Where are you guys eating dinner?

119
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,930
I will come find you guys.

120
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,990
We bought something for you already.

121
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,520
How did you get in?

122
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,400
I'm here to give you your dinner.

123
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,850
Thanks.

124
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,970
Are you not going to give me the dinner?

125
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,880
Don't you have anything to say to me?

126
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,950
I already said thank you.

127
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,590
Fine.

128
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,620
If you don't have anything to say to me, that's fine. But I do.

129
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,860
What do you want to say? Can we eat while we talk?

130
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,610
The dinner smells great.

131
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,124
Why did you ask Gill out?

132
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,480
How do you know?

133
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,800
How do I know?

134
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,670
Because she messaged me saying

135
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,170
how thankful she was to me for introducing a boyfriend to her.

136
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,520
It is like you heard.

137
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,790
I should thank you

138
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,930
for introducing such a beautiful girl like Gill to me.

139
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,940
You guys just had a meal.

140
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,430
We also watched a movie.

141
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,640
And just like that, you decided to get together?

142
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,940
Aren't all relationships like this?

143
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,500
If there are feelings on both sides, then we get together.

144
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,730
If there are feelings, then you get together?

145
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,680
Hsiao Li Cheng, what are you doing?

146
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,670
You say if there are feelings, then you get together. So why didn't you pick me?

147
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,110
I don't have feelings for you.

148
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,940
You're lying!

149
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,520
I can feel it.

150
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,680
Your body is tense, and your heartbeat is accelerated, but you don't hate it,

151
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,220
just like me.

152
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,180
No way. Don't make a fool of yourself.

153
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,630
Why are you so sure I'm making a fool of myself?

154
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,410
I understand your personality very well.

155
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,140
When I confessed and kissed you just then,

156
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,690
if you thought it was disgusting, you would have already punched me.

157
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,560
Also, right now, as I appear in front of you,

158
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,770
you haven't given me a single look of disgust.

159
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,630
So don't say that I'm making a fool of myself.

160
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,500
Okay, you want to talk about fighting?

161
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,530
Fine! Let go!

162
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,600
I will punch you right now! Even two or three punches are fine!

163
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,930
- Let go of me!
- Bring it on!

164
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,174
Are you still talking tough?

165
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,240
If you weren't panicking,

166
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,220
you wouldn't have called Gill to tell her you want to be with her.

167
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,240
I can be in a relationship with someone whenever I want.

168
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,149
I don't need to pick a time.

169
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,960
Teng Mu Ren!

170
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,356
Would it kill you to admit you have feelings for me?

171
00:11:17,356 --> 00:11:18,570
I said I don't, and that means I don't!

172
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,450
What do you want me to admit?

173
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,420
Don't be so caught up in your own wishful thinking that we can't even be friends anymore!

174
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,090
If you're worried, you can help out.

175
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,240
Things involving feelings can't be helped.

176
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,679
Feelings can't be forced.

177
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,370
Then don't mind it.

178
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,840
How is that possible?

179
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,325
These two are my closest friends.

180
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,310
It is okay. You don't have to worry about me.

181
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,220
This scene seems a bit too familiar.

182
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,480
I don't like you touching my head,

183
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,880
because at that moment you're my brother. I can tell it apart.

184
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,730
I don't want you to be my brother.

185
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,073
Yung Chieh, have you really thought it through?

186
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,625
In the end, if I were to conclude that

187
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,040
I just spoiled you too much, and I don't actually love you,

188
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,826
what would you do?

189
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,580
If I can't be your significant other,

190
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,500
does that mean we can't be brothers?

191
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:12,580
♫ I drift along a life where you're not a daily part of it♫

192
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:26,320
♫ Not disturbing you shows the seriousness of my love for you ♫

193
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:35,010
♫ I choose to be your friend so you have a chance of happiness ♫

194
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,840
♫ I'm just here to accentuate your forever with him ♫

195
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,680
♫  I never ask about it ♫

196
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,590
♫ Staying behind in this lonesome city ♫

197
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:53,770
♫ A lost soul is an addition to our parting ♫

198
00:14:53,770 --> 00:15:01,100
♫ I have no talent for healing ♫

199
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:06,370
♫ I use love to conceal the scars ♫

200
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:12,250
♫ And live my life peacefully ♫

201
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:17,000
♫ I don't ask about it ♫

202
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,500
We just got back from the trip this afternoon.

203
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,658
Don't stay out too late having fun. We still have work tomorrow.

204
00:16:10,658 --> 00:16:13,100
Going on a date with a girl isn't tiring at all.

205
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,190
But I will watch the time.

206
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,300
If it gets too late, I won't come back.

207
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,980
You don't need to wait for me.

208
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,930
What do you plan on doing now?

209
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,760
I don't know.

210
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,450
I know he doesn't hate me,

211
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,447
but I'm not sure if he likes me or not.

212
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,920
If he didn't choose me and chose some other guy,

213
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,110
I would definitely fight for his hand.

214
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,020
But... I can't stop him from liking girls.

215
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,938
So... have you given up?

216
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,017
Xiao Yeh,

217
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,349
I don't know if I should give up or not.

218
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,160
♫ Even breathing is torturous ♫

219
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,490
♫ Lost within my heart ♫

220
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,540
♫ I've looked for all the exits ♫

221
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,470
♫ Yet I didn't find a reason to give up ♫

222
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,860
♫ All the fantasies have been broken ♫

223
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:15,380
♫ The memories will no longer flow ♫

224
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,670
♫ Turns out that the wounds you can't see ♫

225
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,680
♫ Are the most painful ♫

226
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,060
♫ Your love is just like the wind ♫

227
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,860
♫ Once you've passed it, you can soothe your sorrows ♫

228
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,980
♫ Yet I can't unreasonably ask for ♫

229
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:42,570
♫ You to stay one more minute with me ♫

230
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,540
♫ All the fantasies have been broken ♫

231
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:05,130
♫ The memories will no longer flow ♫

232
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:14,080
♫ The wounds you can't see are really the most painful ♫

233
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:25,480
♫ Turns out I've loved you for so long ♫

234
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:52,160
This is the time-consuming, 28-day dry-aged steak.

235
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,420
With this amount of aging, one really tastes the tenderness of the steak.

236
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,485
Its flavor also isn't too overpowering.

237
00:19:59,485 --> 00:20:02,500
When paired with red wine, it is indeed a supreme feast.

238
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,830
You really know food.

239
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,070
I still remember the first time I brought Li Cheng here and asked him what he thought,

240
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:12,100
he just said it was a little better than my family's steak.

241
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,700
That sounds like something he would say.

242
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,880
When did you bring him to this steakhouse?

243
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,990
In the fourth year of college.

244
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,360
He said he wanted to help celebrate my birthday so I brought him here.

245
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,030
It turned out that after we had the meal, he was broke.

246
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,440
For the next half month, he lived on four loaves of bread.

247
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,120
You guys are very close.

248
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,850
Why didn't you get together?

249
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:45,720
We were together... but broke up quite quickly.

250
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,880
We held hands on the first day,

251
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,330
kissed on the second day,

252
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,500
and broke up on the third day.

253
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,993
Because there was no "spark."

254
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:55,270
At the time, Li Cheng was stressed out all night

255
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,790
wondering how to tell me so that I wouldn't be hurt.

256
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,740
The next day when he told me, he had huge dark circles under his eyes.

257
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,520
To tell you the truth, when you asked me out suddenly, I was kind of shocked.

258
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,590
Especially since meeting last time, we haven't talked to each other.

259
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,920
Sorry about that. Work has been busy lately.

260
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,960
Actually, the last time when we met and talked,

261
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,084
I really wanted to ask you out and to come eat this dry-aged steak.

262
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,598
So... are you impressed with me?

263
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,670
You're very open and lively, and this really impresses me.

264
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:48,480
Then do you want to pursue me and make me your girlfriend?

265
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,162
I do have that intention,

266
00:21:52,162 --> 00:21:55,120
but I want to see more of you

267
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,643
which is why I asked you out.

268
00:21:57,643 --> 00:22:00,302
You're really straightforward.

269
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:02,260
We are both mature adults,

270
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:07,080
and neither one likes playing around.

271
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,370
Then after dinner, do you want to come over to my place?

272
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,770
It is a bit late.

273
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,300
Don't think too much about it.

274
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,978
I didn't mean it like that.

275
00:22:18,978 --> 00:22:22,230
I just think since our topic of conversation right now is Li Cheng,

276
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,820
I'm going to really use this opportunity to bring us closer together.

277
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,310
I can show you what he looked like in college, with his dorky (socially awkward) look.

278
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,540
He was not as good-looking as now.

279
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,300
Doesn't he like you? Are you sure?

280
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,600
After I confessed my feelings,

281
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,400
he went out with a girl and didn't return until 3:00 a.m.

282
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,400
Also, there's the fact that he's been ignoring me.

283
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,050
I think there really is no hope.

284
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,489
You must be very upset.

285
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,100
Why are you so upset about it?

286
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,100
Do you want to comfort me?

287
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,100
Okay. Then will you consider me?

288
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,930
After all, you were my first love.

289
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,400
If you would console me, I would probably heal faster.

290
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,400
Sure! I've agreed.

291
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,480
Let's be boyfriend and girlfriend.

292
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,400
Now give me a kiss.

293
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,550
I want a French kiss.

294
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,390
We're at the office.

295
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,760
I was joking.

296
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,500
Feelings are not meant to joke about!

297
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,050
You're not even in the mood right now, and you're pretending to be humorous.

298
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,580
If Manager Teng heard you, you'd be in trouble.

299
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,760
If he heard it, he wouldn't care.

300
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,240
Don't be like this.

301
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,790
Maybe he isn't really willing to go from friends to lovers at the moment.

302
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,800
I can discuss it with my friend and figure out a plan.

303
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,900
There's no need.

304
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,200
Maybe after calming down a bit and getting some distance,

305
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,790
I can slowly adapt myself, which will be beneficial for us both.

306
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,710
In fact, some people say the best way to cure losing love

307
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:06,000
is to look for the next relationship to distract yourself.

308
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,200
Director Yeh is very good as well.

309
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,100
It's not that I like guys.

310
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,900
I just like him.

311
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,400
It's true love! It's true love!

312
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,100
Don't break up, okay?

313
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,900
We're not even together. How could we break up?

314
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,270
You sincerely want me to succeed. I'm really moved.

315
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,170
My apologies.

316
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:37,800
What I said before was too much. I let you and your friend down.

317
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,860
I'm okay. After a few days, I'll be fine.

318
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,200
Really?

319
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,500
I'm Hsiao Li Cheng.

320
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,000
Then won't you consider it?

321
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,200
- Director Yeh?
- Yes.

322
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,700
Or what type do you like? I can help you look.

323
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,000
I have a long list of people I could introduce to you.

324
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,700
Give me the meeting's record before work ends today.

325
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,970
Okay.

326
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,860
Sister Wang, this wedding reception design needs to be modified according to our recent discussion.

327
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,600
- Get it to me by tomorrow.
- Sure.

328
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,070
Director... Manager Hsiao, Manager Teng, and you are good friends.

329
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,400
What's going on with them lately?

330
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,560
Did they have an argument?

331
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,180
No. Why would you say that?

332
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,160
But they don't interact with each other at all in the office.

333
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,000
Is it because of the PK (player knockout) game?

334
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,400
We heard that Manager Hsiao stole a client from Manager Teng.

335
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,900
Nothing of the sort happened.

336
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,700
Director, please clear things up.

337
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,600
I don't know what to say.

338
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,110
Those two are really ignoring each other.

339
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,500
The sales department atmosphere is terrible right now.

340
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,150
What on earth happened?

341
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,920
Even if something did happen, it would be their private business.

342
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,520
- It doesn't have anything–
- So...

343
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,000
Have they really had a falling out (end of friendship)?

344
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,270
Was it over a girl or over business?

345
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,190
How is this any of your concern?

346
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,900
The director just got back from a meeting and has a lot of work to do.

347
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,820
If you guys don't want to work, then help not hinder.

348
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,790
- You're a newcomer. What's with the attitude?
- What does it matter if I'm new?

349
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:59,110
At least I work hard, unlike those who think that because they're experienced,

350
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,000
- they can stand around and do nothing.
- You—

351
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,610
- What?
- That's enough! Stop fighting!

352
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,060
It's working hours right now.

353
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,500
Although I have no rules against what everyone can talk about, don't let it affect work.

354
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,300
Everyone, go back to your seats.

355
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,600
Hsing Ssu...

356
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,700
What are you doing here?

357
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,100
I came to give you an answer.

358
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,100
What do you want to give me an answer to?

359
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,680
Didn't you ask me recently, if you finally figured out

360
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,300
you had only been spoiling me and were not actually in love with me,

361
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,130
what would I do?

362
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:08,100
And whether it would even be possible to be brothers again...

363
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,999
Have you been thinking about that for all this time?

364
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,800
I've come up with an answer.

365
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,300
Then what is your answer?

366
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,000
I am your best choice,

367
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,400
but in the end, if you really don't choose me,

368
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,300
I'm still willing to be your little brother.

369
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:40,750
Do you always think so much about everything I say?

370
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,120
Why did you buy so much beer?

371
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,200
It's been a while since we three relaxed and talked.

372
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,000
Let's drink tonight!

373
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,900
We still have to work tomorrow.

374
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,700
This isn't like you at all.

375
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,500
Is it because you heard some rumors,

376
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,300
and you are worried about us?

377
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,400
No. What rumors? There aren't any rumors.

378
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,100
Thanks, Xiao Yeh.

379
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,650
Hsing Ssu, I'm heading out now.

380
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,000
Are you going out again today?

381
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,800
Yes. I have a date with Gill.

382
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,000
But I bought food for three people.

383
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,700
You guys go ahead.

384
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,800
If I come back early, I will join you.

385
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,000
Mu Ren... wait one second.

386
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,100
I have something to say.

387
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,900
What do you want to say?

388
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,700
I'm sorry.

389
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,600
I apologize,

390
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,200
not because of my confession to you,

391
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,400
but for all the negative consequences of my love confession,

392
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,380
which have made you feel uncomfortable.

393
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,820
Now you're going out with Gill almost every night

394
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,000
to minimize the time that we see each other.

395
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,100
I'm very sorry.

396
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,200
I've thought things through.

397
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,900
What you and Xiao Yeh said was right.

398
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,500
I don't want to lose a friend.

399
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,700
So I will end things here.

400
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,300
So what you mean is that you don't like me anymore.

401
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,800
No,

402
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,700
I still like you.

403
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,000
But I've given up.

404
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,200
Do you regret confessing?

405
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,700
A little bit.

406
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,400
Anyway... I just want to keep being good friends,

407
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,000
good brothers.

408
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,800
All in all, just think of it as my having gone crazy lately.

409
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,600
You often tease me like that anyway.

410
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,300
Afterward, we should do what we usually do.

411
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,000
We will drink and have a good time as life-long friends.

412
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,200
I've already set a time tonight with Gill.

413
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,600
It's not good to cancel at the last minute.

414
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,100
You should go.

415
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,500
Gill is a good girl.

416
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,000
When I introduced her to you, I thought you two would hit it off (be a good match).

417
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,500
Have you really given up?

418
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,700
There's no point in persisting anyway.

419
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,600
I'm not a girl.

420
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,900
I can't force him to accept me, right?

421
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,720
It's not a problem.

422
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,100
A man's spirit is like a sponge.

423
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,310
No matter how much you squeeze, it will bounce back.

424
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,910
Tonight... accompany me as I drown my sorrows

425
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:06,200
and pay tribute to "lost love" with a whole night of drinking.

426
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:11,200
♪ The sunset is always so beautiful ♪

427
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,200
♪ The weather tomorrow will still be good ♪

428
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,200
Cheers!

429
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,200
Since there was a three-month wait, I decided not to buy it immediately.

430
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,100
For all I know, it was probably a scam. Am I right or wrong?

431
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,100
Hello?

432
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,000
You were right.

433
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,900
There are so many scams nowadays. You should be careful.

434
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,600
Am I boring you?

435
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,000
You have been quiet the whole time, and you look sad.

436
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,400
Is it because going out with me everyday has started to bore you?

437
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,600
No, you're a very good friend to talk to.

438
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,600
Am I only a friend?

439
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,600
Gill... before, when I said I wanted to pursue you

440
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,500
so we could get to understand and know each other better,

441
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,300
I lied.

442
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,200
I'm sorry.

443
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,500
Actually, I have no feelings for you.

444
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:48,000
I just wanted to prove I liked girls so I asked you out.

445
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,400
So don't you like girls?

446
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,200
No, I like girls. I've had girlfriends.

447
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,100
It's just that recently...

448
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,300
recently, it's been chaotic.

449
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Does it have anything to do with Li Cheng?

450
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,200
How did you know?

451
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,400
A woman's sixth sense is very sensitive.

452
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,950
Every time we talk, your favorite topic is Li Cheng.

453
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:28,600
But when we were on our first date, I asked you to come over.

454
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,100
When I asked if you wanted to see Li Cheng's photos from college, you refused.

455
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,800
I just–

456
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,300
You're unhappy because I know what you don't know about Li Cheng.

457
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,200
You feel hostile toward me.

458
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,900
No hostility. It's not that.

459
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,000
- I...
- Then it's a rejection.

460
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,400
Sure enough,

461
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,200
who knew that a beauty like me could still be rejected by men?

462
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,800
It's okay. I didn't like you that much anyway.

463
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,000
I'm truly sorry for wasting so much of your time.

464
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,600
Now we're even.

465
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,400
I forgive you.

466
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:36,200
You... In the future, don't use girls to avoid problems.

467
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,200
You're so attractive.

468
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,100
Don't be a player.

469
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,900
I know.

470
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,000
But the person you're talking about is Li Cheng.

471
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,700
Is it because life is too good, and you're looking for trouble?

472
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:56,200
Other than being somewhat good-looking, and having a decent figure,

473
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,700
he actually has many flaws.

474
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,000
I think you need to think more clearly about it.

475
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,800
I don't want to join your group. I will talk to the professor myself.

476
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,900
I have some stuff to do at home. That's it for now.

477
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,400
Why are you waiting for me?

478
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,200
I went with your dad just now to take some home-cooked food to your brother.

479
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,800
We saw you two hugging and all.

480
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,900
What's wrong with that?

481
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,000
So when I see you two

482
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,900
hug like that,

483
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,300
is it just brotherly affection?

484
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,400
No.

485
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,500
Then what is it?

486
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,600
I love him.

487
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,200
Fu Yung Chieh!

488
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,500
He's your brother!

489
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,400
Bring him here right now, and let's clear this up.

490
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,500
There's no need to call him. It's only me and my one-sided love.

491
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,300
Is hugging like that just one-sided love?

492
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,100
I have proof.

493
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,590
What is this nonsense?

494
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,890
- I just wanted him so I got him drunk, and slept with him.
- Fu Yung Chieh!

495
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:00,520
I tricked him so he thinks he seduced me!

496
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,580
Fu Yung Chieh!

497
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,900
I made him feel guilty so he'd be good to me!

498
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,600
Daddy! That's enough!

499
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,670
Daddy! Daddy! Are you all right?

500
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,760
- Daddy? Daddy!
- Dad. Dad!

501
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,300
Don't scare me! Daddy!

502
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,200
Call an ambulance.

503
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,950
Dad.

504
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,460
Wake up, Dad.

505
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,980
My husband fainted.

506
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,730
- Okay.
- Dad.

507
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,610
The address is Dongzheng District...

508
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:29,200
- Dad, Dad.
- Number 70...

509
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,300
Hsing Ssu said you drank a lot last night.

510
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,900
Thanks.

511
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,500
I came back too late yesterday. I wasn't able to join you.

512
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,300
How about I treat you guys to lunch today?

513
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:09,000
I already have plans today with Mei Fang and Sister Wang.

514
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,300
That's fine.

515
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,900
Next time then.

516
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,400
Then let's have a party this Friday.

517
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,710
All right!

518
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,120
It's been a long time since we three partied.

519
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,500
Let's have a no-going-home-if-you're-not-drunk party.

520
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,400
Drinking so much is probably bad for you.

521
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,400
Then let's drink and chat. Getting slightly drunk is fine.

522
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,100
Okay. No problem.

523
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:44,200
[MUSE Weddings]

524
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,200
Are Manager Hsiao and Mei Fang from your department together?

525
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,720
Yes, she clung to Manager Hsiao and wouldn't let go.

526
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,600
Really?

527
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:57,610
Really. Someone heard that she begged Manager Hsiao not to break up with her.

528
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,890
In the end, she wouldn't let go.

529
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,500
She really is thick-skinned (insensitive, tough).

530
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,100
I can't believe she's so bold.

531
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,770
Have you just realized? She's actually super arrogant.

532
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,600
"Rumors stop with the wise."

533
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,760
It would be better if there were less rumors around the office.

534
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,400
It's not a rumor.

535
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,000
It's true. I have pictures.

536
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,500
Look!

537
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:25,000
There are only two pictures and your words to tell the story. Are they all correct?

538
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,000
Have you checked with the people themselves?

539
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,400
Then I will head back to the office first.

540
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,100
You're a girl as well.

541
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,500
This kind of rumor hurts girls more than just a little bit.

542
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,500
Hopefully, you'll be more careful in the future.

543
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,200
I don't want anyone affected by personal issues

544
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,290
that destroy the relationship between the design and sales departments.

545
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,320
Don't let there be a next time I hear about this.

546
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,900
I'll wait for you at the first-floor lobby.

547
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,200
Let's go buy three-treasures rice today.

548
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,600
Okay. I just entered the elevator. I'll be right there.

549
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,290
I watched the drama you mentioned last time.

550
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,610
- Really?
- Yes.

551
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,100
Which part did you like best?

552
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,000
My favorite scene was when they were at home making breakfast.

553
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,800
Yes! And they made eggs together.

554
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,400
If there's someone with whom you can make breakfast,

555
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,110
make lunch, make dinner, then–

556
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,300
It'd be so romantic.

557
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,700
Yes, it's romantic!

558
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,000
Who knew that being five minutes late would cause such a long wait?

559
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,300
This Hong-Kong-style BBQ restaurant has always been busy.

560
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:15,700
Recently my workload has increased so I won't be able to see you for a while.

561
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,200
Thanks.

562
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,370
It's okay.

563
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:20,500
Wait awhile.

564
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,100
When your studies lessen, we will see each other again.

565
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,500
What's wrong?

566
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,100
Nothing.

567
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:38,100
When I was waiting for you, I saw Li Cheng and Mei Fang going for food,

568
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,310
but I didn't see Sister Wang with them.

569
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:41,500
Sister Wang?

570
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:46,000
Sister Wang took the day off. I think her child wasn't feeling well.

571
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,800
Oh, I see.

572
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,900
What's wrong?

573
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,560
Nothing.

574
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,900
I just thought, Li Cheng said he likes me.

575
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,700
Then what about Mei Fang?

576
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,800
Does he still like Mei Fang?

577
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,520
Why do you ask that all of a sudden?

578
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,110
They look like they're very close.

579
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,900
- Is it possible–
- Mu Ren,

580
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,100
you know Li Cheng's personality.

581
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,200
He's not a playboy, and he's not indecisive either.

582
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,600
Even though he's slow sometimes,

583
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,800
once he's sure of something, he moves forward.

584
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,400
Even if he fails, he doesn't hold onto things.

585
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,400
I know. I'm not saying he's a playboy.

586
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:36,000
I just thought, he said he gave up on me,

587
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,010
but is it possible he will continue to chase Mei Fang?

588
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,600
If he continues to chase Mei Fang,

589
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,100
then that's his choice.

590
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,900
That's true.

Would it kill you to admit you have feelings for me?

597
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,000
I've thought things through.

598

What you and Xiao Yeh said was right.

599
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,300
I don't want to lose a friend.
