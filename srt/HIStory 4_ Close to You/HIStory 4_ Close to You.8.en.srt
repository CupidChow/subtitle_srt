[Episode 8]

15
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,632
Mom, let me help you.

16
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,965
No need, no need!

17
00:01:42,965 --> 00:01:47,832
You rarely take a day off to rest. Just daydream and relax.

18
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:53,800
Your eyes aren't puffy anymore.

19
00:01:57,866 --> 00:01:59,500
They're a lot better now.

20
00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:04,865
Here, here. Sit.

21
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:10,565
Crying it out is a good thing.

22
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:13,100
Why are you embarrassed?

23
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,933
You're just too used to holding it all in,

24
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:22,365
constantly suppressing everything. It's not good for your health.

25
00:02:22,365 --> 00:02:25,032
With any future issues, just come and talk to me.

26
00:02:25,032 --> 00:02:28,033
There's nothing that can't be solved.

27
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:32,999
Look, your dad was able to accept it as well.

28
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,566
Mom, so did you know early on I was gay?

29
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,473
Didn't you say, if there was anything, come talk to you?

30
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:55,866
Even though I'm not your biological mother,

31
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:59,966
I still think of you as my own child, whom I take care of.

32
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:05,566
I probably knew around the same time as Yung Chieh.

33
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,666
When did Yung Chieh find out?

34
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,166
When he started middle school.

35
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,766
That early?

36
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:17,465
Don't judge him because he doesn't discuss.

37
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:20,565
He's a man with a lot of crafty thinking.

38
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:25,265
I know in the past when I left him with relatives, he must have had a lot of grievances.

39
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:27,366
It was surely tough.

40
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:30,499
But he likely made it hard for the relatives as well.

41
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,532
He did a lot of underhanded things privately,

42
00:03:33,532 --> 00:03:35,933
but he never left any evidence.

43
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,666
I still didn't apologize to you.

44
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,366
Apologize?

45
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,700
This boy and his plan to get you drunk,

46
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,733
I knew all about it.

47
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,867
I disregarded your wishes. I'm a bad mother.

48
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:23,299
But what he said isn't wrong!

49
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,966
You really do care too much about others and not enough about yourself.

50
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:33,300
That's why I agreed with what he did.

51
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,300
I'm also willing to accept your anger toward me.

52
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,532
Mom, I–

53
00:04:39,532 --> 00:04:41,833
It's fine.

54
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:49,866
Don't be in a rush to say you forgive us.

55
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,966
Hsing Ssu,

56
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,665
you can choose not to forgive us, but you must forgive yourself.

57
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:03,566
Do you understand?

58
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,666
Okay.

59
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,765
Mom, then can you help me with something?

60
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,065
When I call Yung Chieh, he never answers.

61
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,600
Can you tell me where he lives?

62
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,900
Hsing Ssu!

63
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,700
What's wrong?

64
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,133
You didn't reply all day.

65
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:54,365
Sorry about that. I let you guys worry.

66
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:57,499
Something happened, and I had to process my feelings.

67
00:05:57,499 --> 00:05:59,132
That's why I didn't contact you guys.

68
00:05:59,132 --> 00:06:00,933
Did something happen?

69
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,299
- Did your dad find out you're gay?
- Yes,

70
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,066
I confessed.

71
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:10,566
You're so brave.

72
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:13,199
What about your dad? What did he say?

73
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,200
Could he accept it?

74
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,232
He kind of accepted it.

75
00:06:17,232 --> 00:06:20,032
And he wants me to move back home.

76
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:21,899
Are you moving out?

77
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:23,866
Yes.

78
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:25,499
To tell you the truth,

79
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:28,733
I always wanted to move back home and live with my family.

80
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:33,599
What worried me most happened now, and the ending was a good one.

81
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:35,566
I'm really fortunate.

82
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,166
The fact you can return home is a good thing.

83
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,933
But as for leaving Li Cheng and me alone,

84
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:46,266
it feels a little lonely.

85
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,365
Mu Ren, Li Cheng is serious.

86
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:56,400
I know.

87
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,300
You don't have to tell me.

88
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,200
We already...

89
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:04,399
We're already together.

90
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,265
By "together," do you mean

91
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:12,033
- what I think you mean?
- Yes.

92
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,565
When?

93
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:17,533
I want to hear about it!

94
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:23,633
That night when I was drunk...

95
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:25,466
Did you even drink wine?

96
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,899
Thanks for coming with me today.

97
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:36,066
Why are you thanking me?

98
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:40,766
We were after this client for a long time, and we finally have him.

99
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:42,633
Congratulations!

100
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:47,533
This means the performance of Team 2 will skyrocket again!

101
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,565
But looking at this from another angle,

102
00:07:49,565 --> 00:07:53,766
I'm probably your lucky charm.

103
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,700
Look at that!

104
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:00,966
Let's go.

105
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,233
It's so pretty.

106
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,280
Look at them.

107
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,470
- I can't stand seeing them.
- Don't be so loud.

108
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:37,333
What?

109
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:41,466
Nothing.

110
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:49,565
Our relationship now, do you like it?

111
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,300
I like you.

112
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:59,699
But I'm still not used to it.

113
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:01,265
That's fine then.

114
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:04,765
Not being used to it in the beginning is normal, right?

115
00:09:04,765 --> 00:09:07,700
We don't need to care how others see us anyway.

116
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,100
Our happiness is our own.

117
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:19,010
Then... what do you like about me?

118
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,333
Lots of things!

119
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,832
When I'm with you, I can be myself.

120
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,866
And liking someone doesn't require a reason.

121
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,165
That's true.

122
00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:41,332
If you think about it, what's most important

123
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:43,499
is your face is "so cold."

124
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,065
So besides me, who else would like you?

125
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:49,733
Who else would accept your crazy personality?

126
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:51,099
Don't be angry.

127
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:52,933
I was just joking.

128
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:02,133
Next time, let's go on a date.

[MUSE Weddings]

130
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:24,833
Today's revenue from Team 2 exceeded NT$10 million (US$360,000)!

131
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,399
Thank you for your hard work!

132
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,665
Zoe is still the best in Team 2.

133
00:10:29,665 --> 00:10:31,365
Everyone should learn from her.

134
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:32,366
She indeed is our senior.

135
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:34,832
- Zoe, keep up the good work.
- Thanks, Manager.

136
00:10:34,832 --> 00:10:39,365
Manager, I finally understand what "being unable to beat the other half" means.

137
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,965
Then do you think what I said is right?

138
00:10:42,965 --> 00:10:44,833
Of course, it's right!

139
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,865
Children can be taught!

140
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:51,766
I decided to add another 5% to the year-end bonus!

141
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:54,466
Thank you, Manager!

Come here, everyone.

143
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,232
I know you worked hard this month.

144
00:11:00,232 --> 00:11:04,233
So as Manager, I'm treating everyone to Michelin at noon!

Okay!

Keep battling next month!

00:11:13,566 --> 00:11:15,432
Manager Hsiao, we want to go, too!

151
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:16,799
Sure!

152
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,665
Teng Teng's group members are also my group members.

I lost.

156

You defeated me.

157
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,966
You have to comfort me.

158
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:38,598
You and your team get along well.

159
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,632
They have a good attitude. You don't need comfort.

160
00:11:40,632 --> 00:11:42,065
Why do you say I don't need comfort?

161
00:11:42,065 --> 00:11:44,598
I used money to buy that.

162
00:11:44,598 --> 00:11:47,566
I lost a lot of money on this meal.

163
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:49,566
Please make up for it.

164
00:11:51,366 --> 00:11:54,832
This is the office, and we have working hours right now.

Our time together is already so limited. You don't even treasure it.

00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:02,166
I do treasure it.

167
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,566
I look forward to it, too.

168
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:07,099
Hsing Ssu's moving back home anyway.

169
00:12:07,099 --> 00:12:10,166
Eventually, there'll be only the two of us left.

170
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:15,199
So do you want Xiao Yeh to hurry and move?

171
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,033
Don't talk nonsense.

172
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:19,165
I'm just stating facts.

173
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:22,765
Then after Xiao Yeh leaves, what do you want to do to me?

174
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,700
I don't want to do anything to you.

175
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,432
What about what I want to do to you? Are you willing?

176
00:12:28,432 --> 00:12:31,533
Hsiao Li Cheng, aren't you being too straightforward?

177
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,232
I miss your body.

178
00:12:33,232 --> 00:12:35,999
I'm strongly sexually attracted to you.

179
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:38,966
What's wrong? Aren't you happy?

180
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:42,432
So are you saying

181
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:45,866
you like me just because of my body?

182
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,032
Of course not!

183
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:53,100
I like you, which is why I'm interested in your body.

184
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:55,565
If I recall correctly,

185
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:58,132
when you first liked me, you had a reverie (daydream) about me.

186
00:12:58,132 --> 00:12:59,833
Wasn't it?

187
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,866
Saying it like that isn't wrong.

188
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,532
Teng Teng, you're mistaken!

189
00:13:10,532 --> 00:13:12,365
I love you so I love your body!

190
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:14,698
Don't yell it so loudly!

191
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:18,100
When Xiao Yeh moves, we can stay in separate rooms at first.

192
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,932
Our bodies can meet later.

193
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,498
Shut up.

194
00:13:21,498 --> 00:13:23,533
Don't be so mean.

195
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:26,566
I love you so I love your body.

196
00:13:57,933 --> 00:14:01,199
Hsing Ssu, you don't need to move everything out.

197
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,433
You should leave a few sets of clothes here so you can come back anytime.

198
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:07,400
If I come back anytime

199
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,300
and interrupt your lovers' world,

200
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,766
that won't be good, either.

201
00:14:11,766 --> 00:14:13,166
Why not?

202
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,867
It's the same as before.

203
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:19,366
We three can still drink together, have talks, and stay up all night.

204
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:30,266
Mu Ren, do you really accept Li Cheng?

205
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:35,800
It's not a sudden impulse or overwhelming excitement, is it?

206
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,300
Why do you say that?

207
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,133
Because after becoming a couple,

208
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:45,300
the way you interact isn't how you interacted as friends.

209
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,432
I can tell Li Cheng truly loves you.

210
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:55,033
Do you think I'm not being honest?

211
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:57,266
I don't mean it like that.

212
00:14:57,266 --> 00:14:59,700
I just wanted to tell you

213
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,533
that after becoming a couple,

214
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:08,733
there are many things between you that can only happen in a relationship.

215
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:11,866
Do you mean sleeping together?

216
00:15:11,866 --> 00:15:14,466
You're scared I'm against it, right?

217
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:18,333
In the past, you both fought about the top and bottom business.

218
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:22,266
What I'm saying is it doesn't matter if it's lovers or couples,

219
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:24,834
things that happen in bed are important.

220
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:29,766
I don't want you guys to fight or create any problems.

221
00:15:29,766 --> 00:15:34,933
So find a time and talk it over with Li Cheng.

222
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,599
How do two men make love?

223
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,599
The first time a gay couple sleeps together,

224
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:26,166
you should know nine things before sleeping with someone.

225
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:52,200
Why are there so few things?

226
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,400
They're mostly clothes. Everything is stuffed inside.

227
00:16:57,966 --> 00:16:59,966
You don't have to take everything.

228
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:03,465
Leave a few sets of clothes here so you can come back anytime.

229
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:05,900
What?

230
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,067
I'm not joking. I'm being honest.

231
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:11,900
It's not that. Its just that you and Mu Ren said the same thing.

232
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,800
That's called having a connection.

233
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,360
[Yung Chieh]

234
00:17:57,366 --> 00:17:59,266
Long time no see.

235
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,966
I called you so many times, yet you never picked up.

236
00:18:07,566 --> 00:18:09,233
I was waiting.

237
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:10,866
Waiting for what?

238
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,399
For you to calm down.

239
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:16,140
Waiting for you to organize your feelings.

240
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,766
I only have one chance

241
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:22,600
to become your lover or your brother.

242
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:26,466
Then how come you called me?

243
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,633
Mom told me

244
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:34,333
you asked her for my address.

245
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,200
But you never came to see me.

246
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,950
So you were worried,

247
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,800
scared,

248
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,933
and you couldn't wait.

249
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:49,366
Did you then automatically call me?

250
00:18:55,533 --> 00:19:00,800
Dad said you showed him the video of my getting drunk.

251
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,300
Was this what you meant about helping me move back home?

252
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,700
Not completely. It was earlier than anticipated.

253
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:16,700
I originally planned to let you love me first before I graduated (as a medical doctor).

254
00:19:19,566 --> 00:19:21,733
But it happening early is also good.

255
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:25,466
You used this to come out of the closet.

256
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:28,466
Compared to being in love with me,

257
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:31,766
coming out of the closet

258
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:35,500
is easier for Dad to accept.

259
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:43,766
But because of this,

260
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:47,566
in order for Dad to be happy,

261
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:49,566
I won't be together with you in the end.

262
00:19:49,566 --> 00:19:51,766
I know,

263
00:19:51,766 --> 00:19:54,199
but you can go home now.

264
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,033
I will go home, but what about you?

265
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,466
Home was never that important to me.

266
00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:06,833
Dad has my mom to take care of him,

267
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,433
and you can go home.

268
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:12,566
It doesn't matter if I'm there or not.

269
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:14,167
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?

270
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:17,400
You're also my brother and part of the family.

271
00:20:21,366 --> 00:20:25,000
So is that your answer?

272
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,466
I understand.

273
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:57,566
You can't have a lot of things both ways.

274
00:20:57,566 --> 00:20:59,533
I'm not greedy.

275
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,966
But I'm greedy.

276
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,140
♫ Will you let me ♫

277
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,140
♫ Gently kiss you? ♫

278
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:20,430
♫ It's all so sweet and beautiful ♫

279
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,950
♫ I'm starting to slowly like you ♫

280
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,510
♫ You make me very curious ♫

281
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,100
♫ You're always on my mind ♫

282
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,690
♫ I always want to see you ♫

283
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:51,766
♫ I'm losing control over my longing for you ♫

284
00:21:51,766 --> 00:21:58,166
Yung Chieh, I want you to be my brother and my lover as well.

285
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,400
That's my answer.

286
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,570
♫ The stars that fill up the sky ♫

287
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:09,100
♫ Ocean wind blows your hair into a mess. It's so beautiful. I'm in a daze ♫

288
00:22:12,466 --> 00:22:14,566
It's not just gratitude, is it?

289
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,533
Even if it's gratitude, I'll still think it's true.

290
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:18,899
I won't let go.

291
00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:22,533
If you mess with me, there'll be trouble. You have to think carefully about it.

292
00:22:23,466 --> 00:22:26,099
I already thought about it very carefully.

293
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:29,699
Fu Yung Chieh, I like you.

294
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:31,666
Let's get Dad's blessing together.

295
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,320
Let's go home together.

296
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,030
♫ My baby ♫

297
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,266
Yeh Hsing Ssu is mine!

298
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:54,466
We're together! Wow!

299
00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:56,533
Are you that happy?

300
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:01,034
I'm so dizzy.

301
00:23:01,034 --> 00:23:03,580
That's enough! I'm so dizzy.

302
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,101
You want to kiss, don't you?

303
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:12,133
Yes. Do you want to kiss me? Kiss me!

304
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,700
Let me tell you something.

305
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,399
Carry me!

306
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:17,765
Hurry up!

307
00:23:17,765 --> 00:23:19,366
All right.

308
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,560
♫ My baby ♫

309
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,932
You're so great. Let me give you a reward, okay?

310
00:23:26,932 --> 00:23:28,600
Sure!

311
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:37,160
♫ Baby (Baby, Baby) ♫

312
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,030
♫ Be my baby (be my baby) ♫

313
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,620
♫ My baby ♫

314
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,600
Teng Teng, you'll never guess what!

315
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,000
Xiao Yeh really got together with that little devil.

316
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
How could he be so thoughtless?

317
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,333
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing!

318
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,000
Did Hsing Ssu talk to his brother?

319
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,520
Not just talked to, they're planning on being together!

320
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,600
They're working on how to face their father,

321
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,200
and they will cause quite a stir in the family.

322
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,733
Did Hsing Ssu make such a big decision?

323
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,600
Yes.

324
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,500
Because of that guy, he finally found the courage...

325
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,600
To face his beloved Dad.

326
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
He must be very sad.

327
00:24:54,466 --> 00:24:55,533
Not at all.

328
00:24:55,533 --> 00:24:56,966
He's very happy.

329
00:24:56,966 --> 00:24:58,200
Happy?

330
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,900
How so?

331
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,300
Facing opposition is definitely upsetting, but he's not alone.

332
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,900
The two of them will face it together.

333
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,700
So it's bittersweet.

334
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,600
As I was driving him back, Xiao Yeh smiled the whole time.

335
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:25,833
What are you doing?

336
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:27,300
I'm curious about what you're watching.

337
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,300
You were watching intensely with headphones on.

338
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,366
It's nothing.

339
00:25:31,366 --> 00:25:34,733
I'm just... looking for dating locations and stuff.

340
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,000
Dating?

341
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,800
I almost forgot.

342
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,300
I was just browsing.

343
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,800
It can't be whatever. This is our first date.

344
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,000
I'll plan it carefully.

345
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:50,066
Let's go tomorrow.

346
00:25:50,066 --> 00:25:50,967
Tomorrow?

347
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,500
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

348
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,700
All you need to do is participate.

349
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,830
[Sampo]

350
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:11,334
- Dad, I'm here.
- Okay.

351
00:26:11,334 --> 00:26:12,800
Tea, Daddy.

352
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Thanks, Mommy.

353
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:25,333
Did you meet Yung Chieh?

354
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,766
We met yesterday.

355
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:28,866
What happened?

356
00:26:28,866 --> 00:26:31,133
Did he force you to do anything?

357
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:33,700
Don't be softhearted and let him have his way.

358
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,300
That guy really has clever, crafty thinking!

359
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,000
Mom,

360
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,260
- we decided to be together.
- What!

361
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,250
What's wrong?

362
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,200
Nothing!

363
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,800
Why yell so loudly for no reason?

364
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:57,233
Hsing Ssu just said he found a cockroach in his room.

365
00:26:57,233 --> 00:26:59,133
I probably didn't clean properly.

366
00:26:59,133 --> 00:27:01,566
I'll use pesticide spray later.

367
00:27:01,566 --> 00:27:03,066
Are there cockroaches?

368
00:27:03,066 --> 00:27:05,800
Then we will spray everywhere, not just the bedroom.

369
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,690
All right.

370
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:13,733
Daddy, we ran out of the pesticide at home. Can you go buy some?

371
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:15,133
Fine.

372
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,300
Thanks, Daddy.

373
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,100
Thanks, Dad.

374
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:25,000
Are you guys really together?

375
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,400
Are you really fine with it,

376
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,833
or are you just being sympathetic?

377
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:34,400
Mom, are you against my being with Yung Chieh?

378
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,366
I'm not against it. I'm just worried.

379
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:43,000
Your personality is too softhearted so you'll definitely be bullied by him.

380
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,100
Also, you promised him so easily

381
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,366
that he will go find your dad next.

382
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:52,700
It's over. I even told your dad to go out.

383
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,366
Mom, relax.

384
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:56,833
I told Yung Chieh not to see Dad yet.

385
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,333
Don't provoke him like that.

386
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:02,266
If he were so obedient, his name wouldn't be Fu Yung Chieh (literally "always heroic").

387
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:05,300
This can't be. I will call and ask your dad to come home.

388
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,600
He might use the chance to go to him

389
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,200
and say he's going to get him to give his blessing.

390
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:21,666
Hello, Mommy?

391
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,100
Daddy, I found the pesticide.

392
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,500
You don't need to buy any. Hurry back.

393
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,000
Okay.

394
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,266
Where are we going?

395
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:45,866
You'll find out soon.

396
00:28:45,866 --> 00:28:47,533
I want you to anticipate it a little.

397
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:50,700
I put a lot of heart into choosing it. There won't be a problem.

398
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,100
We are here!

399
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,466
Is craft work our date's first stop?

400
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:03,966
Indeed!

401
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:05,633
Don't look down on crafting.

402
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:08,133
Sweetness can be made here!

403
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:11,300
It's also practical and a good place to remember.
[Shu's]

404
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,200
It's practical and memorable.

405
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,133
I understand. But what's sweet?

406
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:18,599
You'll see soon enough.

407
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:20,366
You'll like it for sure.

408
00:29:20,366 --> 00:29:22,300
Let's go! I reserved the first show.

409
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,166
Add some woodworking design...

410
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:27,100
Look at this place!

411
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,533
I'm so good at choosing.

412
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,799
It's full of artistic atmosphere and super suitable for us.

413
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:33,033
Senior!

414
00:29:33,033 --> 00:29:34,400
Po Hsiang?

00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,000
Why are you guys here?

416
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,990
We are on a date.

417
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,600
We are here on a date also.

418
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,700
So are you Senior's other half?

419
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,066
Hello,

420
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:48,666
I'm Teng Mu Ren.

421
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:49,700
I'm Sun Po Hsiang.

422
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,066
This is my darling, Lu Chi Gang.

423
00:29:52,066 --> 00:29:53,700
Hello.

424
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,500
He's my darling.

425
00:29:56,433 --> 00:29:57,700
That many darlings?

426
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,400
Darling against darling.

427
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,766
Are you also here for the pottery class?

428
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,633
- Are you, too?
- Yes, it's our first class.

429
00:30:03,633 --> 00:30:06,166
What a coincidence! I will look around with Teng Teng first.

430
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:07,000
- Okay.
- See you later.

431
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,100
- Okay. Bye.
- Okay.

432
00:30:10,533 --> 00:30:13,000
Teng Teng, look at that cup.

433
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,400
Do you still remember when we were first together?

434
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,633
Of course, I remember.

435
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:19,500
I wonder if there's a shower here.

436
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,133
What are you talking about?

437
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:23,700
This here: one black, one white.

438
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,200
I think it's perfect for us.

439
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,301
The design is good as well.

440
00:30:29,301 --> 00:30:30,600
The texture is also good.

441
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,166
If we could take it home, it'd be great.

442
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:35,000
Did I say I want to marry you?

443
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,900
It's a good thing you said that a long time ago.

444
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,700
Did I remember incorrectly?

445
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,600
Do you like it? (When doubled, the cup handles' characters signify marriage luck and fortune.)

446
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,300
It really is pretty. (When doubled, the cup handles' characters signify marriage luck and fortune.)

They are a longtime couple, and we only just got together.

00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:21,666
and sent it to the loudmouth employee who spread it?

493
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:23,500
It looks that way.

494
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,200
But in the video, I found the reflection of a person who was filming. It was a woman.

495
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,833
- A woman?
- Yes.

496
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:33,966
I tried to enlarge it so it's pixelated and slightly blurry,

497
00:34:33,966 --> 00:34:37,200
but you can probably see if it's anyone from your company.

498
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:45,100
I don't know her.

499
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,266
It's probably not an employee.

500
00:34:47,266 --> 00:34:49,200
If it's not, that makes things more difficult.

501
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,700
Let me think.

502
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,500
Don't trouble yourself.

503
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,933
I'll just be more careful next time.

504
00:34:55,933 --> 00:34:57,600
Thanks for your help.

505
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,566
I will thank you properly another day.

506
00:34:59,566 --> 00:35:01,200
Do you want to thank me?

507
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,333
Thanking me is easy.

508
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:05,000
Help me by giving me a discount.

509
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,800
Help?

510
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,100
You've been together for eight years.

511
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,000
But… he called Li Cheng "Senior."

512
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:17,800
When we met, he was a junior in high school.

513
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,800
I'm older by twelve years.

514
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,000
That much?

515
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,433
Sorry, sorry!

516
00:35:27,433 --> 00:35:29,166
I didn't mean anything else.

517
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:30,100
That's fine.

518
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,700
Your reaction is already very subtle.

519
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:36,700
Po Hsiang always says not to worry about what others think

520
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,500
because our happiness is our own.

521
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,000
That thinking is similar to Li Cheng's.

522
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:49,300
No wonder they get on so well.

523
00:35:52,966 --> 00:35:56,799
Even though I'm older, it is he who actually takes care of me.

524
00:35:56,799 --> 00:36:01,000
You guys have been together for so long, yet you still go on dates.

525
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,866
You must really love each other.

526
00:36:02,866 --> 00:36:03,833
We do.

527
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:07,200
We came here today to make presents to give ourselves for our wedding.

528
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,800
- Wedding presents?
- Yes.

529
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,700
We are getting married.

530
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,600
Congratulations!

531
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,900
When the time comes, will you attend with Li Cheng?

532
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,900
For sure!

533
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,866
To happiness!

534
00:36:20,866 --> 00:36:22,500
To happiness.

535
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,500
Mister, your drinks are ready.

536
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,600
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

537
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,867
Here.

538
00:36:36,867 --> 00:36:38,800
- Did you finish talking?
- Yes.

539
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,300
Thanks.

540
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,066
Mommy, I'm going to buy cigarettes.

541
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,633
I will come with you. Wait for me.

542
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:59,065
Why would come with me to buy cigarettes?

543
00:36:59,065 --> 00:37:00,732
I'll keep you company.

544
00:37:00,732 --> 00:37:03,866
Give me ten minutes to wash the dishes.

545
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:07,566
What's wrong? You're so nervous and unsettled today.

546
00:37:07,566 --> 00:37:10,766
It's nothing, but your health isn't good lately.

547
00:37:10,766 --> 00:37:13,865
I'm scared it's dangerous for you to go out alone.

548
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,399
What if you accidentally fall

549
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,666
or... or have a heart attack?

550
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:21,167
If it's not handled well, our whole family will be separated!

551
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:23,900
That's an exaggeration.

552
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,666
Dad, you stay here and keep Mom company. I'll buy your cigarettes.

553
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:28,932
All right!

554
00:37:28,932 --> 00:37:30,698
Daddy, help me with the dishes.

555
00:37:30,698 --> 00:37:32,432
There are so many to wash.

556
00:37:32,432 --> 00:37:35,300
That's enough, Dad. Mom worries about your health.

557
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,150
You stay with Mom.

558
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,000
Okay?

559
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,100
You be careful yourself.

560
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,900
You're here!

561
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,800
I missed you.

562
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,200
Didn't we see each other yesterday?

563
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,400
We have to meet every day.

564
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:20,900
Okay, I missed you, too.

565
00:38:26,366 --> 00:38:31,000
Actually, I was hanging around outside of home all day.

566
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,500
I originally thought I'd say everything to Dad privately,

567
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,000
but I thought of my promise to you.

568
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,100
So I kept holding it in.

569
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:42,966
But it's uncomfortable. It's hard. I want to tell Dad.

570
00:38:42,966 --> 00:38:45,133
Yung Chieh, with Dad's health…

571
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:46,465
I know.

572
00:38:46,465 --> 00:38:48,665
I'm a medical student. I will be careful.

573
00:38:48,665 --> 00:38:51,900
I won't make it harder for you or make you feel guilty for life.

574
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Fine.

575
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,900
Then when you invite Dad, tell me.

576
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,700
We will go together.

577
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:10,900
Come get cigarettes with me.

578
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,400
Okay.

579
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:38,100
You should look ahead when walking. Why do you keep looking at me?

580
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,200
Because looking at you like this makes me happy.

581
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,700
Is that enough to make you happy?

582
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,266
Yes.

583
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:53,300
Because when I'm holding your hand and walking by your side like this,

584
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,000
I'm no longer just your brother.

585
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,900
I'm your lover.

586
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,300
Then... do you want to be even happier?

587
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,800
Yes.

588
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:09,266
Talk sweetly to me.

589
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:17,166
I'm your boyfriend. You can sweet-talk me anytime you want.

590
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:20,900
I don't know how.

591
00:40:23,066 --> 00:40:24,498
Then you should learn.

592
00:40:24,498 --> 00:40:25,899
Come.

593
00:40:43,366 --> 00:40:45,900
Now we are a couple.

594
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,233
What do you want to do to me?

595
00:40:50,899 --> 00:40:52,800
I want to kiss you.

596
00:40:57,033 --> 00:41:00,099
You should learn to sweet-talk me.

597
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:02,433
Ask me for something.

598
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:06,566
Then kiss me.

599
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:11,133
The request is there.

600
00:41:11,133 --> 00:41:13,066
What about sweet talk?

601
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:34,666
The first step with sweet-talking is slowly getting closer to the other person's body,

602
00:41:35,866 --> 00:41:37,766
reducing the distance.

603
00:41:46,366 --> 00:41:48,466
And the second step

604
00:41:50,699 --> 00:41:55,000
is to gently rest your face on the other person's face,

605
00:41:56,733 --> 00:41:59,200
just a light touch.

606
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:04,600
Next,

607
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,800
you can name your desire.

608
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,433
It's your turn.

609
00:42:22,033 --> 00:42:23,866
Kiss me.

I think every day we spend together is worth celebrating.

00:46:31,033 --> 00:46:33,632
When we were apart, we had our own personalities.

658
00:46:33,632 --> 00:46:37,333
But when we're together, we become one.

659
00:46:37,966 --> 00:46:41,333
Teng Teng, you're absolutely right!

660
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:45,933
This is why I chose this pair.

661
00:46:47,466 --> 00:46:51,765
Then... what are you getting me next time?

662
00:46:51,765 --> 00:46:53,299
Whatever you want, just say it!

663
00:46:53,299 --> 00:46:55,233
I will buy it all for you.

664
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,933
I want something unique.

665
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,066
What is it?

666
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:06,266
Think about it yourself.

667
00:47:13,866 --> 00:47:17,980
But this ring already took me so long to think of.

668
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,590
How long do you need to think?

669
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,020
Three days.

670
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:26,560
Then I'll give you three months to think of one this time.

671
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,840
I got it! I'll wrap myself up as a gift for you.

672
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:40,620
♫ A promise tied to the chest ♫

673
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:45,620
♫ Paralyzed in place, unable to walk ♫

674
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:54,290
♫ Insomnia under the night sky with only one excuse ♫

675
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:59,870
♫ In the end, you don't concern me ♫

676
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:06,790
♫ Later on, it won't exist anymore ♫

677
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,470
♫ My eyelid brims are suddenly hot ♫

678
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:13,610
♫ I can only cherish the memories that drift in the sea of my mind ♫

679
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:21,290
♫ Later on, I laugh as I'm filled with emotions and thoughts ♫

680
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:26,530
♫ I'm content to finally understand for once ♫

681
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:29,950
♫ Even breathing is torturous ♫

682
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:33,300
♫ Lost within my heart ♫

683
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,280
♫ I've looked for all the exits ♫

684
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,240
♫ Yet I didn't find a reason to give up ♫

685
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,630
♫ All the fantasies have been broken ♫

686
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:49,120
♫ The memories will no longer flow ♫

687
00:48:49,120 --> 00:49:00,410
♫ Turns out that the wounds you can't see are the most painful ♫
