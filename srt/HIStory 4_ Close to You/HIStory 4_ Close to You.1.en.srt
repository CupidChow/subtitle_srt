[MUSE Weddings]

15
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,466
- Good morning, Director.
- Morning.

16
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:42,633
- Good morning, Director.
- Morning.

17
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,734
- Here.
- Thank you, Director.

18
00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:59,666
- Put this on my desk.
- Okay.

19
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,966
Thanks.

20
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,399
Hot latte with no sugar.

21
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:18,133
- Thanks.
- No problem.

22
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:20,933
You work very hard so let me serve you a bit.

23
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:21,899
Iselin, Alice!

24
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,300
- Wilson! Hi!
- Hi, Wilson!

25
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,566
Your hair accessory looks really nice. I can see it from so far away!

26
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:26,666
Oh, thank you.

27
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,933
Why don't you have one? That's okay. Next week I'll buy you one.

28
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:30,101
- That's so nice.
- And do you know what?

29
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:33,365
This Western-style clothing really suits an elegant beauty like you.

30
00:02:33,365 --> 00:02:36,367
- And the best color would be—
- He's here! He's here!

31
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:39,400
He's as charismatic as ever today!

32
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,532
I took a picture.

33
00:02:40,532 --> 00:02:42,866
Send it to me! Send it to me!

34
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,320
Wow, what is this?

35
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,266
- So handsome!
- It's Manager Hsiao.

36
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:54,333
When it comes to men, you have to look at their body.

37
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,720
Everything is real. You can even touch it.

38
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,230
- He's so sturdy.
- I knew he worked out.

39
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,100
If you say these things, you can be sued for sexual harassment.

40
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,965
I'm being touched. I'm not touching others.

41
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:07,166
As long as you cause trouble, it is harassment.

42
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,200
Do you girls feel harassed by me?

43
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,266
It's okay. Just tell me.

44
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:16,433
That... We still have things to do so we'll get going.

45
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:23,199
Look at you.

46
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,566
You scared the girls away.

47
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:28,465
Haven't you been staying up late recently?

48
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:29,900
Are you still drinking coffee?

49
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,965
I...

50
00:03:30,965 --> 00:03:36,066
Because... drinking a cup of coffee every morning is Hsing Ssu's habit.

51
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:39,201
Late nights hurt the body, and coffee hurts the stomach. Don't you have any common sense?

52
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:41,766
What do you mean, "Don't you have any common sense"? You're the one with no common sense.

53
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:43,933
Also... What are you doing?

54
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:46,433
If you can't drink coffee, then you can't casually take medication either.

55
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:48,599
This is stomach medicine. Its properties are mild.

56
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,999
There's milk added to my coffee.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,665
It's fresh milk, not creamer.

58
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,099
It doesn't hurt the stomach.

59
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,066
There's a newcomer today. You guys continue.

60
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,666
I will go ahead first.

61
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:00,633
Give it back.

62
00:04:04,468 --> 00:04:06,632
I am Yeh Hsing Ssu and 28 years old.

63
00:04:06,632 --> 00:04:09,778
I'm the Creative Director of the Design Department at MUSE Weddings.

64
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,197
I like creating happiness for others,

65
00:04:12,197 --> 00:04:15,130
but I've never had a girlfriend before.

66
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:20,432
Because... in middle school, I discovered I like men.

67
00:04:20,432 --> 00:04:23,181
He is Hsiao Li Cheng, Manager of Team 1 in the Sales Department.

68
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:24,547
He has a bold, direct personality.

69
00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:26,429
He is very manly and loyal.

70
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:28,930
When he's in a group, there's never a dull moment.

71
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,419
He thinks men shouldn't focus on details when getting things done

72
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:34,319
and must look handsome in the process.

73
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,608
The one who excites girls is Teng Mu Ren, Manager of Team 2 in the Sales Department.

74
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:40,816
He's the company's famous Cold Prince

75
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:43,948
because he is cold and indifferent to everyone.

76
00:04:43,948 --> 00:04:46,656
Acting scrupulously and methodically, he may shoot cold arrows (hurt others),

77
00:04:46,656 --> 00:04:49,453
but he actually has a soft and delicate heart.

78
00:04:49,453 --> 00:04:52,555
We are the company's iron triangle (strong, sturdy, united). We're "brothers."

79
00:04:58,066 --> 00:04:59,766
Why did you guys follow me to the Design Department?

80
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,666
Stomach medicine.

81
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,365
Is it enough to just take stomach medicine?

82
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:05,500
Look how tired you are.

83
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,799
Thanks.

84
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:08,665
This week, it's your turn to cook dinner.

85
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,499
I suggest we go out to eat!

86
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,533
My treat, he pays.

87
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:13,565
Why is it I who pays?

88
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:14,865
"Why?"

89
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:16,465
Don't think that I know nothing.

90
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:21,201
Xiao Yeh, let me tell you. His Sales Team 2 just recently had a huge order.

91
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:24,365
You are so miserly.

92
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,632
Indeed, we'll beat you in sales performance this month.

93
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:28,832
I can pay for the meal to comfort you, the loser.

94
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,066
Awesome! I'll look for a restaurant.

95
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:34,201
Director, the new floral designer, Liu Mei Fang, is here. She's at the reception desk.

96
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,200
Liu Mei Fang?

97
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:49,933
What is it?

98
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:54,833
- Put this on my desk.
- What's up with him?

99
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,265
Maybe he's possessed.

100
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:57,866
Go take a look.

101
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,399
Here's mine as well.

102
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:23,600
Are you having a brain seizure or facial palsy?

103
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,600
Come and help me see how to be more handsome.

104
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,467
Whatever you like.

105
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:29,266
You'll be a bit inferior to me anyway.

106
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:31,466
What do you mean, "Whatever you like"?

107
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:33,566
I'm being serious.

108
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:34,966
Which smile seems more sincere?

109
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:36,833
Like this?

110
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,266
What exactly is going on?

111
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:42,266
That Liu Mei Fang, what is her relationship with you?

112
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,766
There's no relationship yet.

113
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:48,633
What do you mean by that?

114
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:51,566
- She–
- What is it?

115
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:54,233
Spit it out (explain)!

116
00:06:55,133 --> 00:07:00,366
- She... was my first love.
- What?

117
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:11,733
- Yes!
- Enough!

118
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:13,132
Come and chase me.

119
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:16,033
What are you doing, Hsiao Li Cheng?

120
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,433
Hsiao Li Cheng!

121
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:20,565
Come and chase me.

122
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:25,566
One, two, three, freeze! One, two, three, freeze!

123
00:07:27,966 --> 00:07:29,800
Come and chase me.

124
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:37,200
Why are you guys laughing at her? Why are you laughing at her?

125
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,432
You're the one who did it!

126
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:40,666
I'm telling you to shut up!

127
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,200
Are you sure you liked her, considering you acted that way?

128
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,066
Hearing that just makes me want to hit you.

129
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,199
I admit my childhood personality was a bit vile.

130
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,066
But isn't that how you're supposed to be when you like a girl?

131
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:57,065
You have to get her attention!

132
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:58,866
It's more like getting her to kill you.

133
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:00,399
Let's not dwell on the past.

134
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,099
We need to look toward the future.

135
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,233
Now God arranged for me to reunite with her.

136
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:07,133
This is destiny.

137
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:12,165
I think she won't be as happy as you are now after she sees you.

138
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:14,165
Of course, I know that.

139
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,033
That's why I'm asking you two for help.

140
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:19,333
You guys have to help me showcase my merits to her.

141
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,266
Let her know that I was reborn

142
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:22,900
and am completely different.

143
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,200
First loves never work out.

144
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,133
You didn't even help yet. Why are you jumping to conclusions?

145
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:39,466
Xiao Yeh, I only have you now.

146
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:41,000
Help me.

147
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,800
You created the situation yourself so you deal with it.

148
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,765
Okay! I'll deal with it.

149
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:47,165
This meal is on me.

150
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,100
Guys, help me.

151
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:51,499
Don't you like to eat seafood?

152
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,400
Then let's get a lobster baked with a cheese topping.

153
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,466
All right. Let's also order a salmon steak.

154
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:59,233
Okay, then I want to order a short rib.

155
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:00,665
The dried salted fish isn't bad also. I like fish.

156
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,234
- Okay. I want four orders of chicken legs.
- Okay.

157
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:05,066
Hey, there are scallop rolls. Don't you like scallops?

158
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:07,401
- Then let's have three orders of that.
- All right.

159
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:09,766
There are only three of us.

160
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:11,965
Let's get a bottle of alcohol as well.

161
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:14,066
Let's get Taiji, the NT$4,980 ($176 U.S.) bottle. What do you think?

162
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:15,101
- Of course.
- Okay.

163
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:18,667
Boss, we want Taiji sake, the $4,890 bottle! Thank you!

164
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:19,999
We still have to work tomorrow.

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,333
We didn't order vegetables just now. How about ordering some?

166
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,501
- Let's get some vegetables.
- Yes.

167
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:24,698
This white water snowflake stem looks good.

168
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:26,632
Isn't that too many dishes?

169
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,333
I want to eat sashimi.

170
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,632
- Do you want salmon sashimi?
- We can't finish it all.

171
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:30,799
Sure, let's order a salmon sashimi.

172
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,065
Just now I saw...

173
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:35,633
It's fine. I want to eat king oyster mushrooms. I think they aren't bad.

174
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,066
I have to get you.

175
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:17,832
Good morning, everyone.

176
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,000
Good morning.

177
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:27,366
- Are you getting used to everything?
- Yes.

178
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:29,333
Sister Wang taught me a lot.

179
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,399
No need to be so nervous.

180
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,266
Later, I will take you to see the other departments.

181
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:33,101
Okay.

182
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:35,333
Good morning, everyone!

183
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,765
I brought coffee!

184
00:11:36,766 --> 00:11:39,733
Wilson, why are you being so nice, treating everyone to coffee?

185
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,900
I heard you have a new colleague in your department.

186
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,866
The boss said before that the departments should care for each other.

187
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:47,500
So I brought coffee to get to know you all better.

188
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,765
Thank you, Wilson!

189
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:50,299
You're welcome, you're welcome.

190
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,732
You found out that our new colleague is especially pretty

191
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:54,673
so you came to take a look, right?

192
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,166
Hello.

193
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,165
I'm the manager of Team 1 from the Sales Department, Hsiao Li Cheng.

194
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,266
You can call me Wilson.

195
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:02,965
Hsiao Li Cheng?

196
00:12:02,966 --> 00:12:05,067
- Is your home in Nanjichang?
- That's right.

197
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:07,465
You studied at Xinhe Elementary and Wanhua Middle Schools.

198
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:09,265
Your nickname was Hsiao Yay.

199
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:10,465
Do you still remember?

200
00:12:10,465 --> 00:12:11,865
So you two know each other. What a coincidence!

201
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:13,533
- Then let's have lunch together at noon.
- That's not necessary.

202
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,900
Of course, that'll be great!

203
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,432
Why are you afraid to catch up?

204
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:18,799
You won't cry when you talk about it, will you?

205
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:20,265
Oh, I remember!

206
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:23,833
When you were little, your nickname was Runny Nose, right?

207
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:28,866
Am I wrong?

208
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:30,466
I should be right.

209
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:35,800
You should just jump down. I don't mind helping.

210
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,333
Let go!

211
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,133
Don't use so much force. He really will fall off.

212
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:41,632
I won't die!

213
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:43,065
I will not give up!

214
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:45,800
I will keep going. I will keep trying hard!

215
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,733
"Trying hard," whatever. You're basically asking to be hated.

216
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:51,066
Do you really like her?

217
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:53,665
I really do, Teng Teng!

218
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,365
I really do like her.

219
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:57,599
Use your charisma to help me!

220
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,665
She's my first love.

221
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,400
My happiness, for the rest of my life, depends on you.

222
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,433
Mu Ren... I think since Liu Mei Fang instantly thought of him after hearing the name Hsiao Li Cheng,

223
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:06,765
she does feel something for him.

224
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:09,666
If he works a little harder, perhaps there's hope.

225
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,833
Hope is a disillusionment.

226
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,099
I don't want disillusionment!

227
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,033
I will listen to whatever you say. Just help me.

228
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,765
Enough, Mu Ren. You should just help him.

229
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:25,133
I'm begging you, Bro.

230
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,760
So handsome.

231
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,165
Thank you.

232
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:54,266
You must be the new person in the design department.

233
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,499
Hello.

234
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,200
I'm the manager of Team 2 in the sales department. I'm Teng Mu Ren.

235
00:13:59,866 --> 00:14:02,100
I'm Liu Mei Fang.

236
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,900
I wonder if I could have the honor of eating a meal with you

237
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,760
to build a better relationship between the design and sales departments.

238
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,400
They...

239
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:14,299
I know a good restaurant,

240
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,200
and it's almost lunch time.

241
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,133
Let's go together.

242
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:27,232
Why is he asking the newbie to lunch?

243
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,066
Isn't he the Cold Prince?

244
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:32,800
- Hurry, hurry.
- Quickly message the group chat. This is outrageous.

245
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,034
This restaurant's pesto pasta is very delicious. I recommend you try it.

246
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:45,533
Really? I like pesto a lot.

247
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:47,300
Did you guys come?

248
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,100
Sit.

249
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:56,999
Wilson and I lead Teams 1 and 2 of the sales department, respectively.

250
00:14:56,999 --> 00:15:01,700
We invited you to lunch because we hope to work happily together from now on.

251
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,466
Thank you.

252
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:21,932
Order whatever you want.

253
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:23,499
No need to be shy with me.

254
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,733
We already know each other for so long...

255
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:29,699
I heard Hsing Ssu say Wilson's nickname was "Hsiao Yay" when he was little.

256
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:31,733
I think it's super appropriate.

257
00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:34,333
Children are indeed very honest.

258
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,165
When he was little, he really seemed like a crazy person.

259
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,365
One moment he'd laugh, and the next he'd cry with you.

260
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:42,566
In the past, his parents often took him to the temple to pray for his soul.

261
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,299
It looks like that didn't really work.

262
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,633
He's still not normal now.

263
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,499
What would you like to order?

264
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,333
Ladies first.

265
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:56,099
I'd like the pesto pasta,

266
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,665
the mango mousse, and iced milk tea.

267
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,765
- Okay.
- Thank you.

268
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:01,165
What would you gentlemen like?

269
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,499
Why don't they have it?

270
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,665
Rotini?

271
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,399
They don't have that here, but there's penne.

272
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,665
Then that has to be paired with...

273
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:07,733
Baked cheese,

274
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:10,465
a rich Bolognese sauce, or vegetable sauce works as well.

275
00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:11,300
But...

276
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:14,000
If you want pesto, then you can choose the shell pasta.

277
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,999
- Then...
- Get oriental beauty tea (Taiwanese oolong tea).

278
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,866
You'll like it. It can also wash away strong flavors.

279
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:21,565
Seafood pesto, shell pasta,

280
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:22,733
and hot oriental beauty tea.

281
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,100
Thank you.

282
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:26,433
I want a tomato meat sauce over fettuccine.

283
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:29,533
For dessert, a red-bean-and-matcha cake, as well as a caramel pudding.

284
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:31,733
A hot Americano coffee, thank you.

285
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:36,566
What is it?

286
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,899
Nothing. I just think you two know each other really well.

287
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:44,333
We knew each other for five years now.

288
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,065
He's my senior.

289
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:49,034
When I first joined the company, he took me with him to run business errands every day.

290
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:52,566
He worked me so hard daily that I'd be asleep the moment my head hit the pillow.

291
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:54,333
You heard the customer's request.

292
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,165
Go home and re-do the proposal for me.

293
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,966
Do I have to make another one?

294
00:16:57,966 --> 00:17:00,300
This is already the fifth time we visited!

295
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,633
It's not even a big order.

296
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,166
What is a big order?

297
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,766
A big order is at least NT$1 million ($35,000 U.S.), right?

298
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:21,899
Everyone's wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime event!

299
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:24,066
Every order is a big order.

300
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:27,000
If you don't recognize that, then don't join the wedding business.

301
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,265
It's not like that.

302
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:30,465
I just think it's a waste of time.

303
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,698
Just now, the customer was being difficult on purpose.

304
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:35,698
The more difficult the customer, the more you can show your abilities.

305
00:17:35,698 --> 00:17:37,432
That's not right.

306
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:40,766
In business, you must also understand time costs money.

307
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:49,566
If you don't like how I do things, then find someone else to lead you.

308
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:51,365
I don't want that!

309
00:17:51,366 --> 00:17:55,533
I'll learn all your skills and become better than you at sales!

310
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:04,166
Not having enough physical energy, you should know to self-reflect.

311
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,666
Don't I have enough energy? I have great physical energy!

312
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:10,433
When I play basketball, I can finish a whole game. After halftime, you're done.

313
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,580
♫ In the next second, when the doors open, you and I meet by pleasant surprise ♫

314
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:24,030
♫ Calculating it, this probability may be one in ten million ♫

315
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,160
♫ The love line is on display: red, yellow, blue, green ♫

316
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,060
♫ No matter where you fly to, my heart will follow step by step ♫

317
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:33,299
Hey!
♫ Praying for 20 20 (love you, love you) ♫

318
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:35,966
What are you doing?

319
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:37,966
Play by yourself.

320
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:40,899
I need someone to defend against me. How do I play alone?

321
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:42,133
I'm tired.

322
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:47,090
♫ Forgetting it won't change that you're at the heart of my happiness ♫

323

♫ Oh, turns out there is no way to prove love ♫

♫ That being captured by you is my destiny in life ♫

327
00:19:02,566 --> 00:19:05,333
I just hate sweating too much.

328
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,200
Sweating is manly, all right?

329
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,299
Look at you. You're always in an air-conditioned room

330
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:12,533
so your hands are icy cold.

331
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,200
He probably went out to eat at a high-end place.

332
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,866
Is he deeply closeted?

333
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:25,666
- Really?
- She's here.

334
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,466
Mei Fang, are you close to Manager Teng?

335
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:33,232
What did Manager Teng talk to you about?

336
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:35,199
Nothing much. We just got to know each other

337
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,401
and said to help each other at work in the future, very normal things.

338
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:39,499
How is that normal?

339
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,666
Manager Teng never ate a meal with a female colleague before.

340
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:43,533
That's right.

341
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:46,966
Manager Hsiao, Creative Director Yeh, and he are an iron triangle.

342
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:48,265
They all eat together

343
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:50,133
or alone.

344
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:53,532
That... Does Manager Hsiao normally

345
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:56,266
hug Manager Teng like that?

346
00:19:56,266 --> 00:19:57,966
Hug?

347
00:19:57,966 --> 00:20:01,699
Because I saw him randomly hugging Manager Teng.

348
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:03,032
Manager Hsiao is like that.

349
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:05,733
That's how he shows his affection. He would often put his arms

350
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:07,732
around our Creative Director too.

351
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:08,733
Is that so?

352
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:09,699
What's wrong?

353
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,733
You seem very disappointed.

354
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,100
I'm not.

355
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,166
Okay then. I will go back to work now.

356
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,100
You can continue with your work.

357
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:30,165
Apple, mango and dragon fruit (large cactus fruit).

358
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,299
All the fruits you like blended into juice.

359
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,000
There's no added sugar.

360
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,732
I tried it for you already.

361
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:38,199
You'll definitely like it.

362
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,700
Trust me.

363
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,332
It's not bad.

364
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:48,033
See?

365
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:51,833
Is this pressure all right?

Gentler.

367
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:55,166
Got it.

368
00:20:58,233 --> 00:21:00,566
What gift would she like?

369
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:04,499
How many times did I tell you?

370
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,133
Don't talk right next to my ear.

371
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,565
I know your ear is your sensitive spot.

372
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:11,906
I just wanted to make you comfortable.

373
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:14,898
I'm repaying you.

374
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,499
- So stupid!
- Hey.

375
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:20,466
You still didn't tell me what type of gift she would like.

376
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:22,365
How would I know what she likes?

377
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:23,832
How could you not know?

378
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:27,333
You're the best at observing and understanding people.

379
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,666
Help me analyze her.

380
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:32,001
Gift her flowers.

381
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:34,532
Flowers? Why flowers?

382
00:21:34,532 --> 00:21:37,701
On the way from the office to the restaurant, isn't there a flower shop?

383
00:21:37,701 --> 00:21:40,232
Today, as we passed the flower store, I noticed

384
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,313
that she looked there a few extra times.

385
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,933
You really do understand women!

386
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,366
You met and interacted with countless people.

387
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,565
Don't touch me.

388
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:55,099
Why are you so nervous?

389
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,199
Why can't I touch you?

390
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,699
Could it be really small so you won't let me touch?

391
00:21:58,699 --> 00:22:00,966
Immature! How old (also means big) are you?

392
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:02,833
Mine is definitely bigger than yours!

393
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:03,833
Nonsense.

394
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:05,365
If you're not convinced, let's compare.

395

- Come on.
- Hey!

396
00:22:06,966 --> 00:22:08,533
No! You're crazy!

397
00:22:08,534 --> 00:22:10,766
Stop touching me!

398
00:22:10,766 --> 00:22:12,600
Hurry up!

00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,933
Take off your pants.

400
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:15,933
Don't be scared.

401
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,099
Are you crazy?

What are you guys doing?

403
00:22:19,266 --> 00:22:20,465
Comparing "chicken" (penis) sizes.

404
00:22:20,466 --> 00:22:21,766
I don't want to compare.

405
00:22:21,766 --> 00:22:23,633
You must be small so you're scared to compare.

406
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,900
- Come on!
- Stop touching me, Hsiao Li Cheng!

407
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,732
Do you like chicken that much?

408
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:28,065
Perfect.

409
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:30,766
Tonight, I want fried chicken.

I hope you have a lovely day. Hsiao Li Cheng.

412
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:12,065
Although she threw the card away, she still accepted the flowers.

413
00:23:12,065 --> 00:23:14,800
She even put them on her desk. T-Think—

414

Teng Teng, you're amazing!

415

She really does like flowers.

416
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:24,233
Thinking back to the past, I gave her my favorite candy, toys, and study books,

417
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:26,765
but she didn't even look at them. She just threw them all away.

418
00:23:26,766 --> 00:23:29,400
She even burned all the study books right in front of me.

419
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,299
It sounds like she really hated you.

420
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,099
But she accepted the flowers!

421
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,965
This is a good sign.

422
00:23:34,966 --> 00:23:36,898
A good start is half the battle.

423
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:41,633
As long as I keep going, successful love is just around the corner!

424
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,534
Is he too optimistic, or am I too pessimistic?

425
00:23:44,534 --> 00:23:47,233
I think this first love of his will never succeed.

426
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:51,266
I think he should know when to stop. We should warn him so he understands the situation.

427
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:54,100
Enough.

428
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,232
If he really fails in the end,

429
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:58,866
then we will just comfort him.

430

Hey, why did you delete it?

Reality is cruel.

If you want to move forward, don't reminisce about the past.

This is the first time Mei Fang accepted one of my gifts!

What's wrong with him, Xiao Yeh?

438
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:33,865
He probably doesn't like people saying he's sweet.

Isn't there a name written on it?

There wasn't one last time. There probably won't be one this time either.

Why are we drinking so much beer?

00:27:09,066 --> 00:27:10,299
What about misua (type of noodle)?

484
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:13,232
Let's not eat misua. The chicken leg bento is really good.

485
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:15,299
That's right! You're already so skinny. Why eat misua?

486
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:18,832
Also, you can go to Chenji after work to eat their beef soup.

487
00:27:18,832 --> 00:27:20,698
Let me tell you. This place's misua is really good.

488
00:27:20,699 --> 00:27:21,932
Let me tell you. It's only all right.

489
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,999
Sister Wang, you're picking this place again.

490
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:26,065
What do you mean, I'm "picking this place again"?

491
00:27:26,065 --> 00:27:27,532
It's because you're too picky!

492
00:27:27,532 --> 00:27:28,699
- All right.
- I don't like this place's...

493
00:27:28,699 --> 00:27:30,132
- It's my treat today, okay?
- Wow.

494
00:27:30,132 --> 00:27:31,665
That's so nice of you, Sister Wang.

495
00:27:31,665 --> 00:27:34,666
Boss, I'll take Matsusaka pork with rice.

496
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:38,999
I want Chinese angelica duck leg bento with extra beans and dates.

497
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:40,533
Okay.

498
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,199
I'm still a bit nervous.

499
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:50,132
Don't worry. The director is just on the quiet side, but he's really nice.

500
00:27:50,132 --> 00:27:52,366
- It's ready, your red dates tea.
- When I first joined the company, I didn't dare say a word.

501
00:27:52,366 --> 00:27:53,766
- Thanks.
- It was Sister Wang who covered for me.

502
00:27:53,766 --> 00:27:55,900
- Sir, your honey lemonade is ready.
- Thanks.

503
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,499
- Brown-sugar fresh milk with pearls.
- Thanks.

504
00:27:57,499 --> 00:27:59,766
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

505
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,033
Let's go.

506
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:13,633
Sister Wang, do you like it too?

507
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:16,766
That's great! From now on, we can talk about it together!

508
00:28:16,766 --> 00:28:20,365
Let me tell you, I'm a senior in this area. I already have twenty years of experience.

509
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,500
That's amazing.

510
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,165
What's your type?

511
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,999
I like the domineering boss type.

512
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:33,633
Wait a second!

513
00:28:33,633 --> 00:28:35,566
Thank you.

514
00:28:35,566 --> 00:28:37,400
Manager Hsiao.

515
00:28:39,633 --> 00:28:40,832
- Sister Wang.
- Yes?

516
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,399
You and the newcomer, Liu Mei Fang, seem close

517
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:44,799
like you have lots to discuss.

518
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,600
We're okay.

519
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,833
Don't you two have the same hobby?

520
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:53,665
I already heard that you're a senior,

521
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,533
over twenty years.

522
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,333
Are you the same, Manager Hsiao?

523
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,199
I am!

524
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,732
There aren't many men who like this, but you actually...

525
00:29:07,732 --> 00:29:10,699
Is that so? I'm different from other men.

526
00:29:10,699 --> 00:29:13,900
Can I join you guys then?

527
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,466
You're very welcome to join!

528
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:19,499
Thank you.

529
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:31,966
So what group did you join?

530
00:29:31,966 --> 00:29:33,065
B.L.

531
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:34,666
What?

532
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,200
B.L.

533
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,999
What's that?

534
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:44,065
It's probably some English acronym.

535
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:47,065
I didn't want to ask too much or else it would seem like I don't know anything.

536
00:29:47,065 --> 00:29:51,165
Isn't your English really good? Help me translate "B.L."

537
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,165
B.L.

538
00:29:54,165 --> 00:29:58,265
It should be an abbreviation for some English words.

539
00:29:59,766 --> 00:30:01,433
"Base Line."

540
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,666
"Biological Lab."

541
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,620
"Body Language."

542
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,632
I think it's "Bannan Line" (Taipei's blue metro).

543
00:30:10,632 --> 00:30:12,666
"Bannan Line."

544
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:16,665
Or is it a term in commerce like "Bill of Lading"?

545
00:30:16,665 --> 00:30:17,965
It's not that serious.

546
00:30:17,965 --> 00:30:22,366
Sister Wang doesn't seem the type of person interested in that stuff.

547
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:24,432
Could it be about bust measurement?

548
00:30:24,432 --> 00:30:26,199
"Bust Line."

549
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,165
That's possible!

550
00:30:29,165 --> 00:30:31,899
Women all care about their chest size.

551
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:36,832
But Sister Wang said not many guys like this thing.

552
00:30:36,832 --> 00:30:39,065
How could a guy not like a girl's chest size?

553
00:30:39,065 --> 00:30:41,166
She even said that she's a senior.

554
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:42,866
I will search for it online.

555
00:30:42,866 --> 00:30:44,465
I still think it's "Bannan Line."

556
00:30:44,465 --> 00:30:46,365
Sister Wang and Mei Fang are likely metro rail fans.

557
00:30:46,365 --> 00:30:47,898
Who did you say is a rail fan?

558
00:30:47,898 --> 00:30:49,466
Liu Mei Fang.

559
00:30:49,466 --> 00:30:51,466
Xiao Yeh, let me tell you.

560
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:54,332
Recently, I was secretly observing Liu Mei Fang.

561
00:30:54,332 --> 00:30:56,865
I thought if I understand her better, I can make her mine.

562
00:30:56,865 --> 00:30:59,733
As a result, Sister Wang told me that she likes B.L.

563
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:02,832
B.L.? Is she a fujoshi?

564
00:31:02,832 --> 00:31:06,965
Fujoshi what? A rail fan.

565
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,166
Do you know what B.L. is?

566
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:11,165
B.L. isn't "Bannan Line."

567
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:14,300
B.L. is an abbreviation for "Boys' Love."

568
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,900
- "Boys' love"?
- "Boys' love"?

569
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:36,765
As long as there's love, B.L. will always be there.

570
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:44,266
"Wishful thinking from the heart gives greater spiritual satisfaction."

571
00:31:44,266 --> 00:31:47,300
"Friendship between men is adultery."

572
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,165
"B.L. is true love."

573
00:31:49,165 --> 00:31:51,232
"It's not for continuing the family line by bearing children."

574
00:31:51,232 --> 00:31:53,166
Stop reading.

575
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:55,698
"If two partners are in love for a long time,"

576
00:31:55,699 --> 00:31:58,699
"especially during attacking (inserting) and receiving..."

577
00:31:59,566 --> 00:32:01,766
What's attacking and receiving?

578
00:32:01,766 --> 00:32:03,966
Be quiet.

579
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:10,265
Being quiet isn't the problem. You just shouldn't bother with it.

580
00:32:10,265 --> 00:32:12,665
You actually don't have to understand the world of B.L.

581
00:32:12,665 --> 00:32:15,900
You can still find common topics between you two.

582
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,065
Sister Wang emphasized that Mei Fang really likes B.L.

583
00:32:19,065 --> 00:32:21,032
Also, she's been a fujoshi (female fan of B.L.) for ten years.

584
00:32:21,032 --> 00:32:24,132
So if I talk to her about B.L., I can immediately get close to her.

585
00:32:24,132 --> 00:32:26,265
But you've been cramming all night now,

586
00:32:26,265 --> 00:32:29,933
do you understand? Do you understand what B.L. is?

587
00:32:29,933 --> 00:32:31,765
No matter how I think about it, I just don't understand.

588
00:32:31,765 --> 00:32:35,332
Why would a girl like to watch a guy liking another guy?

589
00:32:36,533 --> 00:32:39,666
This is indeed a broad, profound world.

590
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,766
So as long as I can figure it out,

591
00:32:42,766 --> 00:32:47,299
Mei Fang will think that I'm very diligent and instantly lower her guard.

592
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:51,732
Listen, it'll be very hard for us to understand all this within a short time.

593
00:32:51,732 --> 00:32:53,365
If you talk to her with only surface knowledge,

594
00:32:53,365 --> 00:32:57,230
you'll likely say the wrong thing and expose yourself.

595
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,532
Add your dark history with her and more than likely, Mei Fang

596
00:33:00,532 --> 00:33:04,065
will misunderstand it as you messing with her or even mocking her.

597
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:07,166
Then what should I do?

598
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:09,366
First, don't be so impatient right now.

599
00:33:09,366 --> 00:33:12,165
You need to slowly warm up to her, like a friend.

600
00:33:12,165 --> 00:33:14,465
Try to show her you aren't going to harm her,

601
00:33:14,465 --> 00:33:17,386
that you've grown beyond that past little rascal.

602
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:19,246
I think what Mu Ren said is good.

603
00:33:19,246 --> 00:33:22,166
Doing that is safer.

604
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,065
But she's so resistant towards me.

605
00:33:25,065 --> 00:33:28,065
"As distance tests a horse's strength, time reveals a person's heart."

606
00:33:28,065 --> 00:33:32,632
You shouldn't rush at the moment. The days to come are still long.

607
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,133
Li Cheng, don't worry.

608
00:33:36,133 --> 00:33:37,632
I'm in the same department as Mei Fang.

609
00:33:37,632 --> 00:33:41,133
As soon as there's an opportunity, I will put in a good word for you.

610
00:33:42,733 --> 00:33:44,733
Xiao Yeh,

611
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,200
thank you.

612
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,466
I love you the most.

613
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:53,233
Enough.

614
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:55,033
Hurry and eat.

615
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,533
Is he a fudanshi (male fan of B.L.)?

616
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:11,765
He told me himself that he's also very interested in B.L.

617
00:34:11,765 --> 00:34:14,165
Impossible. He lied to you. From him, I can't detect

618
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:16,065
any characteristic of a fudanshi.

619
00:34:16,065 --> 00:34:18,533
Honestly, I couldn't detect that either.

620
00:34:18,533 --> 00:34:20,932
But fudanshis are rare creatures.

621
00:34:20,932 --> 00:34:24,199
Maybe he's hidden it very deeply.

622
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,566
- Hide?
- Yes.

623
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:29,966
I think what he's hiding is not his identity as a fudanshi.

624
00:34:29,966 --> 00:34:32,666
He's hiding in the closet.

625
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:37,732
What makes you say that? Do you have evidence? O-Or...

626
00:34:37,732 --> 00:34:41,032
Haven't you noticed that he and Manager Teng seem like a couple?

627
00:34:41,032 --> 00:34:43,765
There's a dim glow from within.

628
00:34:43,765 --> 00:34:45,833
There are some feelings of attraction.

629
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,465
A couple? Are you mistaken?

630
00:34:48,465 --> 00:34:53,665
Those two and our Director Yeh are part of the iron triangle. They're bros.

631
00:34:53,665 --> 00:34:57,132
Also, I've seen Manager Hsiao's past girlfriend.

632
00:34:57,132 --> 00:34:59,432
She is quite beautiful.

633
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:03,000
That's why I say he's in the closet.

634
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,200
What?

635
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,932
How about we invite Director Yeh to eat lunch with us?

636
00:35:09,932 --> 00:35:13,033
We can ask about it indirectly.

637
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:21,800
Director, we have some things we would like to talk to you about.

638
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,600
Do you have time to eat lunch with us soon?

639
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,665
Sure.

640
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,832
I heard Li Cheng say that you really like to eat a chicken leg with rice.

641
00:35:27,832 --> 00:35:30,632
There's a nearby place that serves really good chicken legs with rice.

642
00:35:30,632 --> 00:35:32,299
Let's go there.

643
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:34,365
But that place is really busy around noon.

644
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:37,466
You usually have to wait in line for a long time.

645
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:41,232
It's almost time now. Let's go.

646
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,066
Director, are you okay?

647
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,399
It's nothing. I'm just a little dizzy.

648
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:54,265
Your face is slightly red. Do you have a fever?

649

[Simon (Yeh Hsing Ssu)]

650
00:37:06,066 --> 00:37:07,566
Very good.

651
00:37:07,566 --> 00:37:10,166
You didn't chat with your online friends lately.

652
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,333
I just went to see the doctor.

653
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,466
The doctor said it's just a cold.

654
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,400
He prescribed me some sleeping pills and told me to get more rest.

655
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:42,966
Dinner?

656
00:37:42,966 --> 00:37:47,566
For dinner... I want to eat something light.

657
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,146
Mu Ren is calling. Let's leave it at that.

658
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,300
Hello, Mu Ren?

659
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,800
I just got home.

660
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,400
Yes, it's Li Cheng.

661
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,533
Don't be angry. He's not bothering me.

662
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,200
All right. I will go rest right away.

663
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,100
Okay, bye bye.

664
00:38:27,233 --> 00:38:29,553
Didn't I close the door this morning?

665
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:35,666
I will kiss you when you're conscious.

666
00:40:51,899 --> 00:40:54,266
He said something light, but you didn't add anything to it.

667
00:40:54,266 --> 00:40:57,200
This isn't light. That is no flavor at all.

668
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,400
Do you smell something?

669
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,400
Yes.

670
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,100
Dinner.

671
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:15,500
Go and see if anything is missing.

672
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,500
I smell a stranger's scent.

673
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,500
Do you really?

674
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,633
Are you back?

675
00:41:23,633 --> 00:41:25,933
Xiao Yeh was home all afternoon. Ask him. He'll know for sure.

676
00:41:25,933 --> 00:41:27,333
What?

677
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:29,400
Teng Teng said that a stranger broke in.

678
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,633
When you came back at noon, did you notice anything missing?

679
00:41:31,633 --> 00:41:33,300
Did someone break in?

680
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,400
No. When I came home, it was just me.

681
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,433
Nothing was missing either.

682
00:41:37,433 --> 00:41:38,500
Did you hear that?

683
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,266
Don't make a fuss out of nothing.

684
00:41:40,266 --> 00:41:43,300
If someone really broke in, Xiao Yeh wouldn't sleep through the afternoon.

685
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,033
He wasn't robbed or sexually assaulted.

686
00:41:45,033 --> 00:41:51,100
But when I came through the door, I definitely smelled a scent that doesn't belong to either of us.

687
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,900
Really?

688
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,000
Can you smell all of our scents?

689
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,000
Then smell.

690
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,266
What do I smell like?

691
00:42:05,266 --> 00:42:06,367
Sour.

692
00:42:06,367 --> 00:42:09,100
How is that possible? I shower every day.

693
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,466
You must not have smelled properly. I'll give you another chance.

694
00:42:11,466 --> 00:42:13,033
Here! What do I smell like?

695

You weirdo. Go away!

- I don't want to smell you!

697
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,833
- Smell me!
- I don't want to!

698
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:22,000
Fine. If you don't smell, I will.

699
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:25,065
Smell my butt.

No.

You have that strange scent on you.

711

Do I?

712
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,900
I don't smell it.

713
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,800
Maybe I got it from touching something.

714
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,766
Don't overthink so much.

715
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:26,200
Sometimes you're too sensitive.

716
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,333
But I'm very curious.

717
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:36,200
Why were you willing to live with crazy and crude Li Cheng in the beginning?

718

My goal is to buy a house by the time I'm thirty.

719
00:43:40,665 --> 00:43:43,100
Sharing rent is the best way to save money.

720
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,766
Doesn't that mean I'll only be your housemate for one more year?

721
00:43:46,766 --> 00:43:51,400
Even if I bought a house, I'd still welcome you to be my housemate.

722

What about Li Cheng?

723
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,000
I'll probably put a doghouse on the balcony.

The flowers were obviously a gift from Manager Hsiao,

yet she still says she doesn't know whom they're from.

Don't talk nonsense.

I dislike girls the most who lie like this.

732

I agree. Manager Hsiao seems to really like her,

733
00:44:32,133 --> 00:44:34,566
yet she purposely puts on a show for him.

734

She must be so happy on the inside.

The work can be shared among us. We can finish it together.

740
00:44:54,632 --> 00:44:57,166
That's right. Don't just shoulder it all yourself. If worse comes to worst, we can work overtime together.

Yes, yes. That's right.

There's no need. How could we accept that?
