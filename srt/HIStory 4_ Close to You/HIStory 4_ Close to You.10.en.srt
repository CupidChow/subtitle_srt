This is Teng Teng's and my favorite: pasta with pesto and scallops.

16
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,666
You asked me out this late.

17
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,333
What's the important matter you want to talk about?

18
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,266
Of course, it is Manager Hsiao's matter.

19
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:28,200
I hope Vice President Kao can have mercy on him.

20
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,399
What you said isn't right.

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,699
Manager Hsiao's greed got him into trouble. How should I have mercy on him?

22
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:38,199
Yes, what I said was wrong.

23
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,166
I should have said that I hope Vice President Kao

24
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:43,866
can help Manager Hsiao get through this difficult time.

is that what you consider sincerity?

29
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:11,500
Of course, that's not all.

30
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:21,700
That's strange. How come he's not home yet?

31
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:40,132
Boss, I just received an important document.

32
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:41,999
I will send it to you.

33
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,366
He's so heavy.

34
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:53,233
That means he's completely unconscious.

35
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,700
How strong was that drink you gave him?

36
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,700
Probably around 50% alcohol content.

37
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,866
Could he possibly have alcohol poisoning?

38
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,200
Drunkenness is a kind of acute alcohol poisoning.

39
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Symptoms include redness of the cheeks, rapid heartbeat–

What are you going to do to him?

45
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:21,598
He's playing games with Li Cheng so I'll play games with him for revenge.

46
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:23,166
How?

47
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,433
He likes men.

48
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:27,266
I will call some girls who'll take good care of him.

49
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:31,266
Then I will film it and threaten him with it.

50
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:33,133
That's creative.

51
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:36,733
A threesome would be more intense.

52
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,166

What did you say?

63
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,865
I sent you the address. The room key is at the front desk.

Did you really get a room with him?

68
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:36,066
- No. You've misunderstood! I gave him–
- Shut up!

Anything you have to say, let's talk at home.

What do you want to say?

75
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:05,200
Did you get a room with him because of me?

76
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,000
- I didn't. I–
- Or was it not because of me?

77
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,433
It was for you. I–

Ever since that day you left, I've been thinking

about how to get you back on my side.

Should I lock you up?

101
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:54,566
Then you'd never smile at me again.

Don't make yourself sound so scary.

103

You aren't that type of person.

Okay.

Fu Yung Chieh, how long does it take to clean your room?

115
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:58,832
You are so slow. If it's not cleaned today, don't think about sleeping.

Come.

00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,733
- So did you find out who really took the money?
- Yes.

118
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:35,766
I talked to some former employees.

119
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:37,799
They all mentioned the same person.

120
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,732
But in the information I got from the Finance Department, there was no mention of that name.

121
00:12:42,732 --> 00:12:46,366
Did Vice President Kao hide it?

122
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,966
This person's relationship with him is complicated.

123
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:50,733
How so?

124
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:54,565
He's the person in the rumor that Mei Fang heard.

125
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,100
- Is he the sexually-harassed employee?
- Yes.

126
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,133
He asked for hush money.

127
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:01,866
So Vice President Kao stole money to give to him.

128
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:05,599
Are you sure? Is there proof?

129

I asked the client for more details.

133
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,799
I found there were accounts that should have been paid to the company,

134
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:25,700
but were paid to this account instead.

135
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,433
It's Vice President Kao's.

136

This finally proves your innocence.

137

It's nothing.

165
00:15:53,866 --> 00:15:55,766
What are you looking at?

166
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:59,233
Teng Teng! I'm so hungry.

167
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:00,700
Let's eat first, okay?

168
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,933
Something's suspicious. Or else, you wouldn't act like this.

169
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:04,765
Let me see!

170
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:07,632
All right! I'll confess!

171
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,266
I'm looking at gay pornography.
- What?

172
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,966
I'm scared of hurting you.

173
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,766
How about we practice?

174
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:24,099
You! Who wants to practice with you?

175
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,399
Relax. I'm gentle, very gentle.

176
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,666
Gentle, my butt.

177
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:35,334
Who's that hot guy? I've never seen him before.

178
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:39,599
Right. Since when does our school have such an attractive guy?

179
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,200
- Fu Yung Chieh.
- Let's go.

180
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,033
Why did you run?

181
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:45,666
I didn't want to keep you waiting.

182
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,266
Let's go.

183
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:51,165
They're holding hands!

184
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,665
True love is invincible.

185
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,866
He's so lucky.

186
00:16:57,499 --> 00:16:59,566
Thank you, everyone.
[Muse Weddings]

187
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:02,066
Thank you, everyone. Thanks.

188
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:03,665
- For you, Manager.
- Thanks.

189
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:06,766
Manager, I missed you!

190
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:08,700
Let go, let go.

191
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:13,265
Now I'm in a relationship. I can't just hug other guys.

192
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,665
Manager Hsiao, we all believed you'd never take money from the company.

193
00:17:17,665 --> 00:17:21,165
Wrong! Why wouldn't I take the company's money?

194
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:23,666
I work so hard for the company.

195
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,066
Of course, the company has to give me a salary and a bonus.

196
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:28,599
What a good joke.

197
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:30,633
Okay, okay. My return was certain.

198
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,233
Don't relax now, everyone.

199
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:33,900
Hurry and get a few big cases.

200
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,633
That's the right way to earn lots of money.

201
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,799
Fighting!

202
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:41,800
- Meeting.
- Work.

203
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,366
I will collect the clients first.

204
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:45,500
Seeing how popular your darling is,

205
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,033
do you feel honored?

206
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:52,899
Po Hsiang helped a lot. You should thank him.

207
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:55,066
I already planned it.

208
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,466
It's here.

209
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,533
This was designed by Mei Fang.

210
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:03,432
Xiao Yeh and the Design Department helped with the wedding decorations.

211
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:07,865
The Photography and Catering Departments are in the planning stages.

212
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,399
How much of a discount?

213
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:12,700
It's half off!

214
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,233
Did the company allow that?

215
00:18:14,233 --> 00:18:15,466
Of course not.

216
00:18:15,466 --> 00:18:17,466
The friends-and-family discount is only 20%.

217
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:19,933
The other 30% is from me.

218
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,133
Teng Teng, I'm so poor now.

219
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:25,433
You have to support me.

220
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:26,933
You can't abandon me.

221
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:29,000
How are you poor from paying just this bit of money?

222
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,033
Stop joking.

223
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:36,933
I'm not joking. I really am poor now.

224
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:40,999
Teng Teng, you have to support me. Please.

225
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:43,166
I rejected many clients before.

226
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,665
I ignored a lot of money.

227
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,733
But that's okay. As long as I have you, I'm happy.

228
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:56,432
Hsiao Yay, congratulations on clearing your name and making a great comeback!

229
00:18:59,266 --> 00:19:00,465
Thanks!

230
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:03,998
Teng Teng said you stood by me the whole time.

231
00:19:03,998 --> 00:19:06,100
You're indeed a childhood friend.

232
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,999
There's no need to thank me. Manager Teng is the one to thank.

233
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:12,299
Of course, he is. He's my darling.

234
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,466
Watching you both work to overcome difficulties

235
00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:17,466
made me feel so moved!

236
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:19,065
I'm moved as well.

237
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:22,200
So this love must go on forever!

238
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
It must be forever.

239
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,799
Vice President Kao's relationships are very messed up.

240
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,065
One moment he's sexually harassing male employees, and now he's having threesomes with girls.

241
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:35,966
Although I think it's strange,

242
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,298
why did the police arrive just when he was with a prostitute?

243
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:41,300
Isn't it too much of a coincidence?

244
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,433
Someone must have reported it to the police.

245
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,700
Who could it be?

246
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:49,166
Director, who do you think it could be?

247
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:53,866
It had to be a righteous man.

248
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:57,133
Hsing Ssu!

249
00:19:58,266 --> 00:20:00,700
Sister Wang, Mei Fang, I will be off.

250
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:03,366
Bye bye.

251
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:08,233
You're here.

252
00:20:09,766 --> 00:20:10,767
Let's go!

253
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:12,933
Did you see that?

254
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:14,800
They are touching each other's faces

255
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,733
and holding hands!

256
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:20,866
So Director is also…

257
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:24,866
We are so lucky!

258
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,466
Have you thought about what to cook?

259
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,066
Just relax and watch me.

260
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,599
I'd better buy stomach medication first.

261
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:39,266
Mom and Dad are both getting old.

262
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:40,400
Why be like this?

263
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,466
Don't you believe in me?

264
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:01,067
Dad, Mom, if you're hungry, eat some fruit first.

265
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:04,166
Dinner will be ready soon, just a little longer.

266
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:07,533
That's weird. Why is the beef so tough?

267
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,732
Dad, I think I should just go cook, or else this dinner will become a midnight snack.

268
00:21:12,732 --> 00:21:14,665
Mommy, let Yung Chieh do it.

269
00:21:14,665 --> 00:21:17,932
It's so rare that he's very filial and wants to cook for us.

270
00:21:17,932 --> 00:21:20,265
That's right, Mom. You normally work so hard.

271
00:21:20,265 --> 00:21:22,332
You can pretend to be the Empress Dowager today.

272
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:24,166
I will give you a massage.

273
00:21:28,566 --> 00:21:33,700
Daddy, with Hsing Ssu at home, we can be happy.

274
00:21:34,433 --> 00:21:36,699
Mom, where's the salt?

275
00:21:36,699 --> 00:21:38,798
Why put it where no one can find it?

276
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,299
Salt?

277
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,965
Okay, okay.

278
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:43,633
I will go.

279
00:21:47,866 --> 00:21:50,200
You have a good rest.

280
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,165
Move over. I'll do this.

281
00:21:56,165 --> 00:21:57,466
Here.

282
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,832
The skin needs cooking completely to smell good.

283
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,700
Ignore it for now.

284
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,166
Cut across the onion.

285
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,299
Do them like this.

286
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:10,833
There's already olive oil in there.

287
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,900
It smells good.

288
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,932
Daddy, did you make all this?

289
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:20,665
Dad is really good at cooking.

290
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:25,698
When I was in school, when Dad made me lunch, everyone fought over it.

291
00:22:25,698 --> 00:22:27,065
You should have said so earlier.

292
00:22:27,065 --> 00:22:29,798
Then we wouldn't have had to eat Mom's cooking every day.

293
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:31,265
How can you say that?

294
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:33,899
Didn't you write in your diary you'll learn to cook?

295
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:35,700
Then look at all this.

296
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,532
I will learn.

297
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:42,333
Just give me a little more time.

298
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,533
Thanks, Dad.

299
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,333
Thanks, Dad.

300
00:22:57,733 --> 00:22:59,666
Here.

301
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:03,566
Mom and I want to toast you both.

302
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:07,966
May you both be forever happy.

303
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:10,032
And a toast to our family,

304
00:23:10,032 --> 00:23:13,466
may we also be forever happy.

305
00:23:14,366 --> 00:23:16,766
Forever happy!

306
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:27,800
Dad... thank you.

307
00:23:47,766 --> 00:23:49,433
Come on.

308
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:50,866
Let's eat.

309
00:23:50,866 --> 00:23:53,633
Let's eat, let's eat!

310
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,766
Try some of this.

311
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,598
It's so good!

312
00:24:01,598 --> 00:24:04,798
This chicken leg, Yung Chieh helped with it.

313
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:06,900
Really?

314
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,433
Hurry.

315
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,766
- Is it good?
- It's really good.

316
00:24:12,766 --> 00:24:14,465
Of course. I made it.

317
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:16,400
It's good, right?

318
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:19,065
You dropped it.

319
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:20,766
That's okay.

320
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:24,932
This is for you.

321
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:28,100
It is a macaroon from a famous place in the East District.

322
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,399
It's all right. You can eat it.

323
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,466
I'm sorry.

324
00:24:38,533 --> 00:24:44,332
I shouldn't have spread those negative videos and photos of you.

325
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:48,099
Don't mention it. That's all in the past.

326
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:52,766
Thank you for forgiving me!

327
00:24:52,766 --> 00:24:55,167
It was because even though you were new,

328
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:59,032
you got along so well with Sister Wang, Manager Hsiao, and Manager Teng.

329
00:24:59,032 --> 00:25:02,032
I was jealous so I...

330
00:25:02,032 --> 00:25:04,765
I knew Manager Hsiao when we were little!

331
00:25:04,765 --> 00:25:10,065
And with Sister Wang, it's because we have similar interests.

332
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:12,532
What similar interests?

333
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:17,666
Though I've been here a long time, I've never seen her have so much to talk about.

334
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:20,133
- Do you really want to know?
- Yes.

335
00:25:20,133 --> 00:25:21,798
Will you promise not to tell?

336
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:24,833
I swear on my Girl Scout's honor.

337
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:26,899
Then do you know "BL"?

338
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:27,701
I do.

339
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:29,665
Do you like Manager Hsiao and Manager Teng being together?

340
00:25:29,665 --> 00:25:30,566
I do.

341
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:32,966
Okay, and basically…

342
00:25:36,366 --> 00:25:40,899
This time, Sales Teams 1 and 2 co-planned the wedding.

343
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:42,499
I'm really looking forward to it.

344
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,332
This gay wedding is very important to the company.

345
00:25:45,332 --> 00:25:49,467
After all, societies nowadays are pluralistic so this is our future customer-base.

346
00:25:49,467 --> 00:25:53,433
Teng Teng, do you want a romantic wedding?

347
00:25:53,433 --> 00:25:55,866
I will immediately apply for it with the company.

348
00:25:56,566 --> 00:25:58,866
Who was it who said he was poor?

349
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:02,232
Don't I still have you?

350
00:26:02,232 --> 00:26:04,499
I'll provide effort. You provide money.

351
00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:08,333
We will have the wedding of the century.

352
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,798
We are talking about Po Hsiang's and Chi Gang's wedding right now.

353
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:12,966
Why are you talking about us?

354
00:26:16,633 --> 00:26:18,233
Xiao Yeh.

355
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,066
Sorry, I was replying to a client.

356
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:36,399
A client?

357
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:38,932
When did Little Devil become a client?

358
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:43,800
It looks like Xiao Yeh and Yung Chieh will become our company's second gay marriage.

359
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,232
What are you guys talking about?

360
00:26:46,232 --> 00:26:47,565
Yung Chieh is still young.

361
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:50,632
Even if it happens, we would have to wait until he graduates.

362
00:26:50,632 --> 00:26:51,765
Then we will wait!

363
00:26:51,765 --> 00:26:54,366
Can you wait? What about you?

364
00:26:54,366 --> 00:26:59,566
Of course. If it's for you, we will even do the wedding for free.

365
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,132
Okay, let's stop messing around.

366
00:27:03,132 --> 00:27:05,333
Here are some venue plans from Design Department.

367
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:09,432
Take a look and see if you have any ideas.

368
00:27:10,433 --> 00:27:13,000
The Design Team is so good.

369
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,101
There are some outdoor and some indoor ideas. Which do you guys like?

370
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:20,233
Teng Teng, which one do you think Po Hsiang and Chi Gang would like?

371
00:27:24,966 --> 00:27:29,365
During the rehearsal, hearing Po Hsiang's vows

372
00:27:29,365 --> 00:27:32,699
about being together for life and never separating

373
00:27:32,699 --> 00:27:34,799
was really moving.

374
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,432
I thought so, too.

375
00:27:36,432 --> 00:27:41,365
I also want to be with you for life, never separating.

376
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:49,032
Before, I thought I didn't believe in commitments.

377
00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:50,732
I was unwilling to make commitments to others.

378
00:27:50,732 --> 00:27:53,365
That was because you hadn't met anyone

379
00:27:53,365 --> 00:27:55,266
who could make your heart flutter.

380
00:28:03,866 --> 00:28:06,333
I feel so happy.

381
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,566
I will make you even happier.

382
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,160
- If you want to kiss, go home and kiss!
- Hey!

383
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,166
Don't run if you have balls (courage)!

384
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:24,866
Rude!

385
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,898
Teng Teng,

386
00:28:32,899 --> 00:28:34,766
don't mind her.

387
00:28:34,766 --> 00:28:36,432
We aren't in anyone's way.

388
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:38,666
Our own happiness is most important.

389
00:28:40,466 --> 00:28:41,565
Let's go.

390
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:43,065
There's a surprise at home.

391
00:28:43,065 --> 00:28:44,598
What surprise?

392
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,733
You'll see when we get home.

393
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,960
That's right.

394
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,670
The preparations for tomorrow are almost done.

395
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,810
Okay.

396
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:04,633
The table flowers and bouquets will come directly from the florist.

397
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:08,466
Don't forget the drapery and tulle.

398
00:29:08,466 --> 00:29:09,899
Okay. Okay.

399
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:11,566
That's it for now.

400
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,510
Did I wake you?

401
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,700
I wasn't asleep.

402
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,000
Why are you here?

403
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,333
To deliver you a late night snack.

404
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:49,100
I see how you're busy working overtime every day.

405
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,270
If I weren't working overtime,

406
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,086
how would you get the chance to leave the house?

How was it?

442
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:48,820
Wasn't it charming?

443
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,900
Did you feel "electrified" by me?

444
00:36:55,266 --> 00:36:58,220
You probably secretly practiced for a long time, right?

445
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:02,633
For you, however long it takes is worth it.

446
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:10,300
This is what I wrote for you.

447
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,233
One of a kind...

448
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,540
We can't.

449
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,933
We have to attend the wedding tomorrow.

450
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:37,700
Why does that matter?

451
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,566
My bed set!

452
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:46,465
It's in my room!

453
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:49,466
Teng Teng, don't you think we should sleep together?

454
00:37:49,466 --> 00:37:51,032
How do we sleep in such a small bed?

455
00:37:51,032 --> 00:37:52,299
What does that matter?

456
00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:55,900
We can squeeze together or lie on top of each other!

457
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,900
Oh!

458
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:03,000
Teng Teng, why did you lock the door? Open the door!

459
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,632
Sleep in my room tonight!

460
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:05,966
Stop joking around!

461
00:38:05,966 --> 00:38:08,100
All your bed sheets are in my room.

462
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,000
It's freezing. I'll catch a cold with no blankets!

463
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,200
Cooling you off is a good thing. Put the flame out!

464
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,999
Who ignites a fire then ignores it?

465
00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:16,565
Open the door!

466
00:38:16,565 --> 00:38:19,400
If I open the door, the fire won't go out.

467
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,600
Okay, it's gone, gone. The fire's gone.

468
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,900
It's gone.

469
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,900
You should still sleep in my room. If you get cold, you can wear a few of my thick coats.

470
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,833
Good night!

471
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:29,232
Don't say good night.

472
00:38:29,232 --> 00:38:30,899
Without you, how can I sleep?

473
00:38:30,899 --> 00:38:33,765
- Teng Teng.
- Hug this and sleep!

474
00:38:33,765 --> 00:38:35,266
Hey!

475
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:11,100
I, Sun Po Hsiang,

476
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:15,632
am willing to give my love, my heart,

477
00:39:15,632 --> 00:39:21,932
my everything to you, Chi Gang.

478
00:39:21,932 --> 00:39:24,666
In love, we will grow together.

479
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:30,200
From today onward, I will be happy with you when you are happy.

480
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,133
When you're sad,

481
00:39:33,133 --> 00:39:35,466
I will share your sorrow.

482
00:39:37,766 --> 00:39:41,500
Thanks to that day when I met you,

483
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,133
we will never separate in this life.

484
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,566
I love you.

485
00:39:48,966 --> 00:39:53,300
I still remember the first time we met at the gym.

486
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:57,465
Every move you made attracted me.

487
00:39:57,465 --> 00:40:00,400
It was a chance meeting.

488
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,265
Pretending to be calm,

489
00:40:02,265 --> 00:40:05,700
I was only able to act cool and give you a smile.

490
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:13,233
However, in that moment, we both knew that you and I

491
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:16,299
have become us.

492
00:40:16,933 --> 00:40:20,600
Thank you for having the courage to confess your love to me back then.

493
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:25,433
Although I pushed you away again and again,

494
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:28,265
you always persisted

495
00:40:28,265 --> 00:40:30,866
and pulled me into your world.

496
00:40:32,866 --> 00:40:37,933
Thank you for teaching me how to be happy again.

497
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:42,333
Thank you for teaching me how to be brave and accept myself.

498
00:40:42,933 --> 00:40:47,433
Thank you for teaching me how to embrace love again.

499
00:40:49,133 --> 00:40:51,032
You are the one.

500
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,700
Let's build a home together.

501
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,399
I love you.

502
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:58,200
The two of you may now exchange rings.

503
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:04,999
I hereby solemnly announce that

504
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:08,432
Mr. Sun Po Hsiang and Mr. Lu Chi Gang

505
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:12,133
are officially married as husband and husband.

506
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:23,400
The present guests witnessed with me

507
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,500
that these two promised to help and support each other in the days ahead

508
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,966
as they grow old together.

509
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:52,480
♫ You're the only person I want to know ♫

510
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:58,520
♫ I want to loudly say those affectionate words to you ♫

511
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:04,580
♫ Will you let me gently kiss you? ♫

512
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,700
♫ It's all so sweet and beautiful ♫

513
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,833
Even though I haven't known them long, I'm very happy for them.

514
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:14,900
This kind of love is really moving.

515
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:23,232
This is also the happiest part of our work.

516
00:42:23,232 --> 00:42:27,400
We witness all kinds of love blossoming and bearing fruit.

517
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:51,066
I will give you the most beautiful wedding ever.

518
00:42:51,066 --> 00:42:53,666
Do you believe in those vows?

519
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:55,300
I don't.

520
00:42:56,566 --> 00:42:59,333
Whether it's love or marriage,

521
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:02,533
the meaning of existence is not in itself,

522
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:05,100
but in the people who make it.

523
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:09,000
I don't believe in love, nor do I believe in marriage.

524
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,200
But because it's you, I am willing to believe in everything.

525
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:22,540
♫ I want to loudly say those affectionate words to you ♫

526
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:28,570
♫ Will you let me gently kiss you? ♫

527
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:33,910
♫ It's all so sweet and beautiful ♫

528
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:37,030
♫ Baby ♫

529
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:43,550
♫ Baby ♫

530
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,232
Thank you, everyone, for coming today.

531
00:43:48,232 --> 00:43:49,699
It can still pass.

532
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:50,865
Only progress...

533
00:43:50,865 --> 00:43:52,599
That's right.

534
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:54,565
Thank you for planning today's wedding.

535
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,799
This is called "The Turn of the Wind and Water."

536
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,999
Exercise.

537
00:43:57,999 --> 00:43:59,465
Okay, let's not talk now. I'll go in first.

538
00:43:59,465 --> 00:44:00,865
Cheers.

539
00:44:00,865 --> 00:44:03,065
The menu is unlimited. Eat to your desire.

540
00:44:03,065 --> 00:44:04,565
Okay.

541
00:44:04,565 --> 00:44:06,199
Eat as much as you can.

542
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:07,100
You're too biased.

543
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,466
Thanks.

544
00:44:08,466 --> 00:44:10,833
- It's been so long!
- Congratulations!

545
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:12,399
I never expected this day to arrive.

546
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,266
I know! Thanks for coming.

547
00:44:13,266 --> 00:44:15,501
- I want to get married too.
- Are you sure?

548
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:17,399
Old Sun!

549
00:44:17,399 --> 00:44:19,399
Congratulations.

550
00:44:19,399 --> 00:44:20,765
"Where there's a will, there's a way."

551
00:44:20,765 --> 00:44:22,565
"Persevere until the end and never give up."

552
00:44:22,565 --> 00:44:24,065
I never gave up, okay?

553
00:44:24,065 --> 00:44:25,832
Brother Chi Gang, I really have to say

554
00:44:25,832 --> 00:44:28,399
you made the right decision.

555
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:29,799
- The right decision?
- Nonsense.

556
00:44:29,799 --> 00:44:32,199
Of course, it's the right decision

557
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:35,800
because he's the one I love most.

558
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:39,032
Thanks for coming here so early.

559
00:44:39,032 --> 00:44:41,566
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

560
00:44:41,566 --> 00:44:43,134
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Brother.

561
00:44:43,134 --> 00:44:44,766
Thank you.

562
00:44:48,466 --> 00:44:51,466
It's too bad Ah Hao is abroad and couldn't make it.

563
00:44:51,466 --> 00:44:54,367
That's fine. Let's take extra photos and send them to him.

564
00:44:54,367 --> 00:44:56,567
- Okay, for sure.
- Send those photos from just now too.

565
00:44:56,567 --> 00:44:58,599
Let's take more and make him die of envy.

566
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:00,100
- Let's go.
- It's like in high school!

567
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,066
Let's go.

568
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:02,667
- Hurry up, Old People.
- Stand in the middle.

569
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:04,290
That's good. There.

570
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:06,199
- Here.
- Get ready.

571
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:07,399
There has to be a theme.

572
00:45:07,399 --> 00:45:09,500
The first picture can be a bit sweet.

573
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,900
You guys have to be sweeter.

574
00:45:14,866 --> 00:45:17,800
Okay. The three of us want to seriously say this. Brother.

575
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,566
- Brother.
- Brother.

576
00:45:20,566 --> 00:45:22,090
Brother.

577
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:23,865
Brother.

578
00:45:23,865 --> 00:45:27,100
May you soon have a baby!

579
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,333
Sure.

580
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:37,900
The first time you see your own plan brought to fruition feels great.

581
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,532
Especially since it's Po Hsiang's and Brother Chi Gang's wedding.

582
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:43,133
I'm really happy!

583
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,899
- Senior.
- Hey.

584
00:45:45,899 --> 00:45:47,667
- Thanks.
- It's nothing.

585
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:49,365
Your happiness is most important.

586
00:45:49,365 --> 00:45:50,865
Thanks.

587
00:45:50,865 --> 00:45:52,065
Happy new marriage!

588
00:45:52,065 --> 00:45:54,866
A toast to everyone's happiness!

589
00:45:54,866 --> 00:45:57,800
To shared happiness!

590
00:46:01,233 --> 00:46:03,201
- Everyone, come here!
- It's picture time.

591
00:46:03,201 --> 00:46:05,833
Come on. Everyone will be in the picture!

592
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:07,665
A bit lower... on the side... down a bit...

593
00:46:07,665 --> 00:46:09,620
One, two, three.

594
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:12,700
Yes, hooray!

595
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,432
Did you take it? Are you done?

596
00:46:14,432 --> 00:46:15,665
- Okay.
- Okay. It's fine.

597
00:46:15,665 --> 00:46:17,465
This is my high school classmate.
- Teng Teng, let's go.

598
00:46:17,465 --> 00:46:18,599
Hello.

599
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:21,365
This is who helped us prepare for the wedding.

600
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:23,166
What is it?

601
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:25,266
I want to take you somewhere.

602
00:46:25,266 --> 00:46:26,598
Where?

603
00:46:26,598 --> 00:46:27,932
Our future.

604
00:46:27,932 --> 00:46:29,333
Let's go.

605
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:32,132
Where are we going?

606
00:46:32,132 --> 00:46:33,400
It's a secret.

607
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,366
Secret? Why not say it now?

608
00:46:35,366 --> 00:46:38,566
I told you it's a secret, Silly.

609
00:46:38,566 --> 00:46:41,266
- If you can catch me, I'll tell you.
- Hey!

610
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,833
I...

611
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,070
Charge toward our future!

612
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,520

♫ Later on, I laugh as I'm filled with emotions and thoughts ♫

621
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:47,910
♫ I'm content to finally understand for once ♫

622
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:51,350
♫ Even breathing is torturous ♫

623
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:54,740
♫ Lost within my heart ♫

624
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:57,650
♫ I've looked for all the exits ♫

625
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:01,650
♫ Yet I didn't find a reason to give up ♫

626
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:05,010
♫ All the fantasies have been broken ♫

627
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:10,550
♫ The memories will no longer flow ♫

628
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:21,030
♫ Turns out that the wounds you can't see are the most painful ♫

629
00:48:25,233 --> 00:48:29,199
Transport is convenient and living facilities are good here.

630
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:31,865
Is this our future?

631
00:48:31,865 --> 00:48:35,166
Yes. Come here.

632
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:37,832
Didn't you want to buy a house before turning thirty?

633
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:40,666
So this place,

634
00:48:41,866 --> 00:48:43,665
I bought it.

635
00:48:43,665 --> 00:48:45,265
Look at this floor plan.

636
00:48:45,265 --> 00:48:46,866
Isn't it beautiful?

637
00:48:48,033 --> 00:48:49,866
Do you like it?

638
00:48:49,866 --> 00:48:51,433
I like it.

639
00:48:53,799 --> 00:48:56,899
Thank goodness, you like it! I was so nervous.

640
00:48:56,899 --> 00:49:00,465
Didn't I tell you, I became poor?

641
00:49:00,465 --> 00:49:01,798
It wasn't a joke.

642
00:49:01,798 --> 00:49:04,090
Look at the view here.

643
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:07,999
All my savings, I spent them all on this place.

644
00:49:07,999 --> 00:49:10,533
Did you spend all your savings?

645
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:12,532
May I ask how much the loan is?

646
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:13,832
Don't worry. I calculated it.

647
00:49:13,832 --> 00:49:15,565
We can definitely afford it!

648
00:49:15,565 --> 00:49:17,766
How much is it?

649
00:49:19,566 --> 00:49:22,200
How much? Hurry and say it.

650
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:26,665
- NT$25 million. ($890,000 U.S.)
- NT$25 million!

651
00:49:26,665 --> 00:49:30,500
It's a thirty-year mortgage so we just need around NT$100,000 ($3,500 U.S.) monthly.

652
00:49:31,566 --> 00:49:33,733
I will give you two choices.

653
00:49:33,733 --> 00:49:38,200
Return the house, or I'm breaking up with you.

654
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,000
Breaking up? Why?

655
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,899
Teng Teng, don't be so rash.

656
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:46,199
Don't just carelessly talk about breaking up.

657
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:48,399
Carrying a NT$25 million mortgage for thirty years...

658
00:49:48,399 --> 00:49:52,733
Hsiao Li Cheng, is your brain flooded or empty?

659
00:49:52,733 --> 00:49:55,598
Teng Teng, don't be angry.

660
00:49:55,598 --> 00:49:57,999
We can earn more money in the future!

661
00:49:57,999 --> 00:49:59,133
I don't want to.

662
00:49:59,133 --> 00:50:03,400
I don't want to be in so much debt. Our quality of life will decrease.

663
00:50:04,799 --> 00:50:06,165
It won't.

664
00:50:06,165 --> 00:50:07,666
Teng Teng.

665
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:10,633
You still have me!

666
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:12,100
Go away.

667
00:50:12,866 --> 00:50:14,899
This is the fruit of our love.

668
00:50:14,899 --> 00:50:16,700
That's enough.

669
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,700
Stop being angry.

670
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:22,133
Give me a smile.

671
00:50:28,533 --> 00:50:30,333
Okay.

672
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:32,100
Thank you.

673
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:35,333
Let's work hard together.

674
00:50:40,466 --> 00:50:42,899
I have been struck by Cupid's arrow.

675
00:50:42,899 --> 00:50:45,033
Let's buy another place!
