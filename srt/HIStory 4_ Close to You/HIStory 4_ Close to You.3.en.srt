160
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,209
Let's chat in your room. Come on.

161
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,390
Mommy.

162
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,560
Turning twenty is an important milestone. Don't always be so strict with him.

163
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,970
He likes his brother and wants to go out alone with his brother

164
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,160
so just let them go.

165
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,960
Daddy, you really underestimate him.

166
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,920
The only thing I can say is that you're too kind.

167
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,779
All right, all right. I'll talk to him. You eat first.

168
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:57,640
Don't be too mean.

169
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,110
What are you trying to do this time?

170
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,610
I want him.

171
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,560
Are you crazy?

172
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,060
He likes living together with family,

173
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,150
yet he moved out himself.

174
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,480
Do you know why?

175
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,780
Do you know as well?

176
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,570
I knew since middle school.

177
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,830
I saw him and his college classmate kiss.

178
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,560
- Then does he know that you—
- He doesn't know.

179
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,480
He thinks that he hides it very well.

180
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,900
He has no idea

181
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,710
that Dad is the only one in the family who doesn't know that he's gay.

182
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,240
Even if he likes men, you can't force him into anything.

183
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,870
No one can shield him from dad's opposition like me.

184
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,710
I'm confident, and Dad trusts me a lot. I believe that if I ask Dad to entrust his son to me,

185
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,600
it would be easier for Dad to accept.

186
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,890
Did you pretend to be good for so many years just to earn Daddy's trust?

187
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,000
Also, choosing to go into medicine,

188
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,070
I made myself more valuable.

189
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,380
I've also made investments.

190

[Investment Transactions]

191
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,950
Do you really have this much money? Did you actually start investing that early?

192
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,240
Have you truly been planning this for that long?

193
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,480
Don't be so quick to oppose this.

194
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,380
Think carefully about what I said.

195
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,400
With his gentle personality and his desire to not upset Dad,

196
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,730
he will definitely never reveal it for the rest of his life.

197
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,170
But there's no way he would find a girl to marry.

198
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,730
Then his ending would be to grow old all alone.

199
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,380
For his happiness, I am the best choice.

200
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,880
Will he be willing?

201
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,880
He will,

202
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,720
because I feel that

203
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,650
he likes me.

204
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,970
I say you're just full of yourself.

205
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,969
Then how do you plan to shield him from Daddy's anger?

206
00:13:11,969 --> 00:13:15,390
That's easy. I'll just lure the anger to myself.

207
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,820
How will you do that?

208
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,320
Forget about joining us on the two-day, one-night trip.

209
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,660
You will find out eventually.

210
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,930
It has now been confirmed that the wedding for the bank chairman's daughter
[MUSE Weddings]

211
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,510
will be entirely handled by us.
[Proposal to Customize for Clients]

212
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,800
For this month, sales team 2 has already reached its performance goal.

213
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,870
Manager Teng's sales performance has never fallen short of the target.

214
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,540
Of course.

215
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,760
A man has to be true to his word.

216
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,339
Since sales team 2 does so well, sales team 1 can't keep politely conceding every time.

217
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:49,230
It's time to demonstrate our manly spirit.

218
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,629
We will not only reach our sales performance goal this month,

219
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:53,850
but also exceed it by 10%.

220
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,710
Since sales team 1 is becoming serious, then sales team 2 can't be lazy, too.

221
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,160
We will increase the target by another 10%.

222
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,040
It appears it's time to bring out the best we have.

223
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,299
Currently, we still have many contracts for overseas weddings

224
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:08,510
that we're negotiating. If successful, it guarantees sales performance 20% above target for six consecutive months.

225
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,680
Manager Hsiao, do you think you're bargaining at a fish market right now?

226
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,780
If Manager Teng thinks it's too stressful, then he doesn't have to follow along.

227
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,659
Partners of sales team 1, today is my treat.

228
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:27,270
Everyone, let's go eat something good. We'll have strength to fight if we're full.

229
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,080
Manager, are you really being that generous?

230
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,740
In order to win, of course, I have to be generous.

231
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,250
You're right. Not only should one eat until full, but also eat well.

232
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,920
I'll treat you guys to Japanese food.

It can nourish vitality and restore energy.

- Thank you, Manager.
- Thank you, Manager Teng.

236
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,810
The fight today between Manager Hsiao and Manager Teng is fierce.

237
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,510
Could it be a lovers' quarrel?

238
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,790
A lovers' quarrel?

239
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,270
Wait. Did you just say "lover"?

240
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,500
Sorry, it was a joke.

241
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,970
Because there's a company rumor circulating that those two have been flirting with each other.

242
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,660
There are even photos to prove it.

243
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,900
Let's see them. Let's see them.

244
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,609
This looks like they are together, right?

245
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:08,050
For sure.

246
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,051
I'm telling you, this time it's a kiss. Next time there won't even be clothes.

247
00:15:11,051 --> 00:15:12,780
Really.

Hello, what kind of service would you like?

249
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,320
I booked a room. Thanks.

250
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,150
Okay, may I ask, what type of room would you like?

251
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,330
Is there a room with one big bed?

252
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,950
Wh-Why do you want one big bed?

253
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,510
Didn't you say you wanted to sleep with me last time?

254
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,050
That's not it. Last time you slept on the floor so I worried you'd catch a cold.

255
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,443
- This time—
- It's my birthday.

256
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,460
I want to sleep with you.

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,000
Same for me.

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,880
Don't you like the ocean a lot?

262
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,540
Yes, but I don't like coming alone.

263

You can come with your classmates or your friends.

I don't want to.

- Sunscreen.

With this weather, there's no need, right?

271
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:02,500
You still have to put it on. There's still UV radiation.

272
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,679
Come on. I will help you apply it.

273
00:17:07,321 --> 00:17:09,050
Give me some. I can apply it on my front myself.

[Walk-In]

317
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,720
Even when I'm heading out, he stares at me,

318
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,540
as though I did something to offend him.

319
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,799
Wasn't it progressing well?

320
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,240
How did it become like this?

321
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,180
Is it not because...

322
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,701
No.

323
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:01,150
If I say that we're fighting because we both want to be the top,

324
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,710
then wouldn't I expose us?

325
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,720
Mei Fang still thinks I'm pursuing Teng Teng.

326
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,340
Anyway, it's a fight, but I don't know what he is unhappy about.

327
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,910
He's like an explosive barrel. He can't stand the sight of anything.

328
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,640
He's even picking a fight with me, wanting to compete in sales performance.

329
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,070
I heard about that. Everyone at the company is even betting on

330
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,710
whether sale team 1 or 2 will win.

331
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,270
Could Manager Teng be angry

332
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,810
because of the rumors going around the company?

333
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,720
- Are there rumors?
- Yes.

334
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,136
Then that is a possibility.

335
00:22:28,136 --> 00:22:30,680
He is the type of person who cares a lot about what others think of him.

336
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,900
Let me tell you, every morning he takes the longest time in the bathroom.

337
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,300
He has to make his face perfectly clean. Not a single strand of facial hair is acceptable.

338
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,230
He also has a bunch of shoes, but he won't let anyone touch them.

339
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,110
But our shoe closet is so small that I just gave up my space to him.

340
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,521
When we went to rent the place, I also let him choose the room first.

341
00:22:46,521 --> 00:22:49,319
When we go to the market for beer, we buy the brand he likes.

342
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:52,170
The shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom are also the grapefruit scent that he likes.

343
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,860
And his toothpaste has to be mint-flavored.

344
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,960
He looks skinny,

345
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,499
but he loves to eat and try new things.

346
00:22:57,499 --> 00:22:58,990
However, he fears buying something not tasty.

347
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,850
So I always say, "Buy whatever."

348
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:05,041
If it's not good, I'll end up eating it anyway. It's a rough life.

349
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:07,481
So much love.

350
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:10,721
You treat him really well. You take really good care of him.

351
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,011
Is that so?

352
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:15,059
Of course.

353
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:19,820
What normal guy would suffer for another guy? This is true love.

354
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,589
The rumor got out because of me.

355
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:24,559
When I went to the restroom, I left my phone in there.

356
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,900
A colleague brought it back to me.

357
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,596
The pictures you sent me were on that phone.

358
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,079
That's not your fault.

359
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:36,080
The people who secretly looked through your phone are at fault.

360
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,950
Then is Manager Teng angry because he saw those pictures?

361
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,870
He probably never saw them, right?

362
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,230
No, go apologize.

363
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,019
Apologize?

364
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:49,051
I've never apologized to a guy before. I don't know how.

365
00:23:49,051 --> 00:23:51,419
I will help you find a way to atone for your sins.

366
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:55,720
I also heard that Vice President Kao would sexually harass male employees.

367
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,340
Manager Teng is so good-looking, and with the rumors spreading recently,

368
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,840
Vice President Kao will surely sexually harass him.

369
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,200
You must protect him well.

370
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,930
Did you get enough to eat?

371
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:27,570
Yes, I'm really full now, and it was delicious.

372
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,670
Thanks.

373

♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

374
00:24:37,631 --> 00:24:39,750

380
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,370
Okay, hurry and make a wish.

381
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:26,260
I wish for the person I love to be happy forever,

382
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,670
always blissful, and...

383
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,840
for him to get Dad's understanding.

384
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,090
I wish he won't be sad or heartbroken.

385
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,460
And that he will never again have to leave his beloved home.

Who is the person you love in the wish you just made?

388
00:25:54,489 --> 00:25:56,520
Why don't I know about him?

389
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,510
There are a lot of things you don't know.

390
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,149
What else is there?

391
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,379
I even know how to make cocktails.

392
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,269
Really? Do you know how to make cocktails?

393
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,170
I was in a bartending club in high school.

394
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,900
It seems there are many things I don't know about you.

395
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,500
I will make you a cocktail that tastes like you're twenty years old.

396
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,939
Here, have a sip.

397
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:29,440
Okay.

398
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,390
This is sweet and sour. It's really good.

399
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,739
It's tasty, isn't it?

400
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,580
I even know how to make a Rainbow Cocktail.

401
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,280
That's impressive!

402
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,066
Of course.

403
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,479
This one is really good too.

404
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,380
Let me take a sip.

405
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,940
This is also delicious!

406
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,969
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

407
00:27:56,969 --> 00:28:00,000
Which colors do you like? I can make them all.

408
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,200
But it's clearly your birthday. I should be the one making you drinks.

409
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,900
Why don't you teach me? I'll make one for you.

410
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,870
Sure. Then come inside.

411
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,270
Come on.

412
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,409
Then I will start by teaching you how to mix.

413
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:15,660
All right.

414
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,370
First, we pour the base liquor in.

00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,990
Okay.

421
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,370

♫ Face all the painful places where you're at ♫

00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:01,950

428
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,680
You should make the drinks.

429
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:43,950
Thanks.

430
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:45,870
No problem.

431
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,100
Hey, Handsome.

432
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,900
Can you help me make a nice cocktail?

433
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,170
The drinks I make are very strong.

434
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:55,559
For your safety, it's best that you don't drink them.

435
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:58,540
But he drank so much!

436
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,590
That's because he has me.

437
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,100
- Hsing Ssu. Hsing Ssu.
- Yes?

438
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,100
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

439
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,730
Let's go.

440
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,860
Come on.

441
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,800
Let's go.

442
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,400
Be careful.

443
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,880
I do have to make a quick apology.

444
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,320
If you don't, how can you keep up the act in front of Mei Fang?

445
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,010
No.

446
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,780
You'll have to compromise if you show weakness like this.

447
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,380
Then I'll have to go tell Mei Fang that I'm a bottom.

448
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,553
What exactly is he doing?

449
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,816
But continuing this stalemate isn't a solution either.

450
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,060
Don't linger at my door in the middle of the night!

451
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,670
Why can't I?

452
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,830
This space in front of your door is public space!

453
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,300
I will walk wherever I want.

454
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,161
So immature and boring!

455
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:13,180
Well, you're crazy!

456

458

I'm going to pull out your hair and strip you of all your clothes.

You're Yung Chieh.

Yes, I'm Fu Yung Chieh.

470
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:56,290
Now I'm going to tell you who I love, all right?

471
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:07,700
When I was ten years old, he suddenly came into my life.

472
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,379
He has always been kind to me.

473
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:12,950
He has never said "no" to me.

474
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,699
In high school, I discovered that I'd fallen in love with him.

475
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:23,619
Then I began to love him more and more.

476
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,740
Loving him made me so sad and caused me so much pain!

477
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,769
If it's so painful,

478
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,210
then stop loving him.

479
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,669
I cannot.

480
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:41,130
I'm already too deeply in love.

481
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:45,056
No matter how painful it is, I can't stop loving him.

482
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,469
Who is he?

483
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,716
I will go tell him for you.

484
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,970
It's you.

485
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,390
Me?

486
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,601
Yes, you're the person I love very, very much.

487
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,530
Then that's great.

488
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,136
You really, really love me.

489
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,760
I really, really love you, too.

490
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,620
Why don't you kiss me (on the mouth)?

491
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,519
Don't be angry.

492
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,440
I will kiss you (on the mouth) when you are sober.

493
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,990
Did he accept your apology?

494
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,610
No.

495
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,210
Then keep going. Don't give up!

496
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,950
Please him by doing what he likes.

497
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:47,150
Do something that he'll like...

498
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,310
Well... coffee.

499
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,390
Why did you use my cup?

500
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:04,241
I took the wrong one so I'll give this cup to you.

501
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,120
I don't want to drink it right now.

502
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,200
It's already made, and it's the coffee you like.

503
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,660
It is a little hot.

504
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,270
You mistakenly took my cup, and now you're forcing me to drink.

505
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,500
Isn't that a bit too much?

506
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,080
- Fine. If you won't drink it, then I will.
- H-Hey!

507
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,180
This is my cup.

508
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,600
If you want to drink the coffee, go get your own cup, then pour it in there.

509
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,651
All the cups will be washed anyway. Why go through so much trouble?

510
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,210
But you won't drink it!

511
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,729
Why did you come back so early?

512
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,520
It's not even ten o'clock yet.

513
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,820
It's a waste to check out so early.

514
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,340
What happened?

515
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,730
How...

516
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,856
Xiao Yeh, what's wrong?

517
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,540
I...

518
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:08,050
I slept with my brother!

519
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,870
What?

520
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,960
It was my fault. I shouldn't have gotten drunk.

521
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,590
He's my brother. How could I—

522
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:24,910
But... he wasn't drunk.

523
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:29,030
If he was not willing, then why didn't he resist?

524
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,680
I probably kept pestering him so he—

525
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,670
Calm down.

526
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:36,200
You are both men.

527
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,630
Even if you pestered him, "no" is still "no."

528
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:43,590
- But he wouldn't have willingly–
- Wait a second.

529
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:46,930
Let me get this straight. You and your brother slept together.

530
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,190
Well, who was the top?

531
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,630
Hsiao Li Cheng, is that important right now?

532
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,790
Absolutely.

533
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,460
Of course, it's important to know who was the top.

534
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:57,190
If Xiao Yeh was the top, then it would be more likely that his brother was willing.

535
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:00,120
His brother fights better than Xiao Yeh and has a hard fist.

536
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,863
So...

537
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,000
I was the bottom.

538
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,930
Then it might be that you were pestering him

539
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,060
so he reluctantly yielded.

540
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,760
After all, he's just turned twenty so he's full of lust.

541
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,210
It is the age where you only think with your lower body.

542
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:32,400
What should I do? How will I explain this to his mom?

543
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,680
No matter what, you have to face it.

544
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,880
He's... probably still at the hotel, right?

545
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,340
He must be.

546
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:46,060
A little devil, who only had NT$1000 ($35 U.S.) to treat us to dinner, won't have a way to check out of a hotel.

547
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,830
I'll go save him.

548
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:51,861
I'll bring him back so you two brothers can talk it out.

549
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:59,910
How did you get the money?

550
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:22,880
I told you that I would kiss you when you are sober.

551
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,010
Yung Chieh.

552
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:26,776
I purposely got you drunk last night.

553
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,570
What did you say?

554
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:42,780
Whether you were willing or not, having you was my gift to myself for my twentieth birthday.

555
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,010
Because I love you,

556
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:49,326
I want you to belong to only me—

557
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:00,070
What are you doing?

558
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,560
What are you thinking?

559
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,070
I'm your brother!

560
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,600
You are not my brother!

561
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,600
And I don't want you to be my brother!

562
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,580
Since I was young, I have never wanted to call you my brother!

563
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,759
I don't want to see you.

564
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,290
Leave.

565
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,440
Little Devil.

566
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,730
Just go.

567
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:44,550
Don't be annoying.

568
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:38,510
