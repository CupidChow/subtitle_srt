=Episode 32=

17
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,425
(You know
I was a singing performer before.)

18
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,440
(I suffered a lot when I was a child.)

19
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,759
Actually, being a good dancer

20
00:02:17,075 --> 00:02:18,355
isn't a blessing.

21
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:21,625
For people of pariah status like us,

22
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,900
the more talented you are
in serving men,

23
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,839
the more pathetic you are.

24
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,479
If you like dancing,

25
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,320
I'll take you

26
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,039
to Wazi and watch girls dance.
[*Wazi: Public place of entertainment]

27
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:37,559
People there

28
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,050
won't look down upon us.

29
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:44,000
(She was Yinzhang's elder sister.)

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,679
- (When we were in Wazi,)
- Don't cry.

31
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,720
(we always heard people laughing.)

32
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:53,175
(I ate candies and listened to songs. )

33
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:56,479
(I felt warm and happy there.)

34
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,279
(Only in there,)

35
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,720
(I wouldn't be beaten by the
instructor of the Music Bureau.)

36
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,250
(I could watch with pleasure)

37
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,759
(the girls singing
and dancing on the stage.)

38
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,240
The ten years during which
I was a singing performer

39
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:37,039
were the worst part of my life,

40
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:40,320
but Wazi still

41
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:43,320
left a beautiful memory to me.

42
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,679
Then what happened?

43
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,920
What happened to Yinzhang's sister?

44
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,720
That's why
you are always kind to her.

45
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,480
Forget about it.

46
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,839
By the way,
since you like Wazi so much,

47
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,640
why don't you

48
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,000
consider opening one?

49
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,150
Ah?

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,600
Didn't we agree to open a restaurant?

51
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,040
How come it becomes Wazi?

52
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,359
Isn't it all very sudden?

53
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,640
Who said we can't run a Wazi
in a restaurant?

54
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,799
Of course not.

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,839
The restaurant guild won't allow it.

56
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,160
Wazi is for inferiors.

57
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,279
It doesn't correspond
to the position of the restaurant.

58
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,839
Do people of the guild make laws?

59
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,040
Will you listen to them?

60
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,399
Can they discipline you?

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,959
Who said Wazi is for inferiors?

62
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,559
Those who think businessmen are lowly?

63
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,320
You're right.

64
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:40,480
I'm the head of the fish guild
and the vegetable guild.

65
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,880
They have to ask for my favor,

66
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,399
not the other way around.

67
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,600
Though I only ran teahouses before,

68
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,880
I had worked in Heyun Restaurant,
the biggest restaurant in Qiantang,

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,040
for three years.

70
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,880
I know what are needed

71
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,160
to run a restaurant well.

72
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,799
What are they?

73
00:05:58,239 --> 00:06:00,200
Flavor and taste of the cuisines?

74
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,399
Those are essential.

75
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,760
Didn't the Buddhist sutras say

76
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,119
human perceives the world

77
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,799
by his eyes, ears, nose, tongue,
body and mind?

78
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,640
He sees, hears, smells, tastes, feels
and then reacts.

79
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,040
I dare not say

80
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,279
I'll serve the best cuisines
and drinks

81
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,519
in Yong'an Restaurant,

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,040
but I want to achieve perfection

83
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:23,480
in what our customers see,
hear, smell and taste.

84
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,720
I hope in Yong'an Restaurant,

85
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,440
there are good wine, nice food,

86
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,000
beautiful songs, elegant music,

87
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:31,880
as well as folk music and desires.

88
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,519
The singing performers and acrobats

89
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,760
won't feel inferior.

90
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,160
Common folks

91
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,760
will enjoy themselves
with the dignitaries.

92
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,920
This may be an
unprecedented beginning

93
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,399
for all the restaurants
in the Eastern Capital.

94
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:44,839
But we need to make many changes.

95
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,679
Mr. Chi, do you agree with me
to make the changes?

96
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,200
Yes.

97
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,359
I have enough money to start the work.

98
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,839
I'm finished.

99
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,119
What's wrong with you?

100
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,839
It's a relapse.

101
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,559
Chief.

102
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:19,000
Chief.

103
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,559
Sir,

104
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:23,160
didn't you clear the congestion?

105
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
Why hasn't he woken up?

106
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,279
The congestion is cleared.

107
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,959
But Commissioner
has been in a coma for too long.

108
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,480
Like a drowning man,

109
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,880
even if you've drained water
out of his body,

110
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,880
he won't wake up soon.

111
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,480
Chief.

112
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:58,359
Chief, wake up. Chief.

113
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,900
Well.

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,519
Pan'er is in trouble, Chief.

115
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,679
Pan'er is in trouble.

116
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:08,040
Chief, wake up.

117
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:21,679
Sir.

118
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,320
Sir, come and have a look.

119
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,919
Pan'er has been tricked.

120
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,960
Yinzhang is in trouble, too.

121
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,080
Chief.

122
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,640
You finally woke up, Chief.

123
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,359
How is she?

124
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,832
Well...

125
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,200
Anyway, it was a mess
in Lin's Mansion last night.

126
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:22,919
Shen Ruzhuo really lost face,

127
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,599
but he insisted

128
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:25,599
he was drunk and impetuous

129
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,599
and mistook the maid of
Finance Minister Lin for someone else.

130
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:29,840
I don't care about them.

131
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:32,080
Just tell me what happened to Pan'er.

132
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,280
Why was she taken away by Chi Pan?

133
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,559
Why did they have a fight?

134
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,960
How did she get injured?

135
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,799
Since you care about her so much,

136
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:43,400
why don't you ask her yourself?

137
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:46,200
Chief, we can visit her now.

138
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,520
I dare not see her.

139
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,599
What happened, Chief?

140
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,550
I don't think

141
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,080
we'll get married.

142
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,200
Shall I take you

143
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,719
to try some local snacks?

144
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
The people
with the Capital Security Office.

145
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:22,320
Hey, watch out!

146
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,679
What if you hit someone?

147
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,719
Are you all right, Chief?

148
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,000
What's wrong with you?

149
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,119
Chief, Ms. Zhao is in front of us.

150
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:31,000
Go ahead.

151
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,479
Ask her why she is with Chi Pan.

152
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:34,880
Is she under coercion?

153
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:38,239
Chief, won't you see Pan'er?

154
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:38,880
Go ahead.

155
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:39,880
Yes.

156
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,119
Who is making noise?

157
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,919
Long time no see, Pan'er.

158
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,159
Isn't this Mr. Chi?

159
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,599
Pan'er,

160
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,320
don't you bear grudges
against each other?

161
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,159
Why are you with him?

162
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,000
You barely know Mr. Chi.

163
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,520
Everyone in the city

164
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,799
knows Mr. Chi.

165
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,919
Pan'er, I've just returned.

166
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:12,359
I didn't know anything about
the restaurant and the teahouse before.

167
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,000
How are you?

168
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:17,159
Where is Zhaodi? Why isn't she here?

169
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,080
You asked the questions for yourself

170
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:23,359
or for someone else?

171
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,760
Of course for myself.

172
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,159
It's good that you're fine, Pan'er.

173
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,520
By the way,

174
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,880
Mr. Chi isn't a good man.

175
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,039
You must stay away from him.

176
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,640
If anything happens,
send someone to inform me.

177
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,599
Pooh!

178
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,320
Who do you think you are?

179
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,719
Why did you say I'm not a good man?

180
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:42,840
What makes you a good man?

181
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,719
What makes me a bad man?

182
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:45,359
Now that we've broken up,

183
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,159
I can be with any man.

184
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,280
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

185
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:50,975
Exactly.

186
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,359
The rain poured down last night.

187
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,239
The sun shines brightly this morning.

188
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:58,080
Pan'er and I hit it off straight away.

189
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,719
We took up the wine cup
and chatted merrily

190
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,000
in Yong'an Restaurant just now.

191
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,080
Yinzhang and Sanniang were
our witnesses.

192
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,119
Ms. Zhao, are you tired?

193
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,359
The silk shop is mine, too.

194
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
Let's get in and take a rest.

195
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,280
What a useless man!

196
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,080
Mr. Chi,

197
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,960
get Pan'er a brazier later

198
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,039
so that she can jump it over
and get rid of all the bad luck.

199
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,239
Out with the old and in with the new.

200
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,760
Do you hear me?

201
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,039
Sanniang.

202
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:58,719
Shut up.

203
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,919
Excuse me.

204
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,000
We're closing.

205
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,919
I'm really sorry.

206
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,479
Sorry, we're closing.

207
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:14,440
I'm so sorry.

208
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:15,960
See you next time.

209
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,599
Come on.

210
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:17,239
Yeah.

211
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:18,280
Hurry up.

212
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:24,600
Chief, what shall we do?

213
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,050
Go back.

214
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,159
It's enough.

215
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:32,320
I'm relieved knowing that she's fine.

216
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,080
Go.

217
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,960
Well...

218
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:37,100
Chief.

219
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:38,520
Go!

220
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,359
Go.

221
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,679
Chief, don't worry.

222
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,919
I'll find out what happened.

223
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:46,200
Don't worry.

224
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,919
You just woke up and you're still weak.

225
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,760
We can't let anything
happen to you again.

226
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,679
Ms. Zhao, sit.

227
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,479
I'll get you a cup of water.

228
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,039
Pan'er, you feel wretched, don't you?

229
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,880
It's all right to cry.

230
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,000
Gu Qianfan, the monster,

231
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:52,919
is really a Living Devil.

232
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:55,080
He almost killed Pan'er.

233
00:14:58,599 --> 00:14:59,919
Don't worry. Watch me.

234
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,440
Pan'er, do you know
how happy I am today?

235
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,440
I've been opposing Gu Qianfan
for over ten years.

236
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:15,640
It's the first time I've gained
such a complete victory.

237
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,599
He actually hid in the carriage

238
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,200
and dared not make a sound,

239
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:20,559
just like a quail.

240
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,919
I made a prudent decision.

241
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,650
In order to upset him,

242
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,599
you should be with me.

243
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,159
We'll date
under the moon and flowers

244
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:38,919
and make a happy couple.

245
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,159
Let's piss him off, shall we?

246
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:43,880
Look, she slapped me.

247
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:44,799
She is fine now.

248
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,080
I still remember the last slap.

249
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,025
It's all right to cry out.

250
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,525
Hey, Mr. Yuan.

251
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:29,150
Yeah.

252
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,599
In the middle
will be Qianshan Pavilion.

253
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:34,799
It's for individual customers.

254
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,119
On the left, Yiyuan Pavilion.

255
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:38,440
Be careful.

256
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:39,840
There will be private rooms.

257
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,119
On the right is Wazi.
It's for entertainment.

258
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:44,280
We'll call it Wanshui Pavilion.

259
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,359
Yeah, I get it.

260
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,440
Pan'er.

261
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,200
Watch out.

262
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,159
Are you blind?

263
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:50,799
The dust is rising everywhere.

264
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,080
Why don't you fan her a little?

265
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:56,359
I drew a divination stick
at the Temple of God of Earth,

266
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,359
which says our business will boom

267
00:16:58,359 --> 00:16:59,960
after the restaurant reopens.

268
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,119
I'm so pleased on hearing it.

269
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,679
They have the working drawings.

270
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,880
Let them do their job.

271
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,880
It's dirty here.

272
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,040
You'll be exhausted
supervising the work yourself.

273
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,959
How could you be the head

274
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,040
of the construction guild?

275
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,520
If you don't keep an eye
on the construction,

276
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,760
something will go wrong.

277
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,199
Now that I'm the manager
of Yong'an Restaurant,

278
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,225
I'll make sure your money is well spent.

279
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,760
Mr. Yuan, move the board back a little.

280
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,560
OK.

281
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:26,439
Yes.

282
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,880
You're right.

283
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,319
Work hard, you guys.

284
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,280
How many days

285
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,359
do you think it will take
to finish the renovation?

286
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,239
At least ten days.

287
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,000
Sanniang is busy taking up
the challenges of your cooks.

288
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,760
None of them is easy to deal with.

289
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:40,239
It will take her great effort.

290
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:41,520
Cooks?

291
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,319
All right.

292
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,199
Don't tell me

293
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:51,400
women cannot be chefs.

294
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,359
It's time for us to act.

295
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,839
Whoever isn't convinced
should have a competition with me.

296
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:08,479
Whoever convinced come here.

297
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,199
Everyone makes me a fried egg.

298
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:11,199
I'll taste it.

299
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,599
If I'm satisfied, the cook can stay.

300
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,280
If I'm not, please find another job.

301
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:17,560
By the way,

302
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:20,000
those who can stay
get a pay rise of 20%.

303
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,079
Hurry up.

304
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,119
- Hurry.
- Hurry.

305
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,280
- Hurry up.
- Hurry.

306
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,800
- We're at your disposal.
- We're at your disposal.

307
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,800
They're not my cooks.

308
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,719
They are our cooks.

309
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,359
Mr. Chi,

310
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,560
could you restrain

311
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,760
your frivolous manners a little?

312
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,760
Yinzhang is looking for ways to make
the private rooms more tasteful.

313
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,760
If you behave frivolously
every now and then,

314
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:48,719
the scholars will avoid us
like we're the plague.

315
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,000
I'll definitely mend my ways.

316
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,079
Everyone, our humble restaurant

317
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,280
reopens after renovation.

318
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,680
Good wine gives off its aroma.

319
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,680
Old cups welcome new customers.

320
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,760
I'm looking forward
to your personal visit.

321
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,479
On assuming a feigned manner,

322
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:09,359
no one can beat me in the city.

323
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,280
Mr. Yuan, am I right?

324
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,400
Yes.

325
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,079
Mr. Chi, whatever you said is right.

326
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,079
Thanks.

327
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,199
Pan'er.

328
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,040
Pan'er, don't leave.

329
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,439
I haven't finished.

330
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,319
I'm going to see Sanniang
in the kitchen.

331
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,359
It's filled with smoke
of the cooking oil.

332
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,199
Do you want to follow me?

333
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,719
I did something.

334
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,920
I'm sure you'll like it.

335
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,280
Let me show you.

336
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:29,920
Look.

337
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,280
I beat the rascals

338
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,239
of Wangyue Restaurant soundly

339
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,000
and took back the 300 strings

340
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:37,199
they tricked out of you.

341
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:37,920
Here you are.

342
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,000
I won't take the money.

343
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:40,000
Why?

344
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,760
We breached the contract.

345
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,680
They have the right to keep the deposit.

346
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,479
I won't take one coin
that doesn't belong to me.

347
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:47,680
Give it back to them.

348
00:20:48,075 --> 00:20:48,775
Oh.

349
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,560
But I appreciated it a lot

350
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,000
that you helped me to beat them.

351
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,719
Really?

352
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,520
Then you should buy me drinks.

353
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,920
No, I want to eat your pastries.

354
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,319
The pastries
you made in your teahouse,

355
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,800
I barely ate any of those.

356
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,479
Sanniang made all the pastries.
I didn't.

357
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,959
Then whisk tea for me.

358
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:06,479
I want to watch you perform Tea Art.

359
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,839
Mr. Chi,

360
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:11,880
would you stop sweet-talking me?

361
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,640
After all, three days ago,

362
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:16,359
you were one of the people
I hated most in the city.

363
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,425
Oh.

364
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,920
You were badly hurt
by Gu Qianfan that day.

365
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,040
I'm just trying to make you happy.

366
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,199
Who hasn't fallen for a villain

367
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,920
in younger days?

368
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,359
You're a young lady.

369
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,839
Smile suits you well.

370
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,319
Thanks.

371
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:37,359
When I'm free, I'll whisk tea for you.

372
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,359
It's a deal.

373
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,319
Yeah. It's a deal.

374
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,359
By the way,
you should keep an eye on purchasing.

375
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:44,719
As for the restaurant guild,

376
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:46,560
you'd better visit the head constantly.

377
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,040
After all, our restaurant
is just for temporary rest.

378
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,520
We have to purchase wine
from the registered restaurants.

379
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:50,560
No problem.

380
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,359
I'll buy you the best

381
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,119
and most expensive wine.

382
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:54,599
Not the most expensive,

383
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,520
but the most proper wine.

384
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,520
No problem.

385
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:00,079
I'll take all your advice
concerning our restaurant.

386
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,640
What you told me that day,

387
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,119
I'll always keep it in my mind.

388
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,359
We must open an
unprecedented restaurant

389
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,640
in the Eastern Capital.

390
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
In order to do that,

391
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,680
I'll try my best.

392
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:12,599
What's wrong?

393
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,599
I've never seen you being so serious.

394
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,520
I'm not used to it.

395
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:22,760
So she likes it when I'm serious.

396
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,319
I'm finished.

397
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:29,839
What shall I do?

398
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,599
How could I talk to her?

399
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,359
It's beautiful!

400
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:44,000
Yinzhang,

401
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,319
do you invite us over

402
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:47,079
because you want us
to perform here?

403
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,425
- We'll definitely support you.
- It's a great place.

404
00:22:48,425 --> 00:22:49,199
Yes.

405
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:50,040
Not only that,

406
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:52,359
I want to sign a contract with you.

407
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,640
When you perform in our restaurant,

408
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,760
in addition to the fair payment,

409
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,319
you can take a 10% commission
on the wine you've sold.

410
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,239
We can take a commission?

411
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:03,280
- Seriously?
- Really?

412
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,000
Really.

413
00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:05,160
Thank you, Yinzhang.

414
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,959
- Thanks, Ms. Song.
- Thanks, Ms. Song.

415
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,000
You've been working here for long.

416
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,400
The restaurant will still rely on you.

417
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,319
Thank you.

418
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,959
- We're at your disposal.
- We're at your disposal.

419
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,160
Thanks a lot.

420
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,520
Are you getting married?

421
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:32,880
Congratulations!

422
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,599
I don't deserve to be congratulated.

423
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,319
Because I'm still marrying Ouyang Xu.

424
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,800
Ouyang Xu has returned
from the Western Capital.

425
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:43,239
He managed to please Censor Qi

426
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:44,025
and got promoted.

427
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,599
Now he threatens
to expose my privacy.

428
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:50,959
My father forces me to marry him.

429
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,920
How could your father do this?

430
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,560
It concerns your lifelong happiness.

431
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:00,000
How could you let him
manipulate you at will?

432
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,199
Ouyang Xu is a calm viper now.

433
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:07,400
After he has retaliated against me,

434
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,959
he'll come after you.

435
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,719
Ms. Zhao, you must be careful.

436
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,400
- Excuse me.
- Please stop.

437
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,719
- Why do you break in?
- Stop. Stop.

438
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:22,359
Mr. Ouyang isn't home.

439
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:23,640
I'll leave if he isn't home.

440
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,239
Let me check.

441
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:24,880
It's unnecessary.

442
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,520
I'll just take a look.

443
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,920
- Really, just a look.
- Believe me.

444
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,160
Look, isn't he home?

445
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:30,359
You lied to me.

446
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,239
He told me you weren't home.

447
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,439
Leave us alone.

448
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,760
Changfeng, don't take offense
at a servant.

449
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,680
When did you return?

450
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,800
Why didn't you tell me?

451
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,160
His Majesty
requested my service.

452
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,560
And I just assumed the new post.

453
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,400
I didn't have time to pay you a visit.

454
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:47,400
Changfeng, please forgive me.

455
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,319
By the way, thank you for
taking care of my servant

456
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,319
when I was away.

457
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,560
When I returned,

458
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:59,119
Uncle De's leg was almost recovered.

459
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,920
I took care of your house and servant

460
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,439
because I thought you were my friend.

461
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:04,040
What about you?

462
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,520
You didn't tell me when you returned

463
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,479
and got promoted.

464
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,719
Now you don't even tell me
you're home.

465
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:12,040
Changfeng, are you here to blame me?

466
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:15,839
I'm not.

467
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,319
I just heard that

468
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,400
you're going to marry Miss Gao.

469
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,160
Didn't you tell me in your letter

470
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,160
that Miss Gao

471
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:24,439
sent someone to the Western Capital
to torture you?

472
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:25,760
You're getting yourself an enemy

473
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,760
instead of a wife.

474
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,920
You should think it over.

475
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm afraid that you don't
worry about me.

476
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:33,599
You worry about Sun Sanniang.

477
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,079
Though I just returned,

478
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,000
I've heard

479
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,599
a lot of news.

480
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:48,800
Let's put our cards on the table.

481
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:52,119
You're afraid that
after I marry Miss Gao,

482
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,199
I'll get even with Zhao Pan'er
and her friends.

483
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:58,400
You don't have to.

484
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,760
When I was in the Western Capital,

485
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:03,400
I learned to let go of the past.

486
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,000
From now on,
I only care about my fame and fortune.

487
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,479
Let bygones

488
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,800
be bygones.

489
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,479
Seriously?

490
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,959
Changfeng, look.

491
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,959
I got the wounds
when I fell down the cliff

492
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,000
in searching for Taoist Baoyi.

493
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:34,520
It was in May.

494
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:37,400
But Zhongnan Mountain
was covered with thick snow.

495
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:43,439
Sometimes, there are
marvelous turns in life.

496
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,920
Maybe you'll

497
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:47,160
understand me after you

498
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,199
get the same experiences as I did.

499
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,400
That's good.

500
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:54,040
Take care.

501
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,880
Did he really say that?

502
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:06,599
Yes. I heard him with my own ears.

503
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,479
I think he was sincere.

504
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,599
Is his sincerity worthy of 100 coins?

505
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:14,040
Didn't he make a pledge

506
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,160
of three lifetimes with Pan'er?

507
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,040
Mr. Du, thank you for
inquiring about it for us.

508
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,359
Since Ouyang Xu said so,

509
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,479
sincere or not,

510
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:26,280
he has made his views clear.

511
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,680
He doesn't want to
make an enemy of us.

512
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,040
Sounds fair.

513
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Ouyang Xu just returned.

514
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,920
He's busy marrying Gao Hui.

515
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,800
At the moment,

516
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,199
if he acts recklessly,

517
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,719
he'll get himself into trouble.

518
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,920
In that case,

519
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:41,439
it's a good thing.

520
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,079
We're busy with the restaurant.

521
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,400
We have no time to deal with him.

522
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,359
By the way,

523
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:49,560
Ouyang Xu

524
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,359
seems not to know what happened
between you and Mr. Gu.

525
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:52,119
I didn't tell him.

526
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:53,239
I want him to be afraid.

527
00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:55,665
Drink tea.

528
00:27:55,665 --> 00:27:56,325
Yeah, I was wrong.

529
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:10,359
We still have work to do
in the teahouse.

530
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:11,675
Excuse us.

531
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,760
Sanniang, let's go.

532
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,280
You go ahead.
I'll go after I collect the laundry.

533
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,719
Let me help you.

534
00:28:26,475 --> 00:28:27,839
Don't touch ladies' clothes.

535
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:29,319
I...

536
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,199
Don't think

537
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,199
your short-sighted eyes
can see everything clearly

538
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:36,400
just because
you ate a lot of pig livers.

539
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:38,599
Don't mention Gu Qianfan again

540
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,199
in front of Pan'er, remember?

541
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,439
I forgot.

542
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:44,079
You're considerate.

543
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,199
I'm pissed on thinking of that.

544
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,239
Pan'er is such a nice girl.

545
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,680
Why is she always unlucky with love?

546
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:52,920
If Ouyang Xu hurt her badly,

547
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:55,280
Gu Qianfan hurt her much worse.

548
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:58,479
None of you men is a good thing.

549
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,479
I-I'm a good thing.

550
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,719
No, I'm not a thing.

551
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,839
Did I hurt you when I stepped on you?

552
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:12,000
No. It didn't hurt.

553
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:13,280
By the way,

554
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,000
I saw the decorating flower
on your shoe

555
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,719
was missing again.

556
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,640
Stitch this on it.

557
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,160
It saves you the trouble to make one.

558
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,800
Why do you have this?

559
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,800
The other day
when I was in Half-hidden,

560
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,760
didn't I almost fall?

561
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,040
You helped me.

562
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,359
The flower fell off that time.

563
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,239
So I made another one

564
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:31,640
and carry it with me.

565
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,400
You've been carrying it?

566
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,276
Yeah.

567
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,359
Come.

568
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,025
OK.

569
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,800
Sit down.

570
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,900
Du Changfeng. I'll be frank.

571
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,515
Yeah.

572
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:55,359
I take a fancy to you.

573
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,525
Ah?

574
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,100
I have a quick temper,

575
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
and I don't like to speak in riddles.

576
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,439
I'm unabashed.

577
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,359
I know

578
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:10,079
you've been following me around
for dozens of days,

579
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:12,199
but you dare not show your feelings.

580
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:13,920
I'm afraid you haven't
thought it over

581
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,839
or figured it out.

582
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:17,119
So let me ask you directly.

583
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:20,319
I fell for you.

584
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:22,880
Do you want to be together with me?

585
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,640
Yes.

586
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:28,079
How do you want
to be together with me?

587
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:31,800
I want to marry you and live with you.

588
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,560
Then you must think it over.

589
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,839
If you want that,

590
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,280
you must marry me legally.

591
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:42,119
I'm a former butcher

592
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:42,959
with a teenager boy.

593
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,760
I'm too busy to socialize with you.

594
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,479
Do you understand?

595
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:48,719
Yes.

596
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:55,040
You must think it over and over again.

597
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,599
I'm 30 years old.

598
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:57,719
I'm divorced.

599
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:58,959
I have a boy.

600
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,119
I'm hot tempered.

601
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:02,199
I don't want you

602
00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:04,599
to find a wife randomly just because

603
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:07,479
you've been single for long.

604
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:09,920
Moreover,

605
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,160
I'm a cook, and a businesswoman.

606
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,560
You scholars mind it very much,
don't you?

607
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,959
If you marry me,

608
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,640
aren't you afraid of gossips?

609
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:22,525
No.

610
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:25,400
I wasn't afraid
when you threw me into the river.

611
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,439
Would I be afraid
that you work in Yong'an Restaurant?

612
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,079
What's wrong with businesswomen?

613
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:31,439
I'm an official without a post.

614
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,719
I'm timid and overcautious.

615
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,800
I shake when I'm in trouble.

616
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,040
I-I also...

617
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,920
I also...

618
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
What? Spit!

619
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,520
Bring my wife ill luck.

620
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:46,625
I'm tough. I'm not afraid.

621
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,160
That's great.

622
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:50,239
I was scared.

623
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,640
I love you because
you're beautiful and kind

624
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,800
and always take care of people.

625
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,479
Enough.

626
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:58,760
You've admitted
many of your shortcomings.

627
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,850
Then tell me,

628
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,560
why should I marry you?

629
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,800
What can I get from our marriage?

630
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:05,760
You don't have to look after
your in-laws.

631
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,760
Why?

632
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:10,800
My parents passed away early.

633
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:12,825
Oh.

634
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:14,280
Never mind.

635
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,359
I don't keep private money.

636
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:18,920
I'm not that kind of man

637
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,359
who dallies with women outside.

638
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,319
The bottom line is,

639
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,079
don't you want to wear
a chaplet and an official robe

640
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,239
on your wedding?

641
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:27,800
Then marry me.

642
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:30,000
When the officials
of the Eighth Rank and above

643
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,040
get married,

644
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,599
their brides can dress up by the ranks
of prefectures and counties.

645
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:36,800
Think about it.

646
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:41,680
You've surely thought it over.

647
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,920
It's like boiling dumplings
in a teapot.

648
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:46,199
I know exactly what are in there,

649
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,250
but I can't pour them out.

650
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,560
Sanniang, you're good.

651
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,640
You helped me order my thoughts.

652
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,839
I've figured it out completely.

653
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:56,000
I was wondering how to
bring it up to you,

654
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,280
not expecting you asked me first.

655
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,520
Sanniang.

656
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,280
Great.

657
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,239
It's great.

658
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,079
When shall I send a matchmaker
to propose to you?

659
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:10,800
Well,

660
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,560
wait till the renovation
of the restaurant is finished.

661
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,359
When the time comes,

662
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,439
there will be a fierce competition.

663
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:20,160
Since we've made everything clear,

664
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:22,199
I won't be distracted by other things.

665
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,920
But I'm more anxious than you.

666
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,040
Sanniang.

667
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:27,125
Sanniang.

668
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,000
What?

669
00:33:29,225 --> 00:33:29,906
Ouch.

670
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,319
I pushed you too hard.

671
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,000
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

672
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,760
Don't worry. Give me a hand.

673
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,400
I pushed too hard.

674
00:33:35,825 --> 00:33:36,650
Move over this side.

675
00:33:36,719 --> 00:33:37,525
Move over this side.

676
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,560
Don't step on my dress.

677
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,725
I didn't step on you.

678
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
Mr. Du, what are you doing?

679
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:49,479
Wh-Where are my glasses?

680
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:51,719
Where are my glasses?

681
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,640
My glasses got...

682
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,650
I'm helping him look for his glasses.

683
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:57,959
Where are the glasses?

684
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,040
You, get up first.

685
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:02,640
Didn't you say
you had urgent business

686
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,359
and you had to leave?

687
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,400
- Yes.
- You should go.

688
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,359
I got to go.

689
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,319
Not that way.

690
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,640
This way.

691
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,120
Zhaodi, please walk Mr. Du out.

692
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:14,280
Find him a carriage
at the entrance of the alley.

693
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,760
Sanniang.

694
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,200
Bean paste cakes.

695
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,360
To keep my mouth shut.

696
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,360
Don't even think about it.

697
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,280
Hurry up.

698
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:24,875
Hey!

699
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,840
That way!

700
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,679
This way.

701
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,520
It's the right way.

702
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:32,639
- Right.
- No.

703
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,700
Below.

704
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,239
Master.

705
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,080
What's up?

706
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,760
When I sat in meditation
in the east wing,

707
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,679
you know I used to practice
breathing skills,

708
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,320
as I sat still,

709
00:35:34,439 --> 00:35:35,800
I heard something in the tree.

710
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,840
Is it possible that the Gao Family...

711
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,399
Not them.

712
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,399
The Capital Security Office.

713
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,520
- The Capital Security Office?
- The Capital Security Office?

714
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,760
Gu Qianfan
of the Capital Security Office

715
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:50,159
fears that I'm going to pick on
his sweetheart, Zhao Pan'er,

716
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:52,399
so he sent his men to watch me.

717
00:35:53,479 --> 00:35:54,399
What's so strange?

718
00:35:55,399 --> 00:35:57,520
Anyway, they'll stay outside the yard.

719
00:35:57,959 --> 00:35:59,199
They won't break in.

720
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,800
Fortunately, you don't have dealings
with Zhao Pan'er anymore.

721
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,760
We'd better stay away
from the Capital Security Office.

722
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:13,000
Who told you so?

723
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,679
Gu Qianfan and Zhao Pan'er,

724
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:18,159
I won't let off either of them.

725
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,840
But you told Mr. Du...

726
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:26,760
All warfare is based on deception.

727
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,040
Now,

728
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,760
I don't believe what I said myself.

729
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
If anyone believes it,

730
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,639
it's their bad luck to be blamed.

731
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,560
Why are you here?

732
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,919
Did Gu Qianfan send you?

733
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:44,280
He dares not face Pan'er,

734
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:45,560
but he still worries about her,

735
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:46,719
so instead of coming by himself,

736
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:48,199
he sent you as his messenger.

737
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,239
I've been away for long.

738
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:51,199
How are you?

739
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:53,840
None of your business.

740
00:36:58,275 --> 00:37:00,600
I was wrong about your mother that day.

741
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:02,639
I didn't figure it out
until I left the capital.

742
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,360
Everyone has a different past.

743
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,919
I shouldn't have
judged you by my standard.

744
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:06,919
I'm sorry.

745
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:08,080
Drop it.

746
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,800
I'm just a lowly little girl.

747
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,600
I don't deserve the great courtesy

748
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,520
from you.

749
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:13,825
Zhaodi,

750
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,399
I've been missing you every day
since I left.

751
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:17,879
Could you speak nicely to me?

752
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,439
No.

753
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,479
I follow Pan'er.

754
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,840
And you follow your chief.

755
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,879
We're incompatible as fire and water.

756
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,520
What happened between them
shouldn't affect us.

757
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:31,399
Besides, Chief misses Pan'er, too.

758
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,919
Only several days ago,

759
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:35,040
he was seriously injured
because of the North Envoy.

760
00:37:35,479 --> 00:37:36,520
He just woke up from a coma.

761
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,639
He spat blood today.

762
00:37:37,919 --> 00:37:39,239
He really couldn't come by himself.

763
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:40,360
Anyway,

764
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,959
Mr. Chi isn't a good man.

765
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,159
You must be wary of him.

766
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:46,120
Even though, he is better
than your chief.

767
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,639
All I know is,

768
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,120
he is a coward

769
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:50,600
who escaped
without leaving a single word.

770
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:52,520
Because of him,

771
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,080
Pan'er had to kneel down to someone

772
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:56,560
and beg for money

773
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:58,159
to get us out of trouble.

774
00:37:59,199 --> 00:37:59,919
Kneel down?

775
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,639
Something must have gone wrong.

776
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,760
A few days ago,

777
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,080
Chief asked me to

778
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,360
sell two of his manors
to raise money.

779
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,040
How could he
not give Pan'er the money?

780
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,320
Besides, Chief

781
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,719
didn't mean to avoid Pan'er.

782
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,639
It was a state affair

783
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:15,280
concerning the North Envoy.

784
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,840
The imperial court issued an order

785
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,159
and forbade us to talk about it.

786
00:38:19,879 --> 00:38:21,959
Moreover, Chief is seriously ill.

787
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,120
He has to take medicine every day.

788
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:24,560
Is it a big deal?

789
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:26,239
Pan'er has to take medicine, too.

790
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:27,959
She has to take
cicada slough decoction every day

791
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:28,879
in order to get some sleep.

792
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,399
You said he couldn't come.

793
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:32,000
If he really cared about her,

794
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:34,239
he could always ask you
to bring a message to her

795
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:35,639
and tell her he was busy.

796
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:36,520
Is it so hard?

797
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,840
For what it's worth,

798
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:41,719
he is a coward who dares not show up.

799
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:43,040
No.

800
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,199
Actually, last night,

801
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,520
he came to see Pan'er secretly.

802
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:51,639
Last night?

803
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,800
It's true.

804
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,199
Moreover,

805
00:38:54,439 --> 00:38:56,120
you don't have to
be afraid of Ouyang Xu.

806
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:57,719
Since he arrived in the capital,

807
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,320
Chief has sent our men to watch him.

808
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,560
If he dares to pick on you,

809
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,760
he's going to be in big trouble.

810
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,300
And,

811
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,239
I made this myself.

812
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,840
I want you to keep it.

813
00:39:44,399 --> 00:39:45,399
Why are you sighing?

814
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:48,719
Isn't it good

815
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,919
to be the wife of an official?

816
00:39:50,479 --> 00:39:51,520
It's good.

817
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,320
But I'm afraid if by any chance,

818
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,239
he's like Gu Qianfan, Shen Ru...

819
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:00,360
Don't worry.

820
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,879
You can mention Shen Ruzhuo

821
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:04,439
as often as you like.

822
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:06,760
Now in my mind,

823
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,600
he means nothing,

824
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:09,959
just like the branch.

825
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,679
After that day,

826
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,439
did he come to see you again?

827
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,919
I have his statement.

828
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,719
How dare he?

829
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:35,360
The other day,
Suniang came to see me.

830
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:37,719
She told me lots of news.

831
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:40,080
Now rumors say

832
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:42,719
he hooked up with the maid
of Finance Minister Lin.

833
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,239
When I caught them,

834
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,479
I was furious

835
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,879
that I broke his fingers with my pipa.

836
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,840
Were his fingers really broken?

837
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:54,760
Yes.

838
00:40:55,479 --> 00:40:57,679
But I didn't do it.

839
00:40:57,879 --> 00:40:58,919
Finance Minister Lin did it.

840
00:40:59,879 --> 00:41:02,560
I made a hit at the wharf that day.

841
00:41:03,439 --> 00:41:04,919
Everyone says I have a backbone.

842
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,159
Finance Minister Lin
dares not do anything to me,

843
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,879
so he vented his anger on Shen Ruzhuo.

844
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:13,239
I get it now.

845
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,280
Men are some kind of enjoyment.

846
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,040
You can have fun with them,

847
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,679
but don't dream of
permanent relationships.

848
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,239
So, Sanniang,

849
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:28,280
if you like Mr. Du,

850
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:30,080
you should marry him.

851
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:32,280
When you get bored,

852
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,679
just divorce him.

853
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,879
Anyway, he isn't ugly.

854
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,159
You won't lose anything.

855
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,040
Isn't he ugly?

856
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:45,639
Who told you I like him?

857
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:48,199
Or do you think I like him?

858
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,479
Yinzhang,

859
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:57,280
since you came back,

860
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,399
I think you've been...

861
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:04,679
Cynical and misanthropic?

862
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,520
I'm a lady with a backbone now.

863
00:42:08,879 --> 00:42:10,679
If I don't show a strong character,

864
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:12,159
how can I convince people?

865
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:18,239
All right.

866
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:20,959
I'm going to
develop some new recipes.

867
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,239
You must help me name the dishes.

868
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,320
Rest assured.

869
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,120
Mourn gold and cherish jade.
Cry in wind and weep for the moon.

870
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,080
I can give you plenty of such names.

871
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,479
Did Chen Lian really say so?

872
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,600
I didn't change a word.

873
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:56,959
I thought it was weird before.

874
00:42:57,639 --> 00:42:58,239
Chen Lian

875
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:00,159
would never lie to me about this.

876
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,159
Maybe the North Envoy
was the true reason

877
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,679
that they didn't say a word

878
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:09,320
and tell you anything about him.

879
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:13,679
But he was in the carriage that day.

880
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,360
Why didn't he get off the carriage
and see me?
