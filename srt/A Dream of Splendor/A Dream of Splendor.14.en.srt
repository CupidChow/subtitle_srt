=A Dream of Splendor=

16
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,700
=Episode 14=

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Sanniang is in charge of

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,040
kitchen supplies.

19
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,760
I'm on the operation of the teahouse.

20
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,760
Yinzhang is responsible
for the decoration and music.

21
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,520
As for the others,

22
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,440
we will vote
and if it's two against one,

23
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,840
it will be a pass, okay?

24
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,800
Okay.

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,520
Moreover, doing business is

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,240
more difficult for women than for men.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,200
If we keep losing in this teahouse,

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,560
can you stand it anymore?

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes.

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,520
Yinzhang.

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,960
If you become our signboard,

32
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,720
your registration

33
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,720
will be known by people.

34
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,000
No matter losing money

35
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,600
or being despised,

36
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,560
the teahouse must be opened.

37
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,440
Commissioner Gu has alarmed me
last time.

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,920
We must be strong

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,320
to live in the Eastern Capital.

40
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,440
I'll tell them frankly

41
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,640
that I'm the coach of pipa
in the Music Division.

42
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,280
Even if someone recognizes me

43
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,280
and talks about the past
between Zhou She and me,

44
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,560
I won't care.

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll tell them that

46
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,200
I was bitten by a vicious dog.

47
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,920
It was not my fault.

48
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,040
Being a registered musician

49
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
is not my fault, too.

50
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,640
Good.

51
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,240
Exactly.

52
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,840
But the vibe isn't right.

53
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,920
You should

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,480
straighten up your breast

55
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,120
and say it more confidently.

56
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,960
I've straightened up.

57
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,920
A bit more.

58
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,040
Yinzhang.

59
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,280
You're really amazing.

60
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,960
We're so proud of you.

61
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,680
It's good.

62
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,920
Pan'er, Sanniang,

63
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,560
how about

64
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,280
being like this all the time?

65
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,320
Let's not get married,

66
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,040
be sisters forever,

67
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,080
and support each other to the old age.

68
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,640
OK.

69
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,840
OK. OK.

70
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,320
OK.

71
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,440
The yard is not big,

72
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,040
but the plants are meaningful.

73
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,600
(There is a beauty lantern.)

74
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,780
(Mr. Zhuoshi)

75
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
(Mr. Zhuoshi)
And osmanthus on it.

76
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,080
This is exactly as the poem says,

77
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,640
"Inside the door last year
at this time,"

78
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,160
"there were a beautiful lady
and osmanthus."

79
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,480
(Mr. Yuan Tuntian)
But in my opinion,

80
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,440
the lantern is painted with Yuanjiu.

81
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,400
The dark and light of osmanthus

82
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,800
are like different makeups.

83
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,200
Exactly. Exactly.

84
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,960
Mr. Zhuoshi.

85
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,480
Mr. Yuan.

86
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,400
Mr. Yuan.

87
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,440
- Mr. Sun.
- You've also come.

88
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,600
You know me.

89
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,920
I like music the most.

90
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,760
Yes, yes.

91
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,680
I heard from Susu in Fan Pavilion

92
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,280
that a new store opened.

93
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,560
There must be beautiful music.

94
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,200
Yes.

95
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,560
So I came.

96
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,840
Look.

97
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,400
Is this real?

98
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,640
Fragrance.

99
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,360
Beauties.

100
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,600
So fragrant.

101
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,560
Half-hidden is opened again today.

102
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,760
We have prepared tea and music.

103
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,120
Please come in.

104
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,960
(Half-hidden)

105
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,440
Half-hidden.

106
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,800
What does it mean?

107
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,520
Half-hidden is opened.

108
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,560
Please.

109
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,640
Let's go.

110
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,520
Let's go.

111
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,280
I've wanted to come.

112
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,240
Good.

113
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,320
Amazing.

114
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,760
I was wondering
why it's called Half-hidden.

115
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,920
- It's the description of pipa.
- Excuse me.

116
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,320
So beautiful.

117
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,640
I'll come later.

118
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,240
Check there.

119
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,760
So elegant.

120
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,520
Nice pipa.

121
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,360
Yes.

122
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,760
May I know who is playing it?

123
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,440
Miss Song, the coach in Music Division

124
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,240
and the best player in Jiangnan.

125
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,840
This is "half-hidden".

126
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,320
I see.

127
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,800
It's Susu's coach.

128
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,920
No wonder she spoke highly of her.

129
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,480
Could you please play

130
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,120
one more piece?

131
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,200
Princess Qian

132
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,760
liked her music

133
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,520
and hired her as the player.

134
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,760
She made the rule that

135
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,200
she can only play three pieces
every day.

136
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,520
If you want to listen more,

137
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,560
just stay for a while

138
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,280
and enjoy our Jiangnan desserts.

139
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,600
Sir, what tea do you want?

140
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,560
Make the order here.

141
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,400
OK. OK.

142
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,820
(Fragrant juice, fragrant cake)

143
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,440
Jiangnan desserts are really good.

144
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,400
Fragrant cakes.

145
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,000
Let's check it.

146
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,640
Quite fresh.

147
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,720
Well.

148
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,160
80 copper coins
for a bottle of osmanthus juice.

149
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,960
You must have made a mistake.

150
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,960
It's worthy of a hodful of rice.

151
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,720
Too expensive.

152
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,960
You're joking.

153
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,280
Check out the situation,
environment and music.

154
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,880
How can you care about money?

155
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,760
I'm sure that

156
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,640
if you've tasted the osmanthus juice,

157
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,160
you won't think in this way.

158
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,040
Really?

159
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,440
We must try.

160
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,280
Please.

161
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,960
Let's try it.

162
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,440
Try it.

163
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,200
Osmanthus juice.

164
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,840
There is osmanthus.

165
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,520
So fragrant.

166
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,360
I want a bottle of it.

167
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
I am

168
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,640
such a foodie.

169
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,000
But the osmanthus juice

170
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,520
is really good.

171
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,360
Drink without cakes

172
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,920
is like music without wine.

173
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,240
What a pity.

174
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,800
How about

175
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,400
try my osmanthus cakes?

176
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,640
Let's check.

177
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,920
Are these cakes?

178
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,400
They're peach blossom.

179
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,680
Exactly, they're peach blossom.

180
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,960
Smiling at Spring Breeze.

181
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Turning Red Late.

182
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,440
Red Peach Blossom.

183
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,680
Living Beside Water.

184
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,040
Well.

185
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,440
So beautiful.

186
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,960
Living Beside Water.

187
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,080
Clear and transparent.

188
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,800
Like a crystal.

189
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,000
Tastes amazing.

190
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,040
It's like food for immortals.

191
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,080
Do they taste good?

192
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,320
Yes.

193
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,120
Miss Sun

194
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,680
is the offspring of Ning's military
governor in South Tang Dynasty,

195
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,840
These were learnt
from little Empress Zhou.

196
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,840
No matter it's big or little
Empress Zhou,

197
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,600
the taste is the most important.

198
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,600
I'll buy a box of it.

199
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,480
300 copper coins for a box.

200
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,040
It's OK.

201
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,960
So are we.

202
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,880
So am I. So am I.

203
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,680
OK. OK.

204
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,080
We all want them.

205
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,640
You really understand us.

206
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,960
Please come and enjoy Miss Song's pipa.

207
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,440
OK.

208
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,400
Go. Let's go.

209
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,360
Go. Go. Go.

210
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,360
Let me join you.

211
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,480
Upstairs.

212
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,240
Please.

213
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,760
Come.

214
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,040
Go.

215
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,640
Sorry, there's only room for ten.

216
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,600
We can't go?

217
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,720
Sorry.

218
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,240
I've also bought a lot.

219
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,520
We're not allowed to go.

220
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,880
Why is that?

221
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,160
How disappointing!

222
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,160
Ms. Zhao.

223
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,440
It's really unfair.

224
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,160
I was only a bit late.

225
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,920
But I have bought a lot.

226
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,840
Why can't I listen to the music?

227
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,440
The chance

228
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,560
is not about time, but opportunity.

229
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,600
Don't be disappointed.

230
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,200
Let me make you
a cup of Nine Completion Tea.

231
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,400
What is

232
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,080
Nine Completion Tea?

233
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,840
There are nine teacups.

234
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,240
Secret color.

235
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,040
Pink blue.

236
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,320
Plum green.

237
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,720
Red.

238
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,920
Black.

239
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,840
White.

240
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,880
Yellow.

241
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,160
Sky blue.

242
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Hare's fur.

243
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,440
The china of Ming, Yue, Tang,
Deng, Yao, Chai,

244
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,800
Rao, Longquan, Ding.

245
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,040
The famous porcelains of nine colors

246
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,320
preferred by the Imperial Palace
from Tang Dynasty to now

247
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,840
are all here,

248
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,640
being filled with Dragon and
Phoenix Tea His Majesty likes.

249
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,520
It means completion.

250
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,720
Please.

251
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,320
I didn't expect that

252
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,880
Ms. Zhao has collected
so many treasures.

253
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,480
This is peerless in the Eastern Capital.

254
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,040
I'm wondering where do

255
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,480
these famous porcelains come from.

256
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,040
Is it from Princess Qian in Jiangnan?

257
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,800
Sir.

258
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,720
Whatever tea

259
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,640
will be served to the royalties

260
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,240
in such precious cups.

261
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,920
Does the Nine Completion Tea

262
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,480
also cost 80 copper coins?

263
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,120
Of course not.

264
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,680
Good.

265
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,480
250 copper coins.

266
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,040
We only sell ten every day.

267
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,000
250 copper coins.

268
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,320
Only ten?

269
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,640
I'll order one.

270
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,760
So am I.

271
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,600
Me too.

272
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,560
Me too. Me too. Me too.

273
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,040
250 copper coins.

274
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,920
250 copper coins.

275
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,520
(Qingming Pavilion)
It's almost robbery.

276
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,000
For a cup of Dragon and Phoenix Tea,

277
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,040
they earn 30 copper coins.

278
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,920
They just put them in different cups

279
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,160
and sell at such a high price.

280
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,880
They're profiteers.

281
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,200
Sir.

282
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,880
How's the tea in Half-hidden

283
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,000
comparing to that here?

284
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,400
They do

285
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,400
taste better.

286
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,240
Sir, check out.

287
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,040
What are you doing?

288
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,280
Sir, where is Half-hidden?

289
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,400
Are you still going?

290
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,280
Of course.

291
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,280
A gentleman like me

292
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,560
should have more expensive tea.

293
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,960
The liquor tasted by Li Bai

294
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,120
will be more expensive than others.

295
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,600
(Qingming Pavilion)
I've also heard that Half-hidden

296
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,400
has a set of

297
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,040
imperial porcelains
favored by the emperors.

298
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,680
The imperial porcelains

299
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,680
are so precious.

300
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,160
Besides, I've been drinking tea here
for over ten years.

301
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,360
Aren't you sick of it?

302
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,040
I'm already sick of it.

303
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,480
I have to look at
the imperial porcelains.

304
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,800
Just one look will be enough.

305
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,080
This is so-called

306
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,760
"Emperor's daughter doesn't worry
about marriage."

307
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,340
What are you talking about?

308
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:24,980
(Qingming Pavilion)

309
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,280
Don't be late.

310
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,760
Check it.

311
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,120
Well...

312
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,160
Hurry up.

313
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,560
Sorry for the wait.

314
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,960
OK, thank you.

315
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,680
Thank you, Ms. Zhao.

316
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,240
Thank you.

317
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,040
Try this.

318
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,720
Take your time.

319
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,000
Please come in.

320
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,760
OK.

321
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,280
Ms. Zhao.

322
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,080
Ms. Zhao.

323
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,320
Thank you.

324
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,360
Let's continue tomorrow.

325
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,720
But don't say that

326
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,200
we're better than other teahouses
in the Tea Alley.

327
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,520
It may incur jealousy.

328
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,880
OK.

329
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,960
Miss.

330
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,590
You're much nicer than our master.

331
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,200
Our master is so niggard.

332
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,920
You're better.

333
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,800
Are you flattering me

334
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,280
to get more cakes?

335
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,040
No.

336
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,640
It's just that

337
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
our master's birthday is coming.

338
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,040
I don't know what present
should I give him.

339
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,590
I have nothing to give.

340
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,880
Well…

341
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,070
I've already prepared it for you.

342
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:24,800
Wait a minute.

343
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
One for you.

344
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,120
As for the other,

345
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,600
I heard that palace guard has a lover

346
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,200
called Zhang Haohao.

347
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,720
Can you lead me to her

348
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,040
with the excuse

349
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,400
that Yinzhang was enlightened by her

350
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,200
and I want to say thank you to her?

351
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,560
No problem.

352
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,200
I'll take off.

353
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,280
Miss, you look pretty today.

354
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,720
So pretty.

355
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,440
It does taste good.

356
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,840
It's comparable to the cakes
I've tasted in the court.

357
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,200
If you like it,

358
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,160
I'll ask the waiter
to deliver to you every day.

359
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,920
What do you think?

360
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,520
Why does the good luck

361
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,720
befall on me for no reason?

362
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,480
Yinzhang said that you're frank.

363
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,200
So I'll tell you frankly.

364
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,600
Your guests

365
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,120
include rich and noble people,

366
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,800
as well as poets like

367
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,720
Mr. Liu and Mr. Wang.

368
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,360
If they can taste the cakes,

369
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,080
it will not only increase your charm,

370
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,040
but also promote my fame.

371
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,640
You're trying to gain guests through me.

372
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,920
But,

373
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,760
it's a not enough to buy me

374
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,800
with 300 copper coins.

375
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,000
You're not short of money.

376
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,160
Let me put it straight.

377
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,520
You lack uniqueness.

378
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,080
Last time, you were popular among people

379
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,800
when you sang before His Majesty.

380
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,560
But after that,

381
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,160
you've been losing your charm.

382
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,200
Yinzhang told me that

383
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,400
there are hundreds of singing performers
in the Music Division.

384
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,680
There are so many ceremonies now.

385
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,480
All of them are preparing hard for

386
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,440
the imperial performance.

387
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
His Majesty is kind.

388
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,600
If he also awards them colorful dresses,

389
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,200
your music

390
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,000
won't be so precious.

391
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,640
You're exactly the one

392
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,040
who almost drove Mr. Chi crazy.

393
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,440
Teach me then.

394
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,560
I've been worrying about it these days.

395
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,480
Our Half-hidden

396
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,760
is small but of good quality.

397
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,960
Think about it.

398
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,880
What if the guests find out

399
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,120
the cakes that are hard to get

400
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,480
even with ten copper coins
in the black market

401
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,560
can be tasted in here easily?

402
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,160
Yinzhang is now a coach of pipa

403
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,160
in the Music Division.

404
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,760
If there is a chance to perform,

405
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,840
she would only cooperate with you.

406
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,480
I see.

407
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,880
This is so-called uniqueness.

408
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,600
I was

409
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,440
always thinking of

410
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,280
being the best singer.

411
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,400
I didn't expect there'd be such a trick.

412
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,400
Pan'er.

413
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,840
We should meet each other more.

414
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,760
It's my pleasure.

415
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,240
As long as Mr. Chi won't disturb.

416
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,760
How dare he?

417
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,560
Have some more.

418
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,120
What a coincidence.

419
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,080
What are these?

420
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,400
Presents from Zhang Haohao.

421
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,040
The wide-opening bottle of Ding.

422
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,760
She said that the Eighth Prince's
inscription is on it.

423
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,160
I can put it in my teahouse

424
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,560
so that the guests

425
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,960
will know we're close to each other.

426
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,280
Are your teacups all from the palace?

427
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,440
This is forbidden.

428
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,320
It's not allowed.

429
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,880
It's OK.

430
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,440
These were collected in Qiantang.

431
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,400
I didn't say they're from the palace.

432
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,600
I just said that they're popular
in the court.

433
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,200
The guests said that.

434
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,200
It's not my fault.

435
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,440
You're really amazing.

436
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
You know how to take the chances.

437
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,720
You promoted the imperial porcelains,

438
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,320
and befriended Zhang Haohao.

439
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,960
Are you bored?

440
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,680
There's so much work to do
in the Capital Security Office.

441
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,920
Why are you following me?

442
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,400
What are you looking for?

443
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,840
You're not the sculpture in the temple.

444
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,440
Why do you always gild yourself?

445
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,360
The detectives reported that

446
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,600
hundreds of scholars are gathered

447
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,440
in Mahang Street.

448
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,280
As an officer
of the Capital Security Office,

449
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,200
I should come and check

450
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,520
the primary criminal.

451
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,560
What do you want to say?

452
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,040
I'm saying

453
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,680
don't be so high-profile.

454
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,280
Your teahouse is small,

455
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,720
but so many guests poured into there.

456
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,240
If any accident happens,

457
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,400
things would be difficult.

458
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,840
OK.

459
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,440
What's more,

460
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,320
don't ask your people

461
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,040
to invite guests in Tea Alley.

462
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,400
The store owners there are experienced.

463
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,640
Businessmen in the Eastern Capital
team up with each other.

464
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,600
If you offend them,

465
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,200
it won't be good for you.

466
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:21,840
OK.

467
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,920
Why are you

468
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,600
so quiet today?

469
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,240
I'd like to.

470
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,160
Are you mad?

471
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,240
Are you mad at me

472
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,920
for not congratulating you?

473
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,920
I'm mad at someone
who doesn't speak good words.

474
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,440
You're worried.

475
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,800
But you pretend

476
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,280
to be serious and lecture me.

477
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,800
Who can bear it?

478
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
If I'm not serious,

479
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,880
you won't listen to me.

480
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,040
Have you never heard that

481
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,280
"People would rather see
the Devil being angry than laughing?"

482
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,120
You're fine now?

483
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,040
Who was the one

484
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,400
who pissed off every time

485
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,520
when hearing the name Living Devil?

486
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,560
Chen Lian exchanged Fei-qian for cash

487
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,200
and sent it to Gu Qianfan's house
in the South Bureau.

488
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,960
Money and women.

489
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,560
Gu Qianfan

490
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,120
is finally giving himself away.

491
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,280
What?

492
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,240
Gu Qianfan.

493
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,400
Are you…

494
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,000
What?

495
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,560
Nothing.

496
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,280
Alright, get in then.

497
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,000
Well,

498
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,240
when will you send some osmanthus cakes

499
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,200
to our Capital Security Office?

500
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,880
I'm your debt owner anyway.

501
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,720
Your Capital Security Office is scary.

502
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,280
I have no time

503
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,320
or guts to go there.

504
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,920
I'll ask Chen Lian to get them.

505
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,880
The cakes have been sold out.

506
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,800
Tomorrow then.

507
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,640
It's only some cakes.

508
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,920
Why are you so worried?

509
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,560
Let me tell you,

510
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,280
I don't like desserts.

511
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,080
I just want to send them
to one of my relatives.

512
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,360
I'll prepare it tomorrow.

513
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,600
Thanks for holding it for me.

514
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,760
What?

515
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,920
Nothing. I'm just a bit tired.

516
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,040
A rest will do me good.

517
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,480
Wait.

518
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,480
What is it?

519
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,920
Ouyang Xu

520
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,040
has arrived at the Western Capital.

521
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,880
You can be relieved.

522
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,760
OK, thank you.

523
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,440
If anything happens to him,

524
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,920
it will be even harder
to find the painting.

525
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,440
Is there anything else?

526
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,320
No.

527
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,200
I'll get in then.

528
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,480
We've earned 7,425 copper coins.

529
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,040
Minus our cost of construction

530
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,720
and the fee we paid He Si,

531
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,080
we've cleared 425 copper coins.

532
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,480
- Good.
- Good.

533
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,040
Don't get excited too early.

534
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,520
It's our first day.

535
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,600
Taking the cost of furniture and rent
into consideration,

536
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,960
we're still losing money.

537
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,480
I don't care.

538
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,400
We earned so much on the first day.

539
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,640
It suggests that our choice is right.

540
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,280
I was actually very tired.

541
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
Hearing that we earned money,

542
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,640
I'm so revived.

543
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,200
Let's try

544
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,960
to earn the capital back

545
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,560
in this month.

546
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,800
Well,

547
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,200
apart from playing the pipa,

548
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,200
I want to do something else,

549
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,160
like painting the cakes

550
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,680
and boxes for Sanniang.

551
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,320
As long as the guests don't see me.

552
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,560
OK, let me do it. Take a rest.

553
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,320
I'll go back to my room
and practice the pipa.

554
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,400
Just go. Rest early.

555
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,320
I'll go prepare the cakes.

556
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,400
I've forgotten to take the beans.

557
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,480
You go first.

558
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,720
Pan'er.

559
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,160
What?

560
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,000
Something is wrong with you.

561
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,680
Something is wrong with your smile.

562
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,360
Since you came back
from Zhang Haohao's place,

563
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,680
you've been wearing a smile

564
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,240
all the time.

565
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,440
Nonsense.

566
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,760
Wait.

567
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,680
Let me show you.

568
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,120
Look by yourself.

569
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,520
We have to smile
at the guests every day.

570
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,920
I'm used to it.

571
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,760
You're not.

572
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,520
I've never seen you like this.

573
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,680
What happened?

574
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,480
Did something happen

575
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,280
between you and Gu Qianfan?

576
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,240
No.

577
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,200
Nothing.

578
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,320
Sanniang.

579
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,280
I…

580
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,280
What?

581
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,000
I think I like him.

582
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,960
You like him?

583
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,400
That's OK.

584
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,600
No need to cry.

585
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,880
It's a good thing.

586
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,520
No.

587
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,840
I know it's not right.

588
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,840
Because we came to the Eastern Capital

589
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,440
because of Ouyang Xu.

590
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,040
What's the matter?

591
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,200
Listen.

592
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,000
Ouyang Xu has run away.

593
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,240
You and him are done.

594
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,720
You and Gu Qianfan

595
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,040
are both single.

596
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,000
You've suffered together

597
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,000
and are both in the Eastern Capital.

598
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,160
That's good.

599
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,880
These days,

600
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,880
I've been watching you,

601
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,760
and found something's going on
between you two.

602
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,200
I feel he kind of likes me,

603
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,560
but I'm not sure.

604
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,160
What are you talking about?

605
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
Sanniang, let me ask you.

606
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,320
If you like something,

607
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,440
like makeups

608
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,480
jewelries and dresses,

609
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,040
what would you do?

610
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,160
I'll buy them if I can afford them,

611
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,040
and save money if I can't.

612
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,400
Or, I'll keep watching it,

613
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,600
even for one more second.

614
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,960
He's not like that.

615
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,000
Sometimes he's cold,

616
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,720
and sometimes he's just too nice.

617
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,240
He says things

618
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,360
that confuse you

619
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,280
and get you unsettled.

620
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,120
And then he pretends
nothing has ever happened

621
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,360
and make you disappointed.

622
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,360
If you like someone,

623
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,880
would you do that?

624
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,520
He might,

625
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,080
probably,

626
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,640
must like you.

627
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,840
Or why has he done
so many things for you?

628
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,960
The capital of the teahouse.

629
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,360
The house.

630
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,960
And Yinzhang joining the Music Division.

631
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,680
That's like what

632
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,680
Zifang told me,

633
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,400
"Love me, love my dog".

634
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,320
It's love.

635
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,160
That's what upsets me.

636
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,840
When we were in Qiantang,

637
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,040
quite a lot of people liked me.

638
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,200
If he

639
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,800
has no feelings for me at all,

640
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,160
I can pretend nothing ever happened.

641
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,400
But I don't know how he feels.

642
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,880
I always remind myself,

643
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,840
people should know themselves.

644
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,880
Ouyang Xu

645
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,000
passed the Imperial Examination

646
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,400
and abandoned me.

647
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,640
Gu Qianfan is

648
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,960
a Vice Commissioner
of the Capital Security Office.

649
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,480
How could he have no idea
about the gap between us?

650
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,920
I'm really afraid, Sanniang.

651
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,840
I'm used to him taking care of me.

652
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,040
I'm afraid that my heart

653
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,360
is titillated by him.

654
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,160
And one day,

655
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,960
when he waves to me,

656
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,560
I'll come to him without knowing it.

657
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,560
And just like

658
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,280
the other girls,

659
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,320
love fades as I grow old.

660
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,200
And he will say to me,

661
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,120
I was just pitying you.

662
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,000
Gu Qianfan

663
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,000
won't do that.

664
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,160
I've learnt enough from Ouyang Xu.

665
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,200
So I told Yinzhang

666
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,760
that a girl should depend on herself.

667
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,840
If you want to rely on others,

668
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,800
you get weaknesses.

669
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,360
So I was upset.

670
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,200
And I decided

671
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,640
to open the teahouse

672
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,000
to pay him back.

673
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,960
I have no idea what I'm talking about.

674
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,920
Pan'er, you're right.

675
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,710
Trust yourself.

676
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,600
Promise me.

677
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,400
Remind me

678
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,560
to calm down whatever happens.

679
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,150
I can't let him despise me.

680
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,920
I can't despise myself.

681
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,080
In this world,

682
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,040
no one

683
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,600
can despise us.

684
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,760
Don't take a record tonight.

685
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,960
I want to

686
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,920
find out the subordinates
of the West Xia spy.

687
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,600
If Commissioner asked,

688
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,160
you can say…

689
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,000
Rest assured, Boss.

690
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,120
I'm very smart.

691
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,280
I'll make up a perfect story

692
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,440
in front of Commissioner.

693
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,640
Smart people die young.

694
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,640
But smart and lovely people

695
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,880
like me live a long life.

696
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
Are you lovely?

697
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,840
Of course.

698
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,760
Especially with women.

699
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,680
Because

700
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,080
I grew up among women.

701
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,040
I know them.

702
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,120
Sanniang

703
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,280
even takes me as her brother.

704
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,560
OK.

705
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,120
Let me ask you.

706
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,440
If a woman

707
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,400
gets along well with you,

708
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,000
but suddenly she gets mad.

709
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,280
You ask her the reason,

710
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,320
but she just won't tell you.

711
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,400
Why is that?

712
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,840
How's your relationship with her?

713
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,840
Not very close.

714
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,920
Just friends.

715
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,000
That's normal.

716
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,960
Women

717
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,080
always get mad
for a couple of days every month.

718
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,400
Or she deliberately gets mad

719
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,840
to let you know she's unhappy

720
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,200
so that you can comfort her.

721
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,800
But let me tell you, Boss.

722
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,080
You mustn't let her affect you.

723
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,480
Don't be fooled by her.

724
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:36,960
Oh, right, Boss.

725
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,080
Well,

726
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,600
Pan'er's Fei-qian has been found.

727
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,840
I'm afraid that the yard is not safe,

728
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,680
so I exchanged them into coppers

729
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,720
and put them in your mansion.

730
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,080
You can deliver it to her
in your spare time.

731
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,480
OK. Got it.

732
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,220
(Xiao's Mansion)

733
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,240
(Xiao's Mansion)
(The edict of Father coming back to the capital)

734
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,920
will be issued.

735
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,160
(Xiao Wei)
If the mansion

736
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,560
is not cleaned up as I ordered

737
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,760
before he comes back,

738
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,560
you'll end up being like him.

739
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,260
(Yu Zhongquan,
Officer of Capital Security Office)

740
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,180
(Capital Security Office)

741
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,280
Capital Security Office.

742
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,980
(Half-hidden)

743
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,920
(Half-hidden)
Ms. Zhao.

744
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,360
You have to let me

745
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,440
hear Miss Song's music

746
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,840
anyway today.

747
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,480
I'll buy ten boxes of osmanthus cakes.

748
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
Sorry.

749
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,800
It's our new rule that

750
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,160
each customer can only
buy one box each day.

751
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,360
How can you do that?

752
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,280
That's right.

753
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,880
That's fair.

754
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,400
Sanniang.

755
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,240
Give me a cup of Shuangjing Tea.

756
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:08,960
OK.

757
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,440
Cui, a cup of Shuangjing Tea.

758
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,200
And a box of osmanthus cakes.

759
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,880
We've run out of perilla.

760
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,000
I've asked someone to buy some

761
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,480
in the pharmacy.

762
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,160
They offered credit

763
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,440
and asked us to pay back
at the end of the month.

764
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,880
OK, I'll have it recorded.

765
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,800
Do it then.

766
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,320
OK.

767
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,440
Cui.

768
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,600
It's done.

769
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,760
What do we need apart from perilla?

770
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,080
Check it.

771
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,560
What?

772
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,920
I knocked over a cup of tea

773
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,560
by accident.

774
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,680
It's all wet.

775
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,640
It's pretty normal when you're busy.

776
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,160
It's OK.

777
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,920
Don't worry.

778
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,640
Let's dry them in the yard later.

779
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,560
It's OK.

780
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,320
It's OK.

781
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,680
I'll get back to work.

782
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,960
Ms. Zhao.

783
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,840
When can we go upstairs
and listen to the music?

784
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,040
Now.

785
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,160
Let's go.

786
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,080
Please.

787
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,200
Greetings, sir.

788
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,680
Is he really my father's man?

789
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,600
I dare not say.

790
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,280
Minister Xiao treats Gu Qianfan so well.

791
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,240
He almost ruined

792
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,280
Capital Security Office for him.

793
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,080
I'm doing this
for you and your father's sake.

794
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,640
You just want to defeat him
with my help.

795
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,640
Don't be so pretentious.

796
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,000
I do not get along well with Gu Qianfan.

797
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,640
Now he's close to Minister Xiao,

798
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,680
and even Commissioner Lei
dares not offend him.

799
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,560
My life has been
really hard in the Office.

800
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,800
But in fact,

801
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,040
I have figured out the plan
to deal with him.

802
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,520
It's just…

803
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,640
You're afraid that you can't
defeat him once and for all,

804
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,000
and he'll take revenge
with my father's help.

805
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,680
You're right, sir.

806
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,520
Why should I help you

807
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,160
and offend my father?

808
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,240
Minister Xiao is blinded

809
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,280
by the evil person for the moment.

810
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,240
But he's the minister anyway.

811
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,800
He can't

812
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,920
let it be accused

813
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,840
by the clear officers.

814
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,720
Let's just kill Gu Qianfan

815
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,120
before Minister comes back.

816
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,480
Anyway,

817
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,040
officers of the Capital Security Office
risk their lives all the time.

818
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,760
Even if he's killed,

819
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,480
Minister Xiao won't suspect.

820
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,800
Besides, I've heard that

821
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,960
your three little brothers

822
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,120
are unsettled.

823
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,280
You're the oldest son of the Xiaos.

824
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,000
If anything happens,

825
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,120
someone else

826
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,440
will be the heir of your family.

827
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,960
If you can help me,

828
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,880
the Capital Security Office

829
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,240
will help you later as well.

830
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,920
What do you want me to do?

831
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,640
I've found Gu Qianfan's weakness.

832
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,040
I'll take action against him.

833
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,480
When he's in my hands,

834
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,200
please tell Commissioner

835
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,760
and let him believe that

836
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,720
Minister Xiao is sick of Gu Qianfan.

837
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,600
Don't worry.

838
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,560
Our Commissioner is smart.

839
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,320
You're the oldest son of the Xiaos.

840
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,640
Even if he knows about the truth later,

841
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,040
he won't dare to offend you.

842
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,040
You can go now.

843
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,920
Good.

844
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,000
How's it?

845
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,680
Good.

846
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,520
Good.

847
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,680
Mr. Tuntian.

848
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,600
I know you are not only
proficient in music,

849
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,040
but also know epigraphy.

850
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,480
I want to consult you on something.

851
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,680
Don't be a stranger, Ms. Zhao.

852
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,720
Spare the courtesy.

853
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,240
Just ask me.

854
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,600
Well…

855
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,040
We've been waiting for a long time

856
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,480
only to catch a woman?

857
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,880
What do you know?

858
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,320
There are a group of scholars

859
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,440
and some officers inside.

860
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,080
It will be improper to take action now.

861
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,680
Gu Qianfan has been fooled by me

862
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,760
and went to Xiangfu County.

863
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,680
He won't be back before sunrise.

864
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,160
(Half-hidden)

865
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,360
(Half-hidden)
Miss, check out.

866
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:52,840
Thank you.

867
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,040
Go.

868
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,240
We can act now.

869
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,280
Remember,

870
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,000
the woman surnamed Sun
is good at martial arts.

871
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,200
We must control her first.

872
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,320
Be quick

873
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,600
and quiet.

874
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,700
(Half-hidden)

875
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,160
Who are you?

876
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,640
Under the command
of the Capital Security Office,

877
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,320
we're here to arrest the spies.

878
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,240
