00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,700
=Episode 39=

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,200
Oh, no.

18
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,920
The Empress won't let us go.

19
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,480
Perhaps she will.

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,640
She's extremely powerful.

21
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,880
But I know her weakness.

22
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,760
If we fight desperately,

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,240
we may stand a chance of survival.

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,800
But how?

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,480
According to Xiao Wei,

26
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,840
the more people are around me,

27
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,480
the less they dare to kill me.

28
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,600
Are you okay, Pan'er?

29
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,720
I'm fine. Thank you.

30
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,960
I'm so mad at you!

31
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,360
How dare you break into His Majesty's chamber
and make personal political comments.

32
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,160
I…

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,480
The trouble was made.

34
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,120
It won't change the fact
even if you beat me to death.

35
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,920
Hui, are you out of your mind?

36
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,440
Why would you infuriate His Majesty

37
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,840
for a manager of a restaurant?

38
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,200
You're besties, huh?

39
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,960
You've only known her for days.

40
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,520
I really see her as a good friend.

41
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,080
When I was desperate,

42
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,040
she offered me help

43
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,400
without saying a word.

44
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,440
So I must pay back her kindness.

45
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,840
And this is the only thing
that I can do for her.

46
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,840
(Pan'er is a lady.)

47
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,560
(She came here all alone
and has no one to rely on.)

48
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,040
(It's really hard for her)

49
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,440
(to run the restaurant so well.)

50
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,080
(Her Majesty can rely on
no one, but you,)

51
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,960
(in the Imperial Palace.)

52
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,400
(Are you under someone's shelter now?)

53
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,680
(I used to, but not anymore now.)

54
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,040
(That person must be a rogue.)

55
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,160
(Maybe.)

56
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,920
(But he was really nice to me.)

57
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,560
(At least, he didn't mind
I was once a pariah.)

58
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,520
(He wanted to marry me legally.)

59
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,360
(So I never really hate him.)

60
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,600
Pass my order. Xiao Qinyan is
to attend the morning court tomorrow.

61
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,800
Gu Qianfan is to be released

62
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,880
and reinstated to his former position.

63
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,200
Aye.

64
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,320
Commissioner Gu.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,160
I was only doing my job.

66
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,680
My apologies.

67
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,560
We both work for the imperial court.

68
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,280
I won't hold a grudge.

69
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,520
Commissioner Gu,

70
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,440
here's some wonder medicine,

71
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,720
it works well on ear diseases.

72
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,640
Pan'er.

73
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,920
Pan'er.

74
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,760
This dish

75
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,200
is Sanniang's new creation

76
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,000
called Dripping Green.

77
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,440
It's good. Try it.

78
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,600
Wooden Head?

79
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,520
Wooden Head, when did they free you?

80
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,240
Where's Pan'er?

81
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,400
Pan'er...

82
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,800
She's gone to Kaifeng Prefecture.

83
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
I said, she's gone to Kaifeng Prefecture

84
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,880
to sue Ouyang Xu for breaking off
their engagement.

85
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
Are you deaf?

86
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,320
What's wrong with his ears?

87
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,240
Wooden Head? Wooden Head?

88
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,560
Sorry.

89
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,560
Only by making it big

90
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,080
will Ouyang Xu's reputation be ruined,

91
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,880
so he and the one behind him

92
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,040
won't set me and Qianfan up again.

93
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,590
(Kaifeng Prefecture)

94
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,120
(Kaifeng Prefecture)
The more suspicious Ouyang Xu appears,

95
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,920
(Kaifeng Prefecture)
His Majesty will suspect Qianfan less.

96
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,080
But I'm afraid
that you'll be dragged into this.

97
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,280
We're sisters.

98
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,640
Don't say something like that.

99
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,720
They won't have any concerns

100
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,840
if only a handful of people
know about it.

101
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,720
Just file the lawsuit.

102
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,360
I've finished the pipa piece.

103
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,720
Within three days,

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,400
everybody in the Eastern Capital

105
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,880
will learn about Ouyang Xu's
unfaithful behaviors.

106
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,100
(Kaifeng Prefecture)

107
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,280
I, Zhao Pan'er,
manager of Yong'an Restaurant,

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,160
would like to sue Ouyang Xu,
Controller-general of Xinzhou,

109
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,800
(Plaintiff Zhao Pan'er, Address: Eastern Capital)
for breaking off the engagement,

110
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,280
and his retaliative defamation after failing
to degrade his legal wife to a concubine.

111
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,920
But we only have the evidence

112
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,960
of him breaking off the engagement.

113
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,160
What about his retaliative defamation?

114
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,960
Relax.

115
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,760
Mr. Chi interrogated

116
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,080
those ruffians who made trouble again

117
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,880
last night.

118
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,000
We have acquired the fingerprints

119
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,480
of those who admitted

120
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,120
that Ouyang Xu's valet
paid them to do it.

121
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,880
Pan'er has the statement.

122
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,640
Zhao Pan'er was here last night?

123
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,440
It's not a small matter.
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

124
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
She came at midnight.

125
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,920
And the officers were sent

126
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,240
by the Court of Judicial Review.

127
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,360
Even if I wanted to deliver a message,

128
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,520
I didn't have a way.

129
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,160
Please let the Empress know at once

130
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,720
and come up with an idea
against Zhao Pan'er,

131
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,320
otherwise, this woman…

132
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,200
Mr. Ouyang, you're summoned
by Kaifeng Prefecture.

133
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,840
Mr. Ouyang, here's the subpoena.

134
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,580
(Ouyang's Mansion)

135
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,720
Zhao Pan'er is suing me for
breaking off the engagement?

136
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,440
What to do?

137
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,400
Zhao Pan'er wishes to make

138
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,920
a big deal out of it,

139
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,880
so we will have concerns.

140
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,200
Once she wins the case,

141
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,560
my reputation is ruined.

142
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,680
And when the Court of Judicial Review
hears Qi Mu's case,

143
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,360
they won't believe my testimony.

144
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,160
You said

145
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,880
you had disposed of all the paperwork

146
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,080
about your engagement

147
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,280
at the time, didn't you?

148
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,480
She is now suing me.

149
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,920
It means she has other evidence

150
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,960
that I don't know about.

151
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,440
After all, I was with her
for three years.

152
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,480
Fear not.

153
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
Let her file the lawsuit.

154
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,280
But will she necessarily win?

155
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,200
I'll have my men tell Kaifeng Prefecture
you're the victim in a case

156
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,720
that the Court of Judicial Review
is dealing with,

157
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,320
so there cannot be an open trial.

158
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,320
You answer the summoning,

159
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,480
and I'll go with you.

160
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,640
Once we find out what Zhao Pan'er
has got in hand,

161
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,920
we'll just wing it.

162
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,760
Ms. Zhao from Yong'an Restaurant

163
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,160
sues the new Third Graduate
for breaking off their engagement?

164
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,720
What I have heard is,

165
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,560
she's going to marry Commissioner Gu.

166
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,920
Me too.

167
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,880
Isn't Mr. Ouyang

168
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,200
Inspector Gao's son-in-law?

169
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,360
Go. Get out of here.

170
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,640
There won't be an open trial.

171
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,240
Go.

172
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,560
Chief.

173
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,240
Chief, no.

174
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,400
Once the door of Kaifeng Prefecture
is closed,

175
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,360
it won't open for non-staff.

176
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,960
You just got out of jail,

177
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,200
don't try to start another turmoil.

178
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,880
Ouyang Xu wants her dead.

179
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,120
How can I not be anxious?

180
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,360
Chief.

181
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,400
The trial begins.

182
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,080
Silence.

183
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
Why isn't it an open trial?

184
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,000
It isn't fair.

185
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,000
Who speaks down there?

186
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,440
What's your complaint?

187
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,920
I'm Zhao Pan'er.

188
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,240
I wish to sue Ouyang Xu,
Controller-general of Xinzhou,

189
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,280
for breaking off the engagement

190
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,240
and his retaliative defamation after failing
to degrade his legal wife to a concubine.

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,280
I have the plaint paper,

192
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,280
witnesses, and evidence with me.

193
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,640
Mr. Ouyang, what is your justification?

194
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,520
Your Honor.

195
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,920
I have nothing to say.

196
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,080
So you acknowledge
that Ms. Zhao speaks the truth?

197
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,040
No.

198
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,160
I don't justify myself

199
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,760
because I think

200
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,520
Ms. Zhao has no right

201
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,280
to sue me today.

202
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,240
Please review the law.

203
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,000
Ms. Zhao is from Qiantang,

204
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,720
and since I was ordered
to leave the capital city,

205
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,720
my position is registered in Xinzhou.

206
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,040
Kaifeng Prefecture shouldn't
even accept the case.

207
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,520
Nonsense.

208
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,080
We're now in the Eastern Capital,

209
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,520
so we are under
Kaifeng Prefecture's jurisdiction.

210
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,280
If when two outlanders
have an argument in the Eastern Capital,

211
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,440
do you mean Kaifeng Prefecture
has no right to hear this case?

212
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,360
If it's a theft case or a dispute,

213
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,640
Kaifeng Prefecture will hear the case,

214
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,160
but if it's a matrimonial litigation,

215
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,960
Qiantang County or Xinzhou

216
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,240
has the right to hear the case.

217
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,240
Your Honor, you know the laws well.

218
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,960
I'm sure you know
that I'm stating the fact.

219
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,080
Ms. Zhao, is it true

220
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,480
that you haven't lived
in the Eastern Capital for over a year?

221
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
Your Honor…

222
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,840
Yes or no?

223
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,480
No, I haven't.

224
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,200
Your so-called engagement

225
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,360
was agreed upon
in Qiantang County, right?

226
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,480
But he defamed me
and broke off our engagement.

227
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,040
Yes, we can prove
that he broke off the engagement.

228
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,120
Yes, we can prove that.

229
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,520
Silence.

230
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,840
Ms. Zhao, this case is indeed beyond
Kaifeng Prefecture's scope of jurisdiction.

231
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,680
I will return the paper to you.

232
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,160
File the lawsuit at home.

233
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,440
A fair verdict, Your Honor.

234
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,920
Your Honor.

235
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,080
Mr. Ouyang came out already.

236
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,480
Most likely, Ms. Zhao has lost the case.

237
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,800
So it was a false charge.

238
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,080
I knew it.

239
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,200
Why would

240
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,080
the refined Third Graduate

241
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,960
marry a woman who runs a restaurant?

242
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,240
Every restaurant and teahouse knows

243
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,480
that Ms. Zhao

244
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,360
- used to work in a brothel in Qiantang.
- Pan'er.

245
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,360
In that case,

246
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,440
she's not clean.

247
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,240
Who's not clean, huh?

248
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,920
I dare you repeat what you said.

249
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,040
Here.

250
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,760
You're out of jail now.

251
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,080
How are your ears?

252
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,840
They're fine.

253
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,120
The doctor said

254
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,280
my cochleae weren't damaged.

255
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,560
After a few days of recuperation,

256
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,480
I'll be fine.

257
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,160
Ouyang Xu did this to you.

258
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,320
I must see him convicted.

259
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,240
Pan'er, calm down.

260
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,000
Gu Qianfan is fine now.

261
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,920
It's meaningless
that you sue Ouyang Xu now.

262
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,040
It is meaningful, actually.

263
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,560
You heard what they said about us.

264
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,400
We are women,
and we are of pariah status,

265
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,520
so they are on Ouyang Xu's side

266
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,240
regardless of the truth.

267
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,240
Even if we're much more capable

268
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
or kinder than them,

269
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,120
in their eyes,

270
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,440
we are women who are rotten inside.

271
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,680
My original purpose
was to protect myself

272
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
and to rescue Qianfan.

273
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,920
But now, the purpose of the litigation

274
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,080
is to clear our names.

275
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,960
I swear he'll be convicted.

276
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,960
Pan'er.

277
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,640
I believe and support you.

278
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,640
Chief.

279
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
The Empress is behind Ouyang Xu's back.

280
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
If you're determined to do this,

281
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,880
it's declaration of war on her.

282
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,880
Now I'm reinstated,

283
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
but why hasn't His Majesty

284
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,200
summoned me?

285
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,080
It's because he's still
suspicious of me.

286
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,680
Pan'er is right.

287
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,800
Only by proving that Ouyang Xu

288
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,520
is an unfaithful man

289
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,760
at this point

290
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,960
will His Majesty's suspicion of us

291
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,240
be dispelled,

292
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,040
and the Empress will think twice

293
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,640
before she makes any move against us.

294
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,200
But…

295
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,960
There's no but.

296
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,680
I'm a man.

297
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,840
In order to save me,

298
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,640
Pan'er risked her life filing
the lawsuit to Kaifeng Prefecture,

299
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,440
why won't I be at her side

300
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,120
come hell or high water?

301
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,320
Pan'er,

302
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,120
if our plaint paper won't be accepted
in the Eastern Capital,

303
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,120
we'll just go back to Qiantang.

304
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,320
We'll sue him there.

305
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,040
Ms. Zhao.

306
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,120
Ms. Zhao.

307
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,520
There is one place
in the Eastern Capital

308
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,720
that will accept your case.

309
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,720
But it may be difficult.

310
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,320
I remember

311
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,240
(Public Petitioners Drum Office)
His Majesty ordered in Jingde's Reign

312
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,711
(Public Petitioners Drum Office)
to place a Public Petitioners Drum

313
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:11,960
(Public Petitioners Drum Office)
outside the Main Gate of the Eastern Capital.

314
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,160
Every aggrieved man is allowed

315
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,080
to appeal to the Emperor directly.

316
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,440
A case can reach His Majesty?

317
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,960
How come I never heard of it?

318
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,280
There's a law.

319
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,680
The Public Petitioners Drum Office

320
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,360
only accepts serious cases like
bribery-taking, blackmailing, or murder.

321
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,280
For other cases,

322
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,080
they need to be appealed to courts
from county to prefecture level.

323
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,520
Otherwise, it's regarded
as bypassing immediate authority.

324
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,160
What is that sound?

325
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,960
Your Majesty,
it's the Public Petitioners Drum.

326
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,320
It's been years since anyone
beat the drum.

327
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,120
It's…

328
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,760
Who's beating the drum?

329
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,920
I'm Zhao Pan'er.

330
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,560
I wish to sue Ouyang Xu,
Controller-general of Xinzhou,

331
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
for breaking off the engagement.

332
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,480
He held a grudge after failing

333
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,200
to degrade his legal wife
to a concubine.

334
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,280
He defamed me

335
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,720
and retaliated against me.

336
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,920
I'm from Qiantang,

337
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,360
and I haven't lived
in the Eastern Capital for over a year,

338
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,520
so Kaifeng Prefecture
won't accept my case.

339
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,000
But I have learnt
that I can have justice

340
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,760
by hitting the Public Petitioners Drum.

341
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,320
So here I am.

342
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,640
Zhao Pan'er, are you aware

343
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,680
that your case
is neither bribery-taking,

344
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,720
nor blackmailing nor murder?

345
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,720
It's bypassing the immediate authority.

346
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,120
I am aware.

347
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,680
I'm willing to take 20 floggings

348
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,040
as the law says.

349
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,840
But still, I must sue Ouyang Xu.

350
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,000
Do you know that according to the law,

351
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,120
even if you win the case,

352
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,920
the fiancé won't be punished.

353
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,200
He will be ordered
to return the dowry to you.

354
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,920
Are you still willing

355
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,920
to take the 20 floggings?

356
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,280
Yes, I am.

357
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,560
Why?

358
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,560
Because what's wrong is wrong,

359
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,280
and what's right is right.

360
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,400
Your Honor,

361
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,080
there's the law of Eight Exceptions,

362
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,480
meaning if high-ranking officials
or nobles break the laws,

363
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,200
they shall be exempted
from punishments.

364
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,960
But does this

365
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,000
prove that they're innocent?

366
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,840
That's why even though
I'm aware of the result,

367
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,880
and the fact that I'll be flogged,

368
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,480
I would still like to prove

369
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,920
that I'm not an indecent woman

370
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,440
and that Ouyang Xu

371
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,160
is an immoral, vicious hypocrite.

372
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,800
In that case,

373
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,960
your wish shall be met.

374
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,640
Controller-general Ouyang Xu of Xinzhou
is to attend the trial tomorrow.

375
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,760
Zhao Pan'er and Ouyang Xu
were once engaged?

376
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,160
And Zhao Pan'er beat
the Public Petitioners Drum?

377
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

378
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,440
She has ill intentions.

379
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,680
Your Majesty,
the Court of Judicial Review

380
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,560
has found out that the one

381
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,120
who tried to harm Ouyang Xu was
most likely Qi Mu instead of Xiao Qinyan.

382
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,920
Now that the trial draws near,

383
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,840
Zhao Pan'er crops up
and sues Ouyang Xu.

384
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,080
What's the meaning of this?

385
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,200
She's been in the Eastern Capital
for a while.

386
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,120
And she has to sue him

387
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,800
at this very moment.

388
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,680
It's obvious that she wishes
to discredit Ouyang Xu

389
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,640
so the Court of Judicial Review

390
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,640
won't believe his testimony
against Qi Mu.

391
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,640
I can't believe these Scholar Ministers

392
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,000
claim that Xiao Qinyan
colluded with Gu Qianfan.

393
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,200
In my opinion,

394
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,640
they are the ones
who bought Gu Qianfan off.

395
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,520
Otherwise, why would Gu Qianfan

396
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,880
have Zhao Pan'er sue Ouyang Xu
right after he got out of jail?

397
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,080
She didn't give up
and beat the Public Petitioners Drum

398
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,000
even after Kaifeng Prefecture
rejected her case.

399
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,480
Your Majesty, I put up
with the Scholar Ministers,

400
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,480
and I remained silent.

401
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,040
But now, I can't take it anymore.

402
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,240
How much longer will the tumult

403
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,280
caused by the fake painting last?

404
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,080
When will those Scholar Ministers

405
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,440
get off my back?

406
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,520
All right.

407
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,640
There, there.

408
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,040
I told you, didn't I?

409
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,640
That I trust you.

410
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,440
I don't care about all the nonsense.

411
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,720
But your rock-hard trust

412
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,560
won't stop the defamation
from attacking me.

413
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,200
Your Majesty, I beg you.

414
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,480
Please ask the Court of Judicial Review

415
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,720
to hold a strict trial for the case

416
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,280
of Qi Mu framing Xiao Qinyan
and harming Ouyang Xu.

417
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,160
OK. OK.

418
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

419
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,360
No problem.

420
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,800
Don't be mad.

421
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,120
Thank you for your help, Your Majesty.

422
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,760
If Zhao Pan'er fails to discredit me,

423
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,280
I will do everything I can

424
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,440
in the Court of Judicial Review

425
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,360
to make sure Qi Mu is convicted.

426
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:21,360
Silence!

427
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,960
Ms. Zhao, are you aware

428
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,880
that to prevent the abuse
of litigation right,

429
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,800
the action of bypassing
the immediate authority

430
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,320
shall receive the punishment of flogging
before the trial begins.

431
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,880
I am aware.

432
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,760
Very well, then.

433
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,520
Let the floggings begin.

434
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,840
Let the floggings commence.

435
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,920
One.

436
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,000
Two.

437
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,440
Three.

438
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,240
Hit her.

439
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,160
Four.

440
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,840
Good one.

441
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,480
Hit her to death.

442
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,480
Five.

443
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,000
Six.

444
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,280
Stop!

445
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,960
- Stop! Stop!
- Let go!

446
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,760
Gu Qianfan.

447
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,920
As a commissioner,

448
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,520
don't you know
that interfering with the court is a felony?

449
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,200
As a judge, don't you know

450
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,800
that it should be posterior flogging

451
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,880
not spine flogging?

452
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,760
Is the purpose
of your increased punishment

453
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,880
to silent her

454
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,360
by beating her to death
right in the court?

455
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,840
Silence!

456
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,240
You have no right to yell at me

457
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,280
or obstruct the execution of punishment
in the court.

458
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,640
What's the purpose
of your abuse of power?

459
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,800
I'm the Commissioner
of the Capital Security Office.

460
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,360
I have the right
to have you arrested right away.

461
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,280
Pull him aside. Continue the flogging.

462
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,720
Hit her! Hit her! Hit her to death!

463
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,520
How dare you?

464
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,040
I'm afraid you're biased, Your Honor.

465
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,800
I'm taking Ms. Zhao back.

466
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,840
The rest 14 floggings can wait

467
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,840
after the truth comes to light.

468
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,520
Bah!

469
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,480
I thought you were
a good official yesterday.

470
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,800
It turns out

471
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,640
that you, too, are rotten inside.

472
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,280
H-How could this happen?

473
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,880
Open the gates.

474
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,160
Move. Move out of the way.

475
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,600
Move!

476
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,520
What?

477
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,380
(Public Petitioners Drum Office)
What happened to her?

478
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,260
(Public Petitioners Drum Office)

479
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,240
W-What happened?

480
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,840
What's wrong?

481
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,800
Someone played a trick.

482
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,080
The judge changed the posterior
floggings to the spine ones.

483
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:12,960
What?

484
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,880
What?

485
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,640
It's…

486
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,120
(Public Petitioners Drum Office)
The spine flogging is as serious

487
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,160
as banishment of 3,000 miles.

488
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:20,840
Yes.

489
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,840
The Public Petitioners Drum Office is…

490
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,960
They're supposed to uphold justice,

491
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,920
but the judge intends
to murder the plaintiff.

492
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,480
Is there justice anymore?

493
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,040
Right.

494
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,615
- Come on, let's make an appeal.
- The Drum Office is unfair,

495
00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:31,560
- Come on, let's make an appeal.
- the imperial court is unfair.

496
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,360
Let's make an appeal.

497
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,530
(Public Petitioners Drum Office)
The Drum Office is unfair,

498
00:30:33,554 --> 00:30:34,960
(Public Petitioners Drum Office)
the imperial court is unfair.

499
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,720
The Drum Office is unfair,
the imperial court is unfair.

500
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,080
Qianfan, I…

501
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,480
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

502
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,960
Take some medicine.

503
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,120
Should we get a doctor here
to perform acupuncture on her?

504
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,600
Acupuncture can wake her up.

505
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,320
Pan'er said previously

506
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,640
that she mustn't fall asleep.

507
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,960
If she's in a coma,

508
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,960
she won't be able to make the appeal
at the Drum Office.

509
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,440
Do your best to take care of her.

510
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,040
I need to go out.

511
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,760
Watch her. I'll go get the doctor.

512
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,920
I have heard

513
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,600
that Ms. Zhao is really tough.

514
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,920
She was determined
to sue her ex-finance

515
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,720
even if she had to be flogged.

516
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,360
Outrageous.

517
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
How dare you maids gossip here?

518
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,280
- Hail, Your Majesty.
- Hail, Your Majesty.

519
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,520
What were you talking about?

520
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,680
Tell me about it.

521
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,920
I heard Matron Wang and the others'

522
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,520
conversation at Anyang Hall.

523
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,600
They talked about the floggings
Ms. Zhao from Yong'an Restaurant had.

524
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,680
And they said

525
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,200
she really lives up to her birth
as the daughter of a general.

526
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,840
She's the daughter of a general?

527
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,080
She's Zhao Qian's daughter.

528
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,160
She's Zhao Qian's daughter?

529
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,720
Yes.

530
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,960
She has an underclass birth.

531
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,280
A refined girl

532
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,440
has to live a life like this.

533
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,080
It's a mistake that I made.

534
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,000
Your Majesty,

535
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,560
all of your orders are fair.

536
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,280
In my opinion,

537
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,840
Ms. Zhao holds no grudge

538
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,800
against you.

539
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,320
(Yong'an Restaurant)
So I'm fine.

540
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,600
May Heaven bless His Majesty.

541
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,600
If it wasn't for his benevolence,

542
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,520
I wouldn't have the opportunity
to come to see the fireworks

543
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,160
and experience the beautiful life
in the Eastern Capital,

544
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,400
(Yong'an Restaurant)
nor would I have this big restaurant.

545
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,080
What's your opinion about Zhao Pan'er?

546
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,040
I-I-I know nothing.

547
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,240
I only envy her.

548
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,400
When my service is over,

549
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,040
I hope I can meet a good man
like Commissioner Gu.

550
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
It'll be worth everything.

551
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,960
I'm surprised

552
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,400
that Gu Qianfan is a good man.

553
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,000
Not only did Commissioner Gu
go to the court with Ms. Zhao,

554
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
he also ended the unfair punishment
in the court.

555
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,160
So of course, he's a good man.

556
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,400
U-Unfair punishment?

557
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,320
Unbelievable.
This is utterly unbelievable!

558
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,630
You're the Empress.

559
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,440
How can you break the law?

560
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,520
It's widely spread outside the palace.

561
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,400
The Drum Office is unfair,
the imperial court is unfair.

562
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,710
If you think I made a mistake,

563
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,710
just sentence me.

564
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:41,230
Your Majesty, I have served you
for over a decade,

565
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,480
and I have been sincere and meticulous

566
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,560
all the time.

567
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,630
But ever since you made me the Empress,

568
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,150
those Scholar Ministers

569
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:54,040
have never stopped attacking me,

570
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,040
calling me a seductress,

571
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,160
and a woman of lowly birth.

572
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,720
Did I ever show my displeasure?

573
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,200
Did I ever try to justify myself?

574
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,960
I'm expecting

575
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,200
the one who wants me dead
to be brought to justice,

576
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,320
I don't want any uncertainty
at the moment.

577
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,600
Is that a mistake?

578
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,760
But the "uncertainty"
you would like to erase

579
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,600
is a living person.

580
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,960
Wanwan, don't you know

581
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,560
why I'm mad?

582
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,320
You can't give birth,

583
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,520
I gave you a baby with another woman.

584
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,560
You want power,

585
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,680
I never appointed a crown prince.

586
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,360
What makes me sad is,

587
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,560
I treat you with sincerity

588
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,960
while you respond to me with lies.

589
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,320
Have you been secretly sulking over

590
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,520
my decision

591
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,600
of locking up Gu Qianfan

592
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,200
but letting Zhao Pan'er off?

593
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,200
You think my love shifted

594
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,640
after I visited Yong'an Restaurant?

595
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,840
My love.

596
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,520
She's a Zhao,

597
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,360
a girl at the age of my daughter
if I had one, and a member of my clan.

598
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,640
When I see her,

599
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,080
I only feel we're close.

600
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,280
Strictness and leniency
are equally important in statecraft.

601
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,200
Do you think

602
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,960
I'm so broad-minded

603
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,880
that when Ke Zheng spat on my face,

604
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,400
I enjoyed it?

605
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,600
No.

606
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,320
Father taught me,

607
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,080
as an emperor, I mustn't act on will.

608
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,120
I am to be reasonable
and value public opinions.

609
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,360
Arise.

610
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,200
Arise.

611
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,160
Wanwan.

612
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,600
You said Qi Mu tried to frame you
with the fake painting,

613
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,800
I believed you.

614
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,240
You were once married to someone else,

615
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,080
I don't feel good about it.

616
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,600
But I control myself as hard as I can

617
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:46,960
in case you're displeased.

618
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,000
But you adopted a crooked method.

619
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,240
Even if Zhao Pan'er was beaten to death,

620
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,840
would Ouyang Xu's reputation

621
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,400
not be ruined?

622
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,080
Would the Court of Judicial Review

623
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,960
believe Ouyang Xu's words

624
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,480
and convict Qi Mu
because he deserves it

625
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,960
instead of your illicit arrangement?

626
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,920
Would the citizens out there
believe that?

627
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,560
I…

628
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,080
That's all I have to say.

629
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,800
You think it over.

630
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,360
Who is it?

631
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,200
Gu Qianfan, Commissioner
of the Capital Security Office.

632
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,520
Hail, Your Majesty.

633
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,000
Gu Qianfan,

634
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,600
do you know
you'll receive a death sentence

635
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,960
for breaking into my chamber at night?

636
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,680
Yes, I do.

637
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,160
Your Majesty.

638
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,640
My surname is Gu,

639
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,840
but I'm not Xiao Qinyan's nephew.

640
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,960
I'm his son.

641
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,160
My parents were divorced
when I was young.

642
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,520
I was raised in my uncle's house.

643
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,440
Qi Mu, the former Vice Censor-in-chief
knew about my story,

644
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,160
tricked me into joining
the Capital Security Office

645
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,200
with the purpose of me gathering
information inside the palace for him

646
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,440
to bring Xiao Qinyan down.

647
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,400
I, however, still love my father,

648
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,400
so I helped him from time to time.

649
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,560
At the end of last year,

650
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,880
I was ordered to investigate
the defamation of you.

651
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,880
I learnt that The Night Revels was
hidden in Yang's Mansion,

652
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,240
so I went to Qiantang

653
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,040
in an attempt to destroy the painting.

654
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,680
Unexpectedly, I met Zhao Pan'er,
the original owner of the painting.

655
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,160
Your Majesty, you support Ouyang Xu

656
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,080
because you need him
to bring Qi Mu down.

657
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,240
But I have much more secrets

658
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,720
about all these officials
than Ouyang Xu does.

659
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:27,960
Now,

660
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,920
I have told you all about my secret.

661
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,880
It can be a tool for you to control me.

662
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,240
If you give me an order,

663
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,320
I shall obey with full allegiance.

664
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,080
I only hope you show mercy

665
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,440
and let my wife Zhao Pan'er live.

666
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,880
OK. I appreciate
your straightforwardness.

667
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,720
Now that you have pledged
your allegiance to me,

668
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,520
I won't give Zhao Pan'er
a hard time anymore.

669
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,960
Here's what you are going to do.

670
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,400
You will ask Zhao Pan'er to cancel
the case at the Drum Office tomorrow.

671
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,400
When Qi Mu's trial is over,

672
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,840
I will let you have Ouyang Xu.

673
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,640
Then you can do
whatever you want with him.

674
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,480
Neither I nor Pan'er
will drop the lawsuit.

675
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,240
Why?

676
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,120
We're determined
to bring Ouyang Xu to justice,

677
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,840
and to clear Pan'er's name

678
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,280
through the case.

679
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,480
Ridiculous.

680
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,120
Well then.
Don't blame me for not helping you.
