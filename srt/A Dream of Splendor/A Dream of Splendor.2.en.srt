=Episode 2=

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,120
Mr. Yang,

18
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,480
this is a fake painting.

19
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,000
It's impossible.

20
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,240
Well,

21
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,520
there is also the seal of the painter,

22
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,800
Master Wang Ai.

23
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,760
You!

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,000
Where is the real painting?

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,320
Speak!

26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,280
The rain.

27
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:14,840
The snake.

28
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,280
The cloud pattern.

29
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,000
The Imperial Guards.

30
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,680
Master!

31
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,520
- Honey, stop looking.
- What should we do?

32
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,000
Go hide, hurry!

33
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,960
What should we do?

34
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,320
It's toxic. Be careful.

35
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,040
Save me.

36
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,880
There is poison on the dart.

37
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,320
If you don't save me,

38
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,800
you're also going to die.

39
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,160
Burn it!

40
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,800
Keep no one alive!

41
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,000
There's a pond in the backyard.

42
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,480
Run with me if you don't want to die.

43
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,880
Honey!

44
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,880
It looks like

45
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,840
the fire started from the woodshed.

46
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,760
Everyone in the mansion died.

47
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,880
Let's go. Hurry.

48
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,600
Come on.

49
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,600
Can you give me the cure now?

50
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,600
Why aren't you poisoned?

51
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
I saw one of your guys yelling outside.

52
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,640
There happened to be
a water tank next to me.

53
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,320
I dipped my handkerchief
in water to block the smoke.

54
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,040
There aren't so many coincidences.

55
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,040
As a man,

56
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,120
I felt limp

57
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,280
after I inhaled the toxic smoke,

58
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,720
how can you be all right as a woman?

59
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,920
I came to Yang's Mansion today

60
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,440
to ask someone for a favor.

61
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,560
Then I saw you break in with your men.

62
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,040
I tried to run but I didn't make it.

63
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,280
I'm telling you the truth.

64
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,560
Give me the cure.

65
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,120
I saved your life.

66
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,520
You should also save my life.

67
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,800
Then we're even.

68
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,960
There's no poison on the weapon.

69
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,200
Are you guys not going

70
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,400
to investigate those men in black?

71
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,000
It has nothing to do with you.

72
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,640
Don't tell me
that bureaucrats shield one another

73
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,680
and you're going to let it go.

74
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,640
How much else do you know?

75
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,720
When I came out of the pond,

76
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,360
I saw a footprint this big

77
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,640
on the blue slate.

78
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,560
Only a bureaucrat would wear

79
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,240
shoes with a pattern that.

80
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,840
If it's the Capital Security Office
they're after,

81
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,000
why would they take the trouble
to come to Yang's Mansion?

82
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,200
There's no need

83
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,400
to kill everyone in the Yang family.

84
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,240
In my opinion,

85
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,720
their target should be Mr. Yang.

86
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,640
You got caught up in this

87
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,920
only because of coincidences.

88
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,480
You know where my teahouse is.

89
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,480
If you need me to testify,

90
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
I can be there any time.

91
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,000
Let me say it again,

92
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,080
stay out of this.

93
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,080
Don't regret it at the end of your life.

94
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,150
I'm a person who rarely regrets.

95
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,150
As long as I figure it out,

96
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,320
I'll take it no matter what.

97
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,160
I would hurt you.

98
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,200
I'll bite you if you hurt me!

99
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,180

Uncle De?

104
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,520
(Zhao's Teahouse)
Greetings to Ms. Zhao.

105
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,440
(Closed)
Why are you here?

106
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,720
What happened to you?

107
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,520
Nothing. I fell.

108
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,120
Where is Ouyang?

109
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,920
Is he okay?

110
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
He didn't fail again, did he?

111
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,880
Of course not.

112
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,960
I'm back to bring you the good news.

113
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,280
Appointed by the Emperor
at the Jiying Hall,

114
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,480
Master is the Third Graduate now!

115
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,560
The Third Graduate?

116
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,040
The Third Graduate.

117
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,000
He made it!

118
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
He made it!

119
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,160
Get in here.

120
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,760
(Zhao's Teahouse)
Tell me what happened to him.

121
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,360
Well, he could have just

122
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,600
had you write me a letter,

123
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,880
but he had you travel
thousands of miles to pick me up.

124
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,960
Well, it's true

125
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,880
that he has many books

126
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,760
and boxes.

127
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,840
I can't carry them all on my own.

128
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,000
It would be nice to have your help.

129
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Are we going to the capital

130
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
by water or by land?

131
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,360
No hurry, Ms. Zhao.

132
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,560
Let's take our time.

133
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,640
Master asked me to bring you a word.

134
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,160
He said now that he is an official...

135
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,760
You...

136
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,560
I see. I'll make you a cup of tea.

137
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,160
(Zhao's Teahouse)
Ms. Zhao.

138
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,600
I know what he's worried about.

139
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,800
He thinks

140
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,400
I should be out of business.

141
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,360
The teahouse happened
to have a little incident.

142
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
I'll just close it.

143
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,720
Uncle De, have you had breakfast yet?

144
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,240
No, I have something to tell you.

145
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,200
You...

146
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,240
Pan'er, you're finally back.

147
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,760
I've been worried about you all night.

148
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,400
Uncle De, you're back!

149
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,200
Sanniang.

150
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,960
Ouyang made it.
He is the Third Graduate now.

151
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,080
The Third Graduate?

152
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,200
Congratulations!

153
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Congratulations to the wife
of the Third Graduate!

154
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,760
You'll wear the wedding dress
before I do!

155
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,040
That's great!

156
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,400
Are you leaving for the capital
in a couple of days?

157
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,320
Well, let me help you pack.

158
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,320
Ms. Zhao.

159
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,240
Ms. Sun is no stranger.

160
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,200
I'll just say it.

161
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,640
I'm not here to take you to the capital.

162
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,400
Master was granted a marriage
by Consort Xian.

163
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,000
After the Grain Rain,

164
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,240
he will marry the daughter
of Inspector Gao.

165
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,600
Who is Inspector Gao?

166
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,640
Acting Military Commissioner
of Guangji Army,

167
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,080
Deputy Commander of Infantry, Gao Hu.

168
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,120
Say it again.

169
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,520
Master Ouyang is going
to marry Gao Hu's daughter.

170
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,600
Do you want Pan'er to die?

171
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,440
Master said Ms. Zhao is intelligent.

172
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,520
She will understand
that he has no choice.

173
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,280
Shut up.

174
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,160
Even if it's the consort in the palace,

175
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,760
she shouldn't grant a marriage
that casually.

176
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,040
Did she never ask

177
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
whether Ouyang is engaged?

178
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,560
She did.

179
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,600
But Master and Ms. Zhao

180
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,360
weren't made match by parents' order

181
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,000
or on the matchmaker's word.

182
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,680
Well...

183
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,520
Shut up.

184
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,880
You, Yinzhang,

185
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,200
and the three people in my family

186
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,840
all know the engagement
between Pan'er and Ouyang.

187
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,240
It was only a verbal agreement.

188
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,400
There are no written certificates.

189
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,680
You can't call it an engagement.

190
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,080
A verbal agreement is also an agreement!

191
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,480
Not to mention

192
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,680
Ms. Zhao doesn't have
a decent background.

193
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,040
Bah! Do you have a decent background?

194
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,520
Who are you to say that?

195
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,280
We can get by if no one notices her.

196
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,920
But if Consort Xian finds out

197
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,600
that Master rejected her niece

198
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,640
because of a lowly girl...

199
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
Who are you calling lowly?

200
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,320
You guys are lowly!

201
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,440
I'd throw you in the water

202
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,960
if you weren't this old.

203
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,240
No, I'm gonna throw you
in the water right now!

204
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,760
- To shut your dirty mouth!
- No!

205
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,000
You will get me killed. No!

206
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,880
Sanniang!

207
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,720
No...

208
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,160
Sanniang!

209
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,040
Pan'er, you're awake.

210
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,160
Even the royal family

211
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,640
won't allow a consort
to steal a woman's husband.

212
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,480
When I knew him,

213
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,160
my name had been removed
from the register.

214
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,480
I'm a decent woman now.

215
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,360
Ms. Zhao, why do you have to do this?

216
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,280
Everyone knows

217
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,080
that merchants

218
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,680
are at the bottom of society.

219
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,640
In the eyes of aristocrats,

220
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,160
no matter how wealthy

221
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,040
the merchants are,

222
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,440
they're still lowly people.

223
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,280
I can't believe

224
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,920
you're justifying

225
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,880
a betrayer

226
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,360
who broke the engagement.

227
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,440
Pan'er, let's sue him now.

228
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,040
Ms. Zhao.

229
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,240
Do you want to make a big scene

230
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,520
and let everyone know
you're an official performer?

231
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,600
Stop it.

232
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,480
You know that's
what I care most about, right?

233
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,840
Fine.

234
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,160
I'll accept my fate.

235
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,800
Master knows that he failed you.

236
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,280
Here are 80 taels of gold from him.

237
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,920
You still have

238
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,600
his Truelove Jade Pendant.

239
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,320
When Ouyang

240
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,200
failed the exam
and lived on the streets in Hangzhou,

241
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,800
I bought him a land,

242
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,560
so that he could
finish household registration

243
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,920
and take the examination
in Liangzhe again.

244
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,280
It's a shame

245
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,680
that the three years we spent together

246
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,280
is not even worth

247
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,800
80 taels of gold.

248
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,000
He wants to buy me off with money.

249
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,600
No problem.

250
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,360
Tell him

251
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,920
80 taels of gold are not enough.

252
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
If he wants the Truelove Jade Pendant,

253
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,800
bring me 500 taels of gold.

254
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,720
500 taels?

255
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,560
That's too much.

256
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,520
I'll give him the pendant
after he gives me the money,

257
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,360
then I'll be done with him.

258
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,480
Ms. Zhao. Take care.

259
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,640
Pan'er, let me buy
some medicine for you.

260
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,320
Sanniang.

261
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,640
Close the teahouse.

262
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:07,760
Okay.

263
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:27,340
(Zhao's Teahouse)
(Closed)

264
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,100
(Closed)

265
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,360
(After I pass the Imperial Examination,)

266
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,520
(I'll follow the traditional
marriage rituals and marry you.)

267
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,100
(Xujiang County Government)

268
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,700
(Capital Security Office)

269
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,100
(Qiantang)

270
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,160
Qiantang.

271
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,800
They came prepared.

272
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,640
They want to kill...

273
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,360
Kill you.

274
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,080
Commander. You'd better...

275
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:46,840
You'd better...

276
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,200
Run!

277
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,040
(Coroner.)

278
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,120
(Please come in.)

279
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,080
Capital Security Office?

280
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,000
Yes.

281
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,320
Those eight or seven people
have tattoos on their inner thighs.

282
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,200
The coroner used to work
in the Eastern Capital.

283
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,120
He said it looks like the mark
of the Capital Security Office.

284
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,360
That's a big deal.

285
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,280
Why didn't you say anything last night?

286
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,920
I wanted to report to you
after I found it out.

287
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,880
Why would the Capital Security Office

288
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,880
send so many people to Jiangnan?

289
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,520
Did they also find out about
the Foreign Shipping Bureau

290
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,760
like Yang Zhiyuan did?

291
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,840
No. It's impossible.

292
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,720
They're here
for the augury of the Empress.

293
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,000
It has nothing to do
with the Yang family.

294
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,040
Have you burnt everything
in Yang's study?

295
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
Yes.

296
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,360
I did it in person.

297
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,240
Rest assured.

298
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,880
He hadn't finished his memorial
on your impeachment.

299
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,880
It never made it to court.

300
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,960
Good.

301
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,520
Everyone is dead anyway.

302
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,520
Even if the Capital Security Office's
people come,

303
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,600
the dead can't give witness.

304
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,800
Stick to the original plan

305
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,000
and pass everything

306
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,560
to Yang Zhiyuan's old rival,

307
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,040
Chu, in Ninghai Army.

308
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,480
By the way,

309
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,240
I told you to put the Ninghai Army's
hand knife in Yang's Mansion.

310
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,480
You didn't forget it, did you?

311
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,120
I didn't.

312
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's just

313
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,040
an arrowhead on the body

314
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,080
of a man
from the Capital Security Office

315
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,440
disappeared

316
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,640
two hours ago.

317
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,200
You only told me to change the knife.

318
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,360
I didn't change the arrow.

319
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,520
The arrows were made
by the counties respectively.

320
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,200
They will trace the source
if they investigative it a little bit.

321
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,160
Didn't you say everyone
was killed last night?

322
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,800
Who stole the arrow then?

323
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,960
A ghost?

324
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,080
I'm guilty! Mercy, Your Honor!

325
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,800
If it's discovered,

326
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,600
everyone in our clans
will be implicated.

327
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,320
We must find out

328
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,920
who stole the arrow.

329
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,640
By the way, I think
a man escaped last night.

330
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:56,320
I heard someone call him "Commander".

331
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,320
A commander
of the Capital Security Office?

332
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,640
It has only been two hours.
He mustn't have gone far.

333
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,520
Give the order

334
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,200
that there might be a pirate
who broke into Yang's Mansion last night,

335
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,240
looting money and setting fires.

336
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,800
Strict scrutiny must be done
at every pass in every county.

337
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,720
Aye.

338
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,640
Find someone to paint a portrait of him.

339
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,760
Issue an arrest warrant.

340
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,760
Any men with a non-local accent

341
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,440
should be arrested and examined.

342
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,280
Aye.

343
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,160
And also,

344
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,040
kill anyone

345
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,960
who resists.

346
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,160
Yes.

347
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,880
I thought about it for a long time
after you two left.

348
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,880
Ouyang and I have been together
for three years.

349
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,440
He is not an unfaithful man.

350
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
Even if he has to marry someone else,

351
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,240
with his character,

352
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,080
he would at least write me a letter

353
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,360
and explain everything,

354
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,680
instead of asking someone else
to send me a message.

355
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,840
What if someone

356
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,120
is trying to sabotage his career

357
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,760
by putting an unfaithful reputation
on him?

358
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,760
Maybe the Gao family does like Ouyang,

359
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,480
but he turned them down
over and over again.

360
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,680
Then they used a carrot-and-stick method

361
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,200
to Uncle De behind Ouyang's back,

362
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,880
trying to take
the Truelove Jade Pendant from me.

363
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,880
Then they will lie to Ouyang
that I've changed my mind.

364
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,760
The reason I asked for 500 taels of gold

365
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,320
is to stabilize Uncle De
and those around him.

366
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,680
I'm not doing business now.

367
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,880
Uncle De thought I'm too sad

368
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,120
to go out.

369
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,160
He won't suspect anything for a while.

370
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,760
By the way, Sanniang.

371
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,280
I need you to pretend

372
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,520
that you visit me every day.

373
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,520
I'll be in the Eastern Capital

374
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,040
by the time they find it out.

375
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,320
Didn't they say they will get married
after the Grain Rain?

376
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,520
As long as I can see Ouyang before that,

377
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,160
everything will come to light.

378
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,800
What if it's true that Consort Xian
granted him a marriage?

379
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,080
Qiantang is thousands of miles
away from the Eastern Capital.

380
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,800
You're sick now

381
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,680
and you can't even walk steadily.

382
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,920
Are you gonna make it?

383
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,760
That's why I'm taking the boat.

384
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,520
At least I can lie down
and rest on the boat.

385
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,360
Even if I die on the way,

386
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,000
I won't regret it at all.

387
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,920
I just don't believe

388
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,400
I have such a bad taste

389
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,840
in men.

390
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,520
Unless I see him in person,

391
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,640
I won't believe a word

392
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,400
anyone says.

393
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,600
Pan'er, go find him.

394
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,000
I will support you
no matter what decision you make.

395
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,640
I wonder how Yinzhang is doing now.

396
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:01,860
(Wanted)

397
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,740
(Wanted)
Gu Qianfan?

398
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,260
(Wanted)

399
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,740
(Wanted)

400
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,780
(Destiny Temple)

401
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,080
Dear God.

402
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,200
Bless me

403
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,440
to arrive in the Eastern Capital
as soon as possible.

404
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,160
I wish my husband, Ouyang Xu,

405
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,640
is not greedy for money or fame.
I wish he is faithful to me.

406
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,640
I don't want to be
a Presented Scholar's wife.

407
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,160
I just want to grow old together

408
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,400
with the man I love.

409
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,360
Zhao Pan'er.

410
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,960
Gu Qianfan.

411
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,560
Help!

412
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,280
You didn't just skip school,

413
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,840
now you got a grade of C in the exam.

414
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,680
All right. All right.

415
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,480
You even kept it from me!

416
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,760
All right!

417
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,480
Well, isn't there also a grade of D?

418
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,920
He'll do business with me

419
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,640
and make a rise in life.

420
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,040
Make a rise in life?

421
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,960
You know what happened to Pan'er.

422
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,320
In the eyes of the nobles,

423
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,680
we business people
are by nature inferior.

424
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,360
In previous years, our family wasn't
even eligible to take the Imperial Exam.

425
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,480
Finally, the court showed mercy.

426
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,560
Fu Zifang!

427
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,240
He has to study well.

428
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,520
What's wrong with
being official performers?

429
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,400
Why do they have to reform their lives?

430
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,720
Now they are also despised.

431
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,520
Song Yinzhang makes more money
a day as a performer

432
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,520
than I do by selling goods for a month.

433
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,040
Young women can't get married
without dowries.

434
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,560
(Fu Xingui)
Many girls born in poor families

435
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,480
(Fu Xingui)
are willing to make some money first

436
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,440
from working as singing performers

437
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,840
before they find honest men to marry.

438
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,880
It makes sense.

439
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,520
Shut up!

440
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,640
Can private performers

441
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,480
be the same as official performers

442
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,440
who can't be redeemed forever?

443
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,760
I'm disciplining my son.

444
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,640
Can you stop trying to be nice

445
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,480
and causing me trouble?

446
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,440
Zifang's surname is Fu, not Sun!

447
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,040
Why can't I interfere?

448
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,560
Listen,

449
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,560
you can daydream

450
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,960
about wearing fancy dresses

451
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,440
and becoming an official's wife,

452
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,840
just leave me out of this!

453
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,800
And don't wear out my precious son.

454
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,240
Come on, I'll take you
to get some fresh air.

455
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,400
Where are you going?

456
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,160
- None of your business.
- Let's play at the old same place.

457
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,960
You're not allowed to go!

458
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,520
Hurry up.

459
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,200
Run.

460
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,060
(Baisha Ferry)

461
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,150
(Baisha Ferry)
No.

462
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,230
(Baisha Ferry)
There are rules for merchant ships.

463
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,760
It's ominous

464
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,560
to bring a woman.

465
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,680
There are many women
working on boats on this canal.

466
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,720
It's up to you

467
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,400
what the rules are.

468
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,240
Here. Come on.

469
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:25,960
Here.

470
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,880
Not this time.

471
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,880
There was a murder last night.

472
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,280
I heard

473
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,400
a high official died.

474
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,760
The County Magistrate

475
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,560
just had people put up a notice.

476
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,520
All merchant ships

477
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,840
are not allowed to carry outsiders.

478
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,680
I could go to jail

479
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,920
if I get caught.

480
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,160
Mr. Zheng.

481
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,640
You must know a lot of girls
in Xiangyun Pavilion.

482
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,000
I happen to know

483
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,240
quite a few too.

484
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,200
I heard someone

485
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,720
lost 200 strings of coins
gambling last month.

486
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,520
I wonder...

487
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,160
Keep it down!

488
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,360
...if his wife knows it.

489
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,200
I can't

490
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,520
stay in this house anymore.

491
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,960
Your mother

492
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,760
is the daughter of a butcher,

493
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,480
but she has to see herself
as Mencius' mother.

494
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,960
Let me wash your clothes!

495
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,560
Let me wash your clothes!

496
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,360
Come on.

497
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,060
(Baisha Ferry)

498
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,240
Give me a hand.

499
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,080
Okay.

500
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,000
One, two. Go.

501
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,120
Come on.

502
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,600
Slowly.

503
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,880
That's a deal.

504
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:40,920
Watch out.

505
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,760
Anchor up!

506
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,560
Hurry up.

507
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,240
Okay.

508
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,160
Stay safe.

509
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,040
Tie it fast.

510
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,960
Over there.

511
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,080
There are more over there.

512
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,000
Let's go. All right.

513
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,280
Two people carry it together.
Be careful.

514
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,410
No problem!

515
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,360
Come on, put it here.

516
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,080
Okay.

517
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,640
The cut on your shoulder
is bleeding again.

518
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,400
It's your fault.

519
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,680
You hit me with your hidden weapon
in Yang's Mansion.

520
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,240
The wound ruptured again
when I carried the sack.

521
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,160
I'll change my dressing.
Don't follow me.

522
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,520
You're pretty good at

523
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,920
escaping by crafty scheme.

524
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,960
That's right.

525
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,560
I learned it
when I was a singing performer.

526
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,880
I helped those rogues in debt escape.

527
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,080
Commander Gu, are you satisfied now?

528
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,160
You were a singing performer before,

529
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,360
and you still want
to marry a Presented Scholar?

530
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,600
Which gentry will dare to marry you?

531
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,840
Sorry. A slip of tongue.

532
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,480
Never mind. You're badly hurt, too.

533
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,440
I'll let it pass.

534
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,000
Can you read?

535
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,160
Here are two bottles of medicine.

536
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,760
You can take whichever you want.

537
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,600
Well,

538
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,160
you can rub it in,

539
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,040
but I can't do the same to you?

540
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,320
I know people like you too well.

541
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,920
You said it's a slip of tongue,

542
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,760
but you still look down on us.

543
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,440
What you regret

544
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,000
is nothing more than

545
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,400
speaking

546
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,360
your mind.

547
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,920
What's wrong
with being singing performers?

548
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,160
We have a better reputation
than the Capital Security Office.

549
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,080
We're pot and kettle.

550
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,960
Don't be so superior all the time.

551
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,360
Don't forget

552
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,760
who saved your life back there.

553
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,360
I didn't ask you to save me.

554
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,640
Get off the boat then!

555
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,840
Let's call a truce, okay?

556
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,560
Let's stop fighting.

557
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,880
Okay.

558
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,080
The ship is bound for
the Eastern Capital.

559
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,520
It got a license
to sell tea from Cangsi.

560
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,560
There are few people checking it.

561
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,760
This is the rear cabin.

562
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,840
People on the boat
don't usually come here.

563
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,960
There are wind chimes on the door

564
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,960
which will ring if someone breaks in.

565
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
You can get off the boat
wherever you like.

566
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,680
I have to wait until we get to Xiuzhou.

567
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,560
This sack will be the dividing line.

568
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,480
You'll be on the left
and I'll be on the right.

569
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,400
Be careful!

570
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,080
What dividing line?

571
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,680
I rented this cabin.

572
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,960
Don't check it for me.

573
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,120
You're not doing well.

574
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,720
It's oozing pus.
I'm getting it out of you.

575
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,120
You still have a shoulder injury.

576
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,960
Can you do it?

577
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,600
Bear with it.

578
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,880
You're not Guan Yu,

579
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,880
and I'm not Hua Tuo.

580
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,920
Don't hold back. There's nobody here.

581
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,800
Gu Qianfan.

582
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,020
(Order is given to investigate
Yang Zhiyuan, the Transport Assistant.)

583
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,420
(It's confirmed that the painting
is kept in his mansion.)

584
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,880
(I came to Jiangnan Region)

585
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,360
(to arrest Magistrate Wei
of Renhe County.)

586
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,760
(I don't mean to hurt you.)

587
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,040
(It can't be determined
whether he is involved.)

588
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,680
(But if you don't appreciate
my kindness...)

589
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,240
Your painting is a fake.

590
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,640
Where is the authentic one?

591
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,480
You...

592
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,920
How ridiculous!

593
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,040
This is the authentic painting!

594
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,040
Don't put on a show in front of me.

595
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,760
Give me the authentic painting.

596
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,220
(It can't be determined
whether he is involved.)

597
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,980
(Capital Security Office)

598
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,540
(Capital Security Office)

599
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,080
Sanniang.

600
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,640
Why didn't you go
to the Ancestral Hall with your son?

601
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,720
Ancestral Hall?

602
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,880
Giving the child away is a huge thing.

603
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,840
As the mother, are you not
going over there to see it?

604
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,440
Give the child away?

605
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,520
Yeah.

606
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,360
Whose child?

607
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,080
Who else can it be?

608
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,880
Your son, Zifang.

609
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,710
I would like to give my son, Fu Zifang,

610
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,840
to my cousin, Fu Xincai,

611
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,560
as his heir.

612
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,710
Signed by Fu Xingui from Yuan House

613
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,560
(Fu's Ancestral Hall)
and Fu Xincai's wife from Shan House.

614
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,000
Sanniang?

615
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,600
Wait, Sanniang.

616
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,040
Listen to me, Sanniang. You...

617
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,320
Wait.

618
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,280
Tao, we are not close,

619
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,280
but we are not enemies, either.

620
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,280
Why are you taking my son away from me?

621
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:46,920
Sanniang.

622
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,630
Come here. Come here.

623
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,000
I know nothing.

624
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,480
All I know is that my husband is gone

625
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,360
and there is no one
to run the big family business.

626
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,600
Of course I should find a successor
among the children in our clan.

627
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,360
Bah!

628
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,200
Fu Xincai is a very distant relative.

629
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,640
What's more,

630
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,240
no parents would give away

631
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,720
their only son to other people!

632
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,440
Sanniang.

633
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,800
I did a lot

634
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,160
to raise Fu Zifang on my own.

635
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,680
Someone's jealous
and wants to steal

636
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,360
the ripe fruit from me.

637
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,560
You wish!

638
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,560
Sanniang, you...

639
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,400
Get out of my way.

640
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,160
(Fruitful and Lush)
Sanniang! Sanniang!

641
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,160
(Fruitful and Lush)
What are you doing?

642
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,960
Chief. Well, I...

643
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,360
Just go.

644
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:30,960
Go.

645
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,840
Sanniang!

646
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,640
(Fu's Ancestral Hall)
Sanniang! Hold on!

647
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,440
Father!

648
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,920
Father!

649
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,200
Father!

650
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,160
Father!

651
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,500
(Xiao's Mansion)

652
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,320
Father!

653
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,120
Go to sleep in your bed.

654
00:36:59,160 --> 00:36:59,920
You're awake.

655
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,760
How long have I been sleeping?

656
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,680
More than a day.

657
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,000
You didn't wake up
when the boatmen were taking in cargo.

658
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,720
Did you scrub my body?

659
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,160
Well,

660
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,720
are you blaming me
for touching your precious body

661
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,760
without your permission?

662
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,720
It's not like that.

663
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,000
I have nothing to lose.

664
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,320
The porridge is done.

665
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,520
Have some yourself.

666
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,480
I put laxatives in it.

667
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,040
Looks like you are fully recovered.

668
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,480
You're not having a fever or coughing.

669
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,400
You even have the strength
to put drugs in the porridge.

670
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,680
Clean my shoes

671
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,160
if you have time.

672
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,800
What happened to the wound
between your eyebrows?

673
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,200
I didn't do that.

674
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,360
It's nothing.

675
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,360
Are those men after you

676
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,400
the killers sent by Yang's Mansion?

677
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,000
Why do you have to find
The Night Revels?

678
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,320
How did you know it's a fake

679
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,520
at the first glance?

680
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,800
Stay out of this
if you don't want to die.

681
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,600
The porridge is good.

682
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,120
Give me money.

683
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,720
I don't have any.

684
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,440
Rogue.

685
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,720
Stingy.

686
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,760
Insidious.

687
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,600
Mean.

688
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,720
Mean?

689
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,120
You're mean!

690
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,320
And you're ruthless.

691
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,880
Unreasonable.

692
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Immoral.

693
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,600
Unfaithful.

694
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,400
Irresponsible.

695
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,800
All you men are no good.

696
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,400
I assume

697
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,680
that's what you want to say to him.

698
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,000
Does it make you feel better
after saying that out loud?

699
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,880
Thank you.

700
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,880
I'm sorry.

701
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,120
We're both hurt.

702
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,640
You don't need to say that.

703
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,600
Just think of it
as the money for porridge.

704
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,000
I didn't know you could tell jokes.

705
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,520
Even the devils
in the Capital Security Office

706
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,680
have feelings and desires.

707
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,040
You are not a devil.

708
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,120
You're a man,

709
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,280
and a good man.

710
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,040
You've only met me a few times.

711
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,840
How do you know I'm a good man?

712
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,120
I just know it.

713
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,840
You don't want to admit

714
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,520
the fact that you have been
abandoned, right?

715
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,400
Zhao Pan'er.

716
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,200
You are proud and confident.

717
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,280
You never take yourself lightly

718
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,040
even you unfortunately went
into a lowly profession.

719
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,160
But when things go wrong

720
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,880
between a man and a woman,

721
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,880
the result is always the worst.

722
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,480
Did you get married?

723
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,040
Do you have a girlfriend?

724
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,320
How can you talk so much

725
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,120
when you have nothing?

726
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,040
I still believe in my own decision.

727
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,840
Ouyang Xu is not that kind of person.

728
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,600
Then why did you

729
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,200
call him unfaithful yesterday?

730
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,560
It means deep down,

731
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,400
you still don't trust him.

732
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
Is that a person?

733
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,280
It looks like a woman.

734
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,240
Go hide. I'll call someone.

735
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,440
Boatmen!

736
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,680
- Mr. Zheng, someone fell into the water!
- What happened?

737
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:10,880
Fell into the water?

738
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,920
Did you see it?

739
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,400
Where is it?

740
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,720
It's over there.

741
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,120
What happened?

742
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,760
Sanniang!

743
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,560
There is someone over there!

744
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,840
Sanniang!

745
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,000
- That's my friend!
- Look, it's over there.

746
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,600
Save her, please.

747
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,360
She is dead.

748
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,080
Yeah.

749
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,480
Calm down!

750
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,000
- I have to save her. That's my friend!
- Don't move.

751
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,610
You can't go there.
