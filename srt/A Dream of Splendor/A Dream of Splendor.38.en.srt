00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,700
=Episode 38=

17
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,599
Your mother has a pure heart and spirit.

18
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,959
She is virtuous, frank,

19
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,239
amiable and respectable.

20
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,480
A gentleman and a lady

21
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,440
falling in love

22
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,360
is the most beautiful thing
in the world.

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,199
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,760
The reason why we didn't tell you

25
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:57,800
is because you just arrived
and you're young.

26
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,919
We're afraid you can't take it.

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,680
Still, I don't allow it!

28
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,160
According to books, a woman
must always be obedient.

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,360
She obeys her father
before getting married.

30
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,360
She obeys her husband
after getting married.

31
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,399
She obeys her son
after her husband dies.

32
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,160
Without my permission,

33
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,759
she can't marry you!

34
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:18,080
Fu Zifang,

35
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:20,759
I don't need your permission.

36
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,880
Don't you remember?

37
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:25,360
Your father divorced me.

38
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,720
A woman gets married
under the order of her parents.

39
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,520
But she can marry anyone
for the second time.

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,960
In this world, no one

41
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,240
has the right to interfere
with my marriage.

42
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,160
Including you, even if you're my son.

43
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,360
Mother!

44
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:40,759
You don't really take me as your mother.

45
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,600
All you need is a babysitter

46
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,320
who is always obedient to you

47
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,320
and takes care of you.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,600
That's not true!

49
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,279
Say no more.

50
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,559
I used to indulge you too much.

51
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,160
So, today,

52
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,520
Yinzhang had to coerce you

53
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,279
and gave you a lesson on my behalf.

54
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,479
Now I finally understand.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,880
I may be a good mother,
but you're never a good son.

56
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,479
Fu Zifang,

57
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,520
you're just as selfish as your father.

58
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,800
Let's get back.

59
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,679
Sanniang.

60
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,479
But...

61
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:22,800
Zifang, come up.

62
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,440
It's too cold.

63
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,520
Go. Leave him there.

64
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,320
He won't be drowned.

65
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,479
He may catch a cold.

66
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:04,160
Mother, I was wrong.

67
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,279
Stand up.

68
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,160
Come over.

69
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,839
Swap for the dry clothes

70
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,199
in case you catch a cold.

71
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:25,040
Mother, are you not angry
with me anymore?

72
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,119
I'm still angry with you.

73
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,640
But a mother never hates her son.

74
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:34,760
Zifang, now,

75
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:36,200
you're growing up.

76
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,920
I think you can get my point.

77
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,559
I'm not only your mother,

78
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,559
but also a woman.

79
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,200
An assertive woman.

80
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,359
I indeed dream to be mandated.

81
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,200
For this dream,

82
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,440
I forced to you study hard

83
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,799
so that you became rebellious.

84
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,160
That's why you were

85
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,839
easily bought over by your aunt

86
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,160
and lost your mind.

87
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:03,559
I don't want you

88
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,440
to live for my dream anymore.

89
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,880
When I want to be mandated,

90
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,480
I'll work hard for that personally.

91
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:13,239
I picked Du Changfeng to be my husband.

92
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,920
I don't think
I'm not good enough for him.

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,119
I don't think
he'll be bad to me, either.

94
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,559
When our wedding is held
a few days later,

95
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,880
I will get married very proudly.

96
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,079
People's discussions

97
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,920
can never defeat me.

98
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,000
Go.

99
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,359
Mother, I was wrong.

100
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,160
I'm no longer angry.

101
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,975
Mm.

102
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,720
Ladies and gentlemen,

103
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,440
a big sale for today.

104
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,959
Come into our restaurant
and get a free cup of Celestial Wine.

105
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,600
- Great.
- Nice.

106
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,399
Line up.

107
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:18,200
Line up. Right there. Line up.

108
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,279
Hurry.

109
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,079
Line up.

110
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,079
Go.

111
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,519
- Go quickly.
- Hurry.

112
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,440
You're like me
before you drink the wine.

113
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,799
But you'll be like him
after you drink it.

114
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
- It improves your health
- Line up.

115
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,880
- and helps you lose weight.
- Line up.

116
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,399
- First come, first served. Hurry.
- Go get the free wine.

117
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,359
Celestial Wine is good.

118
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,239
- Celestial Wine is free for today!
- You two, come this way.

119
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,440
Nice trick, isn't it?

120
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,040
Today, Yong'an Restaurant

121
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,640
receives more customers by 30%.

122
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,440
It's not only a nice trick,

123
00:06:41,679 --> 00:06:42,839
but also a stroke of genius.

124
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,519
You do a better job than me

125
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:46,040
as the manager of Yong'an Restaurant.

126
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm just imitating you.

127
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,480
I can handle the restaurant
for the moment.

128
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,920
But I can't handle it for a long time.

129
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:59,079
I like to see you being happy.

130
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,600
By the way, tell Chi Pan

131
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,519
not to really make a scene

132
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,399
with the restaurant guild.

133
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:08,000
Just show them

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,239
that we're not pushovers.

135
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:12,880
But they tried to kill you.

136
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,920
Why must we be soft with them?

137
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,799
I don't think
they're behind the assassination.

138
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,720
It didn't make any sense.

139
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,760
You're enjoying your leisure time.

140
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,075
Oops.

141
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:29,920
You're back quite early today.

142
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,079
- Qianfan.
- Your leg hasn't recovered yet.

143
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:36,504
I have something to tell you.

144
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:37,125
Mm.

145
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,040
Ouyang Xu is transferred to be
Controller-general of Xinzhou, right?

146
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,559
He left the Eastern Capital yesterday.

147
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,320
Unexpectedly, he ran into bandits
on the sea last night

148
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,920
and was killed.

149
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,900
Ah?

150
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,160
Who did that?

151
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:51,079
No idea. It's still under investigation.

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,640
But I know things can't be
quite that simple.

153
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:55,239
At today's morning court,

154
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,040
censors suddenly impeached me.

155
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:58,720
According to them,
I married a businesswoman,

156
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,519
regardless of the distinction
between officials and businessmen.

157
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,720
This made me unconventional.

158
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,000
I allowed my wife to monopolize spices
and fight for profits with civilians.

159
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,079
This made me heartless.

160
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,040
Pan'er wasn't a pariah a long time ago.

161
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,279
She's a civilian, too.

162
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,959
Commissioner Gu Qianfan,

163
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,440
I'm Inspector-in-chief Zhang Yun

164
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,480
from the Infantry Command
of the Guard Department.

165
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,279
To what do I owe the pleasure?

166
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,440
Commanded by His Majesty, I'll take you
to our prison for interrogation.

167
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:30,559
Qianfan.

168
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,559
Take it easy. Don't worry.

169
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,080
I'll be right back.

170
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,760
Go find Chen Lian. Hurry.

171
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,359
All right.

172
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,200
Gu Qianfan, you'd better confess.

173
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,039
You're familiar
with the tortures, after all.

174
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,840
Why must you wait until you're tortured?

175
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:07,520
Just because I'm familiar

176
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,679
with the tortures,

177
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,320
I can probably guess

178
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:13,559
that His Majesty asked you

179
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:17,046
not to give me severe torture, right?

180
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:21,919
So far, consequently,

181
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,919
you've only dared

182
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,799
to give me the water torture
which will leave no wound on my body.

183
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,559
Let me say it again.

184
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,960
I've never seen The Night Revels.

185
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,960
I've never

186
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,719
instigated anyone to deceive His Majesty
with a fake painting.

187
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,119
Why are you still so stubborn
even when you're dying?

188
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:50,296
You're avenging Commander Cui,
the Hat Demon,

189
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,919
right?

190
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,520
In the first year of Jingde's reign,
he was your deputy commandant.

191
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:00,000
You two even went to a war
with His Majesty.

192
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:03,320
Do you think
His Majesty can't figure out

193
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,440
what I have found out?

194
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,280
Give him the bell torture.

195
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,640
Will you confess or not?

196
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,840
Zhang Yun, calm down.

197
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,880
It's a struggle between Scholar Ministers
and the Empress Party.

198
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,200
I know you want to avenge Commander Cui.

199
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,119
But don't be instigated

200
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:48,760
just because of this

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,280
or get involved in the struggle.

202
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,359
You must understand.

203
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,599
If one day His Majesty knows

204
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:55,679
that I'm innocent,

205
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,400
do you want your Guard Department

206
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,440
to always be an enemy
of the Capital Security Office?

207
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:00,799
Go on!

208
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,640
From the homes of those
who attacked you,

209
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,799
jewels with Minister Xiao's signet
were found.

210
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,000
Among the dead bandits
who attacked Ouyang Xu,

211
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,599
there were Minister Xiao's servants, too.

212
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,840
So, Minister Xiao asked for a sick leave

213
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,559
and he's waiting to be interrogated.

214
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,960
But what does it have anything
to do with Qianfan?

215
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:25,960
Minister Xiao won't kill him.

216
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,159
He just won't.

217
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,520
So, you heard about that rumor, too?

218
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,559
As in the rumor,

219
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,599
Minister Xiao married Chief's aunt

220
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,359
and treated him as his son.

221
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,640
So he kept promoting Chief.

222
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,719
And...

223
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,400
Speech officials told His Majesty

224
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:47,239
that Minister Xiao must be dissatisfied

225
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,440
when Chief insisted on marrying you...

226
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,760
Me, the humble businesswoman.

227
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,520
That's why he tries to kill Qianfan.

228
00:11:58,925 --> 00:11:59,575
Mm.

229
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:01,840
They also said

230
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:04,080
that Minister Xiao didn't know
Chief was also in the carriage

231
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,679
and it made you escape by luck.

232
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:09,440
After hearing that,

233
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,320
His Majesty flew into a rage,

234
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,359
reprimanding Her Majesty
and Minister Xiao

235
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:13,200
for overextending themselves.

236
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,840
But Her Majesty said

237
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,200
she had no idea of this.

238
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,559
To prove her innocence,

239
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,599
she asked His Majesty to have Chief

240
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,200
taken to the Guard Department
for a strict interrogation.

241
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,119
Wait.

242
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,919
I get it.

243
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,640
I'm sure His Majesty thinks

244
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,640
Qianfan colluded with the Empress Party

245
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,840
and instigated me

246
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,440
to lie about The Night Revels

247
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,000
so that the Empress could get away.

248
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:39,679
This is the real reason
why Qianfan was arrested.

249
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:44,039
The Capital Security Office is in charge
of the defense of the capital city.

250
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:46,400
If it's under control
of the Empress Party,

251
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,679
it'll be extremely dangerous
to His Majesty.

252
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:50,159
You're right.

253
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,840
I don't think
Minister Xiao is the murderer.

254
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,359
It's more like that Qi Mu is
incriminating Minister Xiao

255
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,320
when he's out of the capital city.

256
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,039
Who else can order
so many speech officials, anyway?

257
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,200
Think about it, Pan'er.

258
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:05,119
Last time, he colluded with Ouyang Xu
but failed to dethrone Her Majesty.

259
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:06,200
His Majesty then alienated him.

260
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,679
This time, to take revenge,

261
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,479
he tried to murder you and Ouyang Xu.

262
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,760
Whether you died or not,

263
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,039
His Majesty would suspect
Her Majesty and Minister Xiao.

264
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,400
In this way,

265
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,919
he'll get a chance

266
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,119
to assume his job back here.

267
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,200
It can't be true.

268
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,080
Qi Mu isn't in the Eastern Capital.

269
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:25,320
Now that we can think of this,

270
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:26,960
Xiao Qinyan can figure it out, too.

271
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:31,280
Shall we visit Minister Xiao

272
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:32,559
and ask for some advice?

273
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:37,960
Not now.

274
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,000
I haven't been arrested yet.

275
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,400
But someone is probably spying on me.

276
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,119
What we should do is do nothing now.

277
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,080
Qi Mu isn't in the Eastern Capital.

278
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,080
Xiao Qinyan has been
a powerful official for decades.

279
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,000
He will not easily give in.

280
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,679
After all, Qianfan is his...

281
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,159
He won't let Qianfan die.

282
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,479
Besides,

283
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,559
I left a hint to His Majesty.

284
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:11,760
I mentioned that Qianfan
got engaged with me,

285
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,840
regardless of my identity.

286
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,119
So, the calmer we appear to be,

287
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,799
the more His Majesty will believe

288
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,080
that I told the truth

289
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:20,640
before I even realized it.

290
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,719
Is this the good idea you came up with?

291
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,880
It is, of course.

292
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:33,359
Anyway, very few people know

293
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:34,280
that Pan'er married Gu Qianfan.

294
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,039
As long as I marry Pan'er,

295
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:37,520
the speech officials' impeachment

296
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,400
will just be fictitious.

297
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,880
Then His Majesty won't suspect anything.

298
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,599
You're taking advantage!

299
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,159
I'm sacrificing my body

300
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,799
to save all of you, all right?

301
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:48,919
I'm not aware of other punishments.

302
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,679
But Pan'er will be beheaded
for deceiving His Majesty.

303
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,200
You will implicate me, too.

304
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,400
Yong'an Restaurant will also be closed.

305
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,679
Such a dangerous problem

306
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:55,640
must be solved as soon as possible.

307
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,440
Do you not have a selfish motive?

308
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,559
I do, so what?

309
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,159
I have a selfish motive

310
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,640
just because I like Pan'er!

311
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,280
If you were in this trouble,

312
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,640
never dream to get help from me!

313
00:15:06,075 --> 00:15:06,919
- What? What?
- You!

314
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,640
Trying to slap me?

315
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,000
Before I touch you,
why are you still touching me?

316
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,960
Come on. Touch me.

317
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,880
Chi Pan, I appreciate your kindness.

318
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:15,400
Just say but.

319
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:16,679
But Qianfan and I

320
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:18,440
traveled from Qiantang County
to the Eastern Capital.

321
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:21,520
Magistrate of Huating County,
Prefect Xu,

322
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,760
and some
in the Capital Security Office...

323
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,039
A lot of people knew about that.

324
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,640
His Majesty will figure it out
with a careful investigation.

325
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:29,280
What do we do, then?

326
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:32,080
We can't just sit here and wait to die.

327
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,080
We're not waiting to die,

328
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,799
but waiting for an opportunity.

329
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,880
Qianfan's been in prison for a whole day

330
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,919
and we haven't got any information.

331
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,359
I don't know if he was tortured.

332
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,960
Chi Pan, Qianfan's subordinates
don't dare to take any action now.

333
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:47,479
It's not convenient
for me to ask around, either.

334
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:49,280
You're well-connected
in the Eastern Capital.

335
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,640
Could you try to see him?

336
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,520
He can judge more accurately than us.

337
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,520
A jailer of the Guard Department Jail
owed me a gambling debt.

338
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,700
I'll ask him for help.

339
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
No, no, this isn't appropriate.

340
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,080
You're the owner of Yong'an Restaurant.

341
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,880
He may not want to get involved.

342
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,440
Let me go.

343
00:16:08,825 --> 00:16:10,080
I'm an official, anyway.

344
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,200
Even if I'm caught,

345
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:12,520
I may survive.

346
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:14,880
Changfeng, you...

347
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,359
I'm a man.

348
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,679
When the family is in trouble,
the man should always step forward.

349
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,880
You're quite manly today.

350
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,719
Not at all.

351
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:40,880
Off you go.

352
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,599
Thanks.

353
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:49,919
Sir, I'm ordered to check on you.

354
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,359
Sir?

355
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:07,280
Gu Qianfan.

356
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,520
Gu Qianfan.

357
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:22,959
It's me.

358
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,280
Are you the doctor they sent?

359
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,439
Yes, I am.

360
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:34,439
My ears are hurt
and I can't hear anything.

361
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,760
Feel my pulse, then.

362
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,160
Listen to me.

363
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,000
Ask them not to take rash action.

364
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,680
His Majesty only has me interrogated,

365
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,160
instead of doing anything
on Pan'er or Yong'an Restaurant.

366
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,025
It means

367
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,839
His Majesty suspects something,

368
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,199
but doesn't have evidence.

369
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,560
Lei Jing sent me
to look for The Night Revels.

370
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,119
I've got a lot of things on him.

371
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,079
I believe

372
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,319
he's interceding hard for me
with His Majesty.

373
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,479
So, I won't die.

374
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:29,599
But your ears...

375
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,079
If Pan'er asks about my condition,

376
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,350
tell her

377
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:36,640
that I'm only imprisoned

378
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:38,560
and I'm safe.

379
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,520
Ask her not to worry about me.

380
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,479
Are you done?

381
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:48,880
Yes, yes.
I'll go write the prescription.

382
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,000
Take care.

383
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:04,920
What did I say?

384
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,400
Gu Qianfan would be all right.

385
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,040
Yeah.

386
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,199
After all, he's the Commissioner
of the Capital Security Office.

387
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,599
Even Imperial Guards

388
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,000
don't dare to offend him
without a good reason.

389
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:17,880
Something's wrong.

390
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,040
If Qianfan were really all right,

391
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,225
he wouldn't be so nervous.

392
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,359
- Yeah.
- No, no, no.

393
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,880
I'm... I'm not nervous.

394
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:27,000
What exactly happened? Tell me.

395
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,319
Tell us.

396
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:31,560
Say it.

397
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,280
Come on. Tell us.

398
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,520
When I went in, I called him,

399
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,479
but he didn't respond.

400
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,719
I guess his ears were hurt.

401
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,280
He couldn't hear you?

402
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,119
So, he's deaf?

403
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:47,640
Not only his ears were hurt,

404
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,280
his pulse felt messy, too.

405
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:51,479
He also had a fever.

406
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,079
Maybe he was also hurt somewhere else.

407
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,560
Darn it.

408
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,680
How did they torture Chief?

409
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,760
I didn't expect the guards
to torture him like that.

410
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,000
Pan'er.

411
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:06,959
I'm all right.

412
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:09,079
I'll go beg Finance Minister Lin.

413
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:10,599
Don't bother.

414
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,599
Chen Lian, there's only one thing
we can do.

415
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:15,520
No one can save Qianfan, but him.

416
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:18,040
Please draw away those who spy on us.

417
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:19,040
No problem.

418
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,325
(Xiao's Mansion)

419
00:20:23,325 --> 00:20:24,425
(Xiao's Mansion)
Zhao Pan'er

420
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:26,160
asked to see me?

421
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:29,160
Yes. She came through the back door.

422
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,280
For the sake of prudence,

423
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,599
I brought her to the side room.

424
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,920
You have many contacts in court

425
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:17,760
and you must know

426
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,880
how Qianfan is being tortured.

427
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,319
He never wants to be involved

428
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,839
in your struggle
against Scholar Ministers.

429
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,359
For the sake of his mother...

430
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,119
You knew

431
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:32,959
I didn't send anyone to kill you.

432
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:36,400
He seldom talked about you.

433
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,880
But he always believes

434
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:41,400
that you won't hurt him.

435
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:50,400
You may rise.

436
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:58,040
Don't worry.

437
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,599
I've had everything arranged.

438
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:04,479
Qianfan won't be tortured anymore.

439
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,119
In three or five days at most,

440
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,160
he can come out safely.

441
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,199
But during this period,

442
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,119
you'd better not stay
in the Eastern Capital.

443
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:34,800
Master.

444
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,439
Go prepare a carriage.

445
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:37,599
Have it tightly covered

446
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:38,640
and send her back home in it.

447
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,760
Aye.

448
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,599
Qianfan is a good person.

449
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:08,225
So are you.

450
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:14,160
I feel sorry to you.

451
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,160
The carriage is ready.

452
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:47,500
(Xiao's Mansion)

453
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:51,359
Don't move unless you want to die.

454
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,719
I'm saving your life.

455
00:23:57,025 --> 00:23:59,375
(Xiao's Mansion)

456
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
It's safe here, I guess.

457
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:06,640
What did you just say?

458
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,359
He won't rescue Gu Qianfan.

459
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,959
He lied to you.

460
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,359
What?

461
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,599
To the Empress,

462
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,520
The Night Revels is irrefutable evidence

463
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,160
of her shameful past.

464
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,640
So,

465
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,880
when she heard the rumors

466
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,239
about the relationship
between Gu Qianfan and my father,

467
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,719
she started to suspect

468
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,079
that my father had kept
the existence of the painting

469
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,280
because he was disloyal to her.

470
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,479
To prove his loyalty to the Empress,

471
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:35,079
when he met the Empress's brother today,

472
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,319
he asserted

473
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,800
that he divorced Ms. Gu
out of resentment,

474
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,599
and he and Gu Qianfan

475
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,079
only contacted in the Hat Demon case

476
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,800
instead of being a family.

477
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,959
Under such circumstances,

478
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,199
how would he rescue Gu Qianfan?

479
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,650
You think he's heartless, huh?

480
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,839
He's always been this kind of man.

481
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:58,280
Otherwise, he couldn't be
such a powerful official.

482
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,750
In his heart,

483
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:04,319
sons aren't important at all.

484
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Only power matters most to him.

485
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,400
Pan'er,

486
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,520
you used to be very clever.

487
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:15,640
Why did you lose your mind

488
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,640
and come to beg him today?

489
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,439
Don't you know

490
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:20,119
how Gu Qianfan hates him?

491
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,599
You knew that?

492
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,839
Do you also know your father was...

493
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:32,839
I figured out

494
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:35,640
that Minister Xiao wasn't behind those
who attacked me.

495
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,400
But after Qianfan was arrested,

496
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,439
he probably wanted to kill me.

497
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,599
Because as long as he faked

498
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,199
that Qi Mu's men killed me,

499
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,719
he and Qianfan would be vindicated.

500
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,680
But to get Qianfan out quickly,

501
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,479
I don't care
how much I hate your father.

502
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,239
Even if I have to die

503
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,000
and even if Qianfan blames me,

504
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:00,680
I still have to do this.

505
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,920
You're so nice to Gu Qianfan.

506
00:26:07,439 --> 00:26:08,640
He's better to me.

507
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,719
No wonder he insisted on marrying you
even by hurting himself.

508
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,719
I'm still not experienced enough.

509
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:17,640
I didn't expect him

510
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,079
to comfort me with a smile

511
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,439
while arranging for his men to kill me.

512
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,119
Thank you for today.

513
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:29,479
You always hate Qianfan, don't you?

514
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,719
Why did you save me?

515
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,760
Because...

516
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,959
He's my eldest brother, after all.

517
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,719
And because he saved my life
in the Hat Demon case.

518
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:44,520
I'm jealous of him.

519
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,079
But I don't want him to die.

520
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,880
I don't want his beloved lady
to die, either.

521
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:51,119
Get back home.

522
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:53,760
You'd better stay
in Yong'an Restaurant lately.

523
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,040
Don't be alone.

524
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,839
The more people are around you,
the less he dares to kill you.

525
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,359
What about you?

526
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,479
Are you afraid of your father?

527
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:05,119
He'll just beat me.

528
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,359
I'm used to that, anyway.

529
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,439
Get in the carriage.

530
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,359
I arranged this carriage and the driver.
Rest assured.

531
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,000
Pan'er.

532
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,719
Take care.

533
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,479
I also felt confused
after I heard about this.

534
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:34,920
After all, I verified again and again
that The Night Revels

535
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,040
was fictitious.

536
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,239
Gu Qianfan knew nothing about it
before his mission.

537
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,400
How could he fake the painting
with Ms. Zhao?

538
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,119
Is Gu Qianfan really the nephew

539
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,680
of Xiao Qinyan's ex-wife?

540
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,839
Yes.

541
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,000
Gu Qianfan never concealed this

542
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,680
in his resume.

543
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,479
But I don't think

544
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:02,319
Minister Xiao ever helped Gu Qianfan

545
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,599
just for their relationship.

546
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:08,520
Or I wouldn't dare to always assign

547
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,959
the hardest missions to Gu Qianfan.

548
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:13,760
But I remember

549
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,280
when Gu Qianfan was promoted
to be the Commissioner,

550
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,319
Xiao Qinyan put in a good word for him.

551
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,040
It was... It was because

552
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,839
Gu Qianfan killed the Hat Demon.

553
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:30,280
If Minister Xiao didn't repay Gu Qianfan

554
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,520
for saving his life,

555
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,239
others will badly gossip about him.

556
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:38,959
Besides, Gu Qianfan
requested Your Majesty

557
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:41,400
to mandate his aunt Ms. Gu.

558
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:44,079
Ms. Gu is from
a family of Scholar Ministers.

559
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:47,760
She divorced Minister Xiao
out of resentment.

560
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,959
Wasn't he disgracing

561
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:51,000
Minister Xiao

562
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,599
in front of Your Majesty?

563
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,239
Oh, right.

564
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:57,920
There may be another way out.

565
00:28:58,439 --> 00:28:59,280
Say it.

566
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,560
Ouyang Xu isn't dead.

567
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,650
Ah?

568
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,760
He isn't dead?

569
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,199
He was just wounded.

570
00:29:10,199 --> 00:29:11,280
Someone saved him.

571
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,719
Guards of the Court of Judicial Review
are escorting him back.

572
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:16,160
His two servants died.

573
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:18,760
On the ship transferring
osmanthus south,

574
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,239
all of the six workers died, too,

575
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:21,400
from the helmsman to the boatmen.

576
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,439
Only he jumped into the river early

577
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,439
and floated downstream
on a piece of deck.

578
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,119
Pan'er,

579
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,160
I know you hate Ouyang Xu.

580
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:32,920
But if we try to bribe him
with a large sum of money

581
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:34,439
and ask him to tell His Majesty

582
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:36,560
that Qi Mu sent the bandits to kill him,

583
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,680
maybe we can stir things up.

584
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:43,800
Wait, wait. Say it again.

585
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,160
Ouyang Xu isn't dead.

586
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:48,800
We can try to bribe him

587
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,040
and ask him

588
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:51,880
to accuse Scholar Ministers instead.

589
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:53,560
Something's wrong.

590
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:57,239
Qi Mu knows Xiao Qinyan is
Qianfan's father.

591
00:29:58,719 --> 00:29:59,959
Under such circumstances,

592
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,000
he only needs to conceal this secret.

593
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,239
After all, colluding with his son

594
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,839
and distorting an official's resume

595
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:06,800
can be a capital offense
for Xiao Qinyan.

596
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,880
If so,

597
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,479
the one behind all this only knows

598
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,040
that Xiao Qinyan and Qianfan are close.

599
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,880
Could you take me
to see Ouyang Xu stealthily?

600
00:30:23,325 --> 00:30:24,040
Fine.

601
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,000
Help!

602
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:48,839
Stop yelling.

603
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:50,680
I've knocked out the guards

604
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,160
with some incense.

605
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:05,000
Are you here to kill me?

606
00:31:06,275 --> 00:31:07,359
No.

607
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,361
I came to verify something.

608
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,091
I'm almost sure about it, though.

609
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,280
Don't try to look mysterious.

610
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:18,640
Just get to the point.

611
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,479
I smell the Pear Fragrance in this room.

612
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:27,920
It's rarely used by common people,

613
00:31:28,479 --> 00:31:30,160
but widely used in the imperial harem.

614
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:32,760
You just met someone
sent by the Empress,

615
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:34,680
right?

616
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:40,839
Your being attacked is a hoax.

617
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:43,719
Qi Mu isn't behind all this,

618
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:44,550
but the Empress is.

619
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:48,199
You turned to the Empress
a long time ago, right?

620
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,760
Because of The Night Revels,

621
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,839
the Empress hates Qi Mu a lot.

622
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:55,079
Qi Mu has been banished
from the Eastern Capital,

623
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,599
but she still wants to get rid of him.

624
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,359
So, she set interlocked traps.

625
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,079
First, she had Xiao Qinyan suspected.

626
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,880
Then, she'll ask the guards
of the Court of Judicial Review

627
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,800
to find out the flaws in the evidence.

628
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:08,520
Qi Mu isn't in the Eastern Capital.

629
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,239
So, he can't explain
to His Majesty's face.

630
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:13,800
His Majesty will suspect
Scholar Ministers

631
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,359
as much as he distrusted
the Empress Party.

632
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:19,359
Meanwhile, the Empress can

633
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:22,920
warn Xiao Qinyan who gets arrogant
as the Grand Secretary.

634
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:24,800
Am I right?

635
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,520
How did you know that?

636
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:29,520
Because I used to be the one

637
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,560
who knew you best.

638
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:35,079
Three years ago, you fell sick
in Qiantang County

639
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,079
and couldn't smell the osmanthus.

640
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,719
Otherwise, your body would
flare and itch.

641
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:42,000
How could a man like this

642
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,040
take a ship transferring osmanthus?

643
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,520
It means

644
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,880
everything was arranged by someone else

645
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:58,560
and you didn't dare to resist.

646
00:32:59,239 --> 00:32:59,880
Wrong.

647
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,479
I planned all this.

648
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:06,560
I begged the Empress's brother
regardless of humiliation.

649
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:08,640
I told him

650
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:10,520
that I completely offended Qi Mu

651
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:13,719
and I had to be loyal to the Empress.

652
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,560
As long as I risked my life
to set this trap,

653
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,880
the Empress can get rid of
Qi Mu forever.

654
00:33:23,075 --> 00:33:24,359
She trusted me

655
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,400
and gave me another chance

656
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,439
to stay in the Eastern Capital.

657
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,319
So, you had eight people killed?

658
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,199
So, you tried to kill me, too?

659
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:39,520
Ouyang Xu,

660
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,479
I don't think

661
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:42,959
I've ever hurt you.

662
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,160
Why did you do such things to us?

663
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,800
Because...

664
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:06,119
I have no other way out.

665
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,080
Are you all right?

666
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,800
Because I hate you!

667
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,360
You put me through this!

668
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:46,280
Zhao Pan'er,

669
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,919
do you know how much I loved you?

670
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,719
Why didn't you listen to me?

671
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,879
Why did you ask Gu Qianfan for help?

672
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,959
Why did you force me
to be the Taoist Temple Administrator

673
00:34:57,959 --> 00:34:59,239
in the Western Capital?

674
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,360
You ruined my bright future

675
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:06,399
after I studied hard for a dozen years.

676
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,360
I had no choice,

677
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,800
but to work for Qi Mu

678
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,399
and do evil for the Empress.

679
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,080
It's you. You put me through this.

680
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,760
No.

681
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,639
I...

682
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,520
I meant to be a good man.

683
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,225
I meant to be

684
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,600
an unyielding official.

685
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,719
But I didn't have a choice.

686
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:06,439
It's you. You made me do this.

687
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,300
All of you made me do this.

688
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:16,239
I still have a chance.

689
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:22,159
As long as I help the Empress
topple Qi Mu

690
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,320
and kill you and Gu Qianfan,

691
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:27,239
I can stay in the Eastern Capital,

692
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,760
get promoted,

693
00:36:31,919 --> 00:36:35,760
and take revenge on the Gao Family.

694
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:40,959
You and Gu Qianfan will regret
what you've done.

695
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,600
I failed to kill you last time.

696
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,000
I won't let you run away again.

697
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,450
Pan'er.

698
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,360
Somebody!

699
00:37:33,525 --> 00:37:34,159
Pan'er.

700
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:36,919
Come on. Let's go.

701
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,919
Help! Assassins!

702
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,959
Mr. Ouyang, who assassinated you?

703
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,479
I didn't get a clear look.

704
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,320
Wait.

705
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,800
Don't bother to run after them.

706
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:58,439
Leave me alone.

707
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,560
(Don't panic.)

708
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:05,879
(Even if she knows everything,)

709
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:07,280
(she doesn't have any evidence.)

710
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:10,239
(Gu Qianfan is in prison, anyway.)

711
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:11,840
(She's a mere civilian,)

712
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,600
(with no one to rely on.)

713
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:17,000
(I'll tell the Empress
about this tomorrow.)

714
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:19,520
(Yes. This is what I should do.)

715
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:23,360
Ouyang Xu's being attacked
is also weird.

716
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:26,080
If Minister Xiao really wanted
to kill that minor official,

717
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,879
he wouldn't have failed

718
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,000
or left such visible traces.

719
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,280
What's up?

720
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,639
Your Majesty, Consort Gao's niece
Gao Hui insisted on seeing you.

721
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,760
Ridiculous. I'm busy.

722
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:45,239
She said she had something important.

723
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,399
We're not finished here. Wait.

724
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,479
Get her in. Hurry.

725
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:52,120
Aye.

726
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:02,560
Don't bother to kneel.

727
00:39:03,439 --> 00:39:04,959
What did you come for? Say it.

728
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:07,639
Your Majesty,
my good friend Zhao Pan'er,

729
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,280
the manager of Yong'an Restaurant,

730
00:39:09,439 --> 00:39:11,199
has never monopolized spices

731
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:12,360
on the strength of Commissioner Gu.

732
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,399
She's innocent.

733
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,639
Zhao Pan'er is your good friend now?

734
00:39:17,919 --> 00:39:18,719
She is.

735
00:39:20,439 --> 00:39:21,919
So, you came to intercede for her?

736
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,879
I'm not interceding for her!

737
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:25,360
She has done nothing wrong!

738
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:27,840
If Pan'er really bullied others
on the strength of Gu Qianfan

739
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,719
like the officials accused,

740
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:32,199
why did she need to impawn

741
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:34,000
the deed of her teahouse?

742
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:36,879
Besides,

743
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,199
other restaurants first refused

744
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,800
to sell wine to Yong'an Restaurant.

745
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:41,879
Pan'er then didn't sell spices to them.

746
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,800
She was just

747
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,399
turning their playbook against them.

748
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:46,840
Some people had an ulterior motive

749
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,320
and forcibly blamed Pan'er
for bullying others

750
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,040
instead of having a common
business competition.

751
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,320
All right. All right.

752
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,280
This is an affair of politics.

753
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:57,520
A lady like you shouldn't interfere.

754
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,280
But Pan'er is just a lady, too.

755
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,879
You can send anyone to verify
what I just said.

756
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,159
I promise it's all true.

757
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,719
Miss Gao, please go back home.

758
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:18,199
Your Majesty, you watched me grow up.

759
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,120
I'm overbearing.

760
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:22,320
But I've never lied to you

761
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,959
or begged you for anything.

762
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,280
Miss Gao, say no more.

763
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,280
Just go.

764
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,520
Pan'er is a lady.

765
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,159
She came here all alone
and have no one to rely on.

766
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,840
It's really hard for her

767
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,320
to run the restaurant so well.

768
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:35,280
I just beg you to investigate the case

769
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,520
and not to hurt an innocent civilian
in the political struggle,

770
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,159
Your Majesty!

771
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:39,879
Go. Say no more.

772
00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:57,399
Gao Hui is always arrogant.

773
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,439
Why did she make friends
with Zhao Pan'er, too?

774
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,719
It's just fate, I'm afraid.

775
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,679
I think Miss Gao made sense.

776
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:09,800
Come on.

777
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,600
You guys came one after another

778
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,199
to intercede for Zhao Pan'er
and Gu Qianfan.

779
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:17,959
If I remember correctly,

780
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,959
you used to be Gu Qianfan's superior.

781
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,959
Your Majesty, just because
you're generous to take advice,

782
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,000
and Miss Gao and I
have a clear conscience,

783
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,560
we dare to speak bluntly.

784
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:36,719
With all due respect,

785
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:38,320
Prince Sheng is young.

786
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:40,679
Her Majesty can rely on no one, but you,

787
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:42,320
in the Imperial Palace.

788
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,840
She's chaste and proud.

789
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:48,399
She offered to have Gu Qianfan
strictly interrogated

790
00:41:48,399 --> 00:41:50,600
and asked Minister Xiao to wait
to be interrogated on a sick leave

791
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:55,320
only because she trusted you.

792
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,959
But if there's no evidence
for the false charge

793
00:41:59,439 --> 00:42:02,679
and you still don't
get Minister Xiao back to court,

794
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,360
won't you hurt her heart?

795
00:42:12,325 --> 00:42:13,360
Oh, no.

796
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,040
The Empress won't let us go.

797
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:16,439
Perhaps she will.

798
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,760
She's extremely powerful.

799
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,000
But I know her weakness.

800
00:42:21,879 --> 00:42:22,919
If we fight desperately,

801
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,399
we may stand a chance of survival.

802
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,919
But how?

803
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,639
According to Xiao Wei,

804
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,919
the more people are around me,

805
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:36,679
the less they dare to kill me.
