=Episode 3=

17
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
Boatman.

18
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,880
- What's going on?
- Mr. Zheng,

19
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,480
someone is in the water!

20
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,280
In the water?

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,200
Did you see that?

22
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,800
Where?

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,040
- There.
- Over there.

24
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,080
Right over there.

25
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,640
What happened? What happened?

26
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,240
Sanniang!

27
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,960
Someone is over there.

28
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,400
Sanniang!

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,680
- She's a friend of mine.
- Look. Right there.

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,160
Please get her out of the water!

31
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,520
But she's already dead.

32
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,160
Right.

33
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,600
I must go. She's my friend!

34
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,190
Don't move. Wait here.

35
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,120
You can't go.

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,520
Oh, he really jumped.

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,400
Yeah. He should be careful.

38
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,560
Be careful, man.

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,890
Be very careful.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,040
Come back if you can't reach her.

41
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
- He got her.
- He got her.

42
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,680
Hurry.

43
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,720
Pull!

44
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,480
Quickly.

45
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,520
Pull the rope. Hurry.

46
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,280
Hurry. Pull the rope.

47
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,920
Watch out!

48
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,040
He got her back.

49
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,600
Harder.

50
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,560
Pull harder!

51
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,720
- Harder.
- Pull harder.

52
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,840
- Come on.
- Be careful!

53
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,680
Still harder.

54
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,720
Hang in there.

55
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,200
Come on.

56
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,080
- Come on. Quickly.
- Come on.

57
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,760
Pull.

58
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,200
Be careful.

59
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,360
Almost there. Hurry.

60
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,080
Come on.

61
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,480
Come on.

62
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,440
Harder!

63
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,880
- Quickly.
- Pull harder.

64
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,360
Come on.

65
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Come and give me a hand.

66
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,010
- Come.
- Quickly.

67
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,480
Watch out.

68
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,280
Be careful.

69
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,800
She's up here. She's saved.

70
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,160
Be gentle. Be gentle.

71
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,020
- Careful.
- How's she?

72
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,830
How's she?

73
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,510
Oh. OK.

74
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,560
Come on. Give him a hand.

75
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,510
Here.

76
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,480
How's she?

77
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
- How's she?
- Is she all right?

78
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,320
How's she?

79
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,040
Is she still alive?

80
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,840
How's she?

81
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,840
Is she all right?

82
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,480
Umm...

83
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,920
She's alive. Alive.

84
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,560
Sanniang.

85
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,360
- Good, good.
- Yes.

86
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,200
Take her to the cabin

87
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,280
and warm her up with the heater.

88
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,920
This is just so sweet.

89
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,840
- Come on.
- Be careful.

90
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,120
Come and give them a hand.

91
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,080
Give them a hand.

92
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,160
Be gentle. Be gentle.

93
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,280
Careful.

94
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,080
Mr. Zheng noticed me.

95
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,320
I have to jump into the water
somewhere near the shore.

96
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,440
You can't. Your wound cracked again.

97
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,200
You mustn't jump into the water.

98
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,440
I'll solve the problem.

99
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,520
Go hide yourself first.

100
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,040
Mr. Zheng,

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,480
I was trying to say thank you to you.

102
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,160
Why did you keep avoiding me?

103
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,160
Ms. Zhao, let's just get to the point.

104
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,480
Who on earth is your friend?

105
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,000
You must have seen the official notice.

106
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,240
In terms of age, appearance,

107
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,400
accent, and martial arts,

108
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,360
your friend is exactly the wanted man.

109
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,000
Boatmen like us

110
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,800
don't make a fortune
on capturing a criminal.

111
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,680
We just...

112
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,320
We just don't want to be accused
of sheltering him.

113
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,120
Don't ask who he is.

114
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,960
He isn't a criminal, anyway.

115
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,000
If you want to report him,

116
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,360
never dream to do business
on this river anymore.

117
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,440
Ms. Zhao, are you threatening me?

118
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,800
I don't get to where I've gotten

119
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,640
by being a coward.

120
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,480
Wait.

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,400
If you're really curious,

122
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,680
I'll tell you about him.

123
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,200
He is Xiao Fan,

124
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,080
Minister Xiao's eldest son.

125
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,320
When he traveled to Qiantang County,

126
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,760
he fell in love with me.

127
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,840
The nephew
of Commandery Prince of Pengcheng

128
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,680
took fancy to me

129
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,240
and tried to make me his concubine.

130
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,040
That's why Xiao Fan and I are eloping.

131
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,720
Well, let me uncomplicate it for you.

132
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
I'm pregnant

133
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,920
and I carry Xiao Fan's baby.

134
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,600
They hurt Xiao Fan

135
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,760
and nearly killed my maid Sanniang.

136
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,760
They may kill my baby and me, too.

137
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,560
I wondered

138
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,040
why that man did great martial arts.

139
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,840
So, he was an official's son.

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,360
I didn't see anyone here.

141
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,040
I promise you

142
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,680
that no one on this boat

143
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,160
will gossip about him.

144
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,240
Prepare some light food.

145
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,760
- All right.
- Xiao Fan has a bad appetite.

146
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,720
You didn't hear us, did you?

147
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,680
I did.

148
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,640
I was just scaring him.

149
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,040
Never mind.

150
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,720
To heal your wound,
you used Tianfeng Powder

151
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,560
and Tianwang Healing Pellet.

152
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,920
Cantharides in them
easily cause a miscarriage.

153
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,880
Let me feel your pulse.

154
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,480
What a rascal!

155
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,120
I don't mean to tease you.

156
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,360
But pregnant women mustn't
take such medicine.

157
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,520
Don't talk nonsense.

158
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,560
Aren't you hurrying to find Ouyang

159
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,560
in the Eastern Capital
because you're pregnant?

160
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,360
I'm not pregnant.

161
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
Enough of this nonsense.

162
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,400
If you're not married,

163
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,360
how could you tell people

164
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,440
that you're carrying someone's baby?

165
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,680
Didn't I tell you
I was deceiving Mr. Zheng?

166
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,520
I played it by ear.
Don't you understand?

167
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,960
Come on, you work
at the Capital Security Office.

168
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,600
Sanniang is my friend.

169
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
To save her, you were exposed.

170
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
I just told a few lies.

171
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,030
What's the problem with it?

172
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,360
Besides,

173
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,720
I'm not carrying someone's baby.

174
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,030
I said it was your baby.

175
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,030
I mean

176
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,360
I only told Mr. Zheng.

177
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,670
No one else would know.

178
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,080
So, no one knows it's your baby.

179
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,760
I don't mean that.

180
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,720
I mean...

181
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,120
Anyway, it's...

182
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,320
Fine, fine.

183
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,160
It's just my luck.

184
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,840
I'll be the father, then.

185
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,160
You're taking advantage of me.

186
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,800
I'm a father so unexpectedly.

187
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,240
Aren't you taking advantage of me?

188
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,400
I was trying to save you.

189
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,400
Didn't I save your friend first?

190
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,520
Sanniang, you're awake?

191
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,320
Pan'er.

192
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,080
Where am I?

193
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,520
You freaked me out.

194
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,160
What happened to you?

195
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,480
Why am I here?

196
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
Pan'er,

197
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,560
(Porcelain)
Fu Xingui divorced me.

198
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,680
Zifang didn't want me, either.

199
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,880
That very night, I went back by carriage

200
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,440
to my hometown in Deqing Village.

201
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,720
But I arrived there,

202
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,680
only to see a collapsed house.

203
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,920
I felt...

204
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,680
I felt that I had nothing left.

205
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,240
Then...

206
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,520
I jumped into the water.

207
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,320
Fu Xingui...

208
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,880
He lied to me

209
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,440
that he let Lady Tao
adopt Zifang as a cover.

210
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,640
I believed him.

211
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,160
But I happened to see him

212
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,680
having an affair with Lady Tao.

213
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,120
They've been having an affair

214
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,600
for at least half a year.

215
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,120
They just didn't admit it.

216
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,520
Fu Xingui complained

217
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,680
that I was jealous and unreasonable,

218
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,840
I didn't respect him

219
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,320
and I defamed Lady Tao.

220
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,840
He wrote a divorcing letter on the spot.

221
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,400
(I didn't want to sign it, of course.)

222
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,160
(But Lady Tao bribed the clan chief.)

223
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,840
(The clansmen forced me
to put my thumbprint on the letter.)

224
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,240
(Then Zifang showed up,)

225
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,720
(only to say)

226
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,280
(that his father and Lady Tao
had no affair.)

227
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,760
(He said Lady Tao was nice to him.)

228
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,360
(Mouthed: This is my mother.)

229
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,120
(He said I was a bad mother)

230
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,000
(who only cursed him and his father,)

231
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,240
(and forced him to study hard.)

232
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,440
(He said I wasn't nice.)

233
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,480
(March 10)
(He said he hated me.)

234
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,600
(He preferred)

235
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,360
(to take Lady Tao as his mother.)

236
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,800
I gave birth to my son
after two days of difficult labor.

237
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,360
When we were poor,

238
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,600
even when I fainted due to hunger,

239
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,480
I always fed him enough food.

240
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,560
He...

241
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,240
He said he didn't want me.

242
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,680
He said he didn't want me.

243
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,240
Fu Xingui hit me and cursed me.

244
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,600
I was all right with it.

245
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,680
But Fu Zifang...

246
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,440
He's my biological son. But he...

247
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,320
He only wanted Lady Tao.

248
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,240
Then I have nothing

249
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,200
to live for.

250
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,120
You have something.

251
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,440
Your name is Sun Sanniang,

252
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,400
not Fu Zifang's mother.

253
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,200
You're a kind woman.

254
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,920
You can make delicious pastries,

255
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
dishes, and soup.

256
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,560
Neighbors all know that you're virtuous

257
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,240
and bounteous.

258
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,360
Besides,

259
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,040
no children in this world

260
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,760
don't recognize their parents.

261
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,800
I watched Zifang grow up.

262
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,440
A child like him

263
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,200
must be fond of playing.

264
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,280
It's very likely

265
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,920
that Lady Tao

266
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,280
coaxed him with food and toys

267
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,040
so that he said something stupid.

268
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,680
No, no.

269
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,280
Zifang didn't say that
in the heat of the moment.

270
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,880
He just hates me.

271
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,920
I don't even know

272
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,040
when he started to hate me.

273
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,680
He said he hated me

274
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,600
because I kept asking him to study

275
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,320
and I always wanted him

276
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,840
to make me an official's mother.

277
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,720
What have I done wrong?

278
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,920
I must have done something wrong.

279
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,320
I must have done something evil
in my previous life

280
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,640
so that

281
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,080
I was punished in this life.

282
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,920
Think about Fu Xingui.

283
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,160
When he married me,

284
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,840
he was even too poor
to afford the bride-price.

285
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,320
I...

286
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,080
I worked as a butcher

287
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,360
to collect every penny for him!

288
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,800
It took me two years
to collect one string.

289
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,280
I gave all the money to him

290
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,640
so he could start a business.

291
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,200
Now he's rich.

292
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,360
He fell out with me
and became ungrateful.

293
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,480
He forgot what life I was living

294
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,000
as a butcher for two years!

295
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,840
Why did I marry him?

296
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,960
Why did I even have such a bad son?

297
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,120
If I knew I would suffer in this life,

298
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,480
why would I live?

299
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,760
Why would I...?

300
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,240
She's too weak.

301
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,760
She can't be so excited.

302
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,760
Send this to Controller-general Liu.

303
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,960
And this to the Surveillance Office.

304
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,400
As for the gold to Xiuzhou,

305
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,000
you must send it personally.

306
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,960
Then stay in Xiuzhou.

307
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,320
Once Prefect Wang

308
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,360
captures that commander
of the Capital Security Office,

309
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,200
take him back immediately.

310
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,000
Aye. I'm on it.

311
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,960
But Prefect Wang...

312
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,960
Does he really dare to offend
the Capital Security Office?

313
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,240
Money talks, you know.

314
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,960
Over the years, he's taken
a lot of money from me.

315
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,480
He has to help me without reserve.

316
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,640
I don't believe

317
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,640
that commander can still escape
when all commanding officials

318
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,320
in Jiangnan Region
work together to hunt him.

319
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,400
I admire you, Your Honor.

320
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,160
Since she woke up at night,
she's been like this.

321
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,360
Her pulse is smooth.

322
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,080
She isn't wounded, I assume.

323
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,520
Looks like she's out of her mind

324
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,800
after having extreme grief.

325
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,160
She has to see a physician soon.

326
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,560
Otherwise, even if she lives,

327
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,520
she'll probably be demented.

328
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,240
I'll ask Mr. Zheng

329
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,760
to pull up to shore
and I'll take her off the boat.

330
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,160
Stop.

331
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,080
(Jiaxing County)

332
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,600
(Jiaxing County)
Stop.

333
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,240
(Jiaxing County)
Why?

334
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,880
- Stop.
- What is your job?

335
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,120
Sir.

336
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,680
Fine, fine.

337
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,600
I do small business.

338
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,480
Are you a local?

339
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,520
- Yes, yes.
- Away you go.

340
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,400
You, stop.

341
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,040
Off you go.

342
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:14,960
Come over.

343
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,280
You'd better stay on the boat.

344
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,200
You're wanted everywhere.

345
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,720
(What are you doing here?)

346
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,880
What if someone recognizes you?

347
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,880
I saved her life.

348
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,920
I can't watch her go insane.

349
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,840
Now that we're eloping,

350
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,360
I shouldn't let you take your maid

351
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,640
to a clinic alone.

352
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,660
(Tai'an Clinic)
(Superb Medical Skills)

353
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,480
She's out of her mind
due to extreme grief.

354
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,960
With a deficiency of heart and spleen,

355
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,800
she surely feels empty and muddled.

356
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,040
(I'll do the acupuncture on her)

357
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,280
(Notice)
(so that she can drink the decoction.)

358
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,800
(Thank you.)

359
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,900
(200 strings for the report of this man.
By Qiantang County Government)

360
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Would you like the physician
to check on you, too?

361
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,070
This may be a safe place.

362
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,400
When Sanniang can drink the decoction,

363
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,680
we'll get back to the boat immediately.

364
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,680
(Tai'an Clinic)
(Anything specific we need to know about?)

365
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,160
Two things.

366
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,040
First,

367
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,160
rhinoceros horns should have been used.

368
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,640
But they're way too expensive

369
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,680
and I don't have any.

370
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,640
If you want her to recover soon,

371
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,840
you'd better buy some rhinoceros horns

372
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,160
in Guiyuan Pharmacy on West Street.

373
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,920
Rhinoceros horns?

374
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,560
How much do we need to spend?

375
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
For seven days,

376
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,120
at least twenty strings of copper coins.

377
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,280
What about the second thing?

378
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,000
She can't be exposed to wind or moved.

379
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,920
After you leave my clinic,

380
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,640
you'd better settle down in an inn.

381
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,760
She should drink the decoction
for at least seven days.

382
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,240
Seven days?

383
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,040
But we're in a hurry to leave.

384
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,360
Then I can't guarantee

385
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
whether this woman can survive.

386
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,100
(Tai'an Clinic)

387
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,040
Leave us in whatever inn.

388
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,040
Get on the boat and don't wait for us.

389
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,960
Ask someone to send you
to the meeting place.

390
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,240
If you can't get to the Eastern Capital
before Grain Rain,

391
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,280
don't you worry
that Ouyang Xu will marry Miss Gao?

392
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,400
Do you want to lose him?

393
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,640
I don't, but what can I do?

394
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,400
Sanniang's life matters most.

395
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,640
According to the physician,
she needs to rest for seven days.

396
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,520
Then say no more. Get in the carriage.

397
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:53,990
Hurry.

398
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,720
There they are.

399
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,600
Right over there.

400
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,240
That carriage.

401
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,960
After them!

402
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,600
- Stop!
- Stop! Stop!

403
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,080
Stop!

404
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:14,920
Stop the carriage!

405
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,520
Faster.

406
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,800
After them.

407
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,760
Stop!

408
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,600
Stop.

409
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,160
- I can't travel with you anymore.
- Stop!

410
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,590
- Stop the carriage!
- You stop!

411
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,520
Leave with Sanniang first.

412
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,240
Gee!

413
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,640
Gu Qianfan.

414
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,760
Gu Qianfan!

415
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,400
Gu Qianfan!

416
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,400
I'm here.

417
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,800
Here.

418
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,040
Give me your hand.

419
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,640
Are you all right?

420
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,960
Yes.

421
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,160
Then get off me.

422
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,440
It's not that I don't want to get up,

423
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
but I just had a sprain

424
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,960
and my arm had been wounded.

425
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,040
I can't move at all.

426
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,840
Why did you come back to me?

427
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,480
You asked me to leave first,

428
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,440
but didn't say where we would meet.

429
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,320
Then I certainly came back for you.

430
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,320
What a stupid girl!

431
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,920
If you met the pursuing soldiers,

432
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,760
you would have wasted
your chance of escaping.

433
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,920
You're stupid.

434
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,120
Look how weak you are.

435
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,600
If I hadn't come back for you,

436
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,640
you would have been dead.

437
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,720
Sanniang.

438
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,040
Sanniang.

439
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
Now that she's awake, she will be cured.

440
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,040
Get up.

441
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,360
Be careful.

442
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,120
What makes you smile broadly?

443
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,280
The sky is blue and the wind blows.

444
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,840
We're still alive.

445
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,240
And Sanniang can move now.

446
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,840
I can't help feeling happy.

447
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,560
What are we going to do next?

448
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,440
Get back to town.

449
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,800
The most dangerous place is
also the safest.

450
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,620
(Jiaxing Posthouse)

451
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,680
Don't be silly.

452
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,640
This is where officials live.

453
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,920
Only officials can stay.

454
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,040
A pirate doesn't dare to live there.

455
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,640
Come in, please.

456
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,480
This is his certificate.

457
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:10,080
(Certificate)

458
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,200
My mourning period is over.

459
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,120
I'm going back to the capital city
to get reinstated.

460
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,080
Please arrange a room

461
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
for my mother.

462
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,800
No problem.

463
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
Come upstairs, please.

464
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,720
May I have a needle and threads?

465
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,880
We need to patch clothes.

466
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,080
Wait a moment, please.

467
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,240
The certificate looks so real.

468
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,480
Does everyone in the Capital Security Office
have a few pieces?

469
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,520
Gu Qianfan isn't your real name, is it?

470
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,360
How do you know it looks real?

471
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
Did you see another one before?

472
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,200
Yes. When I was little.

473
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,520
My name and my certificate

474
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,840
are both real.

475
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,520
Sir, the needle and threads.

476
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,680
I lied to a lot of people.

477
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,440
But I don't want to lie to you.

478
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,520
What...?

479
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,080
What are the needles for?

480
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,640
The physician asked us
to buy rhinoceros horns.

481
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,560
That's way too ridiculous.

482
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,520
I think he exaggerated
Sanniang's problem

483
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,880
just to make more money.

484
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,080
I want to do acupuncture on her.

485
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,960
Maybe it'll help with the dissipation
of her extravasated blood.

486
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Will it work?

487
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,120
I used it when I interrogated criminals.

488
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,800
Do you think it will work?

489
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,960
Don't stay here.

490
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,000
If you watch, you'll feel sad.

491
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,920
Wait downstairs.

492
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,120
She woke up.

493
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,560
You're awake?

494
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,480
Thank you for what you did today.

495
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,720
You had a long day.

496
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,400
It never happened before.

497
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,200
Someone thanked me for such torture.

498
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,800
A weapon can be used
to kill people or save people.

499
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,880
Today,

500
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,920
you smiled twice.

501
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,440
It never happened before, either.

502
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,680
Did I smile?

503
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,760
Come and have some tea.

504
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,280
How dare you be so rude to me!

505
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,760
Believe it or not, I'll torture you.

506
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,240
Do it, then.

507
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,600
You did that before, anyway.

508
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,360
I'm not scared.

509
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,560
Go.

510
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,640
But...

511
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,200
Hurry.

512
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,840
Sanniang.

513
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,560
Go.

514
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,800
Sanniang, why did you do that?

515
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,080
He's a bad man.

516
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,160
He's hunted

517
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,520
and there's an arrest warrant for him.

518
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,360
I saw that back in my hometown.

519
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,240
He just pricked my finger.

520
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,880
And he even tried to torture you.

521
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,440
Oh, Sanniang.

522
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,440
This is a misunderstanding.

523
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,200
You...

524
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,000
Get the medicine to me, Sanniang.

525
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,640
My medical kit.

526
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,080
Give it to me.

527
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,320
Even if this is a misunderstanding,

528
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,480
we still have to leave immediately.

529
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,480
He's from the Capital Security Office.

530
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,840
Everyone there is ruthless.

531
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,440
We must run.

532
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,720
He saved your life. We can't just leave.

533
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,240
If we leave him alone

534
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,840
and he is detected by the soldiers,

535
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,440
he will be doomed.

536
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,640
But he's a wanted criminal.

537
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,440
If we're implicated,

538
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,360
how can you marry Ouyang Xu?

539
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,800
No matter who he really is,

540
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,080
I just take him as a friend now.

541
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,360
He didn't tell me anything.

542
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,520
But I'm quite aware.

543
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,440
Look, he's hunted by so many soldiers.

544
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,200
Someone powerful must be

545
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,560
behind Yang Zhiyuan's murder case.

546
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,640
Now that he promised me

547
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,880
that he would risk investigating it,

548
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,240
we can't leave him alone.

549
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,440
But when he met you for the first time,

550
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,280
he was so rude to you.

551
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,760
Can you believe him?

552
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,240
Do you believe me?

553
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,800
I do, of course.

554
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,720
I believe him.

555
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,600
I'll stop arguing.

556
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,600
You're smarter than me, anyway.

557
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,320
I'll just listen to you.

558
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,040
Now that you're awake,

559
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,840
you must straighten up.

560
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,320
You were deceived
by Fu Xingui for ten years.

561
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,920
But it's better than being deceived
for a lifetime.

562
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,640
Some people can be very duplicitous.

563
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,760
Magistrate Zheng Qingtian, for example.

564
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,560
I used to think he was a nice man

565
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,280
until Mr. Yang Zhiyuan was murdered.

566
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,960
And look at Gu Qianfan.

567
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,560
I hated him in the first place.

568
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,920
But in the past few days, I realized

569
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,160
that he was a good man.

570
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,160
When did you wake up?

571
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,200
Sorry, Sanniang, she...

572
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,600
Never mind.

573
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,640
I won't be angry with a sick woman.

574
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,600
By the way,

575
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,440
when did you start
to suspect Zheng Qingtian?

576
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,960
You said Commandant of Ninghai Army
wounded you.

577
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,160
But those who just hunted us were

578
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,240
obviously subordinates

579
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,240
of Director-in-chief of Xiuzhou.

580
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,000
Since the last dynasty,

581
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,040
the two divisions have hated each other.

582
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,440
Why are they helping each other now?

583
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,480
Then I thought of

584
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,720
the Magistrate of Qiantang County
who issued the arrest warrant.

585
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,880
He asserts that you're a pirate

586
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,920
and this is weird.

587
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,760
You also talked
about the most dangerous place.

588
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,680
How can the Magistrate
of Qiantang County

589
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,560
interfere with business in Xiuzhou?

590
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,880
Mr. Yang Zhiyuan is of 6th rank.

591
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,960
But they killed him without hesitation.

592
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,600
Who knows how huge the benefits can be?

593
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,040
Do you know why I dared
to check in with my real name?

594
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,800
Because I'm suspecting something.

595
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,840
Just now, I sent my location

596
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,840
to the nearest station

597
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,680
of the Capital Security Office
by pigeon.

598
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,560
I'll see what is going to happen.

599
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,320
We need to live in another inn.

600
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,060
(Notice)
(Qiantang County Government)

601
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:08,660
(Notice)
(Qiantang County Government)

602
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,900
(Notice)
(Qiantang County Government)

603
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,580
(Huating County)

604
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,640
Mr. Zhou,

605
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,720
have one more drink with me.

606
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,000
All right. Use the fur cup

607
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,400
and I'll keep drinking with you.

608
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,160
Here.

609
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,800
Well, well, isn't this Mr. Zhou?

610
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,000
Mr. Xu?

611
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,720
Be seated, please.

612
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,920
(Mr. Xu)
She's a pretty girl.

613
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,160
Sit down.

614
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,680
Sit?

615
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,920
Yes.

616
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,000
You owe me 50 strings of copper coins.

617
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:53,960
When are you going to pay me back?

618
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,520
My cargos haven't arrived yet.

619
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,560
When they arrive,
I'll pay you back immediately.

620
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,880
Tush!

621
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,600
Don't, don't.

622
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,840
Mr. Xu, Mr. Xu.

623
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,920
It's a misunderstanding, Mr. Xu!

624
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Mr. Xu, Mr. Xu.

625
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,840
Mr. Xu, don't get me wrong!

626
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,400
Mr. Xu, Mr. Xu, it's a misunderstanding.

627
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,040
Mr. Xu, I just have a money problem.

628
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,440
All my shops have been mortgaged.

629
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,230
Mr. Xu,

630
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,080
I'll go get the money!

631
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,440
I'll go right away!

632
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,120
You have only one day.

633
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,670
If you still don't pay me back...

634
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,150
Go.

635
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,440
Honey,

636
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:24,960
you must be hungry.

637
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,440
It smells so good.

638
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,840
Come over.

639
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,680
You don't want the food?

640
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,440
Don't be scared.

641
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:56,920
Do you feel cold?

642
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,080
Your hands are so cold.

643
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,400
And look at your hair.

644
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,120
What a mess!

645
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,800
Don't be afraid.

646
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,160
Don't be scared.

647
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,760
Come over. Come. Right.

648
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,520
Yinzhang,

649
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,840
your husband is in trouble now.

650
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,680
Do you remember the ruffian Mr. Xu?

651
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,240
He came to ask for his money again.

652
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,640
To marry you,

653
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,200
I borrowed twenty strings from him.

654
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,800
Now, we're married.

655
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,760
I have to pay him back, right?

656
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,760
So, could you give me

657
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,000
a bit more of your stash?

658
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,520
It's not that I don't give it to you,

659
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,680
but I'm out of money.

660
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,280
I really have no money.

661
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,560
Why can't you be honest?

662
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,200
You're a famous performer
from Qiantang County

663
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,920
and a pipa master in Jiangnan Region.

664
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,280
How could you be out of money?

665
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,880
Then why did you have money

666
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,440
after I hit you last time?

667
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,440
Last time,

668
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,800
I impawned my jewels

669
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,480
for a string of copper coins.

670
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,160
Why do you still deny it?

671
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,600
Believe it or not,

672
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,960
I will burn your face!

673
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,080
Do you believe it?

674
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,760
My money is indeed kept by Pan'er.

675
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,080
Even if you killed me,
I would still say so.

676
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,480
How dare you!

677
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,960
Come on. Stab.

678
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,080
Stab yourself!

679
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:45,920
Get up!

680
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,660
(Arrest Warrant)

681
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,480
Pan'er.

682
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,280
I bought this. How does it look?

683
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,200
I'll see if there's anything delicious.

684
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,740
(Arrest Warrant)

685
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,280
Look, you're such a beautiful lady.

686
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,120
The fire coral is perfect for you.

687
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,400
Sir, how about buying it for your wife?

688
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,520
All right.

689
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,680
See you, sir.

690
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,720
Is there also a spy
in the Capital Security Office?

691
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,440
In a high position, I'm afraid.

692
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,400
In case of getting implicated,

693
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,800
Mr. Zheng will not tell them about you.

694
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,600
You're only delayed by one day.

695
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,200
If you travel by carriage

696
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,560
with a good Armed Escort,

697
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,240
you can reach the Eastern Capital
before Grain Rain.

698
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,080
Take the gold

699
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,480
as your traveling expenses.

700
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,280
No way. You're all alone now.

701
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,520
If we both leave,

702
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,440
what will you do?

703
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,040
I'm not alone. Don't you remember?

704
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,720
Wan Qi at Xiuzhou Branch
of the Capital Security Office

705
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,320
has the most tremendous bonds with me.

706
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,680
What if you get in trouble

707
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,360
before you meet him?

708
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,040
How about we escort you?

709
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,400
It's more convenient for me to go alone.

710
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,880
You may not know

711
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,640
my nickname
in the Capital Security Office.

712
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,240
Living Devil.

713
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,640
Unless I want to die,
no one can kill me.

714
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,240
Yinping!

715
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,200
Sanniang?

716
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,560
Sanniang.

717
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,400
Ms. Zhao?

718
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,360
Why are you here?

719
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,280
Ms. Zhao,

720
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,080
please save Yinzhang.

721
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,600
Zhou She has tortured her.

722
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,200
What?

723
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,120
She's almost dying.

724
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,760
Shortly after the wedding,

725
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,560
he was nice and considerate.

726
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,200
But when we arrived in Huating County,

727
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,480
he took us ashore,

728
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,040
saying that his old illness recurred,

729
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,080
he needed to stay for rest

730
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,280
and couldn't go to Yingtian Prefecture.

731
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,280
The next day,
he asked Yinzhang for money

732
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,760
to buy expensive medicinal materials.

733
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,960
Yinzhang gave him the money
a couple of times

734
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,600
before she sensed something fishy.

735
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,240
I asked around and got to know

736
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,920
that Huating County was his hometown.

737
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,040
Yinzhang questioned him,

738
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,440
and then he lost his temper.

739
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,240
He complained of bad business

740
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,800
and asked Yinzhang not to interfere.

741
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,920
He even forced her to give him

742
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,520
500 strings from her dowry.

743
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,120
She refused and got beaten.

744
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,760
I'm keeping Yinzhang's dowry.

745
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,240
How could she get so much money?

746
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,280
She didn't have the money.

747
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,920
She had planned to ask you for the money

748
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,960
after you cooled down.

749
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,400
But in case of disgrace,

750
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,080
when she got married,

751
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,560
she had some rocks

752
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,160
wrapped in brocade

753
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,880
and put in a dozen boxes.

754
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,800
How stupid she was!

755
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,880
No one can save her, but you.

756
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,880
I was sold the day before yesterday.

757
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,080
At that time...

758
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,120
At that time,

759
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,080
Yinzhang was beaten so badly
that she couldn't even stand up.

760
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,000
She was locked in the woodshed,
waiting to die.

761
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,360
How far does Zhou She live from here?

762
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:23,960
Not very far.

763
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,440
In Huating County, 50 li from here.
[*50 li: Equals 25 kilometers]

764
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,560
Commander Gu, may I have a word with you?

765
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,000
Before you leave,

766
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,040
may I beg you for something?

767
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,720
Try to help someone again?

768
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,760
It takes quite a lot of time

769
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,880
to save a married woman.

770
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,560
Don't you want to reach
the Eastern Capital before Grain Rain?

771
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,600
Yinzhang matters more than Ouyang Xu.

772
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,600
If I can't make it to the capital city,

773
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,200
it's just my fate.

774
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,720
Could you lend me a little more money?

775
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,600
How much do you want?

776
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,520
Ten taels of gold, at least.

777
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,120
How do I have so much money?

778
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,840
You do.

779
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,600
When you were in a coma on the boat,

780
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,640
I found two bars of gold from your robe.

781
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,680
The gold you gave me

782
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,680
was just taken from it.

783
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,520
You...!

784
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,240
No way.

785
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,920
That gold token is vital to me.

786
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,720
I can't give it to you.

787
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,360
I beg you, all right?

788
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,480
I'll pay you back later.

789
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,600
I'm not finding an excuse.

790
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,760
I just can't give it to you.

791
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,580
I have one thing.

792
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,760
Can I exchange it for your gold?

793
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,040
You asked Mr. Yang Zhiyuan

794
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,640
for The Night Revels, right?

795
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,800
I have the authentic painting.
