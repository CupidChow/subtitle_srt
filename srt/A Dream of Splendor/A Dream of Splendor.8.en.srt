=Episode 8=

17
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,320
My lady,

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,840
just say it.

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,680
Okay.

20
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,800
Xu,

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,600
I heard from the servants

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,400
that you were

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,560
talking with a lady

24
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,600
at our front door days ago.

25
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,960
Which lady?

26
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,280
It should be Mrs. Wang.

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,000
I rented her yard before.

28
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,280
I ran across her

29
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,000
at the gate of your house.

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,120
Never mind.

31
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,000
Whether it's Mrs. Wang,

32
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,160
or any other ladies,

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,000
whoever is good to you

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,040
is my benefactor.

35
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,160
I didn't have time to tell you
before engagement.

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,240
I'm not a jealous woman.

37
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,880
If you have

38
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,520
any close lady friends,

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,880
you can get them here.

40
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,480
I'll sister them and treat them well.

41
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,040
We can recite poetry, make paintings,

42
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,360
and do needlework together.

43
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,080
Isn't that

44
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,320
a nice thing?

45
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,880
Who is there?

46
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,280
Don't worry.

47
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,560
No one else.

48
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,440
My steward Uncle De, who has been
looking after me since childhood.

49
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,000
He is having measles recently,

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,840
so I asked him to rest in the side room.

51
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,240
Measles! He's having measles!

52
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,960
Nanny.

53
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,440
It's not very serious.

54
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,320
Uncle De, I know what you mean.

55
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,200
I will

56
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,040
keep in mind the family motto.

57
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,120
I will not marry two women in my life.

58
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,640
Really?

59
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,440
But I heard that

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,800
there were many ladies who fancied you.

61
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,800
If Mr. Ouyang can do what you say,

62
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,960
it would be the best.

63
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,480
I'm done.

64
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,640
You drew so well.

65
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,560
I'm not that pretty.

66
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,280
Nonsense.

67
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,720
I'm not a good painter.

68
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,400
I didn't present half of your beauty.

69
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,160
August 15 at Moon Watch Pavilion
in Qiantang,

70
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,640
by Ouyang Jiming.

71
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,320
Your name is Xu,
your literary name is Jiming.

72
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,480
But I prefer to call you Ouyang.

73
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,080
I'll be much happier

74
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,200
if you call me darling.

75
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,160
When you put the hairpin on me.

76
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,600
Okay. Deal.

77
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,280
(My lady, we need to go.)

78
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,680
We're not supposed to be late

79
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,040
for Princess Xianping's banquet.

80
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,160
It's getting late.

81
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,960
Nanny,

82
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,680
wait for me outside.

83
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,720
Um, Xu.

84
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,200
I'll be looking forward to

85
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,840
appreciating peach blossom

86
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,080
in Qinghui Garden with you.

87
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,320
Of course.

88
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,040
Come out.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,600
You...

90
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,000
Why did you interrupt me?

91
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,680
Haven't you been worried that

92
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,000
you can't take Zhao Pan'er
as your legal wife?

93
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,680
Since Ms. Gao has mentioned it,

94
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,920
you should take the chance

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,680
to marry Zhao as your second wife.

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,960
Do you really think

97
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,040
Gao Hui can accept Pan'er
as my second wife?

98
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,920
Why can't she?

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,080
The second wife sounds nice,

100
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,520
but she is still a concubine
in the genealogy.

101
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,880
Ms. Gao looks like

102
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,200
a decent lady to me,

103
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,240
maybe she would agree.

104
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,760
Being jealous and envious

105
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,880
is not accepted in a noble house.

106
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,160
Do you really think she's not jealous?

107
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,160
Why?

108
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,480
Do you remember

109
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,240
last time when we were
at Lieutenant Yang's house?

110
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,960
Yes.

111
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,400
A lady of the Su family,

112
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,880
sister of Su Xingyuan in the third list,

113
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,840
brought you plum blossoms.

114
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,680
Three days later

115
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,320
she fell accidentally when she went out.

116
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,400
Since then her left eye became blind.

117
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,240
At first,

118
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,840
I thought it was just a coincidence.

119
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,720
Later at the Luming Banquet,

120
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,600
Collator Mr. Gong wanted to betroth

121
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,120
his youngest daughter to me.

122
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,800
Something happened to his family too.

123
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,320
One day when his little daughter
was on a boat trip,

124
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,680
the boat capsized unexpectedly.

125
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,400
Though she lived,

126
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,160
her clothes were all wet

127
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,120
and all of this was witnessed
by many people.

128
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,000
With such humiliation,

129
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,440
she came out of family
and became a female Taoist.

130
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,320
So you think

131
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,600
all of this has something
to do with Gao Hui?

132
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,160
You are in love with someone else,
so I burnt the token of our love.

133
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,040
Not only have I burnt it,
I've spread its ashes in the air.

134
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,160
From now on,

135
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,200
I won't miss you anymore.

136
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,880
There is no more love between us.

137
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,440
Now you have burnt it.
The source of your illness is gone.

138
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,640
Take the medicine.

139
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,320
What do we do next?

140
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,000
Do you want to report him
to the government,

141
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,840
or go back to Qiantang?

142
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,480
I used to think I have a strong heart.

143
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,800
Now things happened,

144
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,840
my mind is completely blank.

145
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,240
I can't think of anything.

146
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,840
Where is Yinzhang?

147
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,800
I haven't seen her yet.

148
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,680
She stayed up all night

149
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,520
to take care of you.

150
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,040
I asked her to go to get some sleep.

151
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,800
That's all for tonight.

152
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,800
If you behave well tomorrow,

153
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,320
I will take you back to your room

154
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,480
and you can still be
the mistress of this house.

155
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,920
If you don't,

156
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,640
I'll torture you slowly.

157
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,000
Left leg first, then your right leg.

158
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,600
Left hand first, then your right hand.

159
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,080
I'll break them one by one.

160
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,360
Understand?

161
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,280
Do you understand?

162
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,200
Don't hit me.

163
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,440
I'm out of money. I really am.

164
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,000
Yinzhang, it's us.

165
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,360
You had a nightmare.

166
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,800
It's okay now.

167
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,760
Keep sleeping.

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,120
Zhou She hit me.

169
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,720
He called me a slut.

170
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,360
He-He sold my Moon.

171
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,200
Your Moon is here.

172
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,560
See? It's here.

173
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,280
Don't touch it.

174
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,280
I've been watching over it.

175
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,680
Zhou She has been exiled.

176
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,960
We've got your lute back.

177
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,200
I can't get over it.

178
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,600
The whole Jiangnan knows
the scandal of me.

179
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,040
Ouyang Xu betrayed Pan'er.

180
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,960
I'm over.

181
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,720
No one can redeem me.

182
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,080
I'm too ashamed to live, Pan'er...

183
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,240
She can't be so excited anymore.

184
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,520
What are you going to do?

185
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,680
I'm going to draw up a deed.

186
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,080
Okay.

187
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,000
Her father is a high-ranking official
in the court,

188
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,440
and her aunt is the favorite concubine
of His Majesty.

189
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,800
She might think

190
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,680
that everything in the world

191
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,920
would be hers if she asks for.

192
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,400
Including me.

193
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,800
This...

194
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,160
Think about it, the sister
of the presented scholar,

195
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,760
the daughter of a sixth-rank official,

196
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,720
she hurt them irresponsibly.

197
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,560
I'm just from an ordinary family,

198
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,880
if I dare to defy her,

199
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,680
what would she do to me?

200
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,320
What would she do to Pan'er?

201
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,320
Then why do you want to

202
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
take Zhao as your concubine?

203
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,920
Actually

204
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,040
I said that to irrigate Pan'er.

205
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,600
I know her too well,

206
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,800
how would she stand
the insult of being a concubine?

207
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,320
As long as she leaves,

208
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,880
as long as Gao Hui
doesn't know her existence,

209
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,320
I can keep her safe.

210
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,320
I see.

211
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,760
You wanted to protect her.

212
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,880
You wanted her to be mad at you

213
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,480
and leave the Capital.

214
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,240
No wonder you said

215
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,320
I helped you being thrown
into the river.

216
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,040
In fact,

217
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,360
from the moment I fell in love
with Pan'er,

218
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,200
she's been the only one in my heart.

219
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,960
If it wasn't for her,

220
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,960
I wouldn't be able to endure

221
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,800
the cold nights during my study.

222
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,600
I wouldn't have money
to afford a great scholar

223
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,760
and take the exam in the Capital.

224
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,240
For all these years,

225
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,480
I have been fantasizing about

226
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,640
getting presented

227
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,640
and marrying her in the public eye.

228
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,680
Then I'll focus on poetry and painting,

229
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,280
and live with her forever.

230
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,920
But unfortunately...

231
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,800
Oh right, Changfeng.

232
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,040
Since you saw Pan'er,

233
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,440
how was she?

234
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,960
Was she sad?

235
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,840
My eyesight is poor.

236
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,000
I didn't see her clearly.

237
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,240
She sounded

238
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,960
quite weak.

239
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,560
And I smelt medicine in her room.

240
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,640
Is she sick?

241
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,880
I have to see her.

242
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,280
Don't.

243
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,040
Don't.

244
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,200
You can't see her.

245
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,480
Since you choose to protect her
in this way,

246
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,960
you must be patient about it.

247
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,200
If the Gao family knows,

248
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,200
all your efforts would go in vain.

249
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,320
Yeah.

250
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,040
Even if I go to see her,

251
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,600
she wouldn't want to see me.

252
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,120
(Gu Qianfan,)

253
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,240
(if you see this deed)

254
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,600
(you would mock me
for being inconsistent.)

255
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,240
(Deed)
(But Yinzhang is my liability.)

256
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,800
(I'm not from a wealthy family,)

257
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,320
(or the royal family,)

258
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,880
(but I must protect her.)

259
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,020
(Divorcing paper, help Yinzhang,
return the Night Revels)

260
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,950
(Drafted by Zhao Pan'er)
(So,)

261
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,600
(exchange the lost love)

262
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,360
(for the happiness of Yinzhang,)

263
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,280
(I won't regret it.)

264
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,100
(If Ouyang Xu can do these three things,
Zhao Pan'er will not see him anymore.)

265
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:34,380
(Live For Eternity)

266
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,480
Father,

267
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,720
I brought Qianfan to you today.

268
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,080
When you were alive,

269
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,840
(Tomb of Duke Xiao Huihao of Guanglu Temple)
you urged me to get married.

270
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,080
Looking at your eldest grandson,

271
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,320
you should rest in peace now.

272
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,280
Look at him,

273
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,600
young and handsome.

274
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,160
He looks so like me when I was young.

275
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,400
There are sacrificing and monument
-washing customs in Jiangnan.

276
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,960
(Tomb of Duke Xiao Huihao of Guanglu Temple)
You should do it for your grandfather.

277
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,520
In the imperial books,

278
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,240
my grandfather was Gu Shenyan,
the Minister of Officials.

279
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,760
Good.

280
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,960
I won't force you.

281
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,880
Can you as least go see

282
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Xiao's ancestral house with me?

283
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,000
Don't tell me that you don't have
the Xiao's blood in you.

284
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:47,420
(Tomb of Duke Xiao Huihao of Guanglu Temple)

285
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,420
(Auspiciousness)

286
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,840
(Concentration)

287
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,520
My lord.

288
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,920
This hairpin is so pretty.

289
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,760
Are you going to give it

290
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,200
to Lady Gao in the ceremony?

291
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,240
No.

292
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,830
What's wrong?

293
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,070
A lady named Zhao wants to see you.

294
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,240
Pan'er.

295
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,880
How did you

296
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,600
find me here?

297
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,320
I gave ten coins to the flower girl
at the gate of Gao's house,

298
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,240
she told me you are here.

299
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,480
It's just a few days,

300
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,120
you've become much thinner.

301
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,040
Because I have conscience.

302
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,760
Aren't you going to let me in?

303
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,880
Please come in.

304
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,760
Please.

305
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,280
Pan'er.

306
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,040
I know I have

307
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,080
broken your heart doing this.

308
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,680
But don't worry,

309
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,960
I will treat you well in the future.

310
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,520
Besides,

311
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,800
Lady Gao came yesterday

312
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,120
and said that

313
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,680
she would be good to you, too.

314
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,160
You will get along with each other.

315
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,080
I wish you

316
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,160
happiness and more concubines.

317
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,080
But,

318
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,680
I won't be one of them.

319
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,080
Mr. Ouyang,

320
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,840
I came to you today

321
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,080
just to make a deal with you.

322
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,360
A deal?

323
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,400
Do you know how your name
came about?

324
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,080
When I traveled with your mother
to Taihu Lake

325
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,240
and saw such beautiful scenery,

326
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,371
I said "thousands of sailboats pass by
[*Thousands of sailboats: Qianfan]

327
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:11,480
but the one I expected has no trace".

328
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,200
What?

329
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,880
Are you tired?

330
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,760
I'm just wondering

331
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,560
what they will do with Zheng Qingtian.

332
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,640
He is dead,

333
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,120
what else is there to do?

334
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,080
His Majesty is benevolent.

335
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,680
He won't exterminate three generations.

336
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,880
Are you worried about
the Capital Security Office?

337
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,200
I've sent someone to Lei Jing.

338
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,320
I resorted to force and then peace.

339
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,560
In the future,

340
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,600
this old fellow will be nice to you.

341
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,720
Anyway, you don't have
to hold grudges on him

342
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,000
for what he did to murder you.

343
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,960
Not happy about the result, are you?

344
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,720
But you have no evidence in your hand

345
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,200
that he accepted Zheng Qingtian's bribe.

346
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,040
Since you can't kill him in one shot,

347
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,120
better keep him for other use.

348
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,000
You can find his weakness

349
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,600
in the future.

350
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,560
I did this

351
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,400
for your own good.

352
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,520
I'm afraid it's not just for me.

353
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,760
The money you gave to Uncle De

354
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,880
can buy my grace of saving your life,

355
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,880
but it can't redeem
your betrayal of my trust.

356
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,080
I will never degrade myself
as a concubine.

357
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,640
If you want to break off
the marriage with me,

358
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,240
and go become
the Gao Family's son-in-law,

359
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,560
you'd better do as this deed says.

360
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,020
(Deed)

361
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,120
Otherwise I won't let you
get away with it.

362
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,180
(Deed)

363
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,320
First of all,

364
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,520
you swore as a son-in-law

365
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,600
in front of my parents' tomb

366
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,000
that you would protect me all my life.

367
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,480
Now that you're going
to abandon the marriage,

368
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,440
please write a divorcing letter

369
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,760
so that I can burn it to my parents

370
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,520
when I go back to Qiantang.

371
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,200
That would be
my explanation to them.

372
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,440
Secondly, you once promised Yinzhang

373
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,880
that once you become an official,

374
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,480
you will help her get out
of her current status.

375
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,120
Now that you are the noble
son-in-law of the Gao family,

376
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,720
(Drafted by Zhao Pan'er)
it is not difficult for you to do so.

377
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,360
Thirdly, my Night Revels
you brought to the Capital

378
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,480
you said you would find
a craftsman to frame it.

379
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,520
Please return it to me now.

380
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,760
For a merchant like me,

381
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,280
a deed is more effective than an oath.

382
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,640
If you can do the above three things,

383
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,600
I will go my ways and you go yours,

384
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,280
I will have nothing to do with you

385
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,280
and I will never see you again.

386
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,080
But if you don't do it,

387
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,400
I'll announce

388
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,080
to the whole world
that we were engaged.

389
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,200
Don't blame me

390
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,080
for ruining your future

391
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,840
by then.

392
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,960
Pan'er.

393
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,240
If you are heartless,

394
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,240
then I'll be ruthless.

395
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,400
(Deed)
Do you agree or not?

396
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,160
I don't have much patience now.

397
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,280
I'll count to ten.

398
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,480
One.

399
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,280
Two.

400
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,360
Three.

401
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,800
I agree.

402
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,040
I knew it.

403
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,880
Where is the painting?

404
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,760
I'll go find it for you.

405
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,960
You're going back to the Capital
as the Minister.

406
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,240
Having been left for three years,

407
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,400
you are worried about
whether His Majesty

408
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,720
still trusts you as before.

409
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,920
Letting go of Lei Jing

410
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,160
is equivalent to

411
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,000
getting the support
of the entire Security Office.

412
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,720
Kill two birds with one stone.

413
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,920
You're truly my son.

414
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,200
Very smart.

415
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,960
You have been serving
in the Security Office for many years,

416
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,560
why do you think
Lei Jing could sell you so easily?

417
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,400
Because you're just a little commander.

418
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,800
If you are my son,

419
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,920
if you are a Hanlin scholar,

420
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,640
how dare he do this to you?

421
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,720
I don't understand
what you are talking about.

422
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,840
Yes, you do.

423
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,840
Your situation

424
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,120
is no different from mine.

425
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,480
I have a notorious name as a Minister,

426
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,880
but you, as the court's hound,

427
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,200
are so noble?

428
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,120
Qianfan,

429
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,360
there are only two of us here.

430
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,720
Can you be honest with me?

431
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,480
Can you tell me

432
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,920
why you insist on

433
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,600
staying in the Security Office
all these years?

434
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,760
I have tried many times

435
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,080
to transfer you from
that dangerous place,

436
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,400
but you refused.

437
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,240
You were once a presented scholar,

438
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,040
why do you want

439
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,800
to gang up with those
eunuchs and soldiers?

440
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Look at these wounds on you.

441
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,160
Can you tell me why?

442
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,760
You have never understood.

443
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,320
Understand what?

444
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,000
Never mind.

445
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,440
I lost something important.
I'm going to find it.

446
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,840
See you.

447
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,360
I've just moved in.

448
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,440
Uncle De organizes everything for me.

449
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,600
I don't know where he
put the painting.

450
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,360
You sent Du Changfeng there, didn't you?

451
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,320
No.

452
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,120
How long will it take
for Yinzhang's thing?

453
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,760
I don't have any position now.

454
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,760
So I can only ask Changfeng for help.

455
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,880
His family is famous in the Capital.

456
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,240
But don't worry,

457
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,360
I promise you

458
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,600
I'll give you an answer
within three days.

459
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,840
Good.

460
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,120
As for the painting...

461
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,400
I'm afraid I can't find it
in a short time.

462
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,160
If I find it tomorrow,

463
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,320
I'll take it to the inn for you.

464
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,680
Okay, I'll wait for three days.

465
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,840
Ouyang,

466
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,800
don't fail me again.

467
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,480
Pan'er, wait.

468
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,160
I have a hairpin to...

469
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,000
Mr. Ouyang,

470
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,400
now that you are a stranger to me,

471
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,240
please call me Ms. Zhao.

472
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,880
Xiao Qinyan, you bastard!

473
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,480
None of your ancestors

474
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,760
were good people.

475
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,680
The Xiao family are all evils

476
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,280
(Live For Eternity)
from generation to generation.

477
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,440
You killed my teacher Wang Di!

478
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,240
(Tomb of Duke Xiao Huihao of Guanglu Temple)
You're not getting away with it.

479
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,560
Pay for your son's debt!

480
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,280
Old Xiao,

481
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,560
you won't have peace in the hell.

482
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,280
Villainous traitor!

483
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,040
Let me give you a good bath.

484
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,560
Go.

485
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,080
What is it?

486
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,440
Seize them. Go!

487
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,320
- Beat them. Beat them to death.
- Let go of me!

488
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,440
Rip her mouth.

489
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,280
Stop it!

490
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,160
Rot in hell!

491
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,120
Kill me if you dare.

492
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,920
Let go of them.

493
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,200
Commander Gu.

494
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,360
Let go of them.

495
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,360
Let go.

496
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,920
Them too.

497
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,520
Let go.

498
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,080
Does this happen a lot?

499
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,960
No.

500
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,800
Every year on Tomb-sweeping Day
and Ghost Festival.

501
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,700
(Tomb of Duke Xiao Huihao of Guanglu Temple)

502
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,440
Go fetch water.

503
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,160
Yes, my lord.

504
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,160
Go fetch water.

505
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,000
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,300
(Tomb of Duke Xiao Huihao of Guanglu Temple)

507
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,180
Wipe it clean.

508
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,820
(Tomb of Duke Xiao Huihao of Guanglu Temple)

509
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:59,220
(Tomb of Duke Xiao Huihao of Guanglu Temple)

510
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,640
Leave.

511
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,060
(Live For Eternity)

512
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Grandfather, please forgive me.

513
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,760
I just want to be a good man.

514
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:33,780
(Live For Eternity)

515
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,160
No.

516
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,520
After you left,

517
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,600
I had your room checked
by the servants.

518
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,960
Nothing was left.

519
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,080
Maybe Uncle De

520
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,800
has given the painting to our teacher

521
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
by mistake?

522
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,400
By mistake?

523
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,640
I'm afraid it wasn't given by mistake.

524
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,520
When Uncle De lived at my place,

525
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,720
he often said that
you are poor at socializing.

526
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,160
Our teacher favors you the most,

527
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,480
but the gifts you gave to him
are too cheap.

528
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,560
He also said,

529
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,040
you should go out with
Inspector Gao to broaden your horizons.

530
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,240
If that painting,

531
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,400
S-Spring Revels or Night Revels?

532
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,240
If it's really the work of Wang Ai,

533
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,200
it's not surprising that Uncle De
added it to the gift list.

534
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,160
What should I do now?

535
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,040
You can do nothing.

536
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,120
Our teacher has just resigned.

537
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,920
If you go get the painting now

538
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,600
it will make you a hypocrite

539
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,080
who hits people when they're down.

540
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,720
I guess I can only wait.

541
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,360
Oh right.

542
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,760
I have one more thing
that I need your help.

543
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,840
Tell me.

544
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,000
You have an uncle

545
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,480
who works in Taichang Temple.

546
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,680
So he can make some help

547
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,960
regarding the registered musicians.

548
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,920
Registered musicians?

549
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,360
Do you want to redeem someone?

550
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,600
An old friend.

551
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,120
This is not proper.

552
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,440
I don't care about the relationship
between you and this old friend.

553
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,040
You have just become
a presented scholar.

554
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,200
If you want to help some performers
get rid of their status so badly,

555
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,200
people would laugh at you.

556
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,200
I'm also entrusted by someone.

557
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,120
Changfeng, look...

558
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,880
When you are an official,

559
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,480
you can't act like
ordinary people anymore.

560
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,760
Besides, we're going
to meet His Majesty to get granted.

561
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,920
If at this time, if...

562
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,280
Someone knows about it
and reports you,

563
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,000
you will be sent to
a small remote county,

564
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,720
or put you aside for a few years,

565
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,520
then your life is over.

566
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,000
Maybe it's a good thing for me.

567
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,320
If I'm demoted,

568
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,840
Gao Hui would

569
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,240
give up on me.

570
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,440
I don't think so.

571
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,280
I don't think the Gao family would

572
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,480
break off the marriage.

573
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,280
They only need
to put something in here...

574
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,880
You will die of a sudden illness.

575
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,560
Then Gao Hui

576
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,720
doesn't have to go to the backcountry

577
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,600
with you.

578
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,800
Uncle De is back, my lord.

579
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,760
Uncle De.

580
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,360
My lord.

581
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,480
My lord.

582
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,480
Uncle De.

583
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,400
Greetings, my lord.

584
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
I'm useless.

585
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,080
I failed to do what you asked.

586
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,720
And Zhao Pan'er fooled me.

587
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,280
I ask for punishment.

588
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,120
Fooled you?

589
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,280
Absolutely no.

590
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,760
You can't write the divorcing letter.

591
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,200
Why?

592
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,560
Think about it.

593
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,000
Zhao is full of tricks.

594
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,800
She was raised in a brothel,

595
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,320
full mouth of nonsense.

596
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,200
If she gets the divorcing letter

597
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,360
and turns against you,

598
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,560
and sues you
for breaking off a marriage,

599
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,880
what will you do then?

600
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,680
Enough!

601
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,400
Don't insult Pan'er.

602
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Good advice is harsh to the ear,
my lord.

603
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,480
She refused to give me
the Jade Pendant

604
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,920
but asked you for divorcing letter.

605
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,240
This is definitely a trap.

606
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,800
If there is a divorcing letter,

607
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,400
there must be a marriage contract.

608
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,640
Don't you understand?

609
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,320
Zhao is your benefactor.

610
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,440
Although I didn't like her very much,

611
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,280
I wouldn't

612
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,080
slander a woman for no reason.

613
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,600
She is truly not a good person.

614
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,720
You don't know it.

615
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,120
In order to pin me down,

616
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,120
she rushed to the Capital

617
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,440
while she was pretending heartbroken.

618
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,920
I've been delayed in Qiantang
for a long time.

619
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,320
Oh, yes.

620
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,400
On my way back to the Capital

621
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,280
I heard big news in Huating County.

622
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,280
What news?

623
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,640
Why has Ouyang Xu not come yet?

624
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,560
Is he going to
break the promise again?

625
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,120
I went to him
in the afternoon three days ago.

626
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,680
It's just past noon.

627
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,040
Not three days yet.

628
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,600
And it's not easy to
get the register thing done.

629
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,280
I said some harsh words

630
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,480
that might hurt his self-esteem.

631
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,360
As I know about him,

632
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,040
he should be able to do what he says.

633
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,160
But people change.

634
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,640
If he hasn't changed,

635
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,840
he wouldn't need three days
to get it done

636
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,600
and show up in the last moment.

637
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,320
You're right.

638
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,080
There's probably something wrong
with him.

639
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,880
Let's go and check.

640
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,280
Impossible!

641
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,360
Why do I want to lie to you?

642
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,520
If she could use a fake marriage
to deceive Zhou She

643
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:22,280
by pretending to be
an unsurpassed beauty

644
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,230
and finally brought him to court

645
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,630
and got him exiled,

646
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,710
why wouldn't she treat you like that?

647
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,630
I don't believe you.

648
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,280
Pan'er is not that kind of person.

649
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:37,120
Always stay vigilant against others.

650
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,920
I have one more thing to ask you.

651
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Did you give

652
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,000
the Night Revels

653
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,600
to Minister Ke

654
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,440
as a birthday gift?

655
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,190
My fault. My fault.

656
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,480
The three things she mentioned,

657
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,480
I can do none of them?

658
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,960
It's all my fault.

659
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,960
My lord is out.

660
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:33,960
Please go back.

661
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,160
I was here three days ago,
do you remember?

662
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,760
I have an appointment with Ouyang Xu.

663
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,160
We can wait inside.

664
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,680
No.

665
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,720
Uncle De said that no one could go in.

666
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,600
Uncle De?

667
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,240
He's back?

668
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,240
Am I right?

669
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,640
He is going to welch on it.

670
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,480
Go tell Ouyang Xu

671
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,640
to come out to see me.

672
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,320
Or he will regret it.

673
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,280
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

674
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,160
Move. Get out of the way.

675
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,160
Go away.

676
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,720
Do you want to chase us away?

677
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,640
Pan'er,

678
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,360
I have experience in debt collection.

679
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,840
Do as I say.

680
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,640
One of us blocks the front door,

681
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,280
- the other blocks the back door.
- Shh...

682
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,800
We have nothing but time.

683
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,360
If we are tired and hungry,

684
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,080
we can ask the hawker to bring food,

685
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,360
- and chairs.
- Shh!

686
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,600
We can lie here and wait.

687
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,640
We can call Yinzhang over
to change shifts in the evening.

688
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,120
I just don't believe that

689
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,920
someone can be a coward
in his whole life...

690
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,680
You...

691
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,280
and never go out.

692
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:33,920
Uncle De...

693
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,360
Now you believe me, my lord?

694
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,240
As long as Zhao is not happy,

695
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,800
she'll make you pay for it.

696
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,520
If you do those three things for her,

697
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,440
she will have you in her hand forever.

698
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,240
Wh-What do we do now?

699
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,720
Don't worry, my lord.

700
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,280
I knew Sun Sanniang

701
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,000
would do something like this.

702
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,200
I've had it all arranged.

703
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,200
What are you doing here, my ladies?

704
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,960
You look so familiar.

705
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,400
Have we met before?

706
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,680
Yes, we have.

707
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,200
You're Guard Chi, that lousy

708
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,280
football player's dog, aren't you?

709
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,760
She curses me.

710
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,640
She dared win Guard Chi in football.

711
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,640
- Beat her, brothers!
- Beat her!

712
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,480
What do you want?

713
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,120
What do you want?

714
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,200
Want to fight?

715
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,920
Help!

716
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,000
Woman beats man in the street!

717
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:07,960
Help...

718
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,160
Did someone in the house send you here?

719
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,800
An old man

720
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,600
who gave me 2,000 coins asked me here.

721
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,200
So what?

722
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,920
You're right.

723
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,080
Once people become officials,

724
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,000
they will become hard-hearted

725
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,120
and ruthless!

726
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,520
What do you want?

727
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,800
Looking for trouble?

728
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,000
Wait for me to get up.

729
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,280
I'm not finished with you.

730
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,280
Sanniang, knock him on Longhu acupoint,

731
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,200
so he will never have children
in his life.

732
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,040
I knocked on your Longhu acupoint,

733
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,400
now you will never have babies.

734
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,360
My lady.

735
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,320
No, my lady.

736
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,600
I have to have babies, my lady.

737
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,520
My lady, please.

738
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,480
I have to have a baby.

739
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,320
I have to have a baby, my lady.

740
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,400
I'm the only child in my family.

741
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,920
Please, my lady! Please!

742
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,080
If you want to be released from it,

743
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,320
do as I say.

744
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,200
Borrow without repaying,
God condemns it!

745
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,480
Borrow without repaying,
God condemns it!

746
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,800
Borrow without repaying,
God condemns it!

747
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,560
This fat man

748
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,800
really believes that I can
do such acupoint-knocking thing.

749
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,200
How can a man have babies?

750
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,120
Dumb ass.

751
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,760
Who did you learn these tricks from?

752
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,640
Gu Qianfan, of course.

753
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,600
When we were in Qiantang,
he asked me,

754
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,800
what would I do if Ouyang Xu changed

755
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,640
like Fu Xingui?

756
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,320
Gu Qianfan told me, that...

757
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,400
Have you ever thought about this?

758
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,880
Sanniang's husband

759
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,280
is changed because of money.

760
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,280
Couldn't your Ouyang be like him too?

761
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,640
He's not that kind of person.

762
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,360
I don't care what kind of person he is.

763
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,440
I care about you.

764
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,800
I'd like to know,

765
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,160
if Ouyang does change his mind,

766
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,680
would you regret it like Sanniang?

767
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,070
(Borrow without repaying)

768
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,840
I was wavering at that time.

769
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,800
(God condemns it!)

770
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,840
But I still told him

771
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,280
that I believed in my choices.

772
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,360
I believed in Ouyang Xu.

773
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,920
The past eighteen years

774
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,640
with Ouyang Xu

775
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,760
was the happiest time for me.

776
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,640
Even if he changes

777
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,840
and becomes someone else's husband,

778
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,360
I won't regret

779
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,080
having a good time with him.

780
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,040
Okay.

781
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,280
I hope you will be stronger

782
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,840
than Sanniang by then.

783
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,640
Don't take it to heart
and fall into water.

784
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,200
Why do you always
have prejudice against Ouyang

785
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,920
and be so sure that he would fail me?

786
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,640
It's not prejudice

787
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,000
because I don't know him.

788
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,840
It's just that

789
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,200
I have seen too many people

790
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,120
in Security Office's prison these years.

791
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,440
And it makes me feel that

792
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,800
in this world,

793
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,000
humanity is the most fragile.

794
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,710
(Borrow without repaying)

795
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,640
It turns out,

796
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,840
(God condemns it!)

797
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,360
he is totally right.

798
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,080
I've been lying to myself.

799
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,520
In this world,

800
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,560
humanity is the most fragile.

801
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,600
(Borrow without repaying,
God condemns it!)

802
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,960
Borrow without repaying,
God condemns it!

803
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,560
No. Too tired.

804
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,920
They're trying so hard.

805
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,680
Should we go get
some food and drinks?

806
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,040
Borrow without repaying,
God condemns it!

807
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,920
Borrow without repaying,
God condemns it!

808
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,800
Where are you going, my ladies?

809
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,840
Go get something to drink for you.

810
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,440
This, this.

811
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,560
Shout louder. I'll help you later.

812
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,680
Shout.

813
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,520
Borrow without repaying,
God condemns it!

814
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,200
Borrow without repaying,
God condemns it!

815
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,400
These files are piling up
into a mountain.

816
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,560
I suspect

817
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,560
that all these officials in Jiangnan

818
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,800
were bought by Zheng Qingtian.
