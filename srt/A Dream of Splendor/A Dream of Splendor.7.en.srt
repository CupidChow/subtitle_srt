17
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,520
Pan'er,

18
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,560
that's why

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,200
I have to wrong you.

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,200
I'll give you the grandest wedding.

21
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,720
But it has to wait

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,760
until six months after I

23
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,800
marry Miss Gao.

24
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,440
What?

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,720
I...

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,040
I know I've wronged you,

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,640
but you've always been virtuous.

28
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,800
You won't mind it, will you?

29
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,360
Pan'er,

30
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,800
you're perfect

31
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,680
except for your background.

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
After all, you once had a pariah status.

33
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,360
If someone looks into it,

34
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,280
it can't be hidden anyway.

35
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,680
I didn't know it
until I became the Presented Scholar.

36
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,800
As a gentry,

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,040
I mustn't have any flaws.

38
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,280
You don't want to be the stain on me,
do you?

39
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,920
Not to mention

40
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,200
Inspector Gao.

41
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,960
I can't afford to offend him.

42
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,280
But you just said

43
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,080
Uncle De lied to me.

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,600
I was afraid you'd become too excited,

45
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,840
so I didn't tell you the truth.

46
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,200
Pan'er,

47
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,560
we vowed to be together
for three lifetimes.

48
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,280
I've never forgotten that.

49
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,960
I just can't make you my legal wife.

50
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,560
But rest assured,

51
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,600
even though I'm going to marry Miss Gao,

52
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,800
I won't let it affect you.

53
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,120
I won't let you demean yourself
in front of her.

54
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,040
I'll arrange you another residence

55
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,840
and let you live an
undisturbed life there.

56
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,480
In the future, your children

57
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,480
could be adopted by the legal wife.

58
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,440
You mean my children

59
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,040
have to call another woman Mother?

60
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,120
It's just an undeserved reputation.

61
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,520
They're our own blood and flesh.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,520
Are you afraid
they would be unfilial to you?

63
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,800
Pan'er.

64
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,760
For our future happy life

65
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,120
and my official career,

66
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,360
I beg you to compromise a little

67
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,040
on the undeserved reputation,

68
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,920
will you?

69
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,120
No.

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,840
Ouyang Xu,

71
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,920
do you think too highly of yourself

72
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,840
or do you underestimate me too much?

73
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,640
You brought me here on purpose,

74
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,760
lest I would make a scene
outside Gao's Mansion,

75
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,680
and ruin your good marriage, right?

76
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,680
Just say it out
if you've changed your mind.

77
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,400
Don't talk in riddles

78
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,080
and make me sick.

79
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,440
I haven't changed my mind.

80
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,240
I can swear to Heaven now

81
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,720
that the only woman I love

82
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,600
is you.

83
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,320
I just have no other choice.

84
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,800
Is that your reason to justify

85
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,760
your acts of betraying me,

86
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,440
breaking our pledge
and marrying another woman?

87
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,360
You...

88
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,680
Don't worry. I won't splash you.

89
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,840
I came all the way here to see you,

90
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,960
kind of hoping there might be a chance.

91
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,640
I didn't expect that

92
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,480
you would disappoint me after all.

93
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,920
In the Eastern Capital,

94
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,760
you only see wealth and ranks,

95
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,960
instead of the one you loved.

96
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,600
You don't deserve my tea.

97
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,540
(Tea House)

98
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,240
Pan'er.

99
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,280
I would never

100
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,160
be a concubine.

101
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,700
(Tea House)

102
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,400
Pan'er.

00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,240
Pan'er.

104
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,560
Pan'er.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,960
Don't follow me!

106
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,320
Be careful I may scream
and ruin your perfect marriage.

107
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,000
20.

108
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,960
21.

109

(Lyu Wu)
Sir, show us a phoenix nod.

113
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,200
It didn't drop.

114
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,520
Well done.

115
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,340
(Chi Pan, Head of 12 Guilds
in the Eastern Capital)

116
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,960
Good.

117
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,160
Great.

118
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,440
Great.

119
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,200
It didn't drop.

120
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,200
No, it didn't.

121
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,160
Look carefully.

122
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,680
- Can you do that?
- It didn't drop.

123
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,400
Go ahead.

124
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,080
Wonderful!

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,320
(He Si)
Well done, sir!

126
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,080
Look carefully.

127
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,760
Catch. Go.

128
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,040
Good.

129
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,400
Well done.

130
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,160
Great.

131
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,640
(Don't cry, Zhao Pan'er.)

132
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,840
(Such a villain
isn't worthy of your tears.)

133
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,880
Move. Move.

134
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm talking to you. Are you deaf?

135
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,320
Exactly.

136
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,280
Who are you?

137
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,560
This is the famous Palace Guard Chi.

138
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,240
I haven't criticized anyone
for a long time.

139
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,040
The road is broad.
We can walk on each side.

140
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,680
The one who bumped into me was blind.

141
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,520
Who are you calling blind?

142
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,280
Who are you calling?

143
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,440
What do you mean?

144
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,120
Wait.

145
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,400
How did I instruct you usually?

146
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,800
You need to
convince a young lady with reason.

147
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,040
Young lady,

148
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,520
we should be reasonable.

149
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,720
Didn't I ask you to move?

150
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
I had made 32 catches
and the ball didn't drop

151
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,720
until you showed up and ruined it.

152
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,150
You owe me an apology.

153
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,000
Only 32?

154
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,080
You're not as skilled as others.

155
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,360
Yet you want me to apologize?

156
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
What a surprise!

157
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,680
How did she make it?

158
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,480
Could she teach us?

159
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,600
She's awesome.

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,840
She's skilled.

161
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,360
Great.

162
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,520
I'm still here!

163
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,360
What are you doing?

164
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,040
- Sir.
- Sir.

165
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,200
Don't be upset.

166
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,240
Don't be upset.

167
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,720
You're such a discredit to me.

168
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,800
You won't get any reward.

169
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,400
- Sir.
- Sir.

170
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,680
I thought Jiangnan
was prosperous enough.

171
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
I didn't expect
the Eastern Capital would be better.

172
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,680
I've never seen so many Persians.

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,960
The Eastern Capital is wonderful.

174
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,240
It's the capital after all.

175
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
We can't see
so many new things in Jiangnan.

176
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,440
Yes.

177
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,080
The Eastern Capital is good.

178
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,040
It's so beautiful.

179
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,080
We can see many new things here.

180
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,920
Mr. Ouyang has been faithful.

181
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,360
I'm so happy.

182
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,560
By the way, will Mr. Ouyang

183
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,040
invite us to live in his mansion?

184
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,520
Definitely.

185
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,520
Look, the man who holds a drum.

186
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,040
Pan'er, come and look.

187
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,000
The Persians are dancing.

188
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:52,960
Come here.

189
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,040
Pan'er.

190
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,120
Pan'er, what happened?

191
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,760
It's nice to see you again.

192
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,480
Pan'er.

193
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,560
Pan'er.

194
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:27,960
Pan'er.

195
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,160
She's hot with fever.

196
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,880
Pan'er.

197
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,120
Yinzhang, you stay here.

198
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,040
Wipe her face with cool water.

199
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,840
Help her to drink plenty of water.

200
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,800
I'll go find a physician.

201
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:40,880
Yes.

202
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,080
Pan'er.

203
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,360
Pan'er.

204
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,680
Exhaustion of strength
and insufficiency of blood.

205
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,480
She seems to break down from overwork.

206
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,160
But her pulse is racing as well.

207
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,000
It seems that
she also suffers from anger.

208
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,080
It's serious.

209
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,680
She needs to take powerful medicine.

210
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,280
I'll write a prescription.

211
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,360
This way.

212
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,920
Are you all right?

213
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,600
I'm fine.

214
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,520
Why am I so stupid?

215
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,120
I can't do anything.

216
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,960
It isn't true.

217
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,960
You can memorize a long music score

218
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,120
by reading it just once.

219
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,960
You're not stupid.

220
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
What did Pan'er mean?

221
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,400
Is Mr. Ouyang unfaithful to her?

222
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,640
I managed to make her
take the medicine just now.

223
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,880
She is asleep.

224
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,200
When she wakes up,

225
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,400
don't ask her anything.

226
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,040
We've done nothing wrong.

227
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,120
Why do we end up like this?

228
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,600
Why, Ouyang?

229
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,920
(Pan'er,)

230
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,600
(if I succeed in the examination,)

231
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,560
(I must marry you
with formal and grand rites.)

232
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,560
Wait for me.

233
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,640
Why?

234
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,560
In the world,

235
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,760
some people just can't stand any test.

236
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,000
(Master.)

237
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,840
(Xiao's Mansion)

238
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,600
(Xiao's Mansion)
(What's up?)

239
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,360
(I've counted the 470,000
strings of coins)

240
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,880
(left by Zheng Qingtian.)

241
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,480
Only that

242
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,600
I don't know whose accounts
shall I enter them into.

243
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,240
Allocate 30,000 to his family,

244
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,040
40,000 for pensions to the casualties
of the Capital Security Office

245
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,360
in the name of Commander Gu secretly.

246
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,320
Then send 200,000
to Defender-in-chief Liu,

247
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,800
the Empress's brother
in the Eastern Capital.

248
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,840
Enter the remaining 200,000

249
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,200
into my private account.

250
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,120
Yes.

251
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,640
How come I've never seen the physician

252
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,120
that served Commander Gu just now?

253
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,280
Replace him with the one who serves me.

254
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,440
Moreover,

255
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,880
ask eight capable men
to follow Commander Gu.

256
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,840
When he needs money,

257
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,280
investigates cases,

258
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,640
interrogates people,

259
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,640
or buries his bosom friends these days,

260
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,160
follow his instructions.

261
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,440
Don't neglect any of his demands.

262
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,040
By the way,
provide him with food and clothing

263
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,440
in the light of those of mine.

264
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,400
And ask the kitchen to cook more
crystal-like cold pork.

265
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,000
He likes it best.

266
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,200
Yes.

267
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,600
Father!

268
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,680
Father!

269
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,120
Father!

270
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,560
Father!

271
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,440
Father!

272
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,880
Father!

273
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,960
Father!

274
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,320
Don't call him again.

275
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,640
Remember,

276
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,880
he isn't your father anymore.

277
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,280
Your surname is Gu, not Xiao.

278
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,520
Father.

279
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,720
Who is Commander Gu?

280
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,400
Why is Minister Duke so kind to him?

281
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:22,000
Shall we tell Ma'am in the capital?

282
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,400
Fool!

283
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,560
Minister Duke has always
ruled his family by military law.

284
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,360
If you dare send a word to the capital,

285
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,200
you won't get away easily
just with a slap.

286
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,160
Yes.

287
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,120
Commissioner.

288
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,000
When did Gu Qianfan

289
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
turn to Xiao Qinyan?

290
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,360
The sly old devil

291
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,520
never meddles in anything usually.

292
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,800
Why does he
stick up for Gu Qianfan this time?

293
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,800
They keep secret in their movement.

294
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,920
I must get to the bottom of it

295
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,680
and destroy them.

296
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,440
The case will be submitted
to His Majesty tomorrow.

297
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,520
Why can't you let go of

298
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,240
your little grudge against Gu Qianfan?

299
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,160
You asked me to take
Zheng Qingtian's money.

300
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,120
Now what should I do?

301
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,000
Commissioner, calm down.

302
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,520
Zheng Qingtian didn't refer to you

303
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,560
in his statement of confession.

304
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,840
Why do you worry about it?

305
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,680
Xiao Qinyan clearly wants to
take the opportunity to clean up

306
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,880
the official circles of Jiangnan,
eliminate dissidents,

307
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,440
and clear the way for his returning
to the capital as Prime Minister.

308
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,840
How can I not be worried?

309
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,000
I took Zheng Qingtian 200,000 strings.

310
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,960
Now he is dead.

311
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,160
Will Xiao Qinyan let me go?

312
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,480
You are deeply trusted by His Majesty.

313
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,200
Even if Minister Duke Xiao
tries to target at you,

314
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,240
His Majesty must...

315
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,160
What do you know?

316
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,760
Between Xiao Qinyan and me,

317
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,160
if one must die,

318
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
His Majesty will kill me and save him.

319
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,760
Moreover,

320
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,320
Xiao Qinyan has the Empress behind him.

321
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,560
Commissioner.

322
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,600
The envoy of Minister Xiao of Suzhou
asks to see you.

323
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,280
Invite him in.

324
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,360
No, wait.

325
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,520
I'll invite him to the main hall
and serve him tea.

326
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,760
Welcome.

327
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,080
What can I do for Minister Xiao?

328
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,560
The Minister said,

329
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,160
he knew everything

330
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,800
you had done in Jiangnan.

331
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,440
He selected the present
personally for you

332
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,520
and asked you to open it by yourself.

333
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,280
Asked...

334
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,760
Asked me to open it by myself?

335
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,240
Yes.

336
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,980
(Letter to Commissioner Lei)

337
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:44,420
(Letter to Commissioner Lei)

338
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,520
Do you like it?

339
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,280
I do.

340
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,320
I do.

341
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,080
The letter in the case
was written by the Minister.

342
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,560
Please read it.

343
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,220
(Letter to Commissioner Lei)

344
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,840
I bid you adieu.

345
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,200
(I've learned)

346
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,640
(some villains did the things
in Jiangnan.)

347
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,800
(It has nothing to do with you.)

348
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,960
(Qianfan found shelter under your roof.)

349
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,440
(For everything you've done for him,)

350
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,000
(I prepared the little gifts
to thank you.)

351
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,040
(Qinyan)

352
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,540
(Tomb of Jia Jiang
of the Capital Security Office)

353
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,140
(Tomb of Jia Jiang
of the Capital Security Office)

354
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,120
We selected the best coffins.

355
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,760
The honorary reward from the Ministry
of Rites will be issued soon.

356
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,160
I think your men

357
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,200
would rest in peace

358
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,680
in the lower world.

359
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,380
(Tomb of Jia Jiang
of the Capital Security Office)

360
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,000
Please.

361
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,080
Everyone, please rest in peace.

362
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,520
I'll inherit your legacies

363
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,800
and wait upon Commander carefully.

364
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,240
But,

365
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,800
(Tomb of Jia Jiang)
Don't be anxious to pick me up.

366
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,440
It's not too late

367
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,960
that we reunite in 70 or 80 years.

368
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,160
Minister Duke sent a letter,

369
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,480
saying he wants you to accompany him

370
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,800
to visit the ancestral grave

371
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,200
after you return to Suzhou.

372
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,120
With all due respect,

373
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,640
these days, Minister Duke

374
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,880
ran hither and thither for you.

375
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,840
He is over 50.

376
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,040
Except for running between
Qiantang and Suzhou,

377
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,160
he has to match his wits

378
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,600
with Commissioner Lei Jing
of the Capital Security Office.

379
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,680
Would you...

380
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,600
All right. Enough.

381
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,760
I'll go.

382
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,560
Then what else can I do for you

383
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,680
in Qiantang County?

384
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,000
The servants of the Yang family...

385
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,440
Rest assured.

386
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,920
Controller-general of Hangzhou
who is in charge of Qiantang

387
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,360
has included them as murder victims.

388
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,960
Pensions have been allocated

389
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,560
from Zheng Qingtian's legacies to them,

390
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,320
120 strings for each.

391
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,080
I'm going to pay tribute
to the aunt of the Yang Family,

392
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,880
then return to Suzhou on my own.

393
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,160
You don't have to follow me.

394
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,200
Yes.

395
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,160
Yinzhang.

396
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,040
Is she fine?

397
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,640
Last night,

398
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,520
I changed her inner wear twice.

399
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,840
Her fever has dropped.

400
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,600
Good.

401
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,840
She will recover soon.

402
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,840
I'll feed her medicine
after she wakes up.

403
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,520
Sit down.

404
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,680
Ouyang Xu is such a swine.

405
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,720
I wish I could go to the Gao Family now,

406
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,040
and tell them everything about him.

407
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,120
Don't make more trouble.

408
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,160
I heard their marriage

409
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,520
was arranged
by a consort in the palace.

410
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,320
You could give vent to your grievance,

411
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,800
but if His Majesty is offended,

412
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,120
we can't bear all the consequences.

413
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,760
Didn't you see when Pan'er came back,

414
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,360
she neither cried nor made a scene,

415
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,280
instead, she just said she was OK?

416
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,800
She didn't want us to be worried.

417
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,920
What should we do then?

418
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,000
Shall we swallow it?

419
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,040
Let's wait till Pan'er gets better.

420
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,160
You've been up all night. Go to bed.

421
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,400
I'll look after her during the day.

422
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,000
All right.

423
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,880
I'm here. Go to bed.

424
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,080
Take this.

425
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,280
Listen to the music.

426
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,600
It's beautiful.

427
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,150
(Du Changfeng)
Where does it come from?

428
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,480
The strings seem to snap,
and for one instant all is still,

429
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,280
only an undertone of quiet grief.

430
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:20,630
Good.

431
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,010
It has a special quality.

432
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:23,570
Yes.

433
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,840
Sir.

434
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,560
Manager.

435
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,120
Is there a famous player playing pipa?

436
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,880
Sorry, I have no idea.

437
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,040
I think it may be a guest.

438
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,800
It seems to be a young lady.

439
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,360
Look,

440
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,680
is it this lady?

441
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,960
Pan'er, you're awake.

442
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,800
I thought I heard Yinzhang playing pipa.

443
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,560
She is playing.

444
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,760
Get up first.

445
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,360
Are you hungry?

446
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,600
I'm not.

447
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,400
But I want to grab a bite.

448
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,000
I cooked fish porridge

449
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,280
in the inn kitchen.

450
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,000
Have some while it's still hot.

451
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Your throat is swollen. Eat slowly.

452
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,440
I won't.

453
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,480
I don't want Ouyang Xu to know

454
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,840
I almost died for him.

455
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,320
I must eat more

456
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,040
so I'll get better soon.

457
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:33,920
Pan'er.

458
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,840
I'm not sad at all.

459
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,080
I mean it.

460
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,160
It's not worth being sad
for such a creature.

461
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,520
Pan'er, you must get better soon.

462
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,840
Then we can find a way to deal with him.

463
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,440
We can't just forget it.

464
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,000
Ms. Zhao of Qiantang.

465
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,600
Ms. Zhao of Qiantang.

466
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,040
I'm going to take a look.

467
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Are you Ms. Zhao of Qiantang?

468
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,160
Ms. Zhao.

469
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,680
Ms. Zhao of Qiantang.

470
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,160
Are you Ms. Zhao of Qiantang?

471
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,880
Who are you?

472
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,400
I'm Du Changfeng, Presented Scholar.

473
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,240
My friend, Ouyang Xu,

474
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,640
asked me to visit Ms. Zhao.

475
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,000
Please grant me the honor to see her.

476
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,880
Get out.

477
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,440
It seems not right.

478
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,320
You-You're not Ms. Zhao.

479
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,040
You!

480
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,520
Who-Who are you?

481
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,200
I'm Pan'er's friend

482
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,240
as you're Ouyang Xu's friend.

483
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,040
You-You're so rude!

484
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,600
I come to visit Ms. Zhao.

485
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,000
Why do you prevent me?

486
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,600
Being a Present Scholar,

487
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,720
you're empty-headed.

488
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,640
Don't you know what "grant" means?

489
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,440
It means we can see you
if we want to,

490
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,800
and you must get out
if we don't want to!

491
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,880
What a rude woman.

492
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,680
Did you eat a firecracker?

493
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,840
Why are you so hot-tempered?

494
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,520
(Sanniang, let him in.)

495
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,800
Pan'er.

496
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,760
Are you Ms. Zhao of Qiantang?

497
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,040
I brought the most popular pastries
of Xiangyang Restaurant

498
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,200
for you to taste.

499
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,320
Please pardon me for not being
properly dressed because I'm ill.

500
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,320
May I ask what message

501
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,400
Ouyang Xu asked you to give me?

502
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,040
Never mind.

503
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,640
I'm short-sighted anyway.

504
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,160
I won't look at you
lest it doesn't conform to the rites.

505
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,720
Actually, Ouyang didn't ask me

506
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,400
to visit you this time.

507
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,560
I just couldn't stand it.

508
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,240
I found you by holding your portrait

509
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,040
and inquiring the inns one by one.

510
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,040
I want to persuade you.

511
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,560
With all due respect,

512
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,760
Ouyang is affectionate to you,

513
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,000
while you're arrogant, rude,

514
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,280
and narrow-minded.

515
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,320
You kept saying
you didn't want to be a concubine.

516
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,040
It was an insult
to your talented reputation.

517
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,280
What nonsense are you talking about?

518
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,560
It's OK. Let him go on.

519
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,600
Then, I shall go on.

520
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,200
Ouyang is a man of keen intellect

521
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,600
and a Presented Scholar, too.

522
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,960
You're lucky enough

523
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,360
to be liked by him.

524
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,800
How could you attack him brutally
because of a disagreement?

525
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,520
Ouyang didn't mind it

526
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,720
for the sake of old times.

527
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,240
But, Ms. Zhao,

528
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,800
you should have a sense of propriety.

529
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,640
What's the sense of propriety?

530
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,040
To know yourself well and
be content with destiny.

531
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,600
- Being born with a pariah status,
- Come.

532
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,280
- you should reflect constantly
- Ignore him.

533
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,240
and be virtuous and prudent.

534
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,920
How could you keep saying
you don't want to be a concubine?

535
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,880
You should know

536
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,800
only the daughter of an eminent family
like Miss Gao

537
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,480
could be a good match for Ouyang.

538
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,920
Of course,
I know you think highly of yourself.

539
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,200
But Huo Xiaoyu was the daughter
of an Imperial Prince,

540
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,520
she also got married as a concubine.

541
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,880
As a woman,

542
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,400
you shouldn't be too greedy.

543
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,320
In your opinion,

544
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,000
if I agree to be a concubine,

545
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,320
it would be my honor.

546
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,640
If I don't, it means

547
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,800
I have no sense to appreciate favors.

548
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:29,880
You're right.

549
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,400
In Commandments for Women,

550
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,800
it says being respectful and obedient
are the greatest rites of women.

551
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,840
You've read Little Stars of
The Book of Songs, haven't you?

552
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,000
The legal wife
isn't jealous of the concubine

553
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,800
waiting upon their husband.

554
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,040
Knowing she has a low status...

555
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,680
Sanniang,

556
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,200
he defiled my ears.

557
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,080
Get him out.

558
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:45,920
I-I-I...

559
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,040
I still have a paragraph to recite.

560
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,160
Knowing she has a low status,

561
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,880
the concubine is devoted to her husband.

562
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,400
I-I haven't finished.

563
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,440
My Tokharoi

564
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,640
dragon teeth glaze crystal aidai!
[*Aidai: Ancient glasses]

565
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,880
Pay me my aidai!

566
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,040
Get it out of the water!

567
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,600
What the heck?

568
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,520
Cut the crap.

569
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,040
You!

570
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,600
Get out.

571
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,230
You...

572
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,760
Woman,

573
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,400
you're rude, vulgar and unreasonable.

574
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,000
Now I get it.

575
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,440
It's a good thing Ouyang
didn't take Ms. Zhao as a concubine.

576
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,280
Who dares to take such shrews as you?

577
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,150
Say it again.

578
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,440
Say what?

579
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,400
The "shrews" thing.

580
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,360
You heard it clearly.

581
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,960
What are you going to do?

582
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,040
I'm going to show you

583
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,360
what a real shrew is like.

584
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,600
I was wrong.

585
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,600
- Good!
- Well done!

586
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,320
You...

587
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,160
You're a disgrace
to the educated people.

588
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,640
- You just read a few more old books.
- His neck is reined in by a woman.

589
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,080
What's the big deal?

590
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,840
You don't know right from wrong.

591
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,720
Since you are so warmhearted,

592
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,680
fine,

593
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,960
I'll calm you down today

594
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,600
and let you know

595
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,880
the first principle of being a man

596
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,520
is not to be mean.

597
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,920
I did it for your good.

598
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,300
Can you swim?

599
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,300
I can't swim.

600
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,240
I can't.

601
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,760
I can't swim.

602
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,320
Help me.

603
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,200
May I use it?

604
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,640
What do you know?

605
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,920
Never persuade a woman to be a concubine,
or you should be struck by lightning.

606
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,360
A man who reads books

607
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,200
doesn't even know such a simple truth,

608
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,280
and dares to force
my sister to be a concubine.

609
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,000
I did it for your good.

610
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,240
You deserve it.

611
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,680
Ask the government to arrest me.

612
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,440
I'm not afraid.

613
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,800
Don't you scholars cherish
your reputation most?

614
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,480
Now everyone knows

615
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,280
you've been thrown into the water
by a woman.

616
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,600
I'll see how you live with it.

617
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,560
You...

618
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,880
You're a disgrace to scholars.

619
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:22,920
A disgrace...

620
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,520
Comfy.

621
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,920
So comfy.

622
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,800
Of course.

623
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,088
(Zhang Haohao)
You're one of the few men

624
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,200
(Top Beauty of Shuangxi Pavilion)
You're one of the few men

625
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,040
that can enjoy my service
in the Eastern Capital.

626
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,800
(Someone fell into the water!)

627
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,840
(Help!)

628
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,560
Someone fell into the water?

629
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,560
Stop. I'm going to have a look.

630
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,840
Hurry up.

631
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,720
Who is this?

632
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,640
Isn't it Scholar Du of the Academy?

633
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,080
Who are you?

634
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,480
Don't you recognize my voice?

635
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,360
I'm the head of over a dozen of guilds
in the Eastern Capital.

636
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,840
Chi Pan, the Palace Guard.

637
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,520
Mr. Chi.

638
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,120
Come on, help me.

639
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,160
I have money. I'll give you money.

640
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,960
Pooh. I don't feel like helping you.

641
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,440
Who do you think you are?

642
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,920
Dare you humiliate me with money?

643
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,120
Stay there in the river.

644
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,080
I have plenty of money.

645
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,120
Chi-Chi Pan.

646
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,560
What kind of a hero are you?

647
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,920
You're Master One Less Than 13.

648
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,320
Master One Less Than 13.

649
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,200
You...

650
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,080
You couldn't get rid of the name
for your whole life.

651
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,600
Get him out.

652
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,880
Help...

653
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,960
Over there.

654
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,840
Don't hit me on the head.

655
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,600
Miss,

656
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,120
why doesn't Mr. Chi

657
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,520
like to be called
Master One Less Than 13?

658
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,800
Because he is just

659
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,760
the head of 12 guilds.

660
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,880
He is one less.

661
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,400
Still holding onto that wood, huh?

662
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,600
I'm afraid
you'll throw me into the water again.

663
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,240
You know it well, don't you?

664
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,040
A civilian shouldn't offend an official.

665
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,600
You? An official?

666
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,840
Do you think you can cheat us?

667
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,080
I'm a Presented Scholar.

668
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,040
The official list is still posted there.

669
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,680
I'm No. 27 in the Second Category.

670
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,480
My name is Du Changfeng.

671
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,440
Why don't you look into it?

672
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,880
Sir, he is really a Presented Scholar.

673
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,040
Sir, we shouldn't offend an official.

674
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,080
Let him go.

675
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,840
Thank you, Master Less Than 13.

676
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,460
(Ouyang's Mansion)

677
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,480
Shrimp.

678
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,960
Such a big shrimp came out of my mouth.

679
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,800
I was so humiliated.

680
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,240
Changfeng.

681
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,520
Don't you think

682
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,840
the shrimp suits you well?

683
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,920
I showed you this

684
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,680
not for you to laugh at me.

685
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,560
I'm trying to prove that

686
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,760
they really made me look bad.

687
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,320
All right.

688
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,840
I know you did it for my good.

689
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,320
But do you remember

690
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,680
what I told you before?

691
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,840
Don't just stand there. Give me a hand.

692
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,120
I've already...

693
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,680
Forget it.

694
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,040
You should cook it tonight.

695
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,600
But you're right.

696
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,680
You tried to stop me again and again,

697
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,560
but I wouldn't listen to you.

698
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,920
I deserved to get myself into trouble.

699
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,320
But why both of the young ladies

700
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
are so vicious and mean?

701
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,400
Ouyang,

702
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,080
as your good friend,

703
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,280
I must warn you.

704
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,520
Zhao Pan'er

705
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,600
isn't suitable to be a concubine.

706
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,040
You'd better never see her again.

707
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,320
Pan'er is a good girl.

708
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,720
I really like her.

709
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,520
Failing to make her my legal wife

710
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,080
is my greatest regret in life.

711
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,560
Forget it.

712
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,480
You just said

713
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,440
a woman threw you into the river.

714
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,560
Do you remember what she looks like?

715
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,240
She is in her 30s

716
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,120
and talks like firecrackers going off.

717
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,680
I remember
Zhao Pan'er called her Sanniang.

718
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,720
Sun Sanniang?

719
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,600
Why did she come here, too?

720
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,560
Why? Is she hard to deal with?

721
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,040
Did I get you into trouble?

722
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,880
No, you didn't.

723
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,520
Changfeng, on the contrary,

724
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,000
you've done me a big favor.

725
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,120
Mr. Ouyang, Miss Gao comes to visit you.

726
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,560
Your future wife
comes to see her husband.

727
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,240
Changfeng, you...

728
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,920
(Auspiciousness)
You should hide somewhere.

729
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,960
No, I've never seen Miss Gao.

730
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,840
You're short-sighted.

731
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,720
You can't see her clearly anyway.

732
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,440
No, no.

733
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,480
Sorry to bother you.

734
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:09,140
(Breeze Brings Integrity)

735
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,800
Miss Gao.

736
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,460
(Gao Hui, the Only Daughter of Gao Hu)

737
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,680
When I went to the palace today,

738
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,480
I got a good piece of ink from my aunt.

739
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,880
I brought it to you specially.

740
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,200
See if you like it.

741
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,040
Consort Xian's ink

742
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,000
must be a rare treasure in the world.

743
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,320
How could the son
of a humble family have it?

744
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,720
No big deal.

745
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,320
It's just a piece of ink.

746
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,360
When we get married and

747
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,110
(Mrs. Jiang, Gao Hui's Wet Nurse)
go to the palace to express gratitude,

748
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,040
it won't be hard to ask His Majesty

749
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,240
for some royal ink.

750
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,640
And,

751
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,360
I've told you many times.

752
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,600
Don't regard me as an outsider.

753
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,880
Call me Hui, remember?

754
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,680
I'd better call you Miss Hui.

755
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,320
OK, then.

756
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,720
We haven't seen each other for days.

757
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,840
Do you miss me?

758
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:09,800
I...

759
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,160
Miss.

760
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,160
The Crown Prince is a killjoy.

761
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,120
He got ill

762
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,600
right before

763
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,120
His Majesty
was about to grant our marriage.

764
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,640
Otherwise,

765
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,440
we should have got married by now.

766
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,880
Miss, be prudent.

767
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,320
All right, Nanny.

768
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,800
There are no other people here.

769
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Why can't I complain about
the Crown Prince?

770
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,920
He isn't Her Majesty's own son.

771
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,600
Miss, just get down to business.

772
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:40,760
OK.

773
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:45,960
Xu,

774
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,640
I heard from the servants that

775
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,360
several days ago,

776
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,400
you seemed to have

777
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,760
talked with a young lady
in front of our mansion.
