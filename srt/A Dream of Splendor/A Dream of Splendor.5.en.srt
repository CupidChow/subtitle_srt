Well, you didn't eat, did you?

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Let me get you some food.

19
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,320
I'll be back soon.

20
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,000
Have some more.

21
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,440
Tell you what,

22
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,040
I hate Song Yinzhang so much now.

23
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,560
It's been only three days
since we got married

24
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,120
before she cheated on me

25
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,160
with the young man next to our door.

26
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,280
Seriously?

27
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,120
Pan'er.

28
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,040
I'm in pain now.

29
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,800
I regret it.

30
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,600
I regret leaving with her
in the first place.

31
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,080
Why didn't I stay

32
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,600
and share confidences with you?

33
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,520
Really?

34
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,240
Really.

35
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,120
I do mean it.

36
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,320
If I told one lie,

37
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,200
I wouldn't deserve a natural death.

38
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
Liar.

39
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,960
I'm going to the bathroom.

40
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,520
I'll be back soon.

A gentleman uses his tongue,
not his fists.

43
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,400
A gentleman uses his tongue,
not his fists.

44
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,240
You spent money on
eating, drinking, whoring and gambling,

45
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,840
yet you have nothing to pay me back?

46
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,760
No, no!

47
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
Help! Someone is beating me!

48
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,040
Help!

49
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,720
Stop it!

50
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,040
Why did you beat him?

51
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,800
You get a little beauty on your side,
don't you?

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,440
He owes me 15 strings of copper coins.
[*A string: equals 1,000 copper coins]

53
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,600
It's been over due
for more than 15 days.

54
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,400
Don't you think he deserves
to be beaten?

55
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,800
Don't listen to him.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,040
I just owe him 10 strings,

57
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,320
but he makes it 15 strings.

58
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,600
When you borrow 10 strings,
I loan you 9 and you pay me 13.

59
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,080
That's the rule.

60
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,080
What rule?

61
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,840
Only 15 strings.

62
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,360
Everyone could have a problem
with money.

63
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,800
I won't just sit by

64
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,800
and watch my friend being bullied.

65
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,760
Sanniang.

66
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,600
Bring my orchid case.

67
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,940
My friend.

(Xiangyun Pavilion)

69
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,920
Look carefully.

70
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,400
There are 16 or 17 strings inside.

71
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,440
They are all yours.

72
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,480
Take the extra

73
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,280
as your reward

74
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,040
for being acting like a snob.

75
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,400
Take the money.

76
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,040
Yes.

77
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,720
We have money!

78
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,240
You're lucky.

79
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,600
You...

80
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,480
You...

81
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,600
Aren't you poisoned?

82
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
Why did you do this?

83
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,520
It was Commissioner's order.

84
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,600
I had no other choice.

85
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,680
Every one of the Capital Security Office

86
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,880
knows about our relationship.

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,360
But I'm different from you.

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,920
I have a family.

89
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,040
If I help you escape,

90
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,440
all my family will be dead.

91
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,160
Qianfan,

92
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,760
you're a brother to me.

93
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,720
Go back with me to see Commissioner.

94
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,680
I'll beg him to spare you, OK?

95
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,360
Please, Qianfan.

96
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,480
Qianfan.

97
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,040
I'm begging you.

98
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,160
Please, Qianfan!

99
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,790
My brother is dead.

100
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,480
I'm so grateful that

101
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,400
such a merciful Bodhisattva as you

102
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,680
are here to save my life.

103
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,360
You're always honey mouthed.

104
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,800
Why don't you pay off your debt?

105
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,360
You boasted about

106
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,360
your family property,

107
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,360
your dozens of shops,

108
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,120
and your big mansions.

109
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,280
Then what happened?

110
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,200
You were cornered for only

111
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,360
15 strings of debt.

112
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,920
Harder.

113
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,120
Can you call yourself a man?

114
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,280
Aren't you ashamed?

115
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,840
Of course not.

116
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,080
If I didn't marry your best friend,

117
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,840
Song Yinzhang,

118
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,600
who asks for gold and silver jewelry
all day long,

119
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,560
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

120
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,880
You're always talking about that woman.

121
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,040
If you miss her so much,

122
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,520
why don't you go to see her?

123
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,240
Why do you stick around?

124
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,680
I'm not going.

125
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,320
Don't stay here.

126
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,280
I'm not going.

127
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,160
I was wrong.

128
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,000
Beat me.

129
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,840
Beat me hardly.

130
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,800
Beat me to death.

131
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,680
Beat me.

132
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,400
Either tell me the truth

133
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,200
or get out.

134
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,120
Don't be angry.

135
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,520
Sometimes businessmen just don't have
enough money to meet their needs.

136
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,080
A while ago, I chartered a ship

137
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,040
and sent it to Nanyang to trade goods.

138
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,640
I don't know what happened,

139
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,560
but I haven't heard from it
since the ship passed Guangzhou.

140
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,520
In the end,

141
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,000
some short-sighted guys

142
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,040
started to fish in troubled water.

143
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,200
I'm so pissed.

144
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,800
Do you mean when your ship returns,

145
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,280
you'll have money?

146
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,560
That's it.

147
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,120
Pan'er.

148
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,240
Good woman.

149
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,040
If you have enough money,

150
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,440
would you please loan me 100 strings?

151
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,320
Help me to get through it.

152
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,320
When the ship arrives,

153
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,920
whatever you want,

154
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,600
including me,

155
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,880
you can have it.

156
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,400
100 strings?

157
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,280
It's easy for you to say that.

158
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,120
I do have money,

159
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,680
but it's the capital
I use to make a living.

160
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,560
Loan it to you?

161
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,160
Who are you?

162
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,600
What do you have to do with me?

163
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,120
I'm your dear Zhou She.

164
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,640
Pan'er.

165
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,440
Leave me alone.

166
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,280
I know you care about me.

167
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,080
Help me to get through it.

168
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,720
Let go.

169
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,360
I won't.

170
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:53,960
Let go of me.

171
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,640
Pan'er.

172
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,920
Let go!

173
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,520
No.

174
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,040
Do you think I'm an idiot?

175
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,240
You want Song Yinzhang

176
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,040
as well as my money.

177
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,000
Tell you what,

178
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,600
no way!

179
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,160
Pan'er.

180
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,400
Pan'er, don't be angry.

181
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,800
I have no such idea.

182
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,480
- Sanniang.
- I...

183
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,520
Walk him out.

184
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,160
Don't bother.

185
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,160
Why are you still here?

186
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,640
Get out.

187
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,720
Pan'er, listen to me.

188
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,880
I don't want to be a two-timer. Pan'er.

189
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,960
Pan'er, listen to me. Pan'er.

190
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,960
- Tell you what,
- Pan'er.

191
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,400
Pan'er.

192
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,480
- I'll make it clear.
- Pan'er.

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,400
- You may use my money,
- Pan'er.

194
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,280
provided that you discard Song Yinzhang.

195
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,160
Pan'er.

196
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,520
After you discard her,

197
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,800
you can speak the honeyed words again.

198
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,320
Why do I have such bad fortune?

199
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,320
Isn't Fan bad enough?

200
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,480
Zhou She tries to bully me, too.

201
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,280
Pan'er, why do you have such a bad fate?

202
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,080
Pan'er, don't cry.

203
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,560
None of the men can be trusted.

204
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,760
Am I born to be

205
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,880
a concubine?

206
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,960
Legal wife?

207
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,640
Does she really want to marry me?

208
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,520
It doesn't sound right.

209
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,400
She doesn't take a fancy to me.

210
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,720
She must feel mortified because of
Song Yinzhang

211
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,120
and the fact that she was driven out.

212
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,880
So she wants me to back her up.

213
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,320
I'm going to back you up.

214
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,000
Pan'er.

215
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,880
Pan'er.

216
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,120
Don't cry, Pan'er.

217
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
Pan'er, don't cry.

218
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,560
I'm willing to marry you.

219
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,160
As long as you promise to marry me,

220
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,880
I'll discard Song Yinzhang,

221
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,800
and marry you with a bridal sedan chair
carried by eight men.

222
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,080
I'm willing to marry you

223
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,560
as long as you promise to marry me.

224
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,200
Pan'er.

225
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,040
Pan'er.

226
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,640
Pan'er. Don't cry. Pan'er.

227
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,400
Is it true?

228
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,400
Yes. Truer than true gold.

229
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,560
Don't believe him.

230
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,520
If he isn't hesitant to
discard Song Yinzhang today,

231
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,000
he won't be hesitant to
discard you tomorrow.

232
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,360
Absolutely not.

233
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,040
Pan'er, if you don't believe me,

234
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,080
I can ask the government
to issue a document,

235
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,920
proclaiming that if I disappoint you,

236
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,680
I'll volunteer to be sent into exile.

237
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,680
Really?

238
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,520
Really.

239
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,280
Do you believe it again?

240
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,400
Words are no guarantees.

241
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,200
But Pan'er,

242
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,200
you should give me more time.

243
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,440
To discard her, I need to...

244
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,760
No.

245
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,400
I want you to discard her right now

246
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,280
and marry me immediately.

247
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,480
I don't want to waste another day.

248
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,720
Come and look.

249
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,160
These are brocade satins from Jiangzhou.

250
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,720
Look clearly.

251
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,720
I'm very rich.

252
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,880
How nice the material is!

253
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,120
This is Dragon and Phoenix Ball Tea
from Beiyuan.

254
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,040
Be gentle.

255
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,440
Look.

256
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,920
Dragon and Phoenix Incense.

257
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,720
I have so much money.

258
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,760
As long as you discard Song Yinzhang,

259
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,120
I'll marry you
requiring no bride price.

260
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,880
If you dare to delay,

261
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,840
I'll leave Huating County tomorrow.

262
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,080
I definitely won't!

263
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
I'm going to discard her.

264
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,440
Treasures.

265
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,240
Right now!

266
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,220
(Xiangyun Pavilion)

267
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,440
Come on. Go home.

268
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,940
(Xiangyun Pavilion)

269
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,160
Yinzhang, you stay here.

270
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,840
I have to go now.

271
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,520
Remember to
keep pissing about and crying.

272
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,480
Don't let him doubt you.

273
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,280
But I've never done anything like this.

274
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,840
Do you think he'll believe me?

275
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,040
Ms. Zhao said,

276
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,280
as long as you grow the guts

277
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,080
as you did when you ran away with him,

278
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,560
you'll make it.

279
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,120
You may rub your skin off.

280
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,040
Gu Qianfan,

281
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,440
why are you here?

282
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,400
Have you finished your business?

283
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:41,960
Yes.

284
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,760
Don't come close.

285
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,560
I look ugly now.

286
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,160
Enough, don't rub again.

287
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,440
Did you see it all?

288
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,800
Yes.

289
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,830
I saw everything when I was out there.

290
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,680
Did you see me drinking and flirting

291
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
with Zhou She?

292
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,560
I'm flirtatious,
lowly and vulgar, right?

293
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,280
No wonder you hate singing performers.

294
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,720
It makes me sick too.

295
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,960
It's like the smell of alcohol
on Zhou She.

296
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,960
I just can't wash it off.

297
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,360
Come.

298
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,840
Aren't they clean now?

299
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,720
White and slender, like the scallion.

300
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,480
How beautiful they are!

301
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,520
In my eyes, you've never been dirty.

302
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,240
Why are you hurt again?

303
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,400
Who did it to you?

304
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,360
I was cut by a sword accidentally.

305
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,600
Let me dress it for you.

306
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,440
Come.

307
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,480
I want to ask you a question.

308
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,840
If Song Yinzhang

309
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,920
betrays you again,

310
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,480
what would you do to her?

311
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,840
You once told me

312
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,320
you never regretted about anything.

313
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,480
She betrayed your trust

314
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,280
and ran away.

315
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,200
But you're still willing to rescue her.

316
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,720
For this reason,

317
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,240
you'd rather pretend
to be a woman in the whorehouse,

318
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,280
and deal with that kind of men
you hate most.

319
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,280
All you want to do is to repay

320
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,280
your debt of gratitude to her sister.

321
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,200
What about after that?

322
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,600
After the debt is paid,

323
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,600
if she lies to you again,

324
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,080
what would you do?

325
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,640
Repay kindness with kindness.
Return evil with evil.

326
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,000
Let bygones be bygones.

327
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,920
Follow my true heart at the moment.

328
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,240
Well said.

329
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,320
Have a drink with me.

330
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,720
I killed a man just now.

331
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,680
Stop it.

332
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,560
Stop it.

333
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,320
I'll fight it out with you!

334
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,360
What's wrong with you tonight?

335
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,080
You...

336
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,440
Are you insane?

337
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,600
You don't let me live.

338
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,080
I won't let you go easily.

339
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,200
Fire!

340
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,520
Fire!

341
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,160
What should we do?

342
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,480
Fire!

343
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,960
Someone put out the fire!

344
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,230
- Go ahead.
- Fire!

345
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,800
Double reward if you do it well.

346
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,640
Fire!

347
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,440
- Rest assured.
- Rest assured.

348
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,720
Someone put out the fire!

349
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,520
Fire!

350
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,760
- Fire! Help!
- Fire!

351
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,800
Fire!

352
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,200
Hurry, put out the fire!

353
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,400
Help!

354
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,360
Fire!

355
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,680
Put out the fire!

356
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,120
Fire!

357
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,760
Hurry.

358
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,400
Put out the fire!

359
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,280
Here's water.

360
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:04,840
Don't beat it again.

361
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,800
It's all right, everyone.

362
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,440
Thank you.

363
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,280
Please go home.

364
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,120
Please.

365
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,840
He started the fire!

366
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,960
He hurt me.

367
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,440
He's seeing another woman.

368
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,320
Shut up! You...

369
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,120
He tries to kill me
because he can't discard me!

370
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,400
How could you do that?

371
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,240
I didn't.

372
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,720
It's a misunderstanding.

373
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,360
How could you do that?

374
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,280
You hit me every day.

375
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,400
You don't give me any food.

376
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,640
- And you tie me up like I'm a dog.
- Shut up!

377
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,360
You have no conscience!

378
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,680
- Yeah. You've gone too far.
- You misunderstood.

379
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,800
Unfaithful man.

380
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,400
Exactly.

381
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,160
How could you do that?

382
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,760
Pan'er's idea is great.

383
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,680
After such a mess,

384
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,800
Zhou She can't get any sleep tonight.

385
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,800
He'll be befuddled

386
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,800
and take the bait tomorrow.

387
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,040
Darn it.

388
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,120
I'm curious.

389
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,360
Why are you never afraid of me?

390
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,040
Because you saved me
the first time we met.

391
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,040
You're a kind man.

392
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,320
Why should I be afraid of you?

393
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,800
Really?

394
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,840
If I told a lie,

395
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,440
you could kill me with your sword.

396
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,560
I couldn't bear to do that.

397
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,520
All over the world,

398
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,960
you may be the only one
who doesn't believe

399
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,680
I'm the real murderer
of the Yang Family.

400
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,520
Is the Capital Security Office
also bribed by Zheng Qingtian?

401
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,240
Good guess.

402
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,600
You can get a reward.

403
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,800
Don't be upset.

404
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,680
There is always a way out.

405
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,680
Though the Capital Security Office
covers the sky with one hand,

406
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,160
there are the three Departments

407
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,280
and the Censorate.

408
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,480
Right?

409
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,160
The Capital Security Office
doesn't belong to the three Departments

410
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,360
or subject to the jurisdiction
of any censorates.

411
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,640
Really?

412
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,440
Then what would you do?

413
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,280
Nothing.

414
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,520
He goes his broad way

415
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,560
and I'll climb my scaling ladder.

416
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,280
Only that my way

417
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,000
is too...

418
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,800
Never mind.

419
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,120
Like you said,

420
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,680
let bygones be bygones.

421
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,520
Follow my true heart at the moment.

422
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,160
Born as a man,

423
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,800
walking around the world,

424
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,600
I shouldn't be tied down by trifles.

425
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,800
OK. I've almost had enough.

426
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,880
Thanks for your drinks.

427
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,640
Wait.

428
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,080
Since your way is so difficult,

429
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,920
why don't you give up?

430
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,360
Concerning the souls
of the Yang Family, you can go slowly.

431
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,800
Just like me,
your pals in the lower world

432
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,960
must not want you

433
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,920
to take so much effort

434
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,200
to avenge them.

435
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,920
I can't stop it.

436
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,280
If I ask you

437
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,440
to forget about Song Yinzhang,

438
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,960
go to the Eastern Capital directly,

439
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,040
and be the wife of the Third Graduate,

440
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,920
you can't do it either, can you?

441
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,520
I'm not going to bid you farewell now.

442
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,560
We'll see each other soon.

443
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,880
Next time when I have another problem

444
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,360
and screw things up,

445
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,400
I could use your help again.

446
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,280
So you don't blame me
for being henpecked?

447
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,760
Why do you know everything?

448
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,200
Huating County is a small place.

449
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,920
Everyone should know the deeds

450
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,480
of an unsurpassed beauty.

451
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,640
If you say it again,

452
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,000
I won't pay your money back.

453
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,960
It doesn't matter

454
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,960
as long as you pledge to marry me.

455
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,000
Sorry, I was being frivolous.

456
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,680
We're friends.

457
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,200
Don't mind the little joke.

458
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,040
Friends?

459
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,080
Don't you agree?

460
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,040
Feels like old friends
at the first meeting.

461
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,920
Having no understanding
with an old acquaintanceship.

462
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,540
(Xiangyun Pavilion)

463
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,280
A peerless beauty.

464
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,080
Now I get it.

465
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,640
No wonder you'd rather ride
for four hours

466
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,680
from Huzhou to here.

467
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,400
So, you were doing it for her.

468
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,000
Look at your wound.

469
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,560
How neatly it's dressed!

470
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,560
The woman is virtuous.

471
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,280
She isn't someone you can joke about.

472
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,080
Your humble servant dares not joke.

473
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,200
It's a praise
from the bottom of my heart.

474
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
My mother used to tell me
when I was a child,

475
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,560
"Remember not to

476
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,240
go against your conscience and lie".

477
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,280
She is really beautiful.

478
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,600
Even if you pull a knife
against his neck,

479
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,560
your humble servant
wouldn't change his words.

480
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,000
You kept saying "your humble servant".

481
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,920
Do you really want to follow me?

482
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,000
I killed people with you.

483
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,040
Why do you still suspect my loyalty?

484
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,480
Could you talk properly?

485
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,240
I'm sorry.

486
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,160
Well,

487
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,120
I've talked too much
with my elder sisters.

488
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,360
It has become a habit.

489
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,120
It isn't that easy to be my subordinate.

490
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,520
I'm not afraid.

491
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,080
I grew up

492
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,520
surrounded by women.

493
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,960
Though without much talent,

494
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,120
I got promoted swiftly.

495
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,920
Because I have a special skill

496
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,320
to choose the right boss.

497
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,680
You're tough enough.

498
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,200
You didn't even hesitate
to kill your best friend.

499
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,000
But the bottom line is

500
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,200
you're kind.

501
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,440
There is a saying that,

502
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,200
show mercy with tough means.

503
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,600
If I follow you,

504
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,280
I'm sure I'll attain eminence
step by step.

505
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,080
You're afraid that
if things come to light,

506
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,680
I'll turn you in.

507
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,400
So you may as well
go along the dark road with me, right?

508
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,280
Absolutely not.

509
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,200
I was brought up under strict rules.

510
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,240
If I leave you here alone

511
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,320
and run by myself,

512
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,200
my mother would surely scold me for
not returning your kindness,

513
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,480
not being loyal

514
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,360
and righteous.

515
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,200
By the way,

516
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,040
where are we heading to?

517
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,160
Pingjiang Prefecture.

518
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,400
Suzhou.

519
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,980
(Commissioner Assistant Administrator
Manager of the Affairs)

520
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:02,740
(Xiao's Mansion in Suzhou)

521
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,820
(Xiao's Mansion)

522
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,440
Master, you're up early.

523
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,400
(Military Commissioner Xiao Qinyan)
The peach blossoms are open.

524
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,560
(Military Commissioner Xiao Qinyan)
Do you want to enjoy them?

525
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,060
(Steward of Xiao's Mansion)

526
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,080
Who's that?

527
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,480
How dare you break into
the minister's mansion?

528
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,200
Minister Duke Xiao, blessings.

529
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,680
Is that him?

530
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,200
Master.

531
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,920
Leave.

532
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,760
Aye.

533
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,640
It's really you.

534
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,320
(Evening Clouds)

535
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,360
Why are you here?

536
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,840
It's been years
since I saw you last time.

537
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,000
One never goes to the temple
for no reason.

538
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,560
With or without reason,

539
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,400
it's great

540
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,280
that you would come to see me.

541
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,720
Please.

542
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,220
(Zhou's Mansion)

543
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,160
Good thing?

544
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,880
Do you think the unsurpassed beauty
taking a fancy to you

545
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,480
is such a good thing
as gold falls from the sky?

546
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,520
Tell you what,

547
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,040
it's definitely a romantic debt.

548
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,920
Last night,

549
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,440
they were pissing about
the whole night.

550
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,640
Attempting suicide and setting on fire,

551
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,880
they only stopped before dawn.

552
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,880
I think...

553
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,440
Mr. Zhou, morning.

554
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,460
(Zhou's Mansion)

555
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,320
Did you see?

556
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,840
It seems that he couldn't
deal with his wife.

557
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,600
Now he has to deal with his mistress.

558
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,280
I didn't mean to delay.

559
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,560
But Song Yinzhang
threatened to kill herself last night,

560
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,920
which disturbed the Community Head.

561
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,080
I'm afraid if I cornered her,

562
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,320
she would kill herself.

563
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,360
It would hurt your reputation

564
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,280
when we get married.

565
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,440
You're right.

566
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,160
It isn't a thing

567
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,040
that can be done in such a hurry.

568
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,800
Exactly.

569
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,640
I thought it over all night
after I sobered up.

570
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,200
I shouldn't have

571
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,080
said those words in anger.

572
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,840
After all,
Yinzhang is like a sister to me.

573
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,280
How could I steal her husband?

574
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,520
So, let's

575
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,160
forget about it.

576
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,120
Pan'er.

577
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,560
Don't forget about it. Pan'er.

578
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,640
You can't forget about it.

579
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,000
I know I failed you.

580
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,120
The brocade satins, ball tea,

581
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,080
alcohol,

582
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,280
and the goats tied outside
as betrothal gifts

583
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,040
are useless to me now.

584
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,160
Take them as my apology gifts.

585
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,280
Pan'er.

586
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,440
Pan'er.

587
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,680
Pan'er.

588
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,560
Hurry up, everyone.

589
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,440
We have a journey to push on with.

590
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,160
Hurry up packing.

591
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,840
Pan'er.

592
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,560
Are you leaving, Pan'er?

593
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,800
Pan'er, it'll only be a little late.

594
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,040
Why do you take it so seriously, Pan'er?

595
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,560
I was right, wasn't I?

596
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,320
Men's words are untrustworthy.

597
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,320
He said the honeyed words last night

598
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,240
only to calm you down

599
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,200
and get your money.

600
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
If you believe
he would discard his wife,

601
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,160
you're a fool.

602
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,200
No.

603
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,280
No, Pan'er.

604
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,000
I really want to marry you, Pan'er.

605
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,920
Pan'er, listen to me.

606
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,480
What are you doing?

607
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,400
Leave me alone!

608
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,560
Pan'er.

609
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,400
Pan'er.

610
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,760
Pan'er.

611
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,800
Pan'er, listen to me, Pan'er.

612
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,120
I'll take you home now

613
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,040
and write the divorcing letter
in your presence.

614
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,040
Everyone, please be my witnesses.

615
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,920
If I don't discard Song Yinzhang today,

616
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,440
I'll write my name backwards.

617
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,920
Are you satisfied?

618
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,800
Let's trust him once.

619
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,520
Pan'er.

620
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,840
This way, Pan'er.

621
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,380
(Zhou's Mansion)

622
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,960
(Zhou's Mansion)
(You dare take your mistress home,)

623
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,480
(and discard me in front of her.)

624
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,840
You've gone way too far.

625
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,000
It's none of your business.

626
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,760
I'm in love with another woman,

627
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,960
so what?

628
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,600
You scratched me
just because you were jealous.

629
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,120
You violated one of the seven grounds
for a husband to discard his wife.

630
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
You're well deserved to be cast off.

631
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,920
He's so heartless.

632
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,160
It's useless
that you don't want to give up.

633
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,000
Listen to me, let it go.

634
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,840
Living a quiet life on your own

635
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,720
is much better than watching
his disgusting face every day.

636
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,920
Shut up!

637
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,760
How can I live my life?

638
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,320
He sold all my dowries.

639
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,680
And my body is covered with injuries.

640
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,120
Mr. Zhou,

641
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,520
it's your fault.

642
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,920
You can discard your wife,

643
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,920
but you should at least
return her dowries.

644
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,600
- Yes, you must return.
- Yes.

645
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,320
Enough, don't make more noise.

646
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,200
I'll return the money to her.

647
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,400
But I don't have money now.

648
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,120
I'll write her an IOU.

649
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,600
Shame on you.

650
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,400
Then will you owe her
the divorcing letter

651
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,520
until you return the money?

652
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,880
What are you talking about?

653
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,040
Miss,

654
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,150
did you see it clearly?

655
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,320
He doesn't want to return the dowries
to his abandoned wife.

656
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,320
Are you sure you want to marry him?

657
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,190
It's none of your business.

658
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,010
Why do you push her?

659
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:20,890
Right, Pan'er.

660
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,630
We must think it over.

661
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,830
How dare you!

662
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,150
My mansion is worth dozens of strings.

663
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,000
At the worst, I'll mortgage
my title deed to you.

664
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,710
OK?

665
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,920
That's better.

666
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,960
That's better.

667
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,180
(Divorcing Letter)

668
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,060
(Divorcing Letter)

669
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,920
He signed it.

670
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,500
(Promisor: Zhou She)
That's more like it.

671
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,040
Black characters on white paper.
Now he can't deny it.

672
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,820
(Witness: Liu Jinyou)

673
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,120
Everyone should go by the rules.

674
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:02,580
Sure.

675
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,040
Pan'er,

676
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,000
in front of everyone,

677
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,160
let me ask you again,

678
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,160
will you marry me

679
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,440
after I discard her?

680
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,040
It's a deal.

681
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,720
Then make an oath.

682
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,200
I, Zhao Pan'er, swear,

683
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,160
as heaven and earth are my witnesses,

684
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,600
I will marry Zhou She.

685
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,480
If I break the oath,
I shall be struck by lightning.

686
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,040
Let me see the divorcing letter.

687
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,400
What if you made any mistakes?

688
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,920
There won't be mistakes.

689
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,000
When I wrote this thing...

690
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,680
You discarded me.

691
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,080
How could I live?

692
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,240
You don't deserve a wife.

693
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,320
Song Yinzhang,

694
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,960
you deserve it.

695
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,320
Go.

696
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,600
Ms. Song, don't mind her.

697
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,360
Go.

698
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,680
Come.

699
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,760
Pan'er, come.

700
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,480
When do we get married?

701
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,520
What's the rush?

702
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,600
She owns the mansion now.

703
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,960
We can't get married here.

704
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,200
Pack up your stuff

705
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,120
and go back to
Xiangyun Pavilion with me.

706
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,480
OK, wait for me. I'll be back soon.

707
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,260
(Title Deed for Land)

708
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,560
Pan'er, Sanniang.

709
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,040
Go ahead.

710
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,520
All right.

711
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,840
We've got the divorcing letter.

712
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,240
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

713
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,000
Your title deed.

714
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,400
Sanniang.

715
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,800
These are yours.

716
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,520
Yours.

717
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,520
If such a thing happens again,

718
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,440
we'll still hire you.

719
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,400
Take it.

720
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,280
You all have your shares.

721
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,080
Let's make money together.

722
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,280
Take it. Don't push.

723
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,600
Yours. Take it.

724
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,080
No, I...

725
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,080
Mine. Mine.

726
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,840
Still collecting money?

727
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,240
How dare you!

728
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,660
(Zhou's Mansion)

729
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,080
How dare you collude with her?

730
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,920
No. No.

731
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,440
Go.

732
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,880
Get them back!

733
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,860
(Zhou's Mansion)

734
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,360
Here they are.

735
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,080
Stop.

736
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,000
Where are they?

737
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,640
Here.

738
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,360
Zhao Pan'er, Song Yinzhang,

739
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,160
how you dare trick me!

740
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,960
Do you really think

741
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,400
I've spent dozens of years
in Huating County for nothing?

742
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,000
Bro,

743
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,280
help me send these lying women

744
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,360
to the county government.

745
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,200
When it's done,

746
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,320
you can have my mansion.

747
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,600
Yes, Mr. Zhou!

748
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,000
What should we do, Pan'er?

749
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,160
What should we do?

750
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,240
Don't be afraid.

751
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,280
Court trial begins!

752
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,720
Silence!

753
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,200
I, Zhou She, beg Your Honor
to back me up.

754
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,560
Zhao Pan'er, a woman in the whorehouse,

755
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,880
tricked me into divorcing my wife,

756
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,960
and denies
her engagement with me.

757
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,880
Zhao Pan'er, do you plead guilty?

758
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,440
I'm a good citizen
of Qiantang County

759
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,040
instead of a woman in the whorehouse.

760
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,760
I don't know my crime.

761
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,360
How dare you deny it?

762
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,640
Your Honor,
she promised to marry me.

763
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,360
Many people can testify for me.

764
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,600
Marry you?

765
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,840
Ridiculous.

766
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,280
Your Honor,

767
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,440
it requires three matchmakers

768
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,160
to make an engagement.

769
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,880
You said we had an engagement,

770
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,760
but where are the matchmakers,

771
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,960
the contract

772
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,120
and the betrothal gifts?

773
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,880
You got nothing
and you said I was going to marry you?

774
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,360
He brings a false charge.

775
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,400
Don't you deny it!

776
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,880
I have betrothal gifts.

777
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,040
Your Honor,

778
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,840
the ball tea, brocade satins

779
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,480
and the goats
she prepared for our wedding

780
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,200
are outside.

781
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,720
It's easy to find out.

782
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,480
You mean those are betrothal gifts?

783
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,040
Is the ball tea yours?

784
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,000
Are the brocade satins yours?

785
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
Even the goats

786
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,720
were bought at the market yesterday
under my instruction.

787
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,640
I have all the contracts.

788
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,120
Your Honor,

789
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,720
from ancient times to the present,

790
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,840
men are responsible for betrothal gifts.

791
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,080
I've never heard

792
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,080
women should prepare
their own betrothal gifts.

793
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,160
Exactly.

794
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,680
Yes.

795
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,240
How can you ask women
to prepare the betrothal gifts?

796
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,040
I've never heard of it.

797
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:12,920
Well,

798
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,360
you've set a trap early for me.

799
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,240
But you swore to marry me.

800
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,160
You said, as heaven and earth are
your witnesses,

801
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,040
if you break the oath,
you shall be struck by lightning.

802
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,720
I said that inside a house.

803
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,960
There was just a roof
instead of heaven.

804
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,920
There were just bricks instead of earth.

805
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,080
How could you take the joke seriously?

806
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,680
When you lied to Yinzhang,

807
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,440
didn't you promise to love her
till the end of your days,

808
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,320
till the seas dry up
and the rocks decay?

809
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,440
Well said.

810
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,680
- Good.
- Good.

811
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,680
Zhao Pan'er,

812
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,920
gods dwell three feet over our head.

813
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,480
As a woman,

814
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,120
how can you be so insolent
and unbridled?

815
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,480
Now that you admitted
you had taken an oath,

816
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,280
the accusations Zhao She made
against you of denying the engagement

817
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,680
and tricking him
into discarding his wife

818
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,680
are real, aren't they?

819
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,920
Your Honor,
please pardon me.

820
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,360
I had no choice but to

821
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,560
deal with Zhou She courteously.

822
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,360
I also want to sue him for

823
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,240
forcing a registered musician
of another county to marry him.

824
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,520
Because she turned him down,

825
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,880
he brutally beat her.

826
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,400
According to the laws of Great Song,

827
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,680
it's a felony.

828
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,160
Is she a registered musician?

829
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,560
Yes.

830
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,600
Song Yinzhang is
a registered musician of Qiantang.

831
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,520
Her name register is recorded in detail
on the written complaint.

832
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,840
You can see it clearly.

833
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,520
Zhou She's crime can be proved

834
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,880
by the divorcing letter
written by himself.

835
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,120
The black characters on white paper

836
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,520
say clearly that

837
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,760
Song Yinzhang was his wife.

838
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,240
No wonder why Ms. Zhao insisted
on asking him to write the letter.

839
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,440
That's the reason.

840
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,720
Couldn't I leave Qiantang?

841
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,400
Of course.

842
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,440
If she didn't emphasize
you were forced to,

843
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,640
you must be flogged.

844
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,960
Where is the divorcing letter?

845
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,080
Here it is.

846
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,280
I didn't write it. It's fake.

847
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,800
