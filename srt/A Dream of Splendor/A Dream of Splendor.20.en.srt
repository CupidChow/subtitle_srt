=A Dream of Splendor=

16
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,700
=Episode 20=

17
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,240
The Empress is now high-powered.

18
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,840
Xiao Qinyan is coming to be
the Grand Secretary, too.

19
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,800
So, I don't think the Hat Demon

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,600
aims at civilians in the capital city.

21
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,720
It aims at officials
who support the Empress.

22
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,360
Does it have to do
with The Night Revels?

23
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,720
Let me tell you a short story.

24
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,800
Once upon a time,

25
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,240
there was an uncertain dynasty.

26
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
In a very small town

27
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,960
lived a young lady.

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,640
She was born beautiful,
and skilled in singing and dancing.

29
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,480
But her family was so poor.

30
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,040
She had to leave home at a young age

31
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,600
and make a living everywhere
on music performance.

32
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,640
It was her destiny, I'm afraid.

33
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,160
One day,

34
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,720
a prince went hunting in this town.

35
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,480
He took a fancy
to this lady at first sight

36
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,320
and made her his concubine.

37
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,360
He even made up

38
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,600
a very decent identity for her.

39
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,200
Twenty years later,

40
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,080
the prince's wife passed away.

41
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,240
The prince loved this young lady

42
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,560
and then made her his legal wife.

43
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,160
You told me

44
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,880
that even a humble lady

45
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,800
could become a princess.

46
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,280
Do you mean this lady?

47
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,560
Hear me out.

48
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,880
The young lady became the princess

49
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,960
and lived a noble life.

50
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,480
She should have been happy.

51
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,840
Unexpectedly,

52
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,160
her fake identity wasn't perfect.

53
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,120
Many senior subordinates of the prince

54
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,200
started to check up on her.

55
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,040
One day,

56
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,520
one of them found a painting

57
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,320
of a famous artist
in which a spring banquet

58
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,120
was held by the Commissioner
of the lady's hometown.

59
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,160
At the banquet,

60
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,600
the Commissioner invited
many of his favorite female performers

61
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,880
to sing and dance.

62
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,600
One of them

63
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,520
looked exactly the same

64
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,960
as the young princess.

65
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,200
The painting became famous.

66
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,360
It proved

67
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,120
that the princess wasn't
from a decent family

68
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,400
as she married the prince.

69
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,080
How could such a woman

70
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,320
be the prince's legal wife?

71
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,280
But some people just look alike.

72
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,960
With only one painting,

73
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,720
how can you be sure
about the princess's identity?

74
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,320
When the famous artist painted,

75
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,560
he loved to keep people guessing.

76
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,440
He put the names of all guests

77
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,680
at the banquet

78
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,600
into the patterns of their clothes

79
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,520
right in his painting.

80
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,320
Oh, I see.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,840
When I remounted this painting,

82
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,200
I noticed those strange patterns.

83
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,720
I didn't say anything.

84
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,440
I just told you a short story.

85
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,640
I know it's just a story.

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,600
As long as you don't keep this painting,

87
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,800
you're safe.

88
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,840
Now that Ouyang Xu wants to keep it,

89
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,960
let him be.

90
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,160
Don't think about it anymore.

91
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,560
I want you to forget about this story.

92
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,000
Let me walk you home.

93
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,500
(Yuhuang Mountain, the Western Capital)

94
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,000
When will we arrive?

95
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,160
Soon enough.

96
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,560
After we climb over the mountain

97
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,240
and walk for another two hours,
we'll arrive at Qingfeng Taoist Temple.

98
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,160
Are you sure
that Taoist Baoyi is in the temple?

99
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,880
Yes, according to my teacher.

100
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,240
What kind of place is this!

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,920
Why is it still so cold in May?

102
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,760
And who on earth is Taoist Baoyi?

103
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,880
Why did he travel to such a place

104
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,920
instead of settling down somewhere?

105
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,760
Master, don't say that.

106
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,000
Master.

107
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,040
Master. Are you all right, Master?

108
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,680
Master, is everything all right?

109
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,560
Get me up.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,680
Come on.

111
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,640
I'm thirsty. Give me some water.

112
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,720
But Master, there's no more water.

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,840
Darn it.

114
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,320
Darn it!

115
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,200
Darn it!

116
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,320
Darn it!

117
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,880
(I must honorably return
to the Eastern Capital.)

118
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,080
(I must get back twice as much)

119
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,520
(as I've suffered lately.)

120
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,840
(As long as Gao Hui comes
to the Western Capital...)

121
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,960
(As long as I can marry her,)

122
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,800
(I will return to the Eastern Capital.)

123
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,000
(Then I can be a Hanlin Scholar)

124
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,960
(and work for His Majesty again.)

125
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,480
Leave me here. You should go back.

126
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,440
No. I can't rest assured
until I see you enter the room.

127
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,800
You don't need to come too often.

128
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,960
Let me know if you're safe
every few days.

129
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,040
How about this?

130
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,280
If I'm safe,

131
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,480
I'll hang a red flower out there.

132
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,280
If I miss you, I'll hang a yellow one.

133
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,760
Deputy Commissioner Gu?

134
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,040
Pan'er.

135
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,280
It's already this late.

136
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,880
Why are you here together?

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,680
Ge Zhaodi is involved
in the Hat Demon case.

138
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,400
Pan'er is her employer.

139
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,640
She was then interrogated
in the Capital Security Office.

140
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,560
Pan'er, are you all right?

141
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,400
She is all right now.

142
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,840
But it doesn't mean she will always be.

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,560
This is a very important case.

144
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,640
And it's potentially linked
to Zheng Qingtian's case.

145
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,760
I'm afraid in recent days,

146
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,680
Pan'er must be ready

147
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,480
to be summoned at any time.

148
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,800
Oh, I get it.

149
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,160
If the Hat Demon case is that important,

150
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,240
why did you still have time
to walk Pan'er back?

151
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,400
I didn't walk her back purposely.

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,910
I came here for you.

153
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,030
Wait a second.

154
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,360
Check this out.

155
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,780
(Liangzhou)

156
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,280
The Complete Song of Liangzhou?

157
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,040
It was lost for quite a long time.

158
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,160
It wasn't lost.

159
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,760
It was just kept secretly in the palace.

160
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,240
Not long ago, I went to see His Majesty.

161
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,880
After the Great Consort passed away,

162
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,760
her maids returned this to His Majesty.

163
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,200
I then asked His Majesty for it.

164
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,520
A good song is meant for someone
who deserves it.

165
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,400
Pan'er told me

166
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,960
that you had been working hard on pipa.

167
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,120
So, I'm giving this to you

168
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,240
and hope you will make this song

169
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,080
as splendid as before.

170
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,840
Thank you for giving me this.

171
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,440
I'll always be grateful.

172
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,160
You're welcome. See you.

173
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,800
Pan'er,

174
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
this is The Complete Song of Liangzhou.

175
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,760
I even dreamed to hear it for once.

176
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,320
He just came and gave this to me.

177
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,040
I'm so happy.

178
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,760
Don't wake Sanniang up.

179
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,840
- Go to bed.
- All right.

180
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,040
You freaked me out.

181
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,000
Why did you have that score with you?

182
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,480
We haven't been engaged yet.

183
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,640
I didn't know if you told anyone else

184
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,520
about our relationship.

185
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,600
A commissioner like me

186
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,640
always lets nothing go wrong.

187
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,520
Do you think I only have the score?

188
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,160
The imperial chef's banquet menu
of the Southern Tang dynasty.

189
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,520
In my original plan,

190
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,160
if we ran into Sun Sanniang,

191
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,560
I would give this to her.

192
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,120
But I remember

193
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,000
you seemed to have told me

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,440
that Sun Sanniang knew our relationship.

195
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,840
You still have to give this to her.

196
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,520
Aye.

197
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,760
Tomorrow, I'll have this given to her.

198
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,160
What?

199
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,120
Was I reacting perfectly just now?

200
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,440
Am I hearing this right,
Deputy Commissioner Gu?

201
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,800
Are you trying to take credit?

202
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,560
What did you call me?

203
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,800
Qianfan. All right?

204
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:36,960
Excuse me.

205
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,200
Qianfan.

206
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,000
All right. You should go.

207
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,520
Or you would be seen again.

208
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,720
Wait a minute.

209
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
Over this period of time,

210
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,600
if Xiao Qinyan's subordinates find you,

211
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,640
do not talk to them.

212
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,600
Let me take care of it, all right?

213
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,800
What?

214
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,280
A good song is meant for someone
who deserves it.

215
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,160
At first, I took a fancy

216
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,040
to your brilliant pipa skills.

217
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,080
But after I got to know you,

218
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,920
I fell in love with you

219
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,000
and started to respect you.

220
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,160
(Stop, stop.)

221
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,440
(Song Yinzhang, stop thinking.)

222
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,240
(Who do you think you are?)

223
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,340
(Half-hidden)

224
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,280
Here I am.

225
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,480
Line up, everybody.

226
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,240
There's plenty for everyone.

227
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,560
Let's line up and wait.

228
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,320
Be patient.

229
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,000
Be patient.

230
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,480
Take it.

231
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,160
There's plenty for everyone.

232
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,040
No worries.

233
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,160
Thank you. Thank you.

234
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,640
Thank you.

235
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,400
Come on.

236
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,080
Here it is.

237
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,240
- Thanks for coming.
- Good.

238
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,000
Thank you very much.

239
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,520
You're welcome.

240
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,160
Good, good.

241
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,800
You know what? Yesterday, I didn't
have tea at this teahouse.

242
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,320
And I felt something missing.

243
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:21,960
Yeah.

244
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,680
Yes, yes.

245
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,480
That's right.

246
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,760
Du, there you are, at last.

247
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,120
You just failed to see me.

248
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,560
You have a pair of glasses?

249
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,000
It's my new pair of glasses.

250
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,720
Just kidding.

251
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,200
With the cord, it won't be dropped.

252
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,400
Today, I must enjoy
the Peach Blossom Cakes here.

253
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,600
I don't think
you only came for pastries.

254
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,080
Are you expecting

255
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,360
to see the lady who saved you

256
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,760
and you missed day and night?

257
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
No, no.

258
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,400
Remember. Her name is Sanniang.

259
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,040
Keep that in mind.

260
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,000
Sanniang?

261
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
Mr. Yuan Tuntian,

262
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,160
what would you like to eat today?

263
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,600
Is there any free pastry?

264
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,160
Isn't he the...

265
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,800
The...

266
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,440
Be right there.

267
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,920
That's him.

268
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,000
He extorted money that day.

269
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,800
Sanniang...

270
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,680
Go, go, go.

271
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,240
Be patient.

272
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,520
Sir.

273
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,760
Go.

274
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,880
Go, go, go.

275
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,600
Here we go.

276
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,420
(Half-hidden)

277
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,720
What would you like, sirs?

278
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,920
I'd like Yujin Tea.

279
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,480
I'd like Luya Tea.

280
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,720
Five-fruit Drink
and a plate of Sweet Pastry.

281
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,120
A Stewed Pear

282
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,040
with a plate of Sour Plum Powder.

283
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,080
You don't even write them down.

284
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,480
Can you remember what we ordered?

285
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,880
Don't worry. If I miss anything,
the bill is on me.

286
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,240
Why did Ms. Zhao and Sun Sanniang

287
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,600
hire such a young man?

288
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,880
I don't understand, either.

289
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,560
Umm...

290
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,080
Here's your food.

291
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,120
Watch.

292
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,800
Yujin Tea.

293
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,920
Luya Tea.

294
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,920
Right, right.

295
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Five-fruit Drink.

296
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,480
Sweet Pastry.

297
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,440
And your Stewed Pear.

298
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,040
Good.

299
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,680
With Sour Plum Powder. Done.

300
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,320
Good.

301
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,680
You missed nothing.

302
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,920
Sanniang,

303
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,350
why do you hire such a wrong waiter?

304
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,240
Wrong?

305
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,480
Two wrongs don't make a right.

306
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,960
Being nice is the right thing.

307
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,480
What?

308
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,720
Are you afraid
that she'll poison your tea?

309
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,720
No, no.

310
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,960
Don't be cowards.

311
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,480
Why do you bother
quibbling about a girl?

312
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,440
If you don't want the tea,
I'll take it away.

313
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,760
Don't. Don't.

314
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,480
We were just kidding.

315
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,120
Yeah.

316
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,120
So, she's a girl?

317
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,640
Her name is Zhaodi.
[*Zhaodi: It means expecting a son.]

318
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,160
How can a boy have this kind of name?

319
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,360
Be right there.

320
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,360
Enjoy yourselves.

321
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,680
Ma'am, a pot of Jian Tea, please.

322
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,400
It's you?

323
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,720
Ouyang has a deep love for you.

324
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,240
But you're arrogant, rude, and petty.

325
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,240
You refuse to be his concubine.

326
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,000
It's quite dishonoring your reputation.

327
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,280
What nonsense!

328
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,640
Jian Tea, please.
[*Homophone to "cheap".]

329
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,080
Who do you mean cheap?

330
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,080
It's you?

331
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,680
Why... Why is it you?

332
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,520
I'll teach you the No.1 code of conduct.

333
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Do not be mean.

334
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,640
I said that for your own good!

335
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,240
Why did she kick him into the water?

336
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,000
How dangerous!

337
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,080
Scholars like you care most
about your reputation, right?

338
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,760
Now, everyone knows

339
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,480
a woman threw you into the water!

340
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,880
I'll see how you have the cheek to live!

341
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,600
You are Sanniang?

342
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,920
Yes, I am. So what?

343
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,800
What... What are you doing here?

344
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,800
What a stupid question!

345
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,440
If I were not here,

346
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,240
how could you come in?

347
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,840
Did you own this teahouse?

348
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,680
You own this teahouse?

349
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,280
Look, he's meeting a friend.

350
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,080
But he just didn't recognize her.

351
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,600
She's not my friend.

352
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,240
Come out with me.

353
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,040
Be gentle.

354
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,240
What is this all about?

355
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,960
Sanniang, would you like to...

356
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,000
Sit down and enjoy your tea!

357
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,640
Come out!

358
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,360
I'll write with my hand. Be gentle.

359
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,600
I'm warning you.

360
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,960
You're not welcome here.

361
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,560
We don't want to see
your awful face, either.

362
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,760
You think I want to come?

363
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,440
Who wants to visit such a teahouse

364
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,960
owned by ungrateful women?

365
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,120
Ouyang Xu is such a nice guy.

366
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,360
He's the Third Graduate of this year.

367
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,200
But because of you, he had to leave
for the Western Capital.

368
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,400
Now, he's living a hard life
with the Taoists

369
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,560
on Yuhuang Mountain.

370
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,240
He doesn't even have meat to eat.

371
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,960
Is that true?

372
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,880
Good to know!

373
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,880
He's just paying for what he's done.

374
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,400
You...

375
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,040
He deserves that.

376
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:52,960
You...

377
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,960
Just you wait!

378
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
I'll get in.

379
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,000
I'll tell them
you threw me into the water.

380
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
I'll see who dares to visit
your teahouse anymore!

381
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,320
What...

382
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:05,920
Go tell them.

383
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,560
What's going on out there?

384
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,680
You think I don't dare to tell them?

385
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,320
If those men know

386
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,320
about the terrible things

387
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,280
you and Ouyang Xu did to us...

388
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:17,840
I...

389
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,600
Guess what they'll think of you two.

390
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,400
Ungrateful men?

391
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,200
Divorcing his wife
to marry another woman?

392
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,840
Want a new wife after getting rich?

393
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,200
Vicious friends?

394
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,600
And...

395
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,080
And what else?

396
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,120
Evil companions.

397
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,200
Bad friends.

398
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,720
Birds of a feather.

399
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,720
Good point.

400
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,360
You...

401
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,880
Shrews!

402
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,480
Shrews!

403
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,120
What do you want?

404
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,760
Are you going to stay?

405
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,120
If you don't leave immediately,

406
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,080
believe it or not, I'll throw you
into the water again.

407
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,440
What do you want?

408
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,200
What do you want?

409
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,600
Help!

410
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,560
Help!

411
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,800
Help!

412
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,000
She's gonna kill me!

413
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,960
She's gonna kill me!

414
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,360
I...

415
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,760
I...

416
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,840
I...

417
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,280
Humph.

418
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,600
Ge Zhaodi,

419
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,400
why did you do that?

420
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,320
Pan'er said

421
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,720
Chen Lian would give us some dogs.

422
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,920
I'll ask the dogs

423
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,440
to smell this piece of cloth

424
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,000
so that they can remember his smell.

425
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,920
If he comes to bully you again,

426
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,200
we'll teach him a good lesson.

427
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
You're a girl.

428
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,000
Why must you be so fierce?

429
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,600
What happened to Mr. Du?

430
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,320
Nothing.

431
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,440
He didn't want the tea and just left.

432
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,040
He has poor eyesight,

433
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,600
but he's a nice man.

434
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,400
He is?

435
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,000
Yes.

436
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,880
Yes.

437
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,240
Fine. Enjoy yourselves.

438
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,160
All right.

439
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,120
All right.

440
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:12,300
(Qingfeng Taoist Temple)

441
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,000
Mr. Ouyang, those two Taoists
have left the mountain.

442
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,360
It's all my fault.
If I hadn't gone the wrong way...

443
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,480
Give me a hand.

444
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,440
Didn't I just tell you?

445
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,240
Taoist Baoyi has left.

446
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,280
Excuse me, I'm too hungry
to keep walking.

447
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,080
May I have some porridge?

448
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,080
But we don't eat boiled food here.

449
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,480
Sorry for that.

450
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,600
Sorry, Mr. Ouyang.

451
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,440
I shouldn't have gone the wrong way.

452
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,680
Sorry.

453
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,040
Mr. Ouyang, are you all right?

454
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,960
Somebody! Help!

455
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,560
Help!

456
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,340
(Qingfeng Taoist Temple)

457
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,120
What happened?

458
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,000
Hey, boy.

459
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,600
Mr. Ouyang, have some yam.

460
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,920
You... You have some, too.

461
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,680
Eat, boy. Then get to sleep.

462
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,040
When the day breaks, we'll leave.

463
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,560
Then we can find Taoist Baoyi.

464
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,240
As long as I see him,

465
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,200
everything will be all right.

466
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,520
Deputy Commissioner Ouyang...

467
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,320
I'm the commissioner
granted by His Majesty.

468
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,800
Even if I have to visit Taoist Baoyi
a hundred times,

469
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,640
as long as I can see him,

470
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,040
I'm all right with the sufferings.

471
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,000
Right?

472
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,360
Deputy Commissioner Ouyang...

473
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,840
You suffered a lot with me.

474
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,240
After we're back in the Eastern Capital,

475
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,760
I'll make you my entourage.

476
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,880
Then you no longer need

477
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,400
to be such a poor Taoist boy.

478
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:31,500
(Qingfeng Taoist Temple)

479
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,640
How about giving him some porridge?

480
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,160
He's an official, after all.

481
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,960
Do it if you want.

482
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,720
He's a petty official

483
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,680
even without an entourage.

484
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,600
He was obviously demoted
away from the Eastern Capital.

485
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,160
Why do you bother about him?

486
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,000
Besides, he didn't read the room.

487
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,720
Instead of giving any altarage,

488
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,240
he even put on official airs.

489
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,720
Sanniang.

490
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,480
Look, I bought a sugar figurine.

491
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
It's so sweet.

492
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,280
Would you like to taste it?

493
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,240
No. Only kids like this.

494
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,040
Eat it yourself.

495
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,480
All right, then.

496
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,920
Are you missing Zifang again?

497
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,360
He couldn't take his eyes away
from the sugar people when he saw one.

498
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,960
We've been in the Eastern Capital
for a long time.

499
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,920
I don't know if my troublesome son

500
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,840
is doing well with his father.

501
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,560
He's growing fast.

502
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,400
I don't know if his aunt
who is closer to him than his mother

503
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,600
has made him any new clothes.

504
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,560
Didn't the guy
who dropped off Fei-qian last time

505
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,720
say that he is doing fine?

506
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
He is young and thoughtless.

507
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,280
He'll know he was wrong

508
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,800
when he grows up.

509
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,320
When our business gets bigger,

510
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,840
we will get him here

511
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,400
and make him study hard.

512
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,360
You will wear the fancy dress

513
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,760
as his mother one day.

514
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,400
Thank you for your kind words.

515
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,080
Every time I think of the way

516
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,320
he disowned me

517
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,160
in public,

518
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,440
it bums me out.

519
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,000
I'm fine.

520
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,720
I'm fine.

521
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,240
School is over. Hurry.

522
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
(Discriminate Wisely)
School is over.

523
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,000
(Discriminate Wisely)
School is over.

524
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,080
School is over.

525
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,980
(Find the gate and go in,
Heaven cannot be reached by ladder.)

526
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,480
Are you Du Changfeng?

527
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,040
Yes, I am.

528
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,200
Manager.

529
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,800
You've been busy all day.

530
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,880
Have a cup of tea.

531
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,160
Well done.

532
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,920
Here are two coppers as your allowance.

533
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,320
Thank you, Ma'am.

534
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,800
The guests have all left.

535
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,200
I'll go to the elegant chamber

536
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,440
and ask Yinzhang to have some fresh air.

537
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,560
Not now.

538
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,840
Except for her three shows today,

539
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,960
she spent the rest of the day
in her room

540
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,480
studying the new piece of music.

541
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,800
Let her be alone for some more time.

542
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
We can ask her to come out

543
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,760
when we are finished here.

544
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,720
All right.

545
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,720
Stay back!

546
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:04,960
Stay back!

547
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,560
Stay...

548
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,040
Help!

549
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,760
Help!

550
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,320
Whose dog is that?
Get the dog out of here!

551
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,920
The dog has only been here for a while,

552
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,360
and it caught a thief.

553
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,560
Let's go and take a look.

554
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,000
Get it out of here!

555
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,440
Help! I'm afraid of dogs!

556
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,720
Go away.

557
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,840
Go away.

558
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,240
Help!

559
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,400
Help!

560
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,240
Why are you here again?

561
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,840
Come here.

562
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,480
You...

563
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,600
You should leave.

564
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,840
The Gao Family is coming after you.

565
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,160
The Gao Family?

566
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,360
Inspector Gao.

567
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,720
He just sent someone to the Academy
to block me

568
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,920
and ask me about
your engagement with Ouyang.

569
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,040
I didn't dare to say
you are doing business here.

570
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,680
But the Gao Family
has informants everywhere.

571
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,760
If they find out about you,

572
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,920
your lives will be in jeopardy.

573
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,920
Take my advice and get out of here.

574
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,160
Are you here to tell us about this?

575
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,880
Thank you.

576
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,400
I've met Inspector Gao.

577
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,400
He knows about my business here.

578
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,600
He didn't do anything to us last time.

579
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,120
I guess his subordinates

580
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,400
won't do anything this time.

581
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,960
Let's forget about Inspector Gao.

582
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,760
What about Gao Hui?

583
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,680
She's ruthless.

584
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,920
The life of every woman
who has ever approached Ouyang

585
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,880
was made a living hell by her.

586
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,280
Take my advice and get out of here.

587
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,120
Is Gao Hui that ruthless?

588
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,360
As the daughter of an official,

589
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,000
she actually pushed someone
into the water.

590
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,760
Anyway, that's what Du Changfeng said.

591
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,160
I think it doesn't hurt to be careful.

592
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,680
What if Gao Hui

593
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,040
is a vicious and ruthless woman?

594
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,120
We'll be

595
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,720
in real trouble then.

596
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,080
Du Changfeng is still
a Presented Scholar.

597
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,000
Even he is so afraid of Gao Hui.

598
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,120
We're just common people.

599
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,880
Pan'er, what should we do?

600
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,440
I wonder

601
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,120
the reason Ouyang Xu was determined
to break off our marriage

602
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,840
is whether he wanted
to move up the ladder

603
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,960
or he was afraid of Gao Hui.

604
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,600
Are you still trying to justify him?

605
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,720
Don't tell me
you still want to forgive him.

606
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,280
I just want an answer for myself.

607
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
After all, I still don't believe

608
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,920
I have such bad taste in men.

609
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,400
Now I've over it.

610
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,360
Even if Gao Hui
only accounted for 30% of the reason,

611
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,920
Ouyang Xu is not entirely heartless.

612
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,360
At least one of the reasons he left me

613
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,440
was to protect me?

614
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,640
Zhao Pan'er.

615
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,400
Do you have tea leaves in your head?

616
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,120
Do you want me to wake you up with this?

617
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,640
Sanniang.

618
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,200
Let's not talk about the past.

619
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,400
There is no need
to be afraid of Gao Hui.

620
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,400
It was her nanny who asked Zhaodi

621
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,720
to use poison last time.

622
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,520
We still solved it.

623
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,800
You remind me of something.

624
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,680
I can't believe I forgot

625
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,160
the godlike existence of Gu Qianfan.

626
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,840
What should we be afraid of?

627
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,000
It's okay.

628
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,840
Did Mr. Gu also contribute
to Zhaodi's matter?

629
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,960
Of course.

630
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,480
Last time when Pan'er
went to see Gao Hui's father,

631
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,080
Gu Qianfan was there to back her up.

632
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,840
Pan'er.

633
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,720
There's a woman out there
looking for you.

634
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,080
She said she is here to bring you
a thank-you gift for her lady.

635
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,280
Who?

636
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,000
Our lady wanted to thank you in person,

637
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,000
but it's not convenient for her to come.

638
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,960
So she sent me here.

639
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,920
This is the dress
she borrowed from you last time.

640
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,120
It has been washed and ironed.

641
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,960
There are also some small gifts.

642
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,520
Well...

643
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,760
I can't take them.

644
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,200
These are too expensive.

645
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,960
I only lifted a finger.

646
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,000
I can't take such expensive gifts.

647
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,920
Just take them.

648
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,080
Others might find these gifts expensive.

649
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,960
But for our Gao Family,

650
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,280
it's really nothing.

651
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,440
The Gao Family?

652
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,960
The Gao Family?

653
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,920
Are you from Inspector Gao's Mansion?

654
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,240
How did you guess that?

655
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,440
There is not a second Gao Family

656
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,280
all over the Easter Capital

657
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,440
in such a grand manner.

658
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,120
Thank you, Ms. Zhao.

659
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,480
The gifts have been sent.
I should leave.

660
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,160
This way, please.

661
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,120
In this case,

662
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,280
the girl who borrowed clothes
from us last time

663
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:48,960
is Gao Hui.

664
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,760
Has Gao Hui been here before?

665
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,080
Inspector Gao only has one daughter.

666
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,000
But she sounded polite.

667
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,240
She doesn't look like someone

668
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,440
who would kill a rival in love.

669
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,190
Are you from Jiangnan?

670
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,880
Qiantang.

671
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,190
Be careful.

672
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,320
People have two faces.

673
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,400
Du Changfeng was also annoying

674
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,280
when he came here
as Ouyang Xu's lobbyist.

675
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,440
But it was an act of kindness

676
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,760
for him to tip us off today.

677
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,480
What are you talking about?

678
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,920
I can't understand a word.

679
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,710
I'm still worried.

680
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,000
Let me check it again.

681
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,600
How about this,

682
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,710
if I'm safe,

683
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,880
I'll hang a red flower outside.

684
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,600
If I miss you,
I'll hang a yellow flower.

685
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,760
That's the Gao Family's carriage.

686
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,760
Look.

687
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,060
(Gao)

688
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,560
What's going on?

689
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,320
Let Sanniang fill you in.

690
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,280
I need to go to the teahouse.

691
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,560
We are about to have dinner.

692
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,520
Are you leaving now?

693
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,760
I forgot to pay the stall tax.

694
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,200
I have to work out the accounts quickly.

695
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,480
Let her go.

696
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,680
Or she can't rest assured.

697
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,080
Look! It's the warrant of Hat Demon.

698
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,340
(Notice)
(Reward for Hat Demon Hunter)

699
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,960
I... I heard

700
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,920
there is a new Zhang's Flaky
Muffin Store in that street.

701
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,120
A lot of people are rushing to buy it.

702
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,960
I'll go check it out.

703
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,600
Wait.

704
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,680
Take your time waiting in line.

705
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,080
I didn't see anything

706
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,240
today or after.

707
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,600
I thought you wouldn't come today.

708
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,080
How come?

709
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,680
I caught sight of the yellow flower
at the door.

710
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,600
Zhang's Flaky Muffin.

711
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,400
Last time you treated me
to the pepper and chili soup.

712
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,480
This is to return your favor.

713
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,720
It's bean-paste filling.

714
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,080
How do you know
I like bean-paste filling?

715
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,480
When we were on the boat,

716
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,680
most of your pastries

717
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,920
were bean-paste flavor.

718
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,160
Did you eat my pastries?

719
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,840
It turns out you guys from

720
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,760
the Capital Security Office

721
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,720
use your professional skills
on stealing pastries.

722
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,760
Well, I had to steal
your pastries first.

723
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,320
Then I can steal your heart.

724
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,240
What did you say?

725
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,760
You eat first.

726
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,280
Eat faster.

727
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,520
After you finish it,

728
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,120
I have an important thing
to discuss with you.

729
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,840
What is it?

730
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,760
Today,

731
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,600
Ouyang Xu's friend, Du Changfeng,

732
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,760
gave us a warning

733
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,320
and said Gao Hu
sent his men to look for us.

734
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,120
Wrap both of these for me.

735
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,600
All right.

736
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,000
Sir, please wrap these two for me.

737
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,600
Wrap what?

738
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,560
I'll wrap you!

739
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,800
- It's you again!
- It's you again!

740
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,880
Why are you cutting in line?

741
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,280
I'm not cutting in line.

742
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,480
I was there buying muffins.

743
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,640
It's just there were two less
in the stove.

744
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,680
The owner asked me
to pick them up later.

745
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,440
Ask him if you don't believe me.

746
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,680
Well...

747
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,960
Sir, why didn't you tell me earlier?

748
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,120
I wouldn't have waited for so long.

749
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,480
How about this, one for each of us.

750
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,320
Us?

751
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,280
Us.

752
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,000
One for each of us?

753
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:33,880
One for each of us.

754
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,760
You wish.

755
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,720
Sir!

756
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,280
What are you waiting for?
Wrap them for me!

757
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,880
You know what,

758
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,800
I'm going to have these muffins today.

759
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,000
Sir, I'll give you three times
the price.

760
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,240
Can I have these two muffins?

761
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:42,960
Okay.

762
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,800
Three times the price?

763
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,720
You might as well buy the place.

764
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,480
I do what I'm willing to do.

765
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,000
Look, wrap them now.

766
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,400
Stop wrapping. Give them to me.

767
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,560
The Hat demon!

768
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,640
The money's on her!

769
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,800
Money!

770
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,200
You haven't paid!

771
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,040
Come here!

772
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,600
Stop!

773
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
This pastry is very delicious.

774
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,120
Really?

775
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,440
Give the muffins back to me.

776
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,560
You...

777
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,480
That's what it is.

778
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,680
Why are you smiling?

779
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,520
I'm happy.

780
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,240
At least you've changed

781
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,040
and you're willing to talk to me
about your problems.

782
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,360
I was afraid you'd nag me
if I don't tell you.

783
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,040
Otherwise, I would
go to see Gao Hui myself.

784
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
Why would you go to see her?

785
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,720
I guess the guy who came to Du Changfeng

786
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,400
works for Gao Hu.

787
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,440
He has been an official for years.
It's natural that he is cautious.

788
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,280
Even if he believes what I said,

789
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,000
he would still have people check it out.

790
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,120
Probably he already
sent people to Qiantang.

791
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,800
Even if that guy
doesn't work for Gao Hui,

792
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,880
I always thought it would be better
to talk to her honestly

793
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,360
instead of hiding like this.

794
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,120
I don't know if she's ruthless,

795
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,760
but considering the way
she borrowed clothes from me

796
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,240
and returned them back,

797
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,920
I think she is a sensible person.

798
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,080
Since you've figured it out,

799
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,040
why would you discuss it with me?

800
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,280
I need someone to back me up.

801
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,720
If she sends someone to kill me,

802
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,920
I'll need a bodyguard.

803
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,400
I'll ask Chen Lian to go with you.

804
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,000
No way.

805
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,360
I want her to see

806
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,040
you're a hundred times more handsome

807
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,120
and more capable than Ouyang Xu.

808
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,240
Then she will believe

809
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,120
I'm not interested

810
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,400
in her future husband anymore.

811
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,960
That's more like it.

812
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,720
When do you want to leave?

813
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,000
How about tomorrow night?

814
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,640
Probably not tomorrow night.

815
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,320
I have an important appointment.

816
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,040
With a belle?

817
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,320
Not a belle.

818
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,800
A friend.

819
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,520
Yinzhang, have a rest.

820
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,760
This is the sweet soup I just made.

821
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,040
Try it.

822
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,280
Lotus seed bean paste.

823
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,520
It's getting hotter every day.

824
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,200
We need to develop some new soup

825
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,000
that can clear away heat
for our teahouse.

826
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,720
It's delicious.

827
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,160
Well,

828
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,080
Gu Qianfan has given you the score.

829
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,440
Is he gonna ask for it back?

830
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,560
(Liangzhou)
Just take your time to study it.

831
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,760
No way.

832
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,200
The Complete Song of Liangzhou
is hard to find.

833
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,720
I would fail Deputy Commissioner Gu
for his kindness

834
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,240
if I don't study it thoroughly.

835
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,400
The fingering here

836
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,160
is kind of strange,

837
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,640
but I can't figure it out.

838
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,520
If you can't figure it out,

839
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,600
you can ask someone for help.

840
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,120
I think that guy

841
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,400
knows a lot about music.

842
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,040
Who?

843
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,400
Who else could it be?

844
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,360
Shen Ruzhuo.

845
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,520
Haven't you been
getting close to him lately?

846
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,320
You two can discuss it together.

847
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,960
It's better than trying
to figure it out alone.

848
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,600
Don't talk nonsense.

849
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,880
I'm not talking nonsense.

850
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,480
A while back, you went to play
with Zhang Haohao,

851
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,640
and who sent you there?

852
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,200
It was not like that.

853
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,720
I ran into him by accident.

854
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,680
All right, it was not like that.

855
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,480
I'm overthinking.

856
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,080
Sanniang.

857
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,120
In a word,

858
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,920
Pan'er is done

859
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,120
with Ouyang Xu now.

860
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,280
You should also stop
dwelling on the past.

861
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,320
There are so many good men
in the Eastern Capital.

862
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,760
Are you never going to find another man

863
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,280
just because you had a fall?

864
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,360
But,

865
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,440
I'm no longer pure.

866
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,320
I gave birth to a child.

867
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,840
What's the big deal?

868
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,280
Do widows in the Eastern Capital

869
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,440
have to be single forever?

870
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,480
Don't just assume that he judges you.

871
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,440
What if he likes

872
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,240
young women who have been through a lot

873
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,200
like you?

874
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,080
Right?

875
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,000
Are you also thinking about...

876
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,480
Why can't I think about it?

877
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,120
Listen.

878
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,160
Ms. Zhao in the next door

879
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,000
is forty years old.

880
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,680
She got married again with a kid.

881
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,600
I'm only in my early thirties.

882
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,080
Why can't I think about it?

883
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,200
What if I meet someone I like

884
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,080
in the teahouse?

885
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,720
Right?

886
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,680
All right, I'm going to make pastries.

887
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,880
There are still quite a few left
at the end of the day, right?

888
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,000
Yes.

889
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,680
But we must serve the guests

890
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,680
the best and freshest pastries.

891
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,320
I'll put the remaining pastries

892
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,360
in a box and send it to Du

893
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,240
as a thank-you gift.

894
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,760
I don't want to owe him anything.

895
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,040
Take your time to practice.

896
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,560
(Don't just assume that he judges you.)

897
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,360
(What if he likes)

898
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,960
(young women
who have been through a lot)

899
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,680
