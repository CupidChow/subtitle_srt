17

Where is the divorcing letter?

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,400
Here.

19
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,520
I never wrote such a letter.
It's fabricated.

20
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,040
It has your fingerprint on it.

21
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,040
He is eating it.

22
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,240
He's swallowed it.

23
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,440
What can you do without the letter?

24
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,680
Pan'er, what to do now?

25
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,360
Don't worry.

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,600
I knew he would deny it.

27
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,880
Let me see.

28
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,560
I'm afraid that you would
miss something,

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,240
in such a high mood.

30
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,720
I won't.

31
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,200
How could I miss anything?

32
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,760
How can you divorce me?

33
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,840
How will I live in the future?

34
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,680
What's wrong with you?

35
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,400
The real letter is here.

36
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,000
The one he swallowed is fake.

37
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,160
Smart.

38
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,000
So smart.

39
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,720
The proof is irrefutable.

40
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,000
Will you still deny it?

41
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,320
Yes, the proof is irrefutable.

42
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,360
Order!

43
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,760
Silence!

44
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,400
Zhou She.

45
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,500
(Upright and Honest)

46
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,520
You have breached the law

47
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,800
by plundering official performers.

48
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,400
You should be executed
spine flogging of 60

49
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,960
and exiled 2,000 miles away by law.

50
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,640
Considering that you're
the first offender,

51
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,440
deserving sympathetic understanding,

52
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,640
I sentence you hip flogging of 15

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,640
and a ransom of copper 80 jin.
[*Equals to 8,000 copper coins.]

54
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,680
Thank you, your honor,

55
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,960
for your wisdom.

56
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,640
What?

57
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,560
Look what he did to Yinzhang.

58
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,560
It only costs him a flogging
and several coins.

59
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,440
That's it?

60
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,880
Unreasonable!

61
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,120
Thank you, your honor,

62
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,400
for your wisdom.

63
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,880
Hold on, your honor.

64
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,800
Isn't the sentence too mild?

65
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,640
(Impartial and Just)

66
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,480
(Impartial and Just)
This is a court.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Are you the magistrate

68
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,160
or me?

69
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,960
But she's wounded.

70
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,600
Look, he beat her.

71
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,520
Please look.

72
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,520
Look.

73
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,960
You're a woman.

74
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,120
What do you know about laws?

75
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,400
He's being partial.

76
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,480
Yeah.

77
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,040
Your honor, I'm not familiar
with laws as you are.

78
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,640
But I know,

79
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,080
in the second year of Duangong,

80
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,000
Emperor Taizong issued
an imperial edict that

81
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,920
people who have committed
frivolous crimes

82
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,480
shall be punished flogging
and exiled,

83
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,280
no ransom is ever demanded.

84
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,080
How Zhou She can be ransomed?

85
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,520
Justice, your honor!

86
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:20,440
Justice! Justice! Justice!

87
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,120
Watch your tongue!

88
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,120
How presumptuous you are!

89
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,800
Women should be chaste and gentle.

90
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,160
You claim to be a good citizen,

91
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,080
but you make groundless accusations
and open threats,

92
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,720
neither ever be done by good citizens.

93
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,760
Zhou She is guilty, no doubt.

94
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,880
You're not innocent either.

95
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,640
Guards. Seize her!

96
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,680
No.

97
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,200
Go away.

98
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,760
You can't do this.

99
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,280
No.

100
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,560
Pan'er.

101
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,160
You want to talk about laws.

102
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,320
I'll talk about it with you.

103
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,360
You disrespected the court,

104
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,640
and interrupted proceedings.

105
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,160
You should be spine-flogged
ten times by law.

106
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,280
Zhao, do you agree?

107
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,200
No, I don't.

108
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,520
Good. Ten more times.

109
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,360
You're just, your honor.

110
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,440
Flog her. Flog her hard.

111
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,200
Mercy, your honor.

112
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,320
You can't do this.

113
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,200
She would die being flogged 20 times.

114
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Flog me if you want.

115
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,720
She offended you because of me.

116
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,240
You can punish me instead.

117
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,600
What do you mean she offended me

118
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
because of you?

119
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,760
Pull them apart.

120
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,840
Mercy, your honor.

121
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
- No, your honor.
- Mercy, your honor.

122
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,160
No, no.

123
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,880
Do it.

124
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,000
Mercy, your honor!

125
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,160
Take it away.

126
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,960
Your honor.

127
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,320
How can they do this!

128
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,140
(Upright and Honest)

129
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,120
Don't do it, your honor.

130
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,960
Don't.

131
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,040
Where is justice?

132
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,280
God, look at this.

133
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,800
Yeah.

134
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,960
No.

135
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,880
Do it.

136
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,160
You can't do it.

137
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,480
Who are you?

138
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,080
My lord.

139
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,920
When did you arrive Huating?

140
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,320
I'm passing by,
so I came to have a look.

141
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,240
Muddlehead!

142
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,280
The defendant is innocent.

143
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,400
How can you punish her so severely?

144
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,760
What…what is going on?

145
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,760
Why did you stop?

146
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,520
What are you doing?

147
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,480
Who are you?

148
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,720
It's fine. Don't mind him.

149
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,000
Continue on the sentence.

150
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,160
How should I sentence

151
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,800
in such a situation?

152
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,600
(Xu Yong, Prefect of Xiuzhou)
By laws.

153
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,400
(Xu Yong, Prefect of Xiuzhou)

154
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,550
(Xu Yong, Prefect of Xiuzhou)
Women and children should be treated

155
00:07:23,574 --> 00:07:24,600
(Xu Yong, Prefect of Xiuzhou)
with leniency in court.

156
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,320
This is antiquity of custom.

157
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,040
I won't interfere in it.

158
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,760
Just do it as you wish.

159
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,920
They always say that

160
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,320
there are many local officials
bending the law.

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,840
Zhou She is one of the rich.

162
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,440
I have to sit in and listen,

163
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,800
so I can defend you when the others

164
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,880
slander you, right?

165
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,160
Yes, yes.

166
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,960
Thanks, my lord.

167
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,360
Please sit.

168
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,200
How can he settle a lawsuit like this?

169
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,960
Yeah.

170
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,160
Yeah, look.

171
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,180
(Upright and Honest)

172
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,560
Order! Order!

173
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,600
Silence!

174
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,080
Don't push me.

175
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,520
Zhou She.

176
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,640
You have breached the law

177
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,920
by plundering official performers

178
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,600
and abusing women.

179
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,920
You should be tattooed on the face
and exiled 3,000 miles away

180
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,360
and suffer spine flogging of 30.

181
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,790
And there is no actual evidence
for what you have accused

182
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,880
of Zhao and Song.

183
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,120
They are free to go home,

184
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
and free to marry.

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Song shall have the ownership
of the estate of Zhou

186
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,760
according to the divorcing letter.

187
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,040
Thanks, your honor.

188
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,560
- Great!
- Great!

189
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,760
Execute!

190
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,440
Thanks, your honor!

191
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,160
Mercy, your honor!

192
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,120
Mercy!

193
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,360
Your honor!

194
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,760
- Pan'er, did I hear it right?
- Mercy! Your honor!

195
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,520
Yes, he'll be tattooed and exiled.

196
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,440
He deserves it!

197
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,760
Wise judgement, your honor!

198
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,000
Bravo!

199
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,160
Beat him!

200
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,680
Easy, my lords.

201
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,840
He deserves severe punishment.

202
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,760
- Beat him!
- Beat him hard!

203
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:18,630
Great!

204
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,850
He had it coming!

205
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,120
I knew it was you.

206
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,200
You were almost killed in court.

207
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,440
Be careful.

208
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,640
I'm tough.

209
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,920
Like you.

210
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,840
Flogging of 20 won't kill me.

211
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,880
And that Prefect Xu.

212
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He was helping us.

213
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,840
Does it mean you're okay now?

214
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,200
I won't die in a while.

215
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,480
Good.

216
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,720
What?

217
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,160
Your patron

218
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,440
made you unhappy again?

219
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,840
He's not my patron.

220
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,640
But with his help,

221
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,840
Yang's case

222
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,320
would be settled very soon.

223
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,600
Good.

224
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
Let me see your hand.

225
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,880
Pan'er.

226
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,280
You're here.

227
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,160
Mr. Gu.

228
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,840
You're behind all of this?

229
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,360
What's wrong with her?

230
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,160
They talked harshly about her.

231
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,960
Some of them don't know
what are musicians

232
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,920
and what are performers.

233
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,400
They call her whore.

234
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,800
Don't listen to them.

235
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,960
Yinzhang, stop crying.

236
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,480
This is Mr. Gu, who saved us today.

237
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,800
Thanks to him.

238
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,160
Thanks, Mr. Gu.

239
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,120
You don't have to.

240
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,480
Easy.

241
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,240
Faster. Faster.

242
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,600
Zhao Pan'er!

243
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,520
Yinzhang, are you alright?

244
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,680
I'm fine.

245
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,760
Yinzhang, are you hurt?

246
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,960
No, I'm fine.

247
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,240
Thanks, Mr. Gu.

248
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,600
I…I don't know how to repay it,

249
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,360
only wish to…

250
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,360
It's no big deal.

251
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,560
I've asked my man

252
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,360
to redeem your pipa.

253
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
My moon.

254
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,240
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

255
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,880
This is all because

256
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,120
of my bad management, commander.

257
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,720
My apologies.

258
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,960
Are you pleased

259
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,560
for what I did?

260
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
Thanks.

261
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,640
Sorry for this, my ladies.

262
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,560
You flattered us.

263
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,840
Many thanks, my lord.

264
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,400
Don't mention it.

265
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,680
Oh,

266
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,600
I heard that Ms. Zhao
is heading to the Capital.

267
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,160
I've arranged the fastest stagecoach.

268
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,720
There are eight days until Grain Rain.

269
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,120
Horses and wheelers will be changed

270
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,160
in each posthouse.

271
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,960
Please don't worry.

272
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,880
You will arrive in the Capital

273
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,960
within seven days.

274
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,960
Please arrange another carriage

275
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,360
to send the others back to Qiantang.

276
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,640
I'm not going back.

277
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,400
I have nowhere to go.

278
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,040
I'm going with Pan'er.

279
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,240
I can make some help

280
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,760
if anything happens.

281
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,760
I'm not going back either.

282
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,920
This case is spreading so fast.

283
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,400
The whole Jiangnan

284
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,360
would know it in a few days.

285
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,360
I'm too ashamed to go back.

286
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,080
Pan'er,

287
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,120
take me with you,

288
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,400
let's go find Ouyang together, okay?

289
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,280
But your musician register
is still in Qiantang.

290
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,800
This is not hard.

291
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,040
Hangzhou Music Bureau
is not my range,

292
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,320
but I can write a letter

293
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
asking Miss Song to do something
for me

294
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,960
in the Music Division.

295
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,480
So all of you can go to the Capital.

296
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,720
Really?

297
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,880
That's so great!

298
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,120
Thanks, my lord.

299
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,040
Please follow me, my ladies.

300
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,280
Let's go, Yinzhang.

301
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:24,840
What?

302
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,880
You have won the case

303
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,840
and will arrive the Capital in time.

304
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,040
You should be happy.

305
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,560
I'm not unhappy.

306
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,840
I was just frightened.

307
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,920
Not recovered yet.

308
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,880
Liar.

309
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,640
I'm not lying.

310
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,200
Admit it.

311
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,280
I'm not a liar.

312
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,080
Are you scared?

313
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,000
Gu Qianfan…

314
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,360
I know you're scared.

315
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,800
What the county magistrate
did just now

316
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,480
was completely
beyond your expectations.

317
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,960
Yes, you're usually

318
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,040
a witted girl

319
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,280
and have your resorts.

320
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,640
You're smart and always get
what you want

321
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,480
among folks.

322
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,640
Even a canny businessman
like Zhou She

323
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,240
was easily manipulated by you.

324
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,000
But when it comes to
the government officials,

325
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,920
you will have no chance at all.

326
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,080
You should know,

327
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,840
a small official like
the magistrate of Huating

328
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,040
can almost kill you,

329
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,360
what will you do in the Capital?

330
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,000
Your rivals will be a Third Graduate,

331
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,480
and the relatives of the emperor.

332
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,640
You're right.

333
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,360
But I will figure it out myself

334
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,560
if anything happens.

335
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,880
Figure it out yourself?

336
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,600
It's not easy living in the Capital.

337
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,160
If anything happens to you,

338
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,040
even I may not be able to protect you.

339
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,040
Gu Qianfan,

340
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,520
what do you want me to do?

341
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,760
If you don't want me
to go to the Capital,

342
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,760
why are you arranging
the carriage for me?

343
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,280
If you want me to go,

344
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,880
why are you telling me all this?

345
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,110
I'm afraid you would regret it.

346
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,830
I won't.

347
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,880
I don't need your help anymore.

348
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,240
You've helped me too many times.

349
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,800
I don't know how to pay you back.

350
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,880
Did I ask you to pay me back?

351
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,520
You can refuse,

352
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,760
but I have to pay pack.

353
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,320
The Night Revels and the money,

354
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,200
I'll give them back.

355
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,200
As well as the interest.

356
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,680
See you then.

357
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,200
Take care.

358

00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,000
Not going to the Capital?

360
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,400

You can leave.

Greetings, My lord.

It's been years since the last time

407
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,880
we met in the Ministry of Personnel.

408
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,680
I hope you're doing well.

409
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,960
You're doing a great job here.

410
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,160
Thanks for the praise.

411

I'm flattered.

412
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,880
I really am.

413
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,440
I've brought you

414
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,400
three gifts

415
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,600
for the great job you did.

416
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,240
Forgive me, my lord.

417
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,320
I don't know what I did wrong.

418
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,360
You privately opened the sea channels

419
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,280
for the Nanyang merchants
to Hangzhou.

420
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,200
I can turn a blind eye to it.

421
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,440
You killed Yang Zhiyuan and his family.

422
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,040
I can ignore it, too.

423
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,720
But you conspired with Lei Jing

424
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,280
for my son's life.

00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,840

Then I'll have your life first.

No, no.

I have no intention to offend your son.

434
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,760
I beg you, my lord.

435
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,440
Please spare my life.

436
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,320
I…

437
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,880
I have more than 400 million coins.

438
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,680
It's all yours if you spare my life.

439
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,840
Please be merciful.

440

one family of yours
will be slaughtered.

447
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,840
I've left them all to you.

It's the first time
I've seen someone like you.

474
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,720
You're obviously angry,

475

but you're just holding it

Let me whip your horse

00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,520
Do you have to?

516
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,160
I wish

517
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,800
I could do

518
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,360
something like this for you every day.

519
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,920
Zheng Qingtian was an idiot
when he was alive.

520
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,760
But he was smart when he died.

521
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,480
He had taken

522
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,640
all the crimes to himself in the letter.

523
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,400
No one who took his money

524
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,240
was implicated.

525
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,440
Minister Xiao is truly

526
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,440
extraordinary.

527
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,400
What?

528
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,280
Still don't want to call me father?

529
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,800
Forget it.

530
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,560
I won't force you.

531
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,880
You are as stubborn as your mother.

532
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,880
Anyway,

533
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,080
I'm okay if you come to this place

534
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,880
now and then.

535
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,520
Just don't do it like this time.

536
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,560
You obviously came to Jiangnan
for a case,

537
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,600
but…

538
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,000
Why are you

539
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
avoiding me?

540
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,760
Once I go back to the Capital,

541
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,320
His Majesty will definitely
award me a new mansion.

542
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,320
I will leave you

543
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,520
a house by then.

544
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,480
A house

545
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,600
or the wealth,

546
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,240
it's better to leave it to your sons.

547
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,680
How can they compare to you?

548
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,000
I became a presented scholar
when I was twenty-six,

549
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,960
but you, eighteen.

550
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,960
This is called "the student
has become the master".

551
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,240
If it wasn't you who insisted to

552
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,480
go to the Capital Security Office,

553
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,000
you're at least in

554
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,880
an important post like a Hanlin Scholar.

555
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,240
Then you wouldn't end up

556
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,520
in a state of being injured?

557
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,560
Uncle was a military commander.

558
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,760
He always wanted someone
to take over his mantle.

559
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,960
What about my mantle?

560
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,600
You are my first-born son.

561
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,440
My most valued son.

562
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,680
My surname is Gu,

563
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,640
not Xiao.

564
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,200
I know.

565
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,800
But…

566
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,200
Qianfan.

567
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,320
Your maternal grandfather and uncle

568
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,720
have always been prejudiced
against me.

569
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,360
They only know about integrity,

570
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,000
regardless of practicality.

571
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,800
No matter how well I do,

572
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,840
in their eyes,

573
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,040
I'm always a low-born minister

574
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,120
who likes to manipulate power.

575
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
What about that singing performer?

576
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,560
Did they put her in your bed?

577
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,240
I have never

578
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,840
betrayed your mother.

579
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,080
How could I fall in love

580
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,800
with that kind of woman?

581
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,960
It was a misunderstanding.

582
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
You do not believe me?

583
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,920
You are an official yourself.

584
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,200
I don't believe

585
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,920
that you have never socialized.

586
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,880
Otherwise, how could you meet

587
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,360
that Zhao Pan'er?

588
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,960
I have never heard of

589
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,160
Fei-qian before.

590
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,360
Pan'er, do you know about it?

591
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,280
Fei-qian can only be used

592
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,680
by officials and merchants
who have obtained the permission

593
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,440
from the imperial court.

594
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,000
Common people are not allowed
to use it.

595
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,800
But they have to go to

596
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,440
the official money house
to exchange it for money

597
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,280
once they arrive in the Capital.

598
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,240
Prefect Xu is such a big helper.

599
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,360
But…

600
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,680
He did it for Mr. Gu's sake, didn't he?

601
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,440
Um…That Mr. Gu…

602
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,080
Who is he?

603
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,360
He…

604
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,120
How did you meet him?

605
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,800
Chen Lian called him "Commander".

606
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,360
What does he command?

607
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,760
Yinzhang.

608
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,280
Pan'er is tired these days.

609
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,880
Give her a break.

610
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,760
I'm your father
and it's my responsibility

611
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,440
traveling miles for your sake.

612
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,160
But as my son, if you do such things
for a woman,

613
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,200
I feel obliged to look into it.

614
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,880
Otherwise,

615
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,960
I'll be an incompetent parent.

616
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,600
She saved my life.

617
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,840
Listen to me carefully,

618
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,160
a woman of this status,

619
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,520
though she's improved,

620
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,960
is no good match for you.

621
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,760
I helped her to the Capital

622
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,800
just to reunite

623
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,000
her and her fiancé.

624
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,880
Even Emperor Taizu escorted
Jingniang for 1,000 miles.

625
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,360
Don't overthink it, all right?

626
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,120
I see.

627
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,960
Okay, good.

628
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,480
You are young and promising.

629
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,120
Only highborn ladies
whose predecessors are all officials

630
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,960
are worthy of you.

631
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,920
I actually know a few of them.

632
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,520
Do you need my help?

633
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,720
Yes, I begged you to save my life.

634
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,640
I owe you one.

635
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,080
But it doesn't mean

636
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,680
you can arrange my marriage.

637
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,600
You are exactly the same as me
when I was young.

638
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,680
Who is exactly like you?

639
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,720
Shuniang, did you see?

640
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,120
He is angry with me!

641
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,320
For all these years,

642
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,320
he's always been so polite.

643
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,600
But just now

644
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,040
he really got mad at me.

645
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,480
Shuniang, I'm so happy.

646
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,520
So happy.

647
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,000
My ladies, please wake up.

648
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,710
Here is the Capital.

649
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,320
Wake up.

650
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,480
Wake up.

651
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,360
We're here.

652
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,000
We're here?

653
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,710
Really?

654
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,080
We're in the Capital?

655
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,760
Yes, my ladies.

656
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,000
We're here.

657
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,800
Come, it's fresh-made.

658
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,100
(The Eastern Capital)

659
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,760
Don't run.

660
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,720
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

661
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,400
Sachets and bags.

662
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,320
Take a look.

663
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,400
Sachets and bags.

664
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,160
Not tired anymore?

665
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,600
Bravo!

666
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,560
Bravo!

667
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,320
One more!

668
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,280
One more!

669
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,440
One more!

670
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,560
Bravo!

671
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,360
Bravo!

672
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,800
Bravo!

673
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,760
Bravo!

674
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,040
Impressive!

675
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,120
One more!

676
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,840
This is the Capital.

677
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,440
Where are you, Ouyang Xu?

678
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,240
Where can I find you?

679
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,440
Pan'er.

680
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,880
Where am I?

681
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,960
This is Sanyuan Inn.

682
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,440
You fainted yesterday.

683
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,400
There is only one inn nearby.

684
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,400
Yinzhang and I carried you in.

685
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,720
This is the only room left.

686
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,480
A little more expensive.

687
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,840
Forget about the money.

688
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,940
Pan'er is ill.

689
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,420
She has to rest.

690
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,960
What day is it today?

691
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,080
Tomorrow is Grain Rain.

692
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
Don't worry.

693
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,760
We have checked for you.

694
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,000
There is no news
about the wedding in Gao Family.

695
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,320
You still have time.

696
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,520
We can find Ouyang
as long as we find Inspector Gao.

697
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,200
Where is Gao's mansion?

698
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,560
Two streets away.

699
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:19,100
(Gao's Mansion)

700
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,420
(Gao's Mansion)

701
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:42,940
(Gao's Mansion)

702
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,520
Pan'er.

703
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,860
(Ouyang Xu)

704
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,520
How did you come?

705
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,720
Ouyang.

706
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,020
(Gao's Mansion)

707
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,800
There is a nice tea house nearby.

708
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,880
Let's talk there.

709
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,040
Just go.

710
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,620
(Gao's Mansion)

711
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,180
(Gao's Mansion)

712
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,800
I knew Uncle De lied to me.

713
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,760
Did he?

714
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,080
That old fellow.

715
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,800
I've been anxious

716
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,320
for half a month.

717
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,440
Until this moment,

718
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,920
I feel so relieved.

719
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,640
It's quite exuberant here.

720
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:28,300
(Fragrance and Pureness)

721
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,820
(Tea House)

722
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,400
Please sit.

723
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,200
This tea house is really good.

724
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,080
Why are they still boiling the tea
in the Capital?

725
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,280
Customs are quite different
in South and North.

726
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,880
You might as well try the Capital tea.

727
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,760
No.

728
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,640
The Shuangjing silver tip
is the most delicate.

729
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,240
Sorry.

730
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,920
It can't be boiled for so long.

731
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,840
You should boil it for five breaths

732
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,880
and then pour it into the tea dust.

733
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,800
This will make it fresh and fragrant.

734
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,560
By the way, better use a silver pot.

735
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,240
Iron pot makes it taste bitter.

736
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,680
This young lady is an expert.

737
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,080
Thanks for the lesson.

738
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,080
Leave us. We'll do it ourselves.

739
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,040
Yes, my lord.

740
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,260
(Tea House)

741
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,200
You haven't tasted the tea I made
for a long time, have you?

742
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,160
Pan'er.

743
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,560
I'm telling you,

744
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,880
not everything in the Capital
is as good as Qiantang.

745
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,960
This tea house is so nice to look,

746
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,440
but the way they make tea
is quite unsatisfactory.

747
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,400
Pan'er,

748
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,880
I have something to tell you.

749
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,640
What do you say

750
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,480
if we postpone our wedding
to the end of the year?

751
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,800
No problem.

752
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,040
I'm not in a hurry.

753
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,200
By the way,

754
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,040
what title did they grant you?

755
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,120
Not so fast.

756
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,440
The White Banquet has just finished.

757
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,440
All presented scholars have to
visit His Majesty

758
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,320
before they are officially granted.

759
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,400
I can only be

760
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,120
a real official after being granted.

761
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,360
Pan'er,

762
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,400
just because of this,

763
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,040
you will have to wait a little longer.

764
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,120
I swear I'll give you a grand wedding.

765
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,640
But you have to wait

766
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,560
for half a year

767
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,720
after I marry Miss Gao.
