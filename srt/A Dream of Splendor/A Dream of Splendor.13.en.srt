17
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,000
Ms. Song,

18
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,000
may I do the honor

19
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,960
to still be your guide?

20
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,400
I'm Shen Ruzhuo, the Editorial Director.

21
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,200
Today, I'm here on business.

22
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,000
I happened to hear your pipa playing.

23
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,040
I was quite lucky.

24
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,160
You flatter me.

25
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,000
Come with me, Ms. Song.

26
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,520
Let me show you around the Division.

27
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,080
Here is the Buddhist Music Section.

28
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,240
This is where I usually study music.

29
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,360
Pipa Branch where you'll work
is across the hall.

30
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,600
Let me take you there.

31
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,400
Mr. Shen, please don't.

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,920
I'll go there by myself.

33
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,480
All right.

34
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,600
- Greetings, Ms. Song.
- Greetings, Ms. Song.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,520
The mastery of instruments matters most,

36
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,120
instead of seniority.

37
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,560
I am new here.

38
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,200
But now that I'm your coach,

39
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,640
I'll do the job I'm hired for.

40
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,020
(Zhao's Teahouse)

41
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,880
The weather doesn't look very good.

42
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,960
It's going to rain.

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,080
- I should go.
- See you.

44
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,920
Are we closing already?

45
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,360
It's raining and no customer will come.

46
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,660
(Music Division)

47
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,560
Ms. Song,

48
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,480
it's raining so heavily.

49
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,680
Shall I give you a ride?

50
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
No, thanks.

51
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,200
My lady, get in, please.

52
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,680
I'm not a lecher.

53
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,160
Why are you so scared of me, Ms. Song?

54
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,160
I'm-I'm not scared of you.

55
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,760
I'm just timid

56
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,800
and I'm not used
to talking to strangers.

57
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,920
Liar.

58
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,800
When you lectured the musicians,

59
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,400
you sounded quite confident.

60
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,160
That's not true.

61
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,320
I-I am confident

62
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,680
only when I play pipa.

63
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,080
Is that true?

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,800
Yes. I swear to God.

65
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,200
I-I didn't lie to you.

66
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,120
Could you stop following me?

67
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,080
It shall be as you command, my lady.

68
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,080
However,

69
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,440
I believe I'll see you again soon.

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,520
I live on Left Street
of Changle Residential.

71
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,280
Ms. Song, if you want
to talk about music or tea,

72
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,120
I'll be waiting there.

73
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,840
Yinzhang.

74
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,960
It was raining. Where were you?

75
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,120
When we didn't see you at home,
we were so worried

76
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,400
that you might be in trouble.

77
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,680
We're on our way to look for you.

78
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,280
I'm all right.

79
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,600
I'll put my pipa back in my room first.

80
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,680
Come on.

81
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,160
Yinzhang made sense.

82
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,120
Now that we decide to stay
in the Eastern Capital,

83
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,880
she can't still be a registered musician

84
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,920
of Qiantang County.

85
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,800
We should have used Prefect Xu's letter

86
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,440
a long time ago.

87
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,080
Even then,

88
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,880
she shouldn't have gone
to the Music Division alone.

89
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,240
That's a complicated place

90
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,120
with a mix of people.

91
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,720
You don't know anyone there.

92
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,000
Do you think it's easy

93
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,240
to seek help from Music Administrators?

94
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,880
Do you know how to deal with them?

95
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,960
Do you know how to bride people?

96
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,480
I do.

97
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,000
I bought ambergris incense
for Music Administrators.

98
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,320
I stayed away from bad men.

99
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,280
I even played Song of Liangzhou.

100
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,960
Everyone there was stunned.

101
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,880
No one in the Music Division
will hurt me,

102
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,800
because I've registered there.

103
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm already a coach at Pipa Branch.

104
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,160
I resigned to my identity
as a registered musician.

105
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,120
But I don't want
to resign to anything else.

106
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,240
Mr. Gu Qianfan set me straight that day.

107
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,240
Pan'er, you want to protect me.

108
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,800
And I want to protect you, too.

109
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,440
As long as I work in the Music Division

110
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,120
and get praised by His Majesty

111
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,920
just like Zhang Haohao,

112
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,200
the Gao Family will no longer hurt us.

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,520
It's true that I can only play pipa.

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,440
But it doesn't mean I'm ignorant.

115
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,840
I served Prince Qian's mother.

116
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,680
I went to official banquets.

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I mostly know

118
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,520
how singing performers behave.

119
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,520
I can even get monthly paid
by the Music Division.

120
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,400
With the money,
we can afford two handymen, right?

121
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,320
I just don't want you to work so hard

122
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,560
or always take care of me.

123
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,040
Sorry, Yinzhang.

124
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,400
I was wrong.

125
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,240
All right.

126
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,640
Be seated.

127
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,670
Yinzhang can be so thoughtful.

128
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,120
We should feel happy.

129
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,320
If only Zifang could...!

130
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,360
If it weren't for Fu Xingui
and Fu Zifang,

131
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
Ouyang Xu and Zhou She,

132
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,840
we wouldn't

133
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,520
have been living such a hard life.

134
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,440
Why are we all so stupid?

135
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,440
Forget it.

136
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,640
We're doing good, aren't we?

137
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
Yes, we are.

138
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,040
There are some good men, anyway.

139
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,040
Yinzhang, don't pull a long face.

140
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,280
You're the coach now.

141
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,560
You should behave more elegantly.

142
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,880
It's good for you to work
in the Music Division.

143
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,960
Then,

144
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,400
you can take colleagues or trainees

145
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,880
to our teahouse.

146
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,640
The business wasn't good today.

147
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,440
We've been worried.

148
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,160
Why wasn't it good?

149
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,080
Weren't there
a lot of customers yesterday?

150
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,240
It's the way business goes.

151
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
It's sometimes good and sometimes bad.

152
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,440
Perhaps it's because
of the holiday of schools

153
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,680
or because it's raining today.

154
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,640
Maybe it'll get better tomorrow.

155
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,000
I'll help you in the teahouse tomorrow.

156
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,840
Good.

157
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,200
When Yinzhang is there,
the business will be good.

158
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,920
That's right.

159
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,120
Come on.
Let's drink tea instead of wine.

160
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,000
Cheers.

161
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,360
To cheer you up,

162
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,480
I'll make you something delicious.

163
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,240
All right. Go.

164
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,400
Come on.

165
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,520
Don't get involved in the interrogation.

166
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,600
You should go back.

167
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,960
But since I started to work here,

168
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,560
I haven't interrogated a criminal yet.

169
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,400
Please, Chief.

170
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,800
I captured the Liao spy, anyway.

171
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,680
Commissioner, he didn't confess,
however hard he was tortured.

172
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,120
All right, then.

173
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,440
Let's teach him a good lesson.

174
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,240
Stop.

175
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,560
What did you try to pry into

176
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,080
by sneaking into our nation?

177
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,120
I can confess.

178
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,560
But I just have one request.

179
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,720
If I tell you who's the traitor,

180
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,080
could you kill me directly?

181
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,920
Go ahead.

182
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,800
The Imperial Diarist,

183
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,360
Shi Quan.

184
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,280
You kept being tortured,

185
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,120
just to make me believe your confession.

186
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,160
Thanks for trying.

187
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,760
Shi Quan isn't a high official.

188
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,120
But he's the son-in-law of Qi Mu,
Vice Censor-in-chief.

189
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,640
If he were a real traitor,

190
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,200
Qi Mu must have been involved.

191
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,920
You probably think
I support the Empress

192
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,320
because I made a contribution

193
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,880
by defending Her Majesty, right?

194
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,520
You think I like to fight
upright officials

195
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,480
led by Qi Mu.

196
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,840
But unfortunately,

197
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,880
you gave yourself away from the start.

198
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,840
Liao people like gold

199
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,240
while the Western Xia people like jade.

200
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,440
Actually, you are

201
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,240
from the Western Xia.

202
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,360
You're scared of the war against Liao.

203
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,320
So, you set interlocked traps

204
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,600
to start a fight between Liao and Song.

205
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,440
Yes or no?

206
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

207
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,520
Play some music for him.

208
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,800
When you're lashed by a steel whip,

209
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,200
it sounds like beautiful music.

210
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,480
If you want a quick death,

211
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,960
just tell the truth.

212
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,680
Then I'll kill you directly.

213
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,040
Gu Qianfan,

214
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,000
you're the ruthless Living Devil!

215
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,560
Something will get back at you.

216
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,160
You and your ancestors

217
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,080
only deserve to rot in hell!

218
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,480
Try to commit suicide?

219
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,000
Make him confess however stubborn he is.

220
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,560
(You're worth your reputation
of Living Devil.)

221
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,520
You even flattened the suspect.

222
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,160
(Living Devil)

223
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,840
doesn't sound nice.

224
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,880
But for the court

225
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,040
and our nation,

226
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,960
bubble reputation isn't that important.

227
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,080
(What about my legacy?)

228
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,760
You're my eldest son!

229
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,680
I care about you most!

230
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,440
(As a literary family
for five generations,)

231
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,280
(the Gu Family
has unyielding integrity.)

232
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,240
But you're an exception, scoundrel.

233
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,800
You even work for eunuchs.

234
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,120
(- You're so wicked,
- Honey.)

235
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,160
(just like your father!)

236
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,080
(Gu Qianfan,)

237
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,000
(you're the ruthless Living Devil!)

238
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,560
(Something will get back at you.)

239
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,240
(You and your ancestors)

240
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,200
(only deserve to rot in hell!)

241
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,140
(South Gate)

242
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,380
(South Gate)

243
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,440
It's not raining today.

244
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,760
Why are there still so few customers?

245
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,560
Do they not like

246
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,960
the pastries I make?

247
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,240
It can't be true.

248
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,480
On the opening day,
a lot of customers came

249
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,080
and they enjoyed the pastries.

250
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,520
The price hasn't gone up.

251
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,680
Why do no customers come?

252
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,240
Look.

253
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,440
The pastries were made last night.

254
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,560
They'll go bad tonight.

255
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
We must throw them away.

256
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,680
Then we'll lose a large sum of money.

257
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,240
There must be some other reason.

258
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,120
Ma'am, a bowl of Zhenru Tea, please.

259
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,320
Be right there.

260
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,440
Sanniang, look.

261
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,400
This is all the money we've made
in the past few days.

262
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
(Accounts)

263
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,480
I'll grind the tea. A minute, please.

264
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,560
Grind the tea?

265
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,160
I don't have time for that.

266
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,640
Get me some loose tea.

267
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,200
Loose tea?

268
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,880
Can't you make it?

269
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,760
Put some tea leaves in the bowl

270
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,120
and brew them with hot water.

271
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,280
We have it.

272
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,680
Enjoy it, please.

273
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,680
Thank you. Nice tea.

274
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,840
Wait here. I'll be out for a moment.

275
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,840
Morning, Chief.

276
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,720
You seldom come so early.

277
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,960
I'm just dying to know

278
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,080
how the interrogation ended up.

279
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,760
What have you got? Did he confess?

280
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,120
What are you doing here?

281
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,320
Commissioner Lei heard
that a spy was captured.

282
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,200
He asked me to come and check it out.

283
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,080
Never you mind. Back you go.

284
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,840
But Commissioner Lei sent me.

285
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,040
Don't make a fuss in his name.

286
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,000
That day, he made it very clear

287
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,600
that our chief would
take full responsibility

288
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,760
of investigations and explorations.

289
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,120
What is a gatekeeper like you
concerned about?

290
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:21,960
Deputy Commissioner,

291
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,920
the spy was captured at Gongchen Gate
where I was in charge.

292
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,760
If necessary,

293
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,200
I'm supposed to interrogate him.

294
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
What? Try to take credit?

295
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,920
Yu Zhongquan, shame on you.

296
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,560
I captured that man, all right?

297
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,800
Gu Qianfan!

298
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,080
Is this how you discipline
your subordinate?

299
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,720
Sounds like you're not my subordinate.

300
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,440
I was out of line just then.

301
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,280
I don't dare to offend you.

302
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,320
You dare and I can see that.

303
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,600
I hear your concubine turns out

304
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,520
to be a cousin of Zheng Qingtian's wife.

305
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,640
This is just a rumor

306
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,480
without evidence of that.

307
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
Please don't believe the rumor.

308
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,080
I did have a concubine.

309
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,160
But she died of a sudden illness.

310
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,960
I never said anything
to Commissioner Lei

311
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,120
about the case of Jiangnan Region.

312
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,120
When did you ever hear

313
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,320
that guards like us

314
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,160
needed evidence to arrest someone?

315
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,240
Deputy Commissioner,

316
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,400
the spy confessed.

317
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,440
His bones are all broken

318
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,600
and he's dying.

319
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,640
What?

320
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,360
Commandant Yu,

321
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,760
you didn't come to take credit

322
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,760
and you look quite anxious.

323
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,320
You're probably an accomplice, then.

324
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,120
Are you going to slay him?

325
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,760
I talked nonsense for credit.

326
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,560
I deserve to be executed.

327
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,360
Not that serious.

328
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,720
Go get a rag for him.

329
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,560
Walk from here to the North Bureau

330
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,240
and wipe every inch of the place

331
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,280
you have walked through.

332
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,880
Remember.

333
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,640
If you dare to come again
without the right reason

334
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,080
and stain my territory,

335
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,200
you will have to use your tongue,

336
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,000
instead of a rag.

337
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,040
Got it.

338
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,880
Don't forget to complain
to Commissioner Lei.

339
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,320
Tell him what exactly happened.

340
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,680
I'd like to see

341
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,080
which side he will be on this time.

342
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,320
Darn it, Living Devil.

343
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,360
Don't bother to get a doctor.

344
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,080
Make him put his thumbprint on it

345
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,120
and kill him.

346
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,680
Aye.

347
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,920
But...

348
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,760
What? Scared?

349
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,000
If you don't even dare to kill,
how can you arrogate criminals?

350
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm not being timid.

351
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,520
I killed people on battlefields, too.

352
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,360
But...

353
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,720
You don't have to explain.

354
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,760
I was scared, too.

355
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,720
When there's blood on a robe,

356
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,560
it can be easily washed away.

357
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,880
But if a piece of paper is stained,

358
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,440
it will never be clean again.

359
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,480
This is why I don't ask you
to interrogate anyone.

360
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,520
(Capital Security Office)
Chief, why are you so nice to me?

361
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,000
If my two sisters weren't married,

362
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,360
I would want you
to marry either of them.

363
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,600
But Pan'er is kind of my sister, too.

364
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,320
Shut up.

365
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,840
What have you got by spying on them?

366
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,920
Their business

367
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,560
doesn't seem to be good.

368
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,840
(Mahang Street)
Come and have a look.

369
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,920

(Mahang Street)

382
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,320
What's worrying you?

383
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,840
There are few customers.

384
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,760
Shortly after the opening day,

385
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,080
the business is already so bad.

386
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,440
This isn't a good sign.

387
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,240
That's right.

388
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,120
Living Devil like you came
so early in the morning.

389
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,360
We'll certainly have bad luck.

390
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,800
Under such circumstances,

391
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,040
why are you still in the mood for jokes?

392
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,400
You already knew that?

393
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,680
Your nickname?

394
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,560
I did.

395
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,960
Aren't you scared?

396
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,520
Of what?

397
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,320
I've known you for days.

398
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,000
By the way, you complained

399
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,400
that I didn't like to ask you for help.

400
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,200
Now I want you to do me a favor.

401
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,400
Just for the record,

402
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,600
you can't cancel the bet.

403
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,720
How narrow-minded!

404
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,400
Just some questions.

405
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,560
First, do people in the Eastern Capital
not like whisking tea?

406
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,800
Second, why is there
no restaurant or food shop

407
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,560
on this street?

408
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,600
Third,

409
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,960
was it an important festival
some days ago?

410
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,040
That's all?

411
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,720
What do you think I am?

412
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,400
A snoop?

413
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,600
You're from the Capital Security Office.

414
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,400
You do better than a snoop.

415
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,900
(Prudent In Business)

416
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,600
You shouldn't be in the way.

417
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,680
What? Are you blind?

418
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,480
Sorry, Commandant Yu.

419
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,360
Get lost!

420
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,040
Aye.

421
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,200
Gu Qianfan,

422
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,040
don't think you can do anything
just by getting engaged

423
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,560
with the Xiao Family.

424
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,840
One day,

425
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,800
I'll wash off the shame.

426
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,120
Streets in the Eastern Capital
are divided by trades.

427
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,560
Do you know why this street
is named Mahang Street?

428
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,360
(Mahang Street)
It's where horse traders and markets are.

429
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,200
Since childhood, local people know

430
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,000
they can buy medicinal herbs
at the Pharmacy Bureau

431
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,800
and do clothes shopping
in the east of Pan House.

432
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,520
When they want some tea,

433
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,920
they visit the Tea Lane.

434
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,240
Oh, I see.

435
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,240
This street is very bustling

436
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,640
and there wasn't a teahouse before.

437
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,160
I thought it was the best place
to run a teahouse.

438
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,600
Unexpectedly,

439
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,440
local people don't come here for tea.

440
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,000
There's a Guanyin Temple near here.
[*Guanyin: Avalokitesvara]

441
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,520
When you opened the teahouse,
it was the Buddha's Birthday.

442
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,520
A lot of worshippers came.

443
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,680
But usually, only horse traders

444
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,640
come to this street.

445
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,520
I know the complicated process
of whisking tea

446
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,560
takes quite a lot of time.

447
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,800
Men of letters can accept that.

448
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,760
But civilians in the Eastern Capital

449
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,920
don't like that kind of tea.

450
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,920
Loose tea is cheap
and less time-consuming.

451
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,280
They love it.

452
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,720
So, from the very beginning,

453
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,000
I didn't approve of your business,

454
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,320
not because I didn't
trust your tea arts,

455
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,320
but because I thought you were

456
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
always hasty and anxious

457
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,280
to make a decision

458
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,720
as if you were scrambling
to prove something.

459
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,720
I can tell others that I'm all right.

460
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,400
I just fell.

461
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,760
I would get up and walk on.

462
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,440
But I can't fool myself.

463
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,840
I don't want to give in.

464
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,360
I always want to do something
to prove myself.

465
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,600
But I feel really bad.

466
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,920
Feels like

467
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,080
I were torn into pieces

468
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,000
and then stirred.

469
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,520
You don't know

470
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,120
how painful it is.

471
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,360
I know.

472
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,680
I was betrayed, too.

473
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,320
Do you remember

474
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,000
the night I went to see you
in Huating County?

475
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,720
Before that

476
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,920
I was just betrayed by my most trusted

477
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,840
comrade.

478
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,880
He told me on to my superior

479
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,800
just to get promoted.

480
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,240
I killed him with my own hands.

481
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,160
Was it hurt

482
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,600
when he died?

483
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,040
I was quick,

484
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,640
so he shouldn't feel any pain.

485
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,800
I mean, were you painful?

486
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,720
What kind of person

487
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,720
am I in your heart?

488
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,280
I want to hear the truth.

489
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,920
In my eyes,

490
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,160
you are a scheming

491
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,640
and ruthless soldier.

492
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,560
Of course,

493
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,880
you are decisive

494
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,160
and impartial.

495
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,800
Like me,

496
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,360
you're both righteous and stingy,

497
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,200
muddled and smart.

498
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,000
I used to tell Yinzhang

499
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,480
that everyone in this world is like

500
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,400
the flaky muffin made by Sanniang.

501
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,200
They all look the same,

502
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,040
but there are
thousands of layers inside.

503
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,480
You only know what it tastes like

504
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,600
if you taste it yourself.

505
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,400
So why do you care
what others think of you?

506
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,680
Are you comforting me?

507
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,680
Comfort

508
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,760
is sympathy.

509
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,680
You're a hero.

510
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,800
You don't need sympathy.

511
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,680
I'm a hero?

512
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,200
They call me falcon and hound,

513
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,720
talons and fangs,

514
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,720
and a living devil.

515
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,920
How am I

516
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,200
become a hero to you?

517
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,400
It's true that you and your
Security Office are notorious,

518
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,520
but until now,

519
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,880
I haven't seen you do anything bad.

520
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,280
The people you killed

521
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,200
deserve to die.

522
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,600
The cases you handled

523
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
benefit the folks.

524
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,200
In public,

525
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,520
you excluded the anxiety
for His Majesty.

526
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,720
In private,

527
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,520
you solved the problems for me.

528
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,040
As long as you don't cook charges

529
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,000
or frame up crimes,

530
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,080
you're always a hero

531
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,720
in my heart.

532
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,560
What's wrong with being hound and fangs?

533
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,360
Isn't better being hounds of the nation,
fangs of people,

534
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,520
than being officials who do nothing?

535
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,160
Hounds of the nation, fangs of people.

536
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,080
Die for a good cause,
not live for nothing.

537
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,080
Thank you.

538
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,400
To make me feel good,

539
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,360
you have made

540
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,720
a silver-tongued speech.

541
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,080
I appreciate it.

542
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,800
All right.

543
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,560
To express my gratitude,

544
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,400
I'll extend the bet for another month.

545
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,200
If you can

546
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,320
make ends meet in two months,

547
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,920
I will never interfere

548
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,320
in your business, okay?

549
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,920
Stop pretending to be nice.

550
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,600
I, Zhao Pan'er,

551
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,760
am famous for selling tea in Jiangnan.

552
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,360
Just wait and see.

553
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,640
Within a month,

554
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,840
you will have to queue up you're here.

555
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:25,380
(Prudent In Business)

556
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,240
Commandant.

557
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,400
How is it going?

558
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,200
He went to the teahouse
on Mahang Street

559
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,360
for the female shopkeeper.

560
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
Woman.

561
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,800
He went there in person.

562
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,280
Commander Gu, what brings you here?

563
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,640
Hum.

564
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,280
I'm here…

565
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,200
To tell you about Shen Ruzhuo.

566
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,080
He is the son of Shen Ming,
Inspector of Council of Rites.

567
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,680
He's from a famed family in the Capital.

568
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,440
He has a keen

569
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,000
on rhythm and dance.

570
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,840
He ran errands to your Music Division

571
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,880
to collect musical materials

572
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,640
for literature proofreading.

573
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,960
He has

574
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,360
no notorious records.

575
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,520
He meant no harm

576
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,600
following you on that day.

577
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,080
Commander Gu,

578
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,480
how did you know it?

579
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,000
Have you been secretly protecting…?

580
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,080
Not Commander Gu,

581
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,440
Deputy Commissioner now.

582
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,840
Our boss has got promoted.

583
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,200
Oh, Yinzhang,

584
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,760
I want to have the pastries

585
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,520
made by Sanniang.

586
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,440
Go get some for me.

587
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,600
What man were you talking about?

588
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,080
Why was he following you?

589
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,880
Why didn't you mention it to us?

590
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,200
Did he harm you?

591
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,680
No.

592
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,640
Don't be shy.

593
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,760
No outsiders here.

594
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,360
We're your friends.

595
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,360
We all know

596
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,640
what Zhou She did to you.

597
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,200
I said no.

598
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,280
He really has no problem?

599
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,480
Forget it.

600
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,320
Deputy Ambassador.

601
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,160
Deputy Ambassador.

602
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,720
The one who followed her,

603
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,840
has no problem?

604
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,320
Oh, right.

605
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,760
Our guests are getting lesser.

606
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,480
It's your job, isn't it?

607
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,680
You did something, didn't you?

608
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,520
Don't say that.

609
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,960
Commander Gu is not
that kind of person.

610
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,480
No. It must be him.

611
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,000
He wants us to close.

612
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,080
He doesn't want Pan'er
to open this shop.

613
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,600
He did it on purpose.

614
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,400
Think about it.
He's from the Security Office.

615
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,320
It's easy if he wants us to close up.

616
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:16,840
Stop it.

617
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,600
All right.

618
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,280
Okay.

619
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
If you say so.

620
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,160
See?

621
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,080
Why are you doing this?

622
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,400
- We had a hard time opening this shop.
- Sanniang.

623
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,280
- Why did you want us to close it?
- Stop it.

624
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,040
Stop talking.

625
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
It wasn't him.

626
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,680
I know why our business is not good.

627
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,680
- Why?
- Why?

628
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,560
I see where the problem is.

629
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:44,960
Yinzhang,

630
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,000
bring your pipa

631
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,720
to the shop tomorrow,

632
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,640
and play it as many times as you can.

633
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,120
You will definitely
attract a lot of guests.

634
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,640
Play to attract guests?

635
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,160
I'm not doing it.

636
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,640
I only play for

637
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,800
those who truly know music,

638
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,320
not for peddlers and menial servants.

639
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,640
You played pipa in the Inn, didn't you?

640
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,920
Yinzhang's identity is different now.

641
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,760
It's not appropriate to play now.

642
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,190
I forgot it.

643
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,120
You are pipa coach
in the Music Division now.

644
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
You have to be more cautious.

645
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,520
By the way,

646
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,670
as I heard from Gu Qianfan,

647
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,760
that Shen

648
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,840
is not a bad person,

649
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,400
but you still have to be careful,

650
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,080
in case to make any trouble
as Zhou She did.

651
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,440
Pan'er,

652
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,150
since the people in Mahang Street

653
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,520
don't like to drink our whisking tea,

654
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,520
we can just sell loose tea instead.

655
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,840
That would save a lot of trouble.

656
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,190
I disagree.

657
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,120
Loose tea

658
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,040
only appeals to peddlers and servants.

659
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,040
Our teahouse is so elegant,

660
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,710
and we can't do such a thing
to lower our level.

661
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,440
Level is important,

662
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,040
but you can't ignore

663
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,280
the preferences of guests.

664
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,120
How about,

665
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,710
we sell both whisking tea and loose tea.

666
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,760
But even if we sell loose tea,

667
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
if guests don't come in,

668
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,040
our business still won't get better.

669
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,760
I think,

670
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,360
we should move the shop

671
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,080
to Tea Lane for good,

672
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,520
as Deputy Ambassador said.

673
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:07,920
Move the shop?

674
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,480
We are only open for several days.

675
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,960
The rent would be wasted then.

676
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,000
Besides,

677
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:15,840
you've never

678
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,400
been a housekeeper,

679
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,440
so you don't know how much
it costs for housekeeping.

680
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,440
I have never done business before,

681
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,600
but I invested the most this time.

682
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,040
Calm down. Talk nicely.

683
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,320
What's wrong with you today?

684
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,000
You picked on me for whatever I said.

685
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,960
I did as you said before,

686
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,200
but the business
is still not getting better.

687
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,600
Besides,

688
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,640
don't I have a say in it
since I've opened my purse?

689
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,600
Enough.

690
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,560
Both of you.

691
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,040
There are always
ups and downs in business.

692
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,120
We've just opened for a few days.

693
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,080
Why argue for such a petty thing?

694
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,000
Do we continue or not?

695
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,520
Maybe we should disband

696
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,640
before the loss gets bigger.

697
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,440
We can't.

698
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,040
Listened to

699
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,080
what you said about housekeeping.

700
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,480
If I were her, I would talk back too.

701
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,320
And you,

702
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,280
tears are not your weapon.

703
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,840
It won't make what you said
more convincing.

704
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,800
You know me,

705
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,320
I don't mean what I said.

706
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,760
But it sounds like what you mean.

707
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,120
It's fine you say that to strangers.

708
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,400
But to your friends it really

709
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,320
hurts feelings.

710
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,040
You too, Yinzhang.

711
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,960
It's true that

712
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,120
you invested the most.

713
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,400
But Sanniang contributed nothing?

714
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,240
Is it not her

715
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,440
who makes pastries all day?

716
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,120
If you think

717
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,960
the one who invested the most
should take in charge,

718
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,440
then the Perfect of Kaifeng

719
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,720
should be Guard Chi.

720
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,880
Have you forgotten

721
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,480
how Sanniang rescued you

722
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,400
when she was ill?

723
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,080
It's my fault.

724
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,040
I've lost my temper again.

725
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,600
I'm sorry.

726
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,000
Get up.

727
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,280
It's my fault.

728
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,800
I shouldn't say something like that.

729
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,360
I haven't never

730
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,720
thanked you for saving my life.

731
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,920
What are you…?

732
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,680
Get up.

733
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,640
Watch out!

734
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,200
Look.

735
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,840
Why are they changing it

736
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,400
with a strawy door?

737
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,400
Are they crazy?

738
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,720
Don't you know "the flower path
has never been cleaned before,

739
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,720
the strawy door is open only for you"?

740
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,680
Who is your teacher?

741
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,920
I see.

742
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,040
Mr.-Mr. Du.

743
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,680
Mr. Du.

744
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,040
The academy was opened very early today,

745
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,040
and what are you doing here?

746
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,080
Go!

747
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,080
Yes, sir.

748
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,920
Wait a minute.

749
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,080
What are your names?

750
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,720
Tell me.

751
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,320
His name is Hu Zhiyuan.

752
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,280
My name is Liu Yongbo.

753
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,640
Go transcribing ten articles!

754
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,800
Give it to me tomorrow morning.

755
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,760
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

756
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,800
Just go!

757
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,800
Everyone is in class,

758
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,480
why are you standing here?

759
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,560
Go to class now.

760
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,840
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

761
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,000
I mistook you for someone else.

762
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,080
How dare you make up our names!

763
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,200
Take it easy.

764
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,320
He didn't wear glasses today.

765
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,480
He can't recognize people

766
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,000
a foot away.

767
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,720
That's why he couldn't
get an official position

768
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,760
since he's already a presented scholar.

769
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,040
He can only wait

770
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,120
while teaching in our academy.

771
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,720
I heard that he embarrassed himself

772
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,120
when he met with His Majesty

773
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,600
because he was too excited.

774
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,400
And he emitted the gas of grains too.

775
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,560
What does that mean?

776
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,720
Fart!

777
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:29,880
You…

778
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,880
When did you learn flower art?

779
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,240
Princess Qian taught me last year.

780
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,640
Do you want to know

781
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,800
my thoughts on the teahouse?

782
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,040
We can give up moving.

783
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,120
But we can divide it into two parts.

784
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,680
We put some tables and chairs
on the ground floor

785
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,040
and sell cheap loose tea

786
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,000
to attract guests.

787
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,360
On the second floor,
we sell whisking tea.

788
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,200
And we sell it more expensive
than before.

789
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,360
Do you know why people like
drinking our tea

790
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,400
when we were in Qiantang

791
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,480
since there were so many teahouses?

792
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,280
That's because our tea has good quality,

793
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,080
elegant names,

794
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,480
and exquisite cups to hold it.

795
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,840
We have calligraphy
and paintings on the walls

796
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,680
and unique rhythm in the house.

797
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,920
The so-called "erudite scholars
come to talk with me,

798
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,000
among my guests
there are no one undereducated".

799
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,200
If we want to do business
in the Capital,

800
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,680
we have to make use of our strengths.

801
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,840
Yinzhang, you're right.

802
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,440
You can't play pipa all the time.

803
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,920
If anyone in our teahouse can hear

804
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,800
the best pipa player
in Jiangnan playing pipa,

805
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,240
how can we make it valuable?

806
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,880
Right?

807
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,320
Yeah, that's what I thought.

808
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,600
Yinzhang is the most famous

809
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,680
in the Capital among us three.

810
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So we have to

811
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,680
run the teahouse with her
as the center.

812
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,720
First,

813
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,400
we change the shop name.

814
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,280
We have to think of an elegant
and artistic name.

815
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,040
Yinzhang,

816
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,640
you don't have to do anything

817
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,760
about serving anymore.

818
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,240
The private room on the second floor
is not finished yet.

819
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,200
Once it's finished,

820
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,560
you can play pipa inside.

821
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,320
You can't play

822
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,720
more than three songs a day.

823
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,560
You can arrange flowers
when you're free.

824
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,960
Make good use
of what Princess Qian taught you.

825
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,240
I don't believe

826
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,360
those writers and poets won't come.

827
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,320
Yes.

828
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,200
As Chen Lian said,

829
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,440
we can't just make
the pastries delicious,

830
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,880
we have to make the cases pretty too.

831
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:25,880
I'll go buy

832
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,800
some cases in the market tomorrow

833
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,680
to make the pastries look pretty.

834
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,920
You can name them for me.

835
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,360
Last time you said "Peaches Blossom",

836
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,200
it sounds good.

837
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,920
Peach Blossoms.

838
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,280
Or Spring Breeze.

839
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,160
Spring River.

840
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,200
Glowing Dusk.

841
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,600
Nice.

842
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,120
We can make more osmanthus drinks
with different flavors

843
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,880
and an elegant osmanthus tea set.

844
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,320
Great.

845
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,840
I'll go try some new pastries now.

846
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,760
Don't go.

847
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,000
Don't rush.

848
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,480
To avoid quarrels in the future,

849
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,680
we have to make things clear.

850
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,320
First of all, we can't argue

851
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,240
like yesterday anymore.

852
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,240
So, we'd better divide the work.

853
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,720
Sanniang is in charge of

854
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,760
kitchen supplies.

855
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,480
I'm on the operation of the teahouse.

856
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,480
Yinzhang is responsible
for the decoration and music.

857
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,240
As for the others,

858
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,160
we will vote
and if it's two against one,

859
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,560
it will be a pass, okay?

860
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,520
Okay.

861
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,240
Moreover, doing business is

862
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,960
more difficult for women than for men.

863
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,920
If we keep losing in this teahouse,

864
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,280
can you stand it anymore?
