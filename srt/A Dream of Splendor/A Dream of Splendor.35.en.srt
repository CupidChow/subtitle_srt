=Episode 35=

17
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,279
As such an insider,

18
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:42,440
don't you fear

19
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:43,919
that His Majesty may kill you?

20
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,319
Why did you do such a stupid thing?

21
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,639
Because once the Empress is convicted,

22
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:51,480
she'll be executed.

23
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,480
I used to be a music performer, too.

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,680
I understand she didn't have a choice.

25
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,959
Another reason...

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,160
I hate you,

27
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,040
but I don't want you to die.

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,040
Pan'er.

29
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,225
Ouch!

30
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,360
What's the matter with you?

31
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,119
Your mouse trap hurt my foot.

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,520
Whenever I step hard, it hurts.

33
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,720
Gu Qianfan.

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,160
It's so unconvincing when you fake it.

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,759
I saw how you got on the bridge.

36
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,440
You walked smoothly.

37
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:33,199
I have no time for your show.

38
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,400
It's my gut feeling

39
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,759
that since His Majesty proposed
a truce with the northerners

40
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,199
and has created the peace
and prosperity in the Eastern Capital,

41
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:43,360
he has to be a merciful man.

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,399
And over the years of their marriage,

43
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,759
I believe he knows everything
about the Empress.

44
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,080
If he eventually chooses to believe me,

45
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:51,119
it means

46
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,919
he believes the Empress
from the bottom of his heart.

47
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,720
That's all I have to say.

48
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:58,440
Bye.

49
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,759
Pan'er, listen to me.

50
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:01,639
I was injured
in the North Envoy incident,

51
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,399
I had no choice.

52
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,199
I didn't know what happened

53
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,119
with Wangyue Restaurant.

54
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,479
So you chose to be a coward.

55
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,240
You stayed in the carriage.

56
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:12,960
You wouldn't even

57
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,600
get off the carriage to say

58
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,800
"This is the end of us" to me.

59
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:22,240
No.

60
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:25,639
I never wanted this to end.

61
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,399
Could you give me another chance?

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,919
Why didn't you make yourself clear?

63
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,520
Can you swear

64
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,720
that for all this time,

65
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,559
you never thought about
breaking off your engagement?

66
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,050
You didn't, huh?

67
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,720
What a coward!

68
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,479
You are even worse than Ouyang Xu.

69
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:57,800
At least, he sent a servant

70
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,000
to let me know.

71
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,975
A man like you

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,375
doesn't deserve my love.

73
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,839
Yes, you don't deserve it.

74
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,399
Pan'er.

75
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,959
Wooden Head, stop following us.

76
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,160
You watched too many hero scenes.

77
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,200
Don't you think

78
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,480
you can soften her heart

79
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,799
by acting like a victim.

80
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:24,760
I am too familiar

81
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,720
with this trick.

82
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,239
If you don't want to give yourself away
in front of His Majesty,

83
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,519
just stop seeing me
at Yong'an Restaurant.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,119
Never mind him.
Let's go drinking.

85
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,239
Stop following us.

86
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,959
Hang in there.

87
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:47,200
He's still watching.

88
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,575
Don't lose your ground.

89
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,800
He's gone.

90
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:35,239
I didn't mean to cross the line.

91
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,480
I just wanted to piss that idiot off.

92
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,440
No tears, please, my beautiful.

93
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,720
If you get red eyes,

94
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,079
Ms. Song will be suspicious tomorrow.

95
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,239
I'm not in tears.

96
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:50,279
You have this in your pocket
all the time, don't you?

97
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,320
When you find a girl in tears,

98
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,679
you say the same thing to her, right?

99
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:54,640
Spot on.

100
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,720
Actually, not one handkerchief,

101
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,760
but three.

102
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,600
What if there are multiple girls
in tears?

103
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:02,640
I never get tired of your smiles.

104
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,959
You said you'd buy me drinks, right?

105
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:06,920
Are we really going?

106

that I kept in your restaurant.

Go.

00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,679
You've worked hard.

145
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,239
Relax yourself tonight.

146
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,600
You'll try some of the most famous
snacks in this city.

147
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,480
Sure.

148
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,679
It may seem like a small restaurant,

149
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:01,079
but I tried the food here
when I was younger.

150
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,920
This is Yaoquan wine.

151
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:09,920
I stole it from the villa

152
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,880
of the Eighth Prince.

153
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,000
Really?

154
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,880
Yes.

155
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,359
When I stole…

156
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,040
Thank you.

157
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,279
Go. Leave us alone.

158
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:20,160
When I stole it,

159
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,359
I was bitten by his dog.

160
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:22,519
My leg still feels the pain
till this day.

161
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,799
Quickly. Try it.

162
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:24,775
I'll top it up for you.

163
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,320
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

164
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,039
Here we go.

165
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,960
We'll get drunk tonight.

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,640
- Sure.
- Good.

167
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,960
The drinking alone is boring.

168
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,440
Let's play some games.

169
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,640
Fine.

170
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:46,760
Bring it on.

171
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,719
Come on.

172
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,960
Wait, wait. Let's play another one.

173
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,640
The loser

174
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,880
must agree to the winner's request.

175
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,719
How about that?

176
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,760
OK.

177
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,080
Come on, the rule is set.

178
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,000
Five.

179
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:11,119
- Fifteen.
- Ten.

180
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,520
Fifteen.

181
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:13,760
- Zero.
- Ten.

182
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,640
Five.

183
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,400
Ten.

184
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,320
Ten.

185
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:17,840
Ten.

186
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,000
Ten. Ten.

187
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:20,080
Fifteen.

188
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:21,679
Ten.

189
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,880
Five.

190
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,479
Ten.

191
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,479
Wait a minute. I'm out of breath.

192
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:28,200
Let's take a break.

193
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,000
Pan'er, are you happy?

194
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,200
Yes, I am.

195
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,520
Next, you're going to say,

196
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:59,640
"Pan'er, how about

197
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,320
we keep this way forever", aren't you?

198
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's raining.

199
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:10,679
Let's find a shelter.

200
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,400
Let's go there.

201
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,039
Sure. Sure.

202
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,159
Be careful.

203
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,159
First of all,

204
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,760
take girls to cheap restaurants,

205
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,919
because that's more fun.

206
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:31,200
Secondly, tell them more
about your wild stories in youth,

207
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,799
because that's interesting.

208
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,039
Also,

209
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,559
when you say something important,

210
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,200
make sure there's candle light

211
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,400
in your eyes,

212
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:41,000
because that makes you look sincere.

213
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,679
Chi Pan, thank you
for drinking with me.

214
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,440
But I grew up in entertainment joints,

215
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,640
I have heard too many of these stories.

216
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,640
If I knew earlier,

217
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,359
I wouldn't have spent so much effort.

218
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:06,275
(Long-lasting Benevolence
God Blesses All Firm As Rock)

219
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,320
Your Majesty, here's
the Styrax Curcuma Wine.

220
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:14,440
Take the wine

221
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,000
to the Empress.

222
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,320
It's thundering out there.

223
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,119
It always scares her.

224
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,479
Let her try some

225
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:22,919
to calm her nerves.

226
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,760
Tell her

227
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,599
that I bought it from the market.

228
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:32,320
Aye.

229
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,925
I get it.

230
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,520
You're worried that I may abandon you

231
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:49,000
like him, right?

232
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,550
Don't worry.

233
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,760
I won't.

234
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,440
I'm a faithful man.

235
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,359
Seriously.

236
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,080
If Zhang Haohao

237
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:59,400
didn't smash my bird,

238
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,280
I'd still be with her.

239
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,200
Ah, no, no, no.

240
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,080
I don't mean you're her replacement.

241
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,239
What I mean is…

242
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,400
Anyway,

243
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,520
we're business partners, right?

244
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,640
You bring me fortune.

245
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,799
You're the last person

246
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,440
I would want to offend.

247
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,900
But I just don't like you.

248
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,280
Why?

249
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,440
Why?

250
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,440
Take bean curd jelly for example.

251
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,799
You like the sweet one,
but I like it to be salty.

252
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:37,039
There's no good or bad.

253
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,400
It just doesn't taste right.

254
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:39,679
This is a bad example.

255
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,400
Bean curd jelly, huh?

256
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:41,975
So…

257
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,960
Did Gu Qianfan take you
to have bean curd jelly before?

258
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,000
See? Got you stumped.

259
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,200
So what if there's
a salt-sweet conundrum?

260
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,320
I'll just buy both.

261
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:55,679
I'm so rich.

262
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,200
Actually, I'd buy four.

263
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,799
We drink one, and smash one.

264
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,359
Mr. Chi, let me ask you.

265
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:05,440
You won't get off my back.

266
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:08,919
Is it because of your retaliation
against Gu Qianfan

267
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,520
or

268
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:13,080
is it because you haven't succeeded
in conquering me?

269
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,239
Do you really like me

270
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:17,159
or do you wish to conquer me?

271
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,640
I…

272
00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:21,000
Never mind.

273
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:23,760
No, I'm not finished.

274
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
I have thought it through.

275
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:30,239
I don't know why,

276
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,840
but I just like you.

277
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,000
When you crave bean curd jelly,

278
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,599
is it because you're homesick

279
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,000
or you're hungry

280
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,719
or you simply feel like eating it?

281
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,960
Finished?

282
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:46,400
Yes.

283
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:47,320
Check-out.

284
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,200
What's the meaning of this?

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,675
Hey!

286
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,550
Hey!

287
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,559
Wait.

288
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:00,159
I believe in fate.

289
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,640
How about we take another bet?

290
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,000
Let God decide.

291
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,080
If I win,

292
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,960
you'll be my girl.

293
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
If I lose,

294
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:07,919
I'll agree to three of your requests.

295
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,225
No backing out.

296
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,919
Fine. What bet?

297
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,175
What bet?

298
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,159
You decide.

299
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,440
As long as there'll be a quick result.

300
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,280
Let's bet on

301
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:24,599
is it a man or a woman
to appear on the bridge next.

302
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,000
Man.

303
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,400
It must be a younger boy

304
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,119
who's following him.

305
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,375
Slow down.

306
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,159
Be careful.

307
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,000
It's unfair.

308
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,320
It was raining a moment ago,

309
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,559
but the kid's hat is dry,

310
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,679
so his mother must have held
the umbrella for him.

311
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,200
Mr. Chi.

312
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,960
You believe in haphazardness,

313
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,440
while I believe in odds.

314
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,119
Just stop.

315
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,119
I lost, alright?

316
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:05,479
Sulking?

317
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,640
I'm good.

318
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,479
Loses are common in gambling.

319
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,919
I lose this time,

320
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:12,479
and I'll win the next time.

321
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,479
Fine.

322
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:14,760
We've got a long way ahead of us.

323
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:16,359
You'll see me every day.

324
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:17,719
Maybe someday,

325
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,320
you may want to try something new.

326
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,719
Or maybe,

327
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:21,960
someday,

328
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,280
I'd like to try something new.

329
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,440
There are so many

330
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,919
cute girls in the Eastern Capital,

331
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:28,039
I won't put all my hope on one girl.

332
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,719
You've got no boyfriend,

333
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:31,679
and I've got no girlfriend.

334
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,960
Now that we're both single,

335
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,400
can't we just date

336
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,320
for fun?

337
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:37,200
Fine.

338
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,080
Stop talking!

339
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,000
I know what you're going to say.

340
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,559
I'm now in a very bad mood.

341
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,799
It's so hard for me to force a smile.

342
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,599
You can be polite

343
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,200
with the guests at Yong'an Restaurant.

344
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:48,479
Is it so difficult for you

345
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,239
to make your boss happy?

346
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,359
Fine. Walk me back
to Osmanthus Lane then.

347
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,119
See? See?

348
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,239
You just can't stop making me angry.

349
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,679
Hi.

350
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,080
Two coins.

351
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,200
Here.

352
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,200
Thank you.

353
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:21,320
A little beauty for you.

354
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,840
She's not as good as you.

355
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,359
She's so fat.

356
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,679
You, however, are gorgeous.

357
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,760
Fine.

358
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,440
I'm a man of my word.

359
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:40,320
Say it.

360
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,320
What are your three requests?

361
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:43,760
First one.

362
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,280
I want you to answer me a question.

363
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,125
What?

364
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,400
Why do you call Gu Qianfan
Wooden Head?

365
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,760
What happened in his family?

366
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:56,200
Who is his father?

367
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,600
You're asking the right person.

368
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,520
So his so-called aunt
is actually his mother?

369
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,280
Correct.

370
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,839
That isn't his aunt.

371
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,800
That's his mother.

372
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,640
His father and mother

373
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,400
were married in another city
behind their family's back.

374
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,880
His grandfather, Gu Shenyan,

375
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,119
was a high-ranking official
in Ministry of Rites.

376
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,920
He was a stern geezer.

377
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,800
I was only five years old.

378
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:31,079
His grandfather would even criticize me

379
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,800
for pulling the girls' hair for fun.

380
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,880
Oh, right. I remember this one time

381
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,719
when his grandfather was super mad.

382
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:42,040
And shortly after,

383
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,079
Gu Qianfan's mother took him

384
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:45,760
to the capital city at night.

385
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,439
I thought

386
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,079
he was the son of his uncle,

387
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,479
but his father came along,

388
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,880
and kept knocking at the door
for the whole night.

389
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:58,239
Qianfan and his mother
were crying in the room.

390
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,839
His grandfather stood outside,

391
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,319
telling his father to get lost.

392
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:03,239
He said

393
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,599
the Gu Family had a good reputation,

394
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,040
and he wouldn't acknowledge

395
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:11,079
this fly- or dog-like son-in-law.

396
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:15,560
Buzz like a fly, live like a dog.
It means lack of integrity.

397
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,239
Yes, that's what he said.

398
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:18,760
And then,

399
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,560
his uncle came out
to drive his father away, as well,

400
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:21,875
saying

401
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,359
Qianfan would use
his mother's family name.

402
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,359
Gu.

403
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:26,599
Never Xiao.

404
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,880
I heard that.

405
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,359
His father's surname is Xiao?

406
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:31,959
Yes, Xiao.

407
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,119
We fought a lot
when we were little,

408
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,680
and I'd always lose.

409
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,520
So I called him Wooden Head
because I was angry.

410
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,959
(I didn't lie to you)

411
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,319
(about Xiao Wei.)

412
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,000
(It's just my relationship
with the Xiao Family)

413
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,959
(is way too complicated,)

414
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,239
(so I couldn't find a way)

415
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:50,520
(to explain to you.)

416
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,239
Not many

417
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,880
know about this, right?

418
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:03,000
No outlanders know this.

419
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:05,319
Inside the capital city,

420
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,000
there were three houses
on the street,

421
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,199
the Chi Family, the Gu Family

422
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,239
and the Su Family.

423
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,599
They had a daughter who was married
to the Yang Family in Qiantang.

424
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,479
Later, there was a plague,

425
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,479
and everybody died.

426
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,599
My parents knew about it, too.

427
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,280
But they died long ago.

428
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,040
Don't tell people about it.

429
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,479
If you didn't ask me
about his personal business,

430
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:30,760
I wouldn't even tell you.

431
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,319
A guy who grew up in a family like this

432
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,239
has to have a weird personality.

433
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,839
It's good that you two have broken up

434
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,199
because it's only a matter of time
that he'd break your heart.

435
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,280
I've talked too much.

436
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,319
I'm parched.

437
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,479
Would you drink more wine with me?

438
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,599
Wait.

439
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:00,280
You're the head of the silk guild
in the Eastern Capital, you said?

440
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,680
Yes. What?

441
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,599
Can you do me another favor?

442
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,000
It's my second request.

443
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,760
(If I miss you,)

444
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,160
(I'll hang a yellow flower,)

445
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:30,959
(and we'll meet at the teahouse.)

446
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:44,319
(If you don't want to give yourself away
in front of His Majesty,)

447
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,640
(just stop seeing me
at Yong'an Restaurant.)

448
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,959
Pan'er, you're back.

449
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:04,560
Yinzhang.

450
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,640
Are things fine
between you and Gu Qianfan?

451
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,500
Yes.

452
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,040
After you and Mr. Chi are gone,

453
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:19,880
someone made trouble
in Wanshui Pavilion.

454
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,319
Sanniang couldn't leave the kitchen,

455
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,000
and Zhaodi didn't know
how to deal with it,

456
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,599
so they informed me.

457
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:27,439
But I took care of it.

458
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,280
Don't worry.

459
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,920
It's lucky that I got you.

460
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:32,760
My problem is solved as well.

461
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,359
Pan'er,

462
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,640
ever since I came back,

463
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,199
I have never said sorry to you.

464
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:43,959
It was the second time
I made a mistake.

465
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:47,599
Jealousy and vanity
got the better of me.

466
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,319
I didn't listen to you

467
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,000
and put my hope on men again.

468
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,359
Enough. I understand you.

469
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,040
There's no right or wrong

470
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,959
in this.

471
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,959
It was a choice you made
based on the situation.

472
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,760
You won't resign

473
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:11,800
because you're still a musician.

474
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,040
That's why you always try
to take gambles,

475
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:14,199
and why you're always impulsive.

476
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,800
I always say you don't feel
how others feel.

477
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:19,040
But when I was at your age,

478
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,680
I took Ouyang Xu's vow for it, too.

479
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,760
Pan'er.

480
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,719
Even now,

481
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,225
I haven't really improved.

482
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,319
Women

483
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:33,959
are like plum blossoms.

484
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:36,239
They weather the harsh winters

485
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,760
to bloom more vigorously.

486
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:41,880
Look at how capable you are now.

487
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,560
You have ideas
and executive capabilities.

488
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,239
For the success of Flower and Moon
Banquet and Qianshan Pavilion,

489
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:50,640
I give you 70% of the credit.

490
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,640
I will keep working hard.

491
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,119
Forever.

492
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:58,479
Never say forever.

493
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,199
If we're willing to,

494
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:04,920
there are thousands of possibilities

495
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,199
expecting us.

496
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,680
Your dress is still wet.

497
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,359
You were caught in the rain
on your way back, weren't you?

498
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:17,719
Change your dress.

499
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:19,640
It's fine. It's dry now.

500
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,239
You left the window open.

501
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:24,479
I'll close it for you.

502
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,880
It's fine. Go back to have a rest.

503
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,560
I'll make some ginger tea for you.

504
00:24:44,075 --> 00:24:45,925
(Bank Ticket
3,000 Strings of Copper Coins)

505
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:46,760
Do you know how?

506
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,439
Yeah.

507
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:17,599
(Bank ticket,
3,000 strings of copper coins)

508
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,525
(Great Xiangguo Temple, Pawn Note)

509
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,280
(Who else could it be other than him?)

510
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:32,250
(Bank Ticket
3,000 Strings of Copper Coins)

511
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,280
Zhaodi.

512
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:41,150
What?

513
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,920
You still see Chen Lian
from time to time, do you?

514
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,760
Yes.

515
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,199
Can you fetch him for me?

516
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,280
Sure.

517
00:25:52,325 --> 00:25:53,825
(Bank Ticket
3,000 Strings of Copper Coins)

518
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:55,560
He sold his house to get money for me.

519
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,680
When did he do it?

520
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:01,400
I remember it was before
Zhaodi and I had the fight.

521
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,280
On the day he followed the order

522
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,640
to go on a hunting trip
with the North Envoy.

523
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,280
Why did he stay in the carriage

524
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,160
instead of getting out to see me?

525
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,280
Chief only told me

526
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:26,400
that it's not he didn't want to see you,

527
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,119
he was afraid to see you.

528
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,839
Pan'er,

529
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:34,400
Chief wouldn't even fear decapitation.

530
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,359
So,

531
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,479
I'm sure it was something big.

532
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:39,680
He was afraid
that you wouldn't forgive him,

533
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:41,760
so he chose to hide from you.

534
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,000
He even risked his life

535
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,119
disobeying the imperial order

536
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,040
to see you.

537
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:15,079
The dish we have today

538
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,680
- has a history.
- Good. Good.

539
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,280
Yes.

540
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:17,959
Mr. Tuntian.

541
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:22,640
You personally cooked for us.

542
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,160
It's such an honor for us.

543
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,719
Yes.

544
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:27,439
- No problem. You're a distinguished guest.
- Yes.

545
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,040
I remember you like freshwater fish.

546
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,280
Try it.

547
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,839
What an honor.

548
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,479
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

549
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,560
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

550
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,439
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

551
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
Look.

552
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,599
- Please.
- Please.

553
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:42,319
Please enjoy.

554
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:43,199
Are you tired?

555
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:46,450
What are you doing?

556
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,319
You seem tired.

557
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,280
I wanted to give you a massage.

558
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,239
I told you,

559
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:53,319
when you're here,

560
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:56,160
we keep a distance.

561
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:57,425
Alright, distance. Well noted.

562
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,675
What do you want from me?

563
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,040
I'm not here to see you.

564
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,319
Otherwise, I'd go straight
to the kitchen.

565
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:06,400
I'm here to see Ms. Zhao.

566
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:07,800
Stop there.

567
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:08,719
Come here.

568
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:09,475
Why are you mad at him?

569
00:28:09,475 --> 00:28:10,800
How dare you?

570
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,920
How dare you steal my stuff.

571
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,560
Come here.

572
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,599
Come here.

573
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,560
I didn't steal it.

574
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,928
- You were going to throw them anyway,
- Yeah.

575
00:28:15,952 --> 00:28:16,400
- weren't you?
- Yeah.

576
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,439
No, I wasn't, actually.

577
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,680
They are supposed to be takeaways.

578
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,479
He Si, why are you standing still?

579
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:21,479
Catch him.

580
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:24,040
Stop there.

581
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,880
Talking me back, huh?

582
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,439
Talking me back?

583
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:27,119
Trying to escape?

584
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,079
Spit it out.

585
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,160
I'm asking you to spit it out.

586
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,040
- Spit it out now.
- Let me go!

587
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:31,280
Spit it out now.

588
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,079
Now, now!

589
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,319
My face!

590
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:40,439
Zifang.

591
00:28:42,275 --> 00:28:43,525
- Mr. Chi, are you okay?
- It burns.

592
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:53,959
Mother?

593
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,400
Mother!

594
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,543
Yes.

595
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:10,920
It's been days.

596
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,040
Still no news from the palace.

597
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,439
The Night Revels

598
00:29:17,725 --> 00:29:19,125
was firm evidence.

599
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:21,680
Oh, right.

600
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,920
The imperial doctor didn't come, right?

601
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,239
I'm confused, too.

602
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:30,160
He should have been here
two hours ago.

603
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:31,119
Oh, no.

604
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,920
Something must have happened
in the palace.

605
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,119
Sir.

606
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,119
No, no.

607
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,319
I don't believe His Majesty

608
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,000
would stand being cuckolded.

609
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,239
It's just deposing the Empress
isn't a small thing.

610
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,800
The contention between
Censor Qi and Xiao Qinyan

611
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:00,800
is still on.

612
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,719
That's true.

613
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,640
Easy. Easy.

614
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,880
Sir, just go to bed.

615
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,599
The secret investigator sent
to Jiangnan Region hasn't returned,

616
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,119
but there are quite a lot of Qiantang
businessmen in the Eastern Capital.

617
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:26,719
I have organized
multiple investigations.

618
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
They all say

619
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:31,719
that Transport Assistant does
visit Ms. Zhao very often

620
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:33,079
to drink tea and buy paintings.

621
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:34,719
In addition,

622
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:38,199
Wu Ming, the Prefect of Runzhou,

623
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,599
said he saw The Night Revels
in Yang's house, too.

624
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:44,125
(The real one is burned. Good.)

625
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,800
He did?

626
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,400
It looks like Zhao Pan'er

627
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,319
did speak the truth.

628
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,725
But

629
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,479
Ouyang Xu and Qi Mu

630
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,959
these two bastards

631
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:02,680
plotted against the Empress.

632
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:04,719
Two scheming pests!

633
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,520
Calm down, Your Majesty.

634
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,680
I, however, suspect

635
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,119
that Mr. Qi and Mr. Ouyang

636
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,800
were deceived.

637
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,359
The counterfeit painting

638
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,000
isn't necessarily the work
of Mr. Ouyang.

639
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:24,719
That is possible.

640
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,760
It may be related to Zheng Qingtian
who killed himself.

641
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:35,400
Too bad.

642
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,760
Zheng Qingtian

643
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,280
died too early.

644
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,400
Indeed.

645
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,719
He even wrote
to plead guilty before he died.

646
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,760
Now that I think about it,

647
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:48,319
it does seem like a cover for others.

648
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:52,520
The culprit forged the painting

649
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,359
and started a conflict within the court.

650
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:57,239
Your Majesty,

651
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,800
don't forget about the Hat Demon case.

652
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:03,839
Minister Xiao's life was threatened.

653
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,079
Mr. Qi was forced to leave
the capital city for rehabilitation.

654
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,239
Are you saying

655
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,839
it's someone else

656
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,719
who's behind these cases?

657
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,000
Yes.

658
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:26,119
Dare I present my inference.

659
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,160
If you think The Night Revels is real,

660
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,640
then the Empress and the Crown Prince
have to be deposed,

661
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,359
Minister Xiao will be implicated,

662
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,319
and you'll have
to appoint another heir apparent.

663
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:40,599
If you think it's fake,

664
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:43,479
Mr. Qi will be convicted,

665
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,479
and you'll still be suspicious

666
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:47,760
of the Empress.

667
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,959
Even if Prince Sheng becomes
the Crown Prince,

668
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,520
the Empress Party and the Scholar
Ministers will both take a hit.

669
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,119
You will have
to choose an assisting minister

670
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,560
from the royal clan.

671
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:10,719
Whether I believe it or not,

672
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:14,119
I shall fall into his trap.

673
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,880
OK. I see.

674
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:27,839
Mr. Lei, stand down.

675
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,520
Director Lei, please.

676
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,033
Hey. That way.

677
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:38,319
This way, please.

678
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,079
Director Lei, please.

679
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,839
Go tell the Empress

680
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:04,920
that I'd like to have her bean congee.

681
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,560
Aye.

682
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,959
His will shall be done.

683
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,719
I'm off, Your Majesty.

684
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,479
(I barely survived the crisis.)

685
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,639
(I went through so much)

686
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,600
(to get my stature.)

687
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,320
(I swear)

688
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:39,239
(I'll be in the position
for more decades.)

689
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,080
Go get the beans.

690
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,439
I will examine

691
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:44,760
every bean personally.

692
00:34:45,225 --> 00:34:45,975
Aye.

693
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,760
What?

694
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:52,000
You don't believe

695
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,239
that I have successfully talked

696
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,159
His Majesty into not convicting you?

697
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,360
I'm grateful

698
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,679
for your aid.

699
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,399
It's just

700
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:06,159
there was no interaction
between us before.

701
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,520
That's exactly

702
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,760
why I chose to offer my help

703
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:19,959
to show my sincerity.

704
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,399
I'll cut to the chase.

705
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,760
His Majesty only has one son,
and that's Prince Sheng.

706
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,199
After he's enthroned,

707
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:33,959
he'll find out that he isn't
the Empress's biological son.

708
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:38,199
By then, the Empress
and her party shall fall.

709
00:35:39,399 --> 00:35:41,520
But I don't intend
to be part of it.

710
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:44,159
I've built connections
in the imperial palace for years,

711
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:48,040
and I'm willing to aid you
in secretly moving forward.

712
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,919
When you become the Prime Minister…

713
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,159
By then,

714
00:35:57,439 --> 00:36:01,600
you will be given
the position of Defender-in-chief.

715
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,399
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

716
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:10,000
But His Majesty

717
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:12,639
has to vent his anger

718
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,239
on someone this time.

719
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,239
I know what to do.

720
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,280
Good. Good.

721
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:33,000
Is The Night Revels real or fake?

722
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,080
It is real.

723
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,360
It's a matter of significance.
I dare not lie.

724
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,760
Still in denial?

725
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:41,959
Consort Xian sent me a message

726
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,040
that the Empress has regained
His Majesty's favor.

727
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:45,760
It shows

728
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,760
that His Majesty has known the truth

729
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,000
and that he doesn't
believe your nonsense.

730
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,479
No way.

731
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,719
It has to be real.

732
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:55,800
Otherwise,

733
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,399
why would the Capital Security Office
and Zhao Pan'er

734
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,080
keep asking me for it?

735
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,679
Zhao Pan'er?

736
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,639
Why is she involved?

737
00:37:04,399 --> 00:37:05,199
I…

738
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,840
I have known all about what happened

739
00:37:07,919 --> 00:37:10,120
between you and Zhao Pan'er.

740
00:37:10,399 --> 00:37:11,000
I mean…

741
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:16,080
Could it be that she's the original
owner of the painting?

742
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:19,399
Then why did you insist

743
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:21,840
that you got the painting
from the Western Capital?

744
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:26,080
Don't you know

745
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:27,719
that fooling the Emperor is a felony?

746
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,760
It was but a mistake.

747
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:34,040
Let me think.

748
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:40,439
Maybe Gu Qianfan had already known

749
00:37:40,439 --> 00:37:41,719
that the painting was problematic,

750
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,600
so he had Zhao Pan'er

751
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,520
ask you for it.

752
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:51,000
You held a grudge against Zhao Pan'er
for forcing you out of the capital.

753
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,120
When you found the secret
of the painting,

754
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,000
you reached out to Qi Mu,

755
00:37:56,199 --> 00:38:00,159
an enemy of the Empress Party,

756
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,520
and returned to the Eastern Capital.

757
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,879
You thought you had iron evidence,

758
00:38:06,879 --> 00:38:08,199
and that your career would take off

759
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,120
after the Empress falls.

760
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:12,520
But you had to take revenge on them.

761
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:15,639
And you hid the fact that
you broke off your engagement,

762
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:20,639
which was a time bomb that would ruin
your career life sooner or later.

763
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,040
So you made up

764
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,760
the history of The Night Revels,

765
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:28,679
hoping that His Majesty

766
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,760
would convict Gu Qianfan
of concealment of the truth.

767
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,360
Do you honestly think

768
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,879
the Capital Security Office
and the Empress Party are useless?

769
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,520
But The Night Revels is real.

770
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,280
And it's a fact that the Empress
was once a musician.

771
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,479
Let's say there's a murder
on the street.

772
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:47,520
Would Kaifeng Prefecture believe my word

773
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,159
or...

774
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,959
the testimony of a ruffian?

775
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,399
Word on the streets says

776
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:57,800
that His Majesty may have visited

777
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,360
Yong'an Restaurant in disguise.

778
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,760
If that's true,

779
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:06,399
no one knows

780
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,360
what Zhao Pan'er might have said
to His Majesty.

781
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:13,120
Save me, Father.

782
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,479
Don't call me like that anymore.

783
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:16,520
I…

784
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:18,560
It's a mistake
that I have trusted you again.

785
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,959
Not only Mr. Qi,

786
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,760
even I'm embroiled in it.

787
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,679
Father,

788
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:32,439
are you going to break off
the betrothal for the second time?

789
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:34,479
What do you mean?

790
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:37,120
I suggest you think twice.

791
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:40,399
You and I are in this together.

792
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,600
If you don't help me,

793
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:45,520
then I shall

794
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,600
expose your daughter's

795
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:50,360
private belongings.

796
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,719
You…

797
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,239
Marriage

798
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:58,120
is supposed to benefit both sides.

799
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:00,879
If I were to go down,

800
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,719
so would Miss Hui and the Gao Family.

801
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,520
I'm going to kill you.

802
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:18,760
Well done.

803
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,280
His Majesty is soft-hearted.

804
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,199
After all, Qi Mu is the leader
of the Scholar Ministers.

805
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:30,080
If we discredit him too hard,

806
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,320
His Majesty will get cautious
sooner or later.

807
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:35,199
Yes, yes. Yes.

808
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,239
But this time,

809
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,080
not only did you beg for mercy
on Qi Mu's behalf,

810
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,679
but you also sowed the seed

811
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,120
of his misjudgment
in His Majesty's heart.

812
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,360
With several more cases
of incompetence,

813
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:53,159
the Scholar Ministers

814
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:55,080
shall lose His Majesty's favor

815
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,719
in no time.

816
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,879
Thank you for your instructions,
Minister Xiao.

817
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,520
Do you know

818
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,639
that His Majesty's health condition…

819
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,239
That's why

820
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,000
the Empress and Prince Sheng

821
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,560
are the future of the nation.

822
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:29,000
Don't worry.

823
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,360
When I take full control
of the imperial court

824
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:35,800
as the regent,

825
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:41,520
your hard work will pay off.

826
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,800
Thank you for your promotion.

827
00:41:49,439 --> 00:41:50,600
Check out the quality.

828
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:51,959
- It has to be good.
- Yes.

829
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:53,025
- Just buy one.
- Sir, this one.

830
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,040
What's your name, miss?

831
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:56,199
Let's go check that out.

832
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:57,639
Ma'am.

833
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,320
(It's so nice.)

834
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,159
(Yes. Yes.)

835
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,320
Where did you get this handkerchief?

836
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
I bought it.

837
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:03,360
Where?

838
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,239
Many stalls sell it
in the Eastern Capital these days.

839
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,719
- It only cost me dozens of coins.
- I'd like to have a look.

840
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:09,919
There's a vendor right over there.

841
00:42:11,879 --> 00:42:13,075
- This one looks pretty.
- This is nice.

842
00:42:13,975 --> 00:42:14,585
Look.

843
00:42:14,675 --> 00:42:15,429
Let me see.

844
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,639
Look.

845
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,479
(Hui)
I have all the girls' names.

846
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,040
What's the name of your girl?

847
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,760
I'll get one for you.

848
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,100
This one, right?

849
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,080
(Shu)

850
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,000
Check this one out.

851
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:30,280
Who did it?

852
00:42:34,439 --> 00:42:35,439
You can't get in here.

853
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,840
Chuntao, leave us.

854
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,000
Go.

855
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:42,360
Yes.

856
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,639
You did this, right?

857
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,719
I don't know what you're talking about.

858
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,550
I, Ouyang Xu, admit

859
00:43:00,399 --> 00:43:01,600
that I'm not good enough for you.

860
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,280
I'd like to break off
our betrothal again.

861
00:43:05,479 --> 00:43:06,600
Again?

862
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,679
I only have the statement
of ending the betrothal

863
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:11,719
that you personally wrote
in the Western Capital.

864
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,520
I don't recall we were betrothed
for the second time.

865
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:17,199
Now that it has come to this,

866
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,520
I'll make myself very clear.

867
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,000
If you agree to this

868
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,775
I'll give you back what you want.
