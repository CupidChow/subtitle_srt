17
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,480
I'm begging you, please.

18
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,440
I'll pay you back.

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,800
I'm not trying to find any excuses.

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,880
I really can't give it to you.

21
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,560
I have something.

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,920
Can I trade it with you?

23
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,000
Weren't you looking for the Night Revels

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,400
when you were in Yang's Mansion?

25
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,840
I have the original painting.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,920
As long as you lend me the money,

27
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,080
I'll give it to you.

28
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,600
What did you say?

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,480
I have the original Night Revels.

30
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,320
It was painted by Wang Ai

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,000
on a five feet silken cloth,

32
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,480
and mounted upon Purple Magpie Brocade.

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,680
The hollow reel is made of sandalwood.

34
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,400
The painting is about
a night banquet hosted by Xue Que,

35
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,920
the Transport Commissioner
of Xichuan Region.

36
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,720
The host is in the center,
and the guests are on either side.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,080
There are music and dancing.

38
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,280
They eat camel hump

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
and dance Whirling Dance.

40
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,920
Elegance is a feature of my teahouse.

41
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,200
I have a few famous paintings.

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,760
A guest used this painting

43
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,800
to pay for his gambling debt.

44
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,080
Mr. Yang also likes
calligraphy and painting.

45
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,080
Last year, when he had tea at my place,

46
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,560
he took a fancy to this painting

47
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,000
and tried to borrow it from me
several times.

48
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,520
I couldn't afford to offend him.

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,480
So I asked someone to make a copy of it
and sent him the fake.

50
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,760
He couldn't tell the difference.

51
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,240
He even thought I was sensible.

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,520
Otherwise,

53
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,440
I wouldn't dare

54
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,040
to ask him a favor

55
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,480
when Yin Zhang took the liberty
to stop being a registered musician.

56
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,400
I swear to God,

57
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,480
if any word I said is not true,

58
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,480
I will degenerate
into a lowly profession again

59
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,360
and never be born again.

60
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,320
Yinzhang's sister died because of me.

61
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,720
She's in such a position now.

62
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,840
I can't let her suffer and do nothing.

63
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,080
I need a lot of money to save her

64
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,040
and to deceive Zhou She.

65
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,520
Where is the painting now?

66
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,440
I put it in a safe place.

67
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,280
I didn't bring it with me.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,280
I need you to trust me.

69
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,840
(Capital Security Office)
This is the gold token you touched.

70
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,080
I cut off a little bit of the edge

71
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,160
because I didn't have any money to use.

72
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,560
It's not that I don't want
to give it to you.

73
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,260
(Gu Qianfan)

74
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,720
It's because if I give it to you,

75
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,880
I won't have anything

76
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,400
to prove who I am.

77
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,480
How about this?

78
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,070
This is the superior Hetian Jade
my father left me.

79
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,760
Take it.

80
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,880
You can get at least
200 strings of coins for it.

81
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,520
Thank you.

82
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,440
Thank you.

83
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,480
Zhao Pan'er, listen to me.

84
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,360
You can't let anyone else know

85
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,560
that you have the Night Revels.

86
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,320
The Night Revels will cause more trouble

87
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,840
than dozens of lives in Yang's Mansion.

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,920
Do you hear me?

89
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Take care.

90
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,280
Take care, too.

91
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,920
Otherwise,

92
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,040
I won't be able to pay you back.

93
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,400
By the way, how can I find you

94
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,040
after you go to the Eastern Capital?

95
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,920
There is Wang's Iron Foundry
at the south end of the Zhou Bridge.

96
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,440
If you see a red flag
hanging at the door,

97
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
go in and buy ten silver needles

98
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,440
from the owner.

99
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,760
Then he'll bring you to me.

100
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,080
If there has been no flag for some time,

101
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,600
you don't have to pay me back.

102
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,560
Stop!

103
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,280
This man has the smell of blood.
Come here!

104
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,120
Who are you?

105
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,360
Where did you get the blood from?

106
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,240
I carried pigs for Butcher Zhang.

107
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,680
That's how I got some blood on me.

108
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:24,920
Oh, right,

109
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,440
Butcher Zhang also gave me
a small piece of liver.

110
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,120
It's you.

111
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,280
Don't kill me.

112
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,120
I'll do whatever you say.

113
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,360
Throw the blades away.

114
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,440
Far away.

115
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,720
Far away!

116
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,840
Take off your belts

117
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,160
and tie each other's hands.

118
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,600
Do it.

119
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,920
Do it.

120
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,240
You, too.

121
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
What government office are you from?

122
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,200
I'm a Commandant of Ninghai Army.

123

(Huating County)

128
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,680
(Huating county)
I've been searching for four hours

129
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,640
and there is still no trace
of Criminal Gu.

130
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,880
I have an idea.

131
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,000
Would he be bold enough

132
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,920
to go along Danzhou
to the capital by sea?

133
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,920
What do you have in mind?

134
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,480
(Huating County)

135
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,240
I request

136
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,720
two light cavalrymen
to search along the coast.

137
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,440
I heard that Criminal Gu is ruthless.

138
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,640
Kill him when you get him.

139
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,560
Yes.

140
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,320
Man.

141
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,120
Be careful, too.

142
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,980
(Wanted)

143
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,680
Hold on!

144
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,620
(Huating County)

145
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,080
He looks like the criminal.
Interrogate him!

146
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,880
Yes!

147
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,440
Do I?

148
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,960
There are no more checkpoints ahead.

149
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,440
Can you let me go?

150
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,960
So you can go back to turn me in?

151
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,800
I promise I won't say anything.

152
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,800
Well, I can buy the knockout drug

153
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,640
and you can watch me take it.

154
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,360
Then I'll sleep
for seven or eight hours.

155
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,160
(Chen Lian)
You'll be far away when I wake up.

156
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,600
Have you not heard that I am ruthless?

157
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,240
Please spare my life.

158
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,040
I have an 80-year-old mother

159
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,040
and four or five hungry children
to feed.

160
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,400
I really can't get in trouble.

161
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,440
Four or five hungry children to feed?

162
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,120
How old are you?

163
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,000
17.

164
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,160
When did you get married?

165
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
You're in good health.

166
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,000
I said that

167
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,000
in hopes of your mercy.

168
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,240
I was recruited when I was 14.

00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,280
I'm the only boy in my family.

170
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,080
Can you bear to watch

171
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,040
three women have no one to depend on?

172
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,960
Lock the door.

173
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,480
Okay.

174
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,280
If you keep nagging,

175
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,840
I'll tell others

176
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,160
you're my accomplice next time.

177
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
What's your name?

178
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,480
Well...

179
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,520
I'm asking you.

180
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,120
My name is Chen Lian.

181
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,320
Who gave the secret order to kill me?

182
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,760
I don't know that.

183
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,600
I saw the sealing wax of emergency

184
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,320
on that secret order,

185
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,880
but I really have no idea

186
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,280
who is coming after you.

187
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,120
Are you hurt?

188
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,920
Do you need me to apply medicine to you?

189
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,640
No.

190
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,120
The fire coral is rare indeed.

191
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,240
No wonder
it's the superior Nanyang's stuff.

192
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,800
Nanyang's stuff?

193
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,880
Yeah.

194
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,240
There is a lot of good stuff
from Nanyang these years.

195
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,840
It's also cheaper than before.

196
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,720
My mother
has a set of jewelry like this.

197
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,720
But it's not as good as yours.

198
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
(The Emperor issued an order.)

(Capital Security Office)

200
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,720
From now on, the merchants
from Java, Chenla, and Srivijaya

201
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,120
are only allowed to dock in Guangzhou.

Merchant ships are banned

203

from Fujian and Guangdong.
Liangzhe, and Shandong...

204
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,240
Fire coral,
the superior Nanyang's stuff.

205
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,680
It's cheaper than before.

206
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,720
She was so kind

207
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,600
to lend us the whole second floor

208
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,040
of Xiangyun Pavilion.

209
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,480
How could you be so sure

210
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,280
that she would let us use it?

211
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,600
Because only the people
in the lowly profession

212
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,680
will be sympathetic
to what happened to Yin Zhang.

213
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,320
Zhou She is a discerning businessman.

214
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,640
Ordinary things can't fool him.

215
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,360
Only Xiangyun Pavilion
can arrange such a setting

216
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,640
in a short time.

217

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,160
Where is the nearest
Maritime Trade Office?

222
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,440
Hangzhou.

223
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,640
Who is the Maritime Trade Supervisor?

224
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't know.

225
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,520
But according to the practice
of the imperial court,

226
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,640
isn't the magistrate of Qiantang
holding the post concurrently?

227
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,520
You stay here tonight.

228
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,400
Go to the beach with me
tomorrow morning.

229
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,680
Did you rob the fire coral from someone

230
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,520
or did you buy it?

231
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,000
Why don't you sell it to me?

232
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,080
I promise it'll be in your interest.

233

Yinzhang?

238
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,720
Yinzhang?

239
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,360
Yinzhang?

240
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,840
Yinzhang?

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,440
Yinzhang?

242

Pan'er.

243
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,040
Keep it down.

244
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,960
I know I was wrong.

245
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,590
I shouldn't have disobeyed you

246
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,560
and eloped with Zhou She
behind your back.

247
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,040
After I got here,

248
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,040
he gave me 50 floggings

249
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,880
and asked me to give him the money.

250
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,830
I have no money
and I don't know what to do.

251
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,480
Say no more. I know it.

252
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,400
I'm here to save you.

253
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,310
Take me out of here now.

254
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,520
Not now.

255
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,760
Why?

256
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,440
Only Sanniang and I came to save you.

257
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,080
Your legs have been hurt.

258
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,680
Even if we carry you on our backs,

259
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,920
someone's gonna find us out.

260
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,320
Besides,

261
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,280
what about the money
you were swindled out of?

262
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,560
What about your broken leg?

263
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,520
You're right.

264
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,040
Pan'er, it's fine
that he lied to me and hit me,

265
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,960
but he sold my Moon Pipa

266
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,440
and burned my music books.

267
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,680
You must let him be punished.

268
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,800
You must.

269
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,840
Then do as I say.

270
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,000
Stop crying. Let's get down to business.

271
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,880
What did you tell him about me?

272
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,120
I told him you were
also a registered musician

273
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,680
and you treat me like your own sister.

274
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,520
Now you're running a teahouse.

275
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,040
You didn't say anything
about my relationship with Ouyang

276
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,640
and Sanniang, did you?

277
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,880
No.

278
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,000
I know you don't like him,

279
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,040
so I rarely mention you to him.

280
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,520
I don't think
he knows Sanniang very well.

281
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,160
He hit you

282
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,400
only to get money from you, right?

283
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,440
Eat the dessert first.

284
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,560
Tomorrow morning,

285
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,280
you have to act like
you can't take it anymore.

286
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,040
Tell him

287
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,680
you still have some secret money

288
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,880
at Quanfu Inn.

289
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,200
He can get
ten strings of coins every time

290
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,600
when he says your name.

291
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,040
Zhou She is now under pressure
to pay the debt.

292
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,080
If he gets a taste for it,

293
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,160
he is gonna treat you well.

294
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,680
You must seize the time to recuperate.

295
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,600
Do you get it?

296
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,760
Wait for my news.

297
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,160
Will it work?

298
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,440
Did I ever fail you

299
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,720
when I promised you something?

300
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,400
By the way, Pan'er,

301
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,080
I heard children singing nursery rhymes
in the street

302
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
that the Third Graduate's
surname is Ouyang.

303
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,000
Is he your husband?

304
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,360
That's great.

305
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,960
You surely know how to pick a man.

306
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,680
You could tell at a glance
that he is destined for greatness.

307
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,640
You're gonna get me out of here, too.

308
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,680
Honey, look how stubborn you are.

309
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,000
As long as you give me your secret money

310
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,720
and help me get through this,

311
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,520
everything will be all right.

312
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,520
I need some invigorating oil.

313
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,040
Not to mention invigorating oil,

314
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,960
as long as you listen to me,

315
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,080
this house and this mansion

316
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,560
will all be yours.

317
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,120
You are not lying to me, are you?

318
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,960
How would I lie to you?

319
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,000
I married you

320
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,560
in hopes of growing old
together with you.

321
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,280
You broke my leg.

322
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,120
I have nothing to eat.

323
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,840
I'm starving to death.

324
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,840
Poor girl.

325
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,720
Tell me the code for the money

326
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,440
and I'll get you something to eat.

327
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,200
I'll buy you whatever you want.

328
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,440
Really?

329
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,000
Of course.

330
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,080
The code is "moonlit river in spring".

331
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,720
You're not lying to me, are you?

332
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,600
Believe it or not.

333
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,400
I'll wait for you to kill me.

334
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,280
I just want to use the money

335
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,640
to trade for a few good days to live.

336
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,040
You won't even trust me in that?

337
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,440
I trust you.

338
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,480
Come on, sit down.

339
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,360
Don't cry. Don't cry.

340
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,640
Bring the good wine and the good food.

341
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,720
And also the invigorating oil.

342
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,760
Take good care of my wife.

343
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,080
Honey, enjoy the meal.

344
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,240
Then take a good bath

345
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,400
and get some sleep.

346
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,120
I'll be right back.

347
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,840
This way, please.

348
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,760
(Guo Si Teahouse)

349
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,400
This way.

350
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,200
Our teahouse has the best view.

351
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,920
You can see clearly
those Nanyang merchant ships

352
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,720
in the harbor from here.

353
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,440
Waiter.

354
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,120
Do you have more Siamese,

355
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,040
more Japanese,

356
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,960
or more Nanyang merchants eat here?

357
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,160
They all eat here.

358
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,080
Well,

359
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,600
I'll have what they have for two.

360
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,240
All right.

361
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,260
(Guo Si Teahouse)

362
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,160
I think the maritime trade tax
is 50 percent.

363
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,240
If three or five of the twenty or so

364
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,800
Nanyang merchant ships cook the books,

365
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,480
the man in charge
is gonna make a fortune, right?

366
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,600
Why do you ask so many questions?

367
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,800
Do you really want to be my accomplice?

368
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,120
Yes.

369
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,520
Yesterday,

370
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,560
(Capital Security Office)
I saw your token with a lion head

371
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,120
when you put away
the fire coral hairpin.

372
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,240
It turns out you are the commander
of the Capital Security Office.

373
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,480
I'm not stupid.

374
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,880
I've figured it out

375
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,240
after what you said yesterday.

376
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,720
The magistrate of Qiantang

377
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,680
was bold enough to violate
the strict order of the imperial court

378
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
and open the pass secretly.

379
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,040
Well, Commander.

380
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,520
Can I ask you a favor?

381
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,920
We kind of got off to a bad start.

382
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,160
Can you give me a chance

383
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,720
to follow you and serve the court?

384
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,360
Are you not afraid
to implicate those women in your family?

385
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,080
I'm a criminal.

386
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,840
A criminal? You must be joking.

387
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,200
How could a hero like you be a criminal?

388
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,160
Let me be honest with you.

389
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,080
Actually, I'm also from
the Easter Capital.

390
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,600
I was transferred to this awful place

391
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,760
with my superior.

392
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,720
I eat rice and fish every day.

393
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,800
It's driving me crazy.

394
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,960
I miss the steamed buns

395
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,000
made by my mother,

396
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,400
the noodles made by my eldest sister,

397
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,360
and the lamb stew
made by my second sister all the time.

398
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,480
Commander.

399
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,240
I want to work for you
in the Capital Security Office.

400
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,440
I'll be satisfied

401
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
to be a handyman.

402
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,200
Do you want to be a criminal like me

403
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,400
just for steamed buns and noodles?

404
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,520
I can show you my heart right now.

405
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,680
All right. Stop it.

406
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,680
Here is a chance for you.

407
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,720
Do you see that guy over there?

408
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,200
Get him here quietly.

409
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,840
Remember not to alarm anyone.

410
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,580
(Quanfu Inn)

411
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,920
There are ten strings of coins.

412
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,760
You wouldn't give it to me
until I beat you.

413
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,880
Eight strings of coins

414
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,000
are probably enough to cope with Xu.

415
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,200
I'll gamble the rest two strings

416
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,640
at the casino and double it.

417
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,720
Do you have no eyes?

418
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,440
You...

419
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,040
Well?

420
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,440
What do you want?

421
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,600
What do you want?

422
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,120
I was walking on my way.
What do you want?

423
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,880
What do you want?

424
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,240
So what that I hit you?

425
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,320
Xiaosi.

426
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,880
Don't waste your time on a rough fellow.

427
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,680
Zhou She?

428
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,480
You...

429
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,720
Why are you in Huating County?

430
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,280
Where is Yinzhang?

431
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,680
Ms. Zhao.

432
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,880
Yinzhang...

433
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,640
She is at home.

434
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,880
Did you actually marry her?

435
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,800
I'll beat you to death!
You heartless, unfaithful man!

436
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,920
You...!

437
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,200
Unfaithful? What are you crying about?

438
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,920
You deserve it!

439
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,840
My sister is crazy about you,

440
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,400
but you left her
and eloped with her best friend.

441
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,680
You deserve a beating!

442
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,760
Beat him!

443
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,760
I...

444
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,600
How did you fall for him
in the first place?

445
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,480
He's such a faker.

446
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,520
He only sees the shiny fake silver,

447
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,120
but he turns his nose up
at the real gold!

448
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,120
We're in broad daylight!

449
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,640
Do you know who I am?

450
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,520
How dare you beat me!

451
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,880
- The bead is worth at least 2,000 coins.
- I'll beat you to death!

452
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,850
Beat you to death!

453
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,080
Check out his clothes.

454
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,600
I think he just got off the boat.

455
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,360
If you don't kill me today,

456
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,640
I'm gonna kill you all!

457
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,560
Screw you!

458
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,360
Well done.

459
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,560
Go ahead.

460
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,520
Do you wanna kill us?

461
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,600
Beat him!

462
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,400
I'll beat you to death!

463
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,840
Let's go.

464
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,520
I'll break your legs if you walk slowly!

465
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,160
What kind of people are they?

466
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,040
Why is this happening to me?

467
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,840
They are heading
for the Xiangyun Pavilion.

468
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,640
Xiangyun Pavilion?

469
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,320
The rooms there are twice
as expensive as Quanfu's rooms.

470
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,480
Who is that young woman?

471
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,840
She is pretty and rich.

472
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,400
You...

473
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:50,960
It's mine!

474
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,840
Hey yourself!

475
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,680
Get off!

476
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,400
Let's go.

477
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,000
(Do you mean the Commandant
of Ninghai Army hurt you?)

478
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,160
But those who came after us

479
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,400
are clearly the people

480
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,000
of the Director-in-chief of Xiuzhou.

481
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,960
The people on both sides

482
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,040
have disliked each other
since the time of Wu Yue.

483
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,320
How would they help each other easily?

484
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,560
It occurred to me

485
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,680
the county magistrate of Qiantang
who issued an arrest warrant

486
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,840
accused you
of being a pirate confidently,

487
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,640
and that's weird.

488
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,560
Commander, it's done.

489
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,000
Forty-nine punches. Not one punch less.

490
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,920
Do you still remember me?

491
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,360
Do you dare to pretend
to be from Ninghai Army again?

492
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,280
I'm Wei Wei from Qiantang.

493
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,840
The county magistrate, Zheng Qingtian,

494
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,200
forced me to do all of this.

495
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,920
Commander, mercy.

496
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,880
Spare my life.

497
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,920
Mercy.

498
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,680
Are coral hairpins like this

499
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,040
from the Javanese merchants

500
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,400
who docked illegally in a port?

501
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,640
Yes.

502
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,800
It was also ordered by Zheng Qingtian.

503
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,960
He said one tael of terebinth

504
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,720
from Guangzhou is sold for
30 million or 40 million copper coins.

505
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,440
The maritime trade tax is half of it.

506
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,320
If we contact
with the Nanyang merchants in private

507
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
and ask them for 10 million coins,

508
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,120
the Nanyang merchants
would prefer to dock in Hangzhou.

509
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,240
How much money
do you get out of this business

510
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,600
every year?

511
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,600
Not much.

512
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,360
I'll say it! I'll say it!

513
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,560
200 million coins.

514
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,800
200 million...

515
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,680
Tell me,

516
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,400
which officials
did Zheng Qingtian buy off?

517
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,320
And who

518
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,160
in the Capital Security Office

519
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,320
gave away our whereabouts?

520
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,000
I don't know.

521
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,720
You don't know?

522
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,680
I don't know.

523
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,040
I really don't!

524
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,920
All I know is that it's a courtier
in the capital

525
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,920
who even gave an order
to kill you on sight!

526
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,480
How much did Zheng Qingtian

527
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,440
spend on it?

528
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,600
200 million coins.

529
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,400
He converted the money into a receipt
of the Gold and Silver Shop

530
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,880
and sent it to the capital by a pigeon.

531
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,960
Zheng Qingtian said

532
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,040
if you report it to the Emperor,

533
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,560
we will be all dead.

534
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,360
He had to spend so much money

535
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,320
to buy us a way out.

536
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,960
The Emperor's body
gets worse day by day.

537
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,080
The Empress will get the power one day.

538
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,920
But among those courtiers,

539
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,760
she only trusts Xiao Qinyan.

540
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,720
I hope I can solve this case
for her this time

541
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,280
and become her trusted aide.

542
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,760
Commissioner said
the secret of the Empress

543
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,480
should be known
by as few people as possible.

544
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,560
Does it mean Gu Qianfan should be...

545
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,680
Do you hate Gu that much?

546
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,040
He got promoted faster than you,

547
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,440
but he risked his life for it.

548
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,440
I'm not doing this for myself.

549
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,800
I just hate it

550
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,200
when he disrespects you.

551
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,720
You told him

552
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,080
to be lenient
in the case of Marquis Jing.

553
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,840
All right.

554
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,960
In the worst case, we'll do it your way.

555
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,880
I heard she is a reformed
famous unsurpassed beauty.

556
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,640
She used to be an official's lover.

557
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,880
But one day the wife came to her place
and beat her.

558
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,680
Then the husband gave her some money
and let her go back to her hometown

559
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,360
- with the rest of her assets.
- Brother Zhou.

560
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,320
Do you miss me?

561
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,640
She booked three rooms at once.

562
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,720
Please.

563
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,920
Sister.

564
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,240
Why hasn't he come up yet?

565
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,800
Did you slap him too hard

566
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,080
and scare him away?

567
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,800
Ms. Zhao.

568
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,440
He's here.

569
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,040
I'm Zhou She.

570
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,240
I just found your gold hairpin

571
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,680
and I'm here to return it to you.

572
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,480
Ms. Zhao.

573
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,480
Ms. Zhao?

574
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,840
Ms. Zhao...

575
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,520
It's you.

576
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,520
Yes.

577
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,760
What are you doing here?

578
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,000
Ms. Zhao doesn't feel good right now.

579
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:30,840
Get out of here.

580
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,440
I'm here to return the hairpin.

581
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,200
Let me in.

582
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
Fan.

583
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,480
You're a heartless hypocrite.

584
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,800
Do you hear that? She is calling me.

585
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,120
I'm guilty.

586
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,920
You and Zhou She...

587
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,200
Zhou She?

588
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,640
I made you angry.

589
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,080
You can beat me or scold me as you want.

590
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,640
How dare you break into our house
in broad daylight.

591
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,280
Get out.

592
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,400
I haven't returned the hairpin.

593
00:32:59,400 --> 00:32:59,960
Let me...

594
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,600
Get out.

595
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,240
I'll beat you to death.

596
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,400
You insensible thing.

597
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,680
Tell me.

598
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,360
Except that I can't play the pipa,

599
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,320
what about me is not as good
as Song Yinzhang?

600
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,360
Nothing.

601
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,360
Is she more beautiful than I am?

602
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,200
No.

603
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,880
Is she more sensible than I am?

604
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,560
No.

605
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,640
She is even no match
for your finger tail.

606
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,160
You're lying.

607
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,400
I'm not lying.

608
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,000
Well, if that's the case,

609
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,200
why would Fan send me away?

610
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,800
Just because I used to
be in a lowly profession,

611
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,720
I don't even deserve
a chance to serve him?

612
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,120
You deserve.

613
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,040
Fan, you...

614
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,760
Why did you send me away?

615
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,630
You listened to that woman
and sent me away.

616
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,320
Be careful.

617
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,320
Stop crying. Stop crying.

618
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
And you!

619
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,560
Why did you elope
with that slutty woman,

620
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,710
Song Yinzhang?

621
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,480
Stop crying.

622
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,710
You're breaking my heart.

623
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,800
He cares about your past, but I don't.

624
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,230
What's wrong with the lowly profession?

625
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,670
Aren't Xue Tao and Hong Fu

626
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,120
both first-class beauties?

627
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,800
Do you mean it?

628
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,600
Yes.

629
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,280
Pan'er, don't be sad.

630
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,600
Let bygones be bygones.

631
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,560
Forget it.

632
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,520
That's right.

633
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,000
Come on, get up.

634
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
Get out of here.

635
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,160
If a woman

636
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,080
doesn't have a husband,

637
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,080
she will have no one to depend on.

638
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,520
Even if she has thousands of
strings of gold and a bucket of beads,

639
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,960
her life will still be meaningless.

640
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,400
Be careful.

641
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,000
You're right.

642
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,960
Come on, get up.

643
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,320
Get up.

644
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,560
Let's stay away from the window.

645
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,880
You're drunk. Don't catch a cold.

646
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,560
Come in.

647
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,400
Bah.

648
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,840
When you were in Qiantang,

649
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,720
I heard you were famous.

650
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,280
I asked Sanniang to send you a bouquet

651
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,560
and invite you over to have some tea.

652
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,920
You just ignored me.

653
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,640
Did that happen?

654
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,960
Are you trying to deny it?

655
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Get your servant, Zhaocai, here

656
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,640
and I'll confront him.

657
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,840
What did he say that day?

658
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,280
He said

659
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,680
you were listening to Ms. Song's
Melody of White Feathers Garment

660
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,800
and you didn't have time
for our stupid tea!

661
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
I sold that boy

662
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,520
a long time ago.

663
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,080
Ms. Zhao.

664
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,080
Look, this is a misunderstanding.

665
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,960
Since the first time I saw you,

666
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,960
I knew

667
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,320
you are a thousand times better
than Song Yinzhang.

668
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,720
The reason I made a mistake

669
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,600
of leaving Qiantang with Song Yinzhang

670
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,040
is because I was afraid
I would lose control of myself

671
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,040
and break my promise to her.

672
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,360
All I want to do

673
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,600
is to worship at your feet.

674
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,800
Do you mean it?

675
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,960
Of course. I can't be more sincere.

676
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,680
If I lie to you in any way,

677
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,760
I'll become

678
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,560
a little turtle

679
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,560
as a stepping stone under your bed.

680
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,400
You are

681
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,160
an interesting man.

682
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,280
I was insensible before

683
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,920
and I made you angry.

684
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,960
I'll drink the wine as an apology.

685
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,920
Please forgive me.

686
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,880
Ms. Zhao, where are you going

687
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,640
via Huating?

688
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,760
Go home.

689
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,280
I'll leave tomorrow.

690
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,760
Tomorrow?

691
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,920
Why the rush?

692
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,680
Your body is precious,

693
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,160
and the journey is tiring.

694
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,200
Why not rest a few more days?

695
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,040
Huating is a beautiful place.

696
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,600
Let me tell you about it.

697
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,800
Please ask the waiter

698
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,240
to bring some stomach-warming
wine and food.

699
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,600
Bring the Yuquan wine.

700
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,800
Get Mr. Xu here.

701
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,480
Okay.

702
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,360
The Yuquan wine won't get people drunk.

703
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,400
Let's take our time to talk
over food and wine.

704
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,080
You dropped it.

705
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,680
Let me bring it to you.

706
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,560
If I were a man,

707
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,680
I wouldn't be able
to resist Pan'er, either.

708
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,200
Commander.

709
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,680
If what Wei Wei said is true,

710
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,880
most of the resident magistrates here
are unreliable.

711
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,000
After all,

712
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,800
the whole Capital Security Office
is at the command of Lei Jing now.

713
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,520
Other people are unreliable,

714
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,960
but not Wan Qi.

715
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,200
He is the one I trust the most

716
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,600
in the Capital Security Office.

717
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,120
Is he your brother?

718
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,800
We're sworn brothers.

719
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,640
Right now everyone out there
is trying to kill me.

720
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,040
He's the only one who would

721
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,280
escort me to the Eastern Capital.

722
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:06,920
All right, you can leave.

723
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,080
But...

724
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,640
I know

725
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,240
you follow me because you want
to go to the Capital Security Office.

726
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,160
But it looks like

727
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,200
it's basically impossible.

728
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:14,920
You are still young.

729
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,840
Don't risk your life

730
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,640
for your wrong decision out of impulse.

731
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,120
Commander.

732
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:20,640
Leave.

733
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,180
(Wine)

734
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,540
(Wan Qi, Stationed Officer of Xiuzhou
of the Capital Security Office)

735
00:40:59,080 --> 00:40:59,920
Qianfan?

736
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,160
Qianfan!

737
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,640
You're so drunk.

738
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,280
Don't drink that much alone.

739
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,560
Are you okay?

740
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,280
I'm a living devil.

741
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,640
I'm not that easy to die.

742
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,000
I saw the secret order from the office.

743
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,960
They are pursuing you everywhere.

744
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,960
I'm glad you're okay.

745
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:31,640
Man.

746
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,760
How did you offend Commissioner?

747
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:36,960
Let's not talk about this now.

748
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,520
I'm here today

749
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,800
to see if the secret order is real.

750
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,040
I'll get it for you now.

751
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,640
You got some good wine here.

752
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,520
Catch it.

753
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,000
I didn't know
my life is worth that much.

754
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,560
20 million strings of coins.

755
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,640
What are your plans now?

756
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,440
Are you going back to the capital
and explain to Commissioner

757
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,040
or are you going to keep running?

758
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,800
I know a way to get you to Fusang.

759
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,160
I've got the money
and the luggage ready for you.

760
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,480
You can leave anytime.

761
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,760
Come on.

762
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:28,840
Come on.

763
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,280
By the way, you must haven't eaten yet.

764
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,840
Let me get you something to eat.

765
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,360
