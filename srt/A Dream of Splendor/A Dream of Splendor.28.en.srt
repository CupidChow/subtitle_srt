See, this is Young Master Chi's mansion.

18
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,640
Go in there with this letter

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,600
and he'll give you
the rest of the money.

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
Maybe he will even give you a tip.

21
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,480
Okay.

22
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,160
Be careful with it.

23
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,720
Okay. Okay.

24
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,960
We made a deal. Five strings of coins.

25
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,660
(Chi's Mansion)

26
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,000
By the way, what has Zhao Pan'er
been doing lately?

27
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,680
It's hot now.

28
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,200
Her shabby teahouse has no ice.

29
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,680
Is their food going to be rotten?

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,080
You know what,

31
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,920
if she wants ice,

32
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,080
she has to beg me for it.

33
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,760
Do you get it?

34
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,360
What's that look?

35
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,080
Young Master.

36
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,200
Gu Qianfan got promoted again.

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,880
What?

38
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,120
He is the Commissioner
of the Capital Security Office now.

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,560
Did he get promoted again?

40
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,440
So what?

41
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,560
Young Master,
there is something you don't know.

42
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,720
The Capital Security Office

43
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,200
has a subordinate department

44
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,920
called Ice Well Department.

45
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,280
Ice Well Department?

46
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,480
I'm so mad!

47
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,760
Young Master Chi.

48
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,880
Who are you?

49
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,560
Nice to meet you, Young Master.

50
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,840
I have a letter for you
from Zhao Pan'er.

51
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,920
Did Zhao Pan'er send you here?

52
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,840
How dare you touch my gold mountain!

53
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,200
Get her on her knees!

54
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,960
Kneel down!

55
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,080
Kneel down.

56
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,240
Wait, read the letter first.

57
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,960
Zhao Pan'er said

58
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,920
that you'd pay me five strings of coins
after reading the letter.

59
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,440
You call this a letter?

60
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,880
Are you making fun of me?

61
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,160
Take her out and beat her up!

62
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,040
I can't read.

63
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,840
It doesn't matter
whether you can read or not!

64
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,320
Take her out and beat her up!

65
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,320
You can't beat me!

66
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,440
Pay me!

67
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,950
You have to pay me!

68
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,880
Spare me!

69
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,880
This is ridiculous!

70
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,520
Get lost!

71
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,960
If you're going
to trick anyone next time,

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,560
at least write something on the paper.

73
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,040
Were you trying to insult Mr. Chi?

74
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,340
(No Adultery and Violence)

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What's wrong? What happened?

76
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,160
Nothing.

77
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,800
I've delivered the money to her.

78
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,360
All is well with Pan'er.

79
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,440
Oh, right. Chief,

80
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,720
you're going to receive

81
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,880
the North Envoy anyway,

82
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,800
and you don't need me.

83
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,240
Well,

84
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,440
the Court of Judicial Review has a case

85
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,920
that needs investigating
outside of the capital.

86
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,480
I want to go.

87
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,640
I can leave now.

88
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,400
The case is in Chenliu.

89
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,720
It's gonna take you at least a month.

90
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,120
I don't care.

91
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,480
All I want

92
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,320
is to get out of the Capital.

93
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,160
Pan'er.

94
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,520
You really scared me.

95
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,840
I heard the noise
and thought there was a thief.

96
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,320
No thief would come.

97
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,800
We only leave 500 strings of coins
in the house.

98
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,360
I just made a pot of cranberry syrup,

99
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,800
and I'm going to soak it
in the well water.

100
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,720
After all, we have to buy
Wangyue Restaurant

101
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,600
and will still
run the teahouse tomorrow.

102
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,880
Let me do it. You've had a long day.

103
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,760
Stop here. You should go back.

104
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,760
No, I can't rest assured
until I see you walk into your room.

105
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,080
You don't have to come here
every day.

106
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,160
Just let me know you're safe
every three or five days.

107
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,280
How about this?

108
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,560
From today,
I'll hang a red flower outside

109
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,680
to show that I'm safe.

110
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,160
I'll hang a yellow one when I miss you.

00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,440
either you sign this deed right now,

168
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,760
or I'll void it.

169
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,480
I'll find another buyer.

170
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,040
Wait, we're not refusing to sign it.

171
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,080
I can sign it.

172
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,120
But we can only give you

173
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,640
the first 600 strings of coins tomorrow.

174
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,200
Is it okay?

175
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,240
Fine.

176
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,240
7:43 AM tomorrow.
I won't wait any longer.

177
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,360
Okay!

178
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,940
(Deed Holder: Su Quanxing
Buyer: Zhao Pan'er)

179
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,440
They are signing it.

180
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,300
(Deed Holder: Su Quanxing
Buyer: Zhao Pan'er)

181
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,720
They signed it?

182
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,220
(Deed Holder: Su Quanxing
Buyer: Zhao Pan'er)

183
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,720
Goodbye.

184
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,080
Thank you.

185
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,800
Thank you.

186
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,100
(Wangyue Restaurant)

187
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,080
Take care, Ms. Zhao.

188
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,120
We just signed it like that?

189
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,000
But our money

190
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,160
is far from enough.

191
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,740
(Wangyue Restaurant)

192
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,720
Don't worry. I got Qianfan.

193
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,520
Money won't be a problem.

194
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,080
But if he doesn't show up,

195
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,040
you will go there for nothing.

196
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,160
All right, let's go home.

197
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,280
Ms. Zhao?

198
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,440
Yes.

199
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,240
Do you know me?

200
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,800
I need to see Commissioner Gu.

201
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,120
Would you mind telling him?

202
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,720
I'm not playing hardball here.

203
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Commissioner Gu accompanied
the envoy from the North

204
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,320
to hunt and enjoy the cool air
in the Liangyuan area.

205
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,720
He won't be back in a few days.

206
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,880
What?

207
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,160
What about Chen Lian, Commandant Chen?

208
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,200
I haven't seen him for a few days.

209
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,640
He's also out of the capital
on business.

210
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,920
Is there something urgent?

211
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,800
You can tell me.

212
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,720
Maybe I can help you.

213
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,800
No need. I'll deal with it myself.

214
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,960
Thanks.

215
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,680
Don't worry.

216
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
Well,

217
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,440
there are no flying pigeons
in the Liangyuan area.

218
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,440
But I'll send a message by horse

219
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,840
and he should be able

220
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,920
to be informed of your visit
in a day or two.

221
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,200
Thank you.

222
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,880
How come?

223
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What's going on with Gu Qianfan?

224
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,120
He...

225
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,920
Could it be that he has backed out

226
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,240
and is trying to avoid you?

227
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,360
He will never do that.

228
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,400
Qianfan must be on business

229
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,960
and can't spare any time.

230
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,840
He's been supportive
of my decision to open a restaurant.

231
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,120
There's no reason for him
to suddenly back out.

232
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,320
I agree.

233
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,600
Why else would he send us
200 strings of coins?

234
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,840
If he had backed out,

235
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,440
he wouldn't have given us the money.

236
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,440
That's right.

237
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,760
Let's wait a little longer.

238
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,320
That's also what his subordinate said.

239
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,600
He said

240
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,800
he will bring us the money we need

241
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,640
in a few days.

242
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,960
We can wait,

243
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,000
but Wangyue Restaurant can't.

244
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,400
Don't you forget we have to give him

245
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,080
600 strings of coins tomorrow morning,

246
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,840
or he won't sell it to us.

247
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,040
Where are we gonna find money

248
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,520
at this hour?

249
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,200
I have some paintings and calligraphy.

250
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,880
The dead of the teahouse
can also be pledged

251
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,040
I'll find a pawnshop right now

252
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,960
and pawn them to get some money.

253
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,600
Wait!

254
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,120
Don't go.

255
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,160
That's all we have now.

256
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,160
If anything goes wrong,

257
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,480
there will be no way back for us.

258
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,480
But if we don't go to the pawnshop

259
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,960
and only hold on to the teahouse

260
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,640
without Yinzhang and her pipa,

261
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,480
the business is going to get worse.

262
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,560
When we pawned everything we had

263
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,680
and decided to stay
in the Eastern Capital,

264
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,840
there was no turning back, either.

265
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,600
Pledging the deed is risky.

266
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,920
But doing business

267
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,360
is about taking risks.

268
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,880
Besides, I'd like to believe in Qianfan,

269
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,760
because he is a man of his word.

270
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,000
He was badly hurt last time

271
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,400
and still came to see me at all costs

272
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,520
so that I wouldn't worry.

273
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,000
That's why I do believe

274
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,640
something serious

275
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,640
must have happened to him.

276
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,800
All we need to do
is to get 600 strings of coins

277
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,070
and wait for his money
to redeem our stuff.

278
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,830
We can still make it happen.

279
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,400
Sanniang, don't you want to know

280
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,310
what it feels like to run
Wangyue Restaurant?

281
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,960
I do!

282
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,830
But I only have 30 strings of coins.

283
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,310
Can you count me in?

284
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,960
I don't want to be a fourth-in-command
or fifth-in-command.

285
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,240
I'll just be
the least important manager.

286
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,680
The second-in-command
hasn't said anything yet.

287
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,680
What's the hurry?

288
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,920
What's more...

289
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,120
Pan'er!

290
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,520
The pawnshops are closed at this hour!

291
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,440
Zhaodi, take the paintings.

292
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,280
Okay.

293
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:38,840
Pan'er!

294
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,320
Pan'er, listen to me!

295
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,720
Zhaodi, don't take the paintings!

296
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,840
Don't go!

297
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,800
Don't take the calligraphy
and the paintings!

298
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,640
Leave a few pieces at least!

299
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,360
- Pan'er, wait for me!
- Don't pawn them!

300
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,080
I'm going with you!

301
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,240
(Yongqiu)
Report! Commissioner Gu has an accident!

302
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,680
Report! Commissioner Gu had an accident!

303
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,240
(Qianfan, where are you?)

304
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,800
(I'm here.)

305
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,640
What happened to you?

306
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,120
(Wait for me. I'll go back
to the capital to see you now.)

307
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,480
(Pan'er, I'm sorry.)

308
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,920
(I shouldn't have been away so long.)

309
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,760
(Qianfan!)

310
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,200
(Qianfan!)

311
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,680
Qianfan, you're finally awake.

312
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,960
Where am I?

313
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,800
We've arrived at Yongqiu.

314
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,240
What are you doing here?

315
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,280
Such a big thing happened
to the envoy of the North.

316
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,640
The Emperor sent me here for inspection.

317
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,720
Rest assured.

318
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,080
Everything is settled.

319
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,520
Yelyu Zongsheng is fine.

320
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,120
He kept saying thanks to me.

321
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,960
The Emperor sent you here this time

322
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,880
to find out about his nature.

323
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,880
With this accident,

324
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,200
we can be relaxed.

325
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,000
Whether or not he will
become the leader,

326
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,560
he owes his life to you.

327
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,000
You did a great job.

328
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,440
But you were struck

329
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,000
in the chest by a stone
while trying to save Yelyu Zongsheng

330
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,440
who fell from a cliff while hunting.

331
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,280
You've been in a coma here for two days.

332
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,800
I was in a coma for two days?

333
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,520
Where are you going?

334
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,640
I have an emergency.

335
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,960
You can't go even if it's an emergency.

336
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,360
Just lie down.

337
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,640
You're not recovered yet.

338
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,240
Did I come all the way here
with my old bones

339
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,280
to bury you?

340
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,440
Listen,

341
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,600
I never expect you to call me Father,

342
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,040
but I don't want to see you

343
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,800
lying there motionless
like you just did,

344
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,040
not knowing if you will die.

345
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,840
I failed your mother.

346
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,920
But you should listen to me
once for a while at least.

347
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,400
Do you want
to avenge your mother's death

348
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,000
by making me lose my son
at middle age?

349
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,840
Man proposes but God disposes.

350
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,800
I thought

351
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,480
I secured advantages for you
through the Empress' influence

352
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,040
and arranged a beneficial trip for you

353
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,640
to take your mind off things
and heal your wounds.

354
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,120
But I didn't know
I would get you into this mess.

355
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,800
Well,

356
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,000
Mahang Street is in a good location.

357
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,640
The mansion is...

358
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,520
They are not going to refuse
to accept our deed, are they?

359
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,880
They won't.

360
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,200
Pawnshops need to make money.

361
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,680
Our deed is just a small order.

362
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,120
Many people come
to pawn gold and jewels.

363
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,960
It's okay.

364
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,520
Sorry, young lady.

365
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,680
My man just did the math.

366
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,560
I don't have enough money now.

367
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,920
We can't take your deed.

368
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,840
It's fine.

369
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,640
We can come early
tomorrow morning and wait.

370
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,640
We can't take it tomorrow, either.

371
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,400
We'll take stock of the shop tomorrow.

372
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,960
Why don't you go somewhere else?

373
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,560
Please.

374
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,320
Other pawnshops are all closed now.

375
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,160
That's true.

376
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,720
Sir, let's stop beating the bush.

377
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,680
I want to ask you a question.

378
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,160
Is Young Master Chi

379
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,160
the head of Pawnshop Guild
in the Eastern Capital?

380
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,600
You're clever indeed.

381
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,200
Well, now that you know about it,

382
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,320
I'll be honest with you.

383
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,920
I dare not offend Young Master Chi.

384
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,280
So you dare offend me?

385
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,120
Well, that's not the same thing.

386
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,360
Let me remind you of something.

387
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,640
The teahouse we're going to pawn

388
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,360
has a Ms. Song

389
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,800
who once got an inscription
from Minister Ke.

390
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,040
You can turn us down today.

391
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,000
But maybe

392
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,680
Ms. Song meets some official one day

393
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,200
and says something about your shop...

394
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,960
Young lady, in this case,

395
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,400
if you do want to pawn your deed,
I can take it.

396
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,360
But I can only give you

397
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,360
50 strings of coins
for a current pawning.

398
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,360
Are you daydreaming?

399
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,720
Why don't you just rob us?

400
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,160
This lady has a quick temper.

401
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:57,920
Come on.

402
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,600
100 strings of coins.

403
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,600
The time limit for a current pawning
is usually one month.

404
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,960
We only need seven days.

405
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,440
If we fail to redeem it in seven days,

406
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,560
the deed worth 300 strings of coins
will be yours.

407
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,040
Well...

408
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,240
Is it okay?

409
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,240
Well...

410
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,320
Deal.

411
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,000
Okay. Deal.

412
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,520
Never mind.

413
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,480
Just let me keep living
a life of intrigue

414
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,000
and walking on eggshells

415
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,280
as a treacherous court official.

416
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,560
The official circle is complex
and full of changes.

417
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,200
No one can stay long and secure

418
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,720
in the seat of Grand Secretary.

419
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,960
A few years later,

420
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:56,520
I'll be exiled to Yazhou and die alone.

421
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,760
That will be

422
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,520
the punishment for me
that you've been waiting for.

423
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,600
All right, I'll do as you wish.

424
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,880
I'll lie down.

425
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,840
It's been a long time

426
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,360
since you and I

427
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,600
had some quiet time together.

428
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,440
Minister Xiao.

429
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,160
I appreciate

430
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,760
your concern for me.

431
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,080
But,

432
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,040
if you are trying to win me over

433
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,960
with such a strategy,

434
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,040
I advise you to drop the idea.

435
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,840
I made it very clear to you
that day at the palace

436
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,920
that I don't take the post of
Commissioner of Capital Security Office

437
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,520
as seriously as you do.

438
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,480
I understand.

439
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,760
I know you want to be a local official.

440
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,920
You want to leave with Pan'er, right?

441
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,640
When did I ever object?

442
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,360
Let me be honest with you.

443
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,800
As long as you are willing
to recognize me as your father,

444
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,760
I'm not afraid to meet
the Emperor with you together,

445
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:59,200
Even if I will be removed
from my post for lying to the Emperor,

446
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,720
I will not regret it.

447
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,240
You don't believe me?

448
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,200
I mean it from the bottom of my heart.

449
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,440
All right, all right.

450
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,680
Let's not talk about this.

451
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,080
Tell me about your wedding.

452
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,560
When are you going
to send gifts to Pan'er?

453
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,440
I don't want to talk about it right now.

454
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,680
Okay, let's not talk about this then.

455
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,720
Well...

456
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,240
Have a good sleep.

457
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,400
It's not easy

458
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,520
to meet a soul mate in your life.

459
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,720
Qianfan.

460
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
You must cherish her.

461
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,840
Don't end up like me.

462
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,480
I made a slight mistake

463
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,320
of being tempted by worldly affairs.

464
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,480
Then I couldn't find my way back.

465
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,240
Who is it?

466
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,520
It's me.

467
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,880
Come in.

468
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,840
Gu?

469
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
Why did you get up?

470
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,960
How is your injury?

471
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,800
Your Highness.

472
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,520
If you take me as your brother,

473
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,000
can you do me a favor?

474
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,640
Go ahead.

475
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,360
I received an urgent letter.

476
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,800
It said

477
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,160
my beloved girl might be in trouble
in the Eastern Capital.

478
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,400
I was going to see her

479
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,600
after everything was settled.

480
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,080
But now I'm too worried.

481
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,600
I have to get back
to the Eastern Capital now.

482
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,200
Fortunately, the Eastern Capital
is not far from here.

483
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,560
If nothing goes wrong over there,

484
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,880
I'll be back tomorrow afternoon
at the latest.

485
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,560
Please stall Minister Xiao for me.

486
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,680
After all, desertion is a felony.

487
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,600
Make it back overnight?

488
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,840
You are such an affectionate man.

489
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,800
I'm okay with it.

490
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,560
But your wound…

491
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,240
It's not a big deal for a military man.

492
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,720
You're a hero indeed.

493
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,600
Just go.

494
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,880
Even if you can't make it back,

495
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,560
I'll tell them

496
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,600
I send you to the posthouse
in the Eastern Capital

497
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,720
to tell my concubine that I'm safe.

498
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

499
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,560
What's the matter?

500
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,120
Did Young Master Chi get mad

501
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,360
because of my mother?

502
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,000
This has nothing to do with you.

503
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,600
Young Master Chi and I

504
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,280
bear deep grudges against each other.

505
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,040
I sent your mother there

506
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,520
to disgust him.

507
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,120
I'm fully responsible

508
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,120
for the situation right now.

509
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,040
Let's not talk about this.

510
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,080
At least we managed to get

511
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,280
600 strings of coins before daybreak.

512
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,960
We have the down payment
for Wangyue Restaurant now.

513
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,040
But why are these 100 strings
of coins so little?

514
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,640
The 200 strings of coins from Chen Lian

515
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,160
were sent here
in several big boxes last time.

516
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,680
Because the value
of the Xiangfu gold ingot

517
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,640
the pawnshop gave us is ten coins.

518
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,680
One ingot is worth ten coins.

519
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,680
What Chen Lian

520
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,960
brought us

521
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,560
was worth two or five coins.

522
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,000
Those definitely would take more space.

523
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,800
Chen Lian has strength indeed.

524
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,480
He carried those boxes

525
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,800
that weighed several hundred kilograms
up and down the stairs easily.

526
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,640
I wonder what he can accomplish

527
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,520
on this business trip.

528
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,000
Don't you two get along well?

529
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,880
Why are you so quiet?

530
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,400
He is the Commandant
of the Capital Security Office.

531
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,320
I'm just a teahouse girl.

532
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,680
I mean, we're both humans,

533
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,040
but there is a big gap between us.

534
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,640
I'm not on a par with him.

535
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,800
Pan'er.

536
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,480
Not everyone is as lucky enough

537
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,080
as you to meet someone like Mr. Gu.

538
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,960
It's my luck to meet Qianfan.

539
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,720
But our happiness is in our own hands.

540
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,600
We can't count on anyone else.

541
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,120
Ziming!

542
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,920
Bring me another jar of wine.

543
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,720
Will you stop drinking?

544
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,640
Things will go wrong
if you keep drinking like this.

545
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,760
What will go wrong?

546
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,320
I met Taoist Baoyi today.

547
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,560
It's okay even if he wants
to live a carefree life

548
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,200
and refuses to take the post

549
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,840
I've been swallowing my pride

550
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,000
in the Western Capital for months

551
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,800
just to see him, right?

552
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,880
Now I've met him.

553
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,400
Shouldn't I celebrate it?

554
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,960
What do we do after that?

555
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,520
Taoist Baoyi refuses to take the post.

556
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,440
Does it mean we can't
go back to the capital?

557
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,920
We can't go back to the capital.

558
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,960
You're right.

559
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,400
We can't go back to the capital.

560
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,120
We can die of old age
in this stupid Western Capital.

561
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,520
Do something about it.

562
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,600
Don't just drown your sorrows.

563
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,200
I heard

564
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,200
that a high official named Censor Qi

565
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,360
has recently returned to his hometown
to recuperate.

566
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,840
His family is prominent
in the Western Capital.

567
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,480
Why don't you go visit him

568
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,120
and try to pull some strings?

569
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,840
Censor Qi?

570
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Right now,

571
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,280
even my teacher thinks
I embarrassed him,

572
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,920
not to mention Qi Mu.

573
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,520
He's also a Scholar Minister
like Minister Ke.

574
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,600
Why would he lay eyes on me,

575
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,040
a Taoist Temple Administrator
who is a disgrace to the literati?

576
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,440
Give it to me.

577
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,200
You'll never know without a try.

578
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,120
Visit him with some gifts.

579
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,520
Be respectful.

580
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,400
Maybe things will change.

581
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,320
What gifts?

582
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,520
I have nothing but poverty.

583
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,200
What gifts can I give him?

584
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,560
Besides,

585
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Qi Mu

586
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,600
is not back here to recuperate.

587
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,440
He was simply defeated by Xiao Qinyan.

588
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,240
He left the capital to avoid trouble.

589
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,000
What can someone like him

590
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,840
do for me?

591
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,040
I don't understand such things.

592
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,920
It's always better to have hope.

593
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,880
Minister Duke Ke

594
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,120
gave you a box of gifts last time.

595
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,440
I'll find it out.

596
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,440
See, an inkstone.

597
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,480
It's worthless.

598
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,480
The Dragon Phoenix Ink.

599
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,190
You can have it.

600
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,920
Here are two paintings.

601
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,520
Isn't this great?

602
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,360
How about the Night Revels of Wang Ai?

603
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,320
Thirdly, you said you would take

604
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,240
the Night Revels to the Eastern Capital
and have it framed by a master.

605
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,320
Please give it back to me now.

606
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,080
No.

607
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,280
Hold on.

608
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,600
Bring me that painting.

609
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,800
(It's the Night Revels indeed.)

610
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,280
(It went round and round)

611
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,760
(and came back to me in the end.)

612
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:25,920
Take a look.

613
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,360
At what?

614
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,880
Just take a look as I said.

615
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,440
It's realistic.

616
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,720
There are many pretty girls.

617
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,800
Here is a character of Wang.

618
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,920
And a character of Zhang.

619
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:00,960
Let me see.

620
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,880
Look, it's here.

621
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,200
You need to look sideways at it.

622
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,160
Just like the talismans
that Taoists often draw.

623
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,840
Zhang Shishi.

624
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,000
Chen Juan.

625
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,720
Wang Yun'er.

626
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,080
Liu Wan.

627
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,560
(It's the Empress.)

628
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,200
We can go back to the Eastern Capital.

629
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,000
What?

630
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,120
We can go back to the Eastern Capital.

631
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,040
Zhaodi. Zhaodi.

632
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,040
Tell them to move it over here.

633
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,760
Come on.

634
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,840
Hurry. Be steady.

635
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,360
Be careful. Don't get hurt.

636
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,680
Sorry.

637
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,720
Why are you here again?

638
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,000
I...

639
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,680
I invited Mr. Du to come.

640
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,360
After all, it's our first time
running such a big business.

641
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,560
Mr. Du is an official.

642
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,440
It's safer to have him here.

643
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,760
Thank you very much.

644
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,920
You're welcome.

645
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,760
We're friends.

646
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
I'm just doing my bit.

647
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,400
Oh, no.

648
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,560
It just occurred to me

649
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,920
that Yinzhang also owns a part

650
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,760
of the 600 strings of coins, right?

651
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,640
It's not appropriate

652
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,440
to use her money without asking her.

653
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,200
Don't worry. I sent Zhaodi
to Shen's mansion yesterday.

654
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,680
She said we could use it. It's okay.

655
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,280
Good then.

656
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,480
(Wangyue Restaurant)
Why are you still standing here?

657
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,720
It's such a scorching day.

658
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,800
Are you not afraid
to turn into dried jerky in the sun?

659
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,200
Why are you so silly?

660
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,840
She said it for my good.

661
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,040
Please.

662
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:48,880
Please.

663
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:55,340
(Wangyue Restaurant)

664
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,440
Why didn't you tell me

665
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,920
that you went to Shen's mansion
last night?

666
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Pan'er asked me not to tell you.

667
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,240
Why?

668
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,960
What did Yinzhang say to you

669
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,680
when you got there?

670
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,000
She tore up the letter from Pan'er

671
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,160
and said that Pan'er asked her
if she would chip in in such a hurry

672
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,160
just to force her.

673
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,560
The good thing was
that she didn't need the money now.

674
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,680
She would return your favor

675
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,760
of saving her in Huating with the money.

676
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,040
She also said

677
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,960
she was in poor health

678
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,120
and needed rest

679
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,400
so she wouldn't come

680
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,680
to the wedding of Pan'er and Gu.

681
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,920
How could she... say that?

682
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,520
She threw away our sisterhood

683
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,360
just because she also likes Gu?

684
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,600
I'm so mad.

685
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,280
(Zhao Pan'er Ge Zhaodi Song Yinzhang)
How is she doing there?

686
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,200
Did she look good?

687
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,000
She is doing great.

688
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,360
Her clothes are gorgeous.

689
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,880
The pearls on the hairpin are this big.

690
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,600
There is a bunch of maids
waiting on her.

691
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,840
Everybody calls her ma'am
in the mansion.

692
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,000
That's good.

693
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,160
The good thing is she didn't meet

694
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,080
a crook this time.

695
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,720
After I came back from Shen's mansion,

696
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,800
I sort of realized

697
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,320
that she left this time

698
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,560
(Outright sale of the land)
not all because of Gu.

699
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,440
After all, all Gu can see

700
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,280
has always been Pan'er alone.

701
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,600
What else could it be about?

702
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,200
Jealousy.

703
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,120
Think about it.

704
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,560
She set her heart on marrying Zhou She

705
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,400
just because Ouyang became

706
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,440
(Zhao Pan'er Ge Zhaodi Song Yinzhang)
a Presented Scholar.

707
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,680
Now,

708
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,600
Pan'er is about to marry an official.

709
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,320
She has to find someone
like Shen Ruzhuo quickly.

710
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,600
Seriously?

711
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,640
Of course.

712
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,800
Pan'er may not have guessed
her feelings for Gu,

713
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,200
but she must have sensed her jealousy.

714
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,600
Otherwise,

715
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,180
why did she ask me
not to tell you about it?

716
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,460
(Zhao Pan'er Ge Zhaodi
Song Yinzhang Sun Sanniang)

717
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,760
Sanniang. Zhaodi.

718
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,760
It's your turn.

719
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,400
It's my turn.

720
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,020
(Zhao Pan'er Ge Zhaodi
Song Yinzhang Sun Sanniang)

721
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,560
There is also Yinzhang's name.

722
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,080
The three of us opened the teahouse.

723
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,120
She also chipped in
for Wangyue Restaurant.

724
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,520
She deserves a share.

725
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,400
I just signed it for her.

726
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,560
Ms. Zhao, you are a righteous person.

727
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,300
(Zhao Pan'er Ge Zhaodi
Song Yinzhang Sun Sanniang)

728
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,920
Zhaodi, come on.

729
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,080
Hurry.

730
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,680
I'm not dreaming, am I?

731
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,560
I'll become a restaurant owner.

732

(Zhao Pan'er Ge Zhaodi
Song Yinzhang Sun Sanniang)

733
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,800

734
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,240
Sure.

735
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:46,940
(Zhao Pan'er Ge Zhaodi
Song Yinzhang Sun Sanniang)

736
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,840

737
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,400
