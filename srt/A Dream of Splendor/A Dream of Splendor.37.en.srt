17
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,640
The darkling skies and yellow earth.

18
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,440
The darkling skies and yellow earth.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,160
Amid great chaos had their birth.

20
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,200
Amid great chaos had their birth.

21
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,720
The sun and the moon wax and wane.

22
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,000
The sun and the moon wax and wane.

23
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,600
All over the universe the stars span.

24
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,000
All over the universe the stars span.

25
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,840
The darkling skies and yellow earth.

26
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,720
The darkling skies and yellow earth.

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,600
Amid great chaos had their birth.

28
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,640
Amid great chaos had their birth.

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,080
The sun and the moon wax and wane.

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,360
I'm not a good mother.

31
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,280
Though I knew he didn't suffer a lot

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,560
on his way to the capital,

33
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
I shouldn't

34
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,880
have thrown him to you

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,120
shortly after our reunion

36
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,520
just because I'm busy doing business.

37
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,160
If he is a three-year-old toddler,

38
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,440
you should take care of him.

39
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,760
But he is turning 14.

40
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,800
You have to pay poll tax for him
next year.

41
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,160
If he still clings to his mother,

42
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,040
he'll be mocked by his classmates.

43
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,360
And what do you mean by
"throw him to me"?

44
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,440
Your son is my son.

45
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,040
I'll try my best
to make him a useful person.

46
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,240
You must stick to your word.

47
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,920
Then give me a reward.

48
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,760
Sir.

49
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,960
Could you give us the privilege

50
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,600
to see the beautiful performers?

51
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,440
It's my call, not his.

52
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,000
You should call me Mrs. Du first.

53
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,960
You...

54
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,280
Hello, Mrs. Du.

55
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,240
Hello, Mrs. Du.

56
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,760
Good.

57
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,560
All right. Go to class. You're late.

58
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,760
If you don't behave,

59
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,120
she'll throw you into the river.

60
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,520
They freaked me out.

61
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,120
Changfeng,

62
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,080
thank you.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,040
Now I think

64
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,760
coming to the Eastern Capital,

65
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,880
opening our own restaurant

66
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,680
and getting to know you

67
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,240
have been the best things

68
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,480
that ever happened to me
in the 30-odd years of my life.

69
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,680
I'm lucky to have met you, too.

70
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,720
We're in the academy.

71
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,920
I have to go.

72
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,160
Let me walk you out.

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,360
You come and go like a shadow.

74
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,160
Why don't you stay in the office?

75
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,240
Why are you here?

76
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,960
I miss you,

77
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,040
so I come to see you.

78
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,680
We've just separated
for less than four hours.

79
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,240
This morning
when I went shopping with you,

80
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,280
I found there was much
good stuff in the shop.

81
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,200
I remembered what you said yesterday.

82
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,200
So I bought some

83
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,200
and had them delivered home.

84
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,120
Shall we go home together
and have a look tonight?

85
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,600
Tonight?

86
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,320
Definitely not.

87
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,200
I must go home tonight.

88
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,080
If Sanniang and Yinzhang
find out about us,

89
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,160
they'll laugh at me.

90
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,320
If we get married right away,

91
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,640
we don't have to
worry about that, do we?

92
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,240
Who told me yesterday

93
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,280
that he couldn't be with me?

94
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
You blushed?

95
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,720
I find that you're good at

96
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,160
taking care of children.

97
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,120
So I took a longer view.

98
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,600
That's why I blushed.

99
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,960
All right. Just amuse yourself.

100
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,040
I'm just saying...

101
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,120
Did I agree to marry you?

102
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,720
I just made up with you.

103
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
I'm busy with the restaurant.

104
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,320
I'm happy.

105
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,040
What if I get bored of you?

106
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,400
Aren't you afraid?

107
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,920
It seems that

108
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,520
Chi Pan has made you happy
these days.

109
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,520
What if he has?

110
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,040
It's great.

111
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,760
You know

112
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,680
I'm dull and boring

113
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,760
and usually occupied with work.

114
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,640
If he diverts you from boredom,

115
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,480
I would be overjoyed.

116
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,120
Aren't you afraid?

117
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,720
I hate him so much.

118
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,600
I've never paid any attention to him.

119
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,160
I've never regarded him as an opponent.

120
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,960
He doesn't deserve it.

121
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,160
Of course,

122
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,200
I know you don't think much of him,

123
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
do you?

124
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,480
Pan'er.

125
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,560
I want you to know,

126
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,440
whether you marry me now

127
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,880
or in the future,

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,320
or you don't even marry me,

129
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,280
I'll wait for you.

130
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,840
I know you're magnanimous.

131
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,480
You can let go of the hatred,

132
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,000
but more or less,
it leaves a shadow in your heart.

133
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,640
I want to be with you.

134
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,520
I hope as time goes by,

135
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,920
your inner wounds will gradually heal.

136
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,040
What's wrong?

137
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,680
Are you going to cry?

138
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,040
No.

139
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,640
I'm just too happy.

140
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,440
Why would I cry?

141
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,000
By the way,

142
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,920
there's an important thing
you need to know.

143
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,680
The Night Revels incident
has come to an end.

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,560
His Majesty found an excuse

145
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,360
to transfer Qi Mu to Suzhou.

146
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,520
So he was demoted?

147
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,840
What about Ouyang Xu?

148
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,160
He was appointed as the
Administrative Assistant of Xinzhou.

149
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,760
So he got a sideways move
instead of demotion?

150
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,880
But he was the initiator of evil.

151
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,440
Why did His Majesty
let him off so easily?

152
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,560
Take them all.

153
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,120
Sell them all?

154
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,680
Don't sell them.

155
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,920
He grabbed them.

156
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,640
Give him.

157
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,080
No.

158
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,360
The ancestral houses
are the last family property.

159
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,400
Still, I'm going to sell them.

160
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,640
Do you know
what kind of a place Xinzhou is?

161
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,840
It's located in the south
of the Five Ridges.

162
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,000
It's a hot uncivilized land
covered with miasma.

163
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,520
Transferring me there

164
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,160
from a much-honored position

165
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,240
is nothing less than killing me.

166
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,720
It must be...

167
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
It must be Qi Mu.

168
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,400
And Gu Qianfan.

169
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,400
They tried to entrap me.

170
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,560
That day,

171
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,400
His Majesty wasn't angry with me.

172
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,520
Why?

173
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,360
Why?

174
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,200
But even the Second Graduate

175
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,920
has been appointed as a regional
Controller-general.

176
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,840
I don't care.

177
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,880
I just don't want to be exiled.

178
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,760
I don't want to
suffer in the Western Capital.

179
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,280
I want to stay in the splendid
and prosperous capital city.

180
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,360
I want to stay here.

181
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,160
So,

182
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,000
before I'm officially transferred,

183
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,040
there are still a dozen days left.

184
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,840
I must make the best use of the time

185
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,000
and seek help from my connections.

186
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,160
I need money.

187
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,560
I need lots of money.

188
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,600
As long as I can stay here,

189
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,160
not to mention the ancestral houses,

190
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,800
I would even

191
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,040
sell my life.

192
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,400
Master, don't do that.

193
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
- Master, what shall I do?
- You can't sell them.

194
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,640
Don't just stand there!

195
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,760
Go ahead!

196
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,560
You can't.

197
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,320
Master.

198
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,000
Come back.

199
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,480
Come back!

200
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,080
You shouldn't sell them.

201
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,200
Come back!

202
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,360
Master.

203
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,920
Master, you can't sell them!

204
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,960
Don't do that!

205
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,480
Master, don't do that.

206
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,080
You can't sell them.

207
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,640
You can't do that.

208
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,280
Sirs,

209
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,920
call me if you need anything.

210
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,480
OK.

211
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,640
Sir, how do you like the food?

212
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,160
It's quite delicious.

213
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,000
Enjoy yourself.

214
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,320
Sir, do you like the food?

215
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,040
Of course.

216
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,960
Yinzhang, long time no see.

217
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,320
You're not welcome here.

218
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,600
Don't take me as a threat.

219
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,600
I've been demoted now.

220
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,800
I'm leaving the Eastern Capital soon.

221
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,720
I come here

222
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,080
to see Pan'er for the last time.

223
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,120
I want to apologize to her face to face.

224
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
She is out,
and she doesn't want to see you.

225
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,480
Sure enough.

226
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,920
Would you please

227
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,520
give her this letter?

228
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,960
Please tell her,

229
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
because I broke our pledges
and loved another woman,

230
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,520
I've been punished by Heaven.

231
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,280
In the future, from the wilderness
of the south of the Five Ridges,

232
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,640
I'll wish her peace, luck,

233
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,920
and great pleasure.

234
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,600
It turns out he is Ouyang Xu.

235
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,680
A villain as he is,

236
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,280
he's quite handsome.

237
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,320
No wonder Pan'er...

238
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,120
Did he pay the bill?

239
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,680
The bill?

240
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,680
I didn't ask you to come down

241
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
because I think

242
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,760
you'd better
not have any dealings with him.

243
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,080
Sure.

244
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,880
(The sea sees the pearl with tears beam,
the field feels the jade with gleam.)

245
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,800
My love for her
draws me back to the past,

246
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,600
while now I'm all lost
and a bit downcast.

247
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,160
Does he deserve to say that?

248
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,120
He is probably afraid that

249
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,280
Qianfan and I would twist the knife,

250
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,160
so he shows weakness to
arouse my sympathy.

251
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,120
Do you believe him?

252
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,280
He presented The Night Revels
to His Majesty

253
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,240
probably because he tried to
play up to Qi Mu.

254
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,800
It wasn't aimed at us.

255
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,440
I don't think he knows

256
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,000
the roles we played in this whole thing.

257
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,960
For him,

258
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,680
hitting a wall in his official career

259
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,760
is the worst punishment.

260
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,400
(Pan'er, I miss you. I'll meet you at
Great Xiangguo Temple tomorrow morning.)

261
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,400
Pan'er, I miss you.

262
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,400
You freaked me out.

263
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,880
Don't hide it. I saw it.

264
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,480
Why does he invite you

265
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,320
to the Great Xiangguo Temple?

266
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,000
It's personal.
None of your business.

267
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,240
How could you say that?

268
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,440
You're my manager now.

269
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,840
We signed a one-year contract.

270
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,880
If you get married and quit,

271
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
what shall I do?

272
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,880
Rest assured.

273
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
I'm not that kind of woman

274
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,360
who quits her business just for love.

275
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,240
I won't quit before I make
Yong'an Restaurant

276
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,880
a sight of the Eastern Capital.

277
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,120
That's more like it.

278
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,360
Do you want to break up
with Wooden Head?

279
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,880
It's okay if you don't.

280
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:50,960
By the way,

281
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,000
you don't have time to meet him

282
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,080
at the Great Xiangguo Temple tomorrow.

283
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,000
(Invitation)
The people of the restaurant guild

284
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,200
finally realized that

285
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,560
all the spices in the city

286
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,480
are sold by us.

287
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,960
Tomorrow is the first day
of next month.

288
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,040
They are going to discuss

289
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,640
bidding for franchise of the wineries.

290
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,440
The head of the guild,

291
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,320
the owner of Pan's Restaurant,

292
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,600
sent us an invitation personally.

293
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,520
Don't we just have the license
to sell wine?

294
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,640
We're not qualified
to participate in the bidding.

295
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,480
Apparently,
the guild tries to draw us in.

296
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,080
You don't know

297
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,120
which restaurant
would sell their franchise.

298
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,800
Within a year,

299
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,120
you and I

300
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,840
will get our restaurant

301
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,960
the license to make wine.

302
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,200
Isn't it exciting?

303
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,240
Pinch me.

304
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,040
I need to know if I'm dreaming.

305
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,800
You got to be kidding.

306
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,840
You asked me to pinch you.

307
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,560
You're on your own.

308
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,400
After today's Flower and Moon Banquet,

309
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,320
I'll take a break.

310
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,160
No way.

311
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,040
Think about it.

312
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,520
Since ancient times,

313
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,640
the guild has never permitted women
to run registered restaurants.

314
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,200
Now you're the manager of
Yong'an Restaurant

315
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,000
and the business is booming.

316
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,080
If you show up there,

317
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
they'll be embarrassed.

318
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,720
Say it.

319
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,560
You sold all the stuff
and the title deeds

320
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,839
for only 400 strings of coins?

321
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,599
Uncle De didn't let me sell them.

322
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He only permitted me to pawn them.

323
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,960
So I didn't get much money.

324
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,880
Master.

325
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,880
Master.

326
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,240
Master.

327
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,440
I shouldn't have decided by myself.

328
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,360
But I did it for your good,

329
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,720
and for the family's good.

330
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,240
With the pawn tickets,

331
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,160
we still have a chance to redeem them.

332
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,360
If we sell them,

333
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,560
we'll lose the ancestral houses forever.

334
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,320
Uncle De.

335
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,120
Give me the tickets.

336
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,800
I won't give you.

337
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,920
Old Master asked me
to look after the family.

338
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,840
I won't give you even if

339
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
it takes my life.

340
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,040
Fine.

341
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,200
Fine.

342
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,200
Master, listen to me...

343
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,680
Who is the master

344
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,720
of the family?

345
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,520
You, or me?

346
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,920
Didn't you say

347
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,800
you just bought some?

348
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,360
I really intended to buy some,

349
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,440
not expecting that

350
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,960
I couldn't stop myself from shopping.

351
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,880
Don't worry about it.

352
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,800
I'll find some capable servants

353
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,560
to clean it up.

354
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,080
By the way,

355
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,000
last time,

356
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,760
the stuff you liked but
were reluctant to spend money,

357
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,720
look, here it is.

358
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,120
Enough.

359
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,560
What?

360
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,960
The key of the money box.

361
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,520
If you keep spending money like this,

362
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,800
we'll be in big trouble.

363
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,920
Right, the key.

364
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,680
Chief.

365
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,000
Pan'er.

366
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,680
As you instructed,

367
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,960
Kong Wu picked the cutest

368
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,680
and most docile one
out of his puppies.

369
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,720
You're going to keep a dog?

370
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,560
I don't want you to get bored.

371
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,560
With you

372
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,000
upsetting me every day,

373
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,160
how could I get bored?

374
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,160
Pan'er,

375
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,320
from now on, I wish our home

376
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,880
to be lively, bustling

377
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,680
and full every day, okay?

378
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,480
As you wish.

379
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,360
Here, the key.

380
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,120
Sir, what are you doing?

381
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,200
Do you have to do this?

382
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,080
Of course.

383
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,240
This is the second time
Pan'er and I go out together.

384
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,640
Of course I have to dress up.

385
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,840
But isn't Pan'er and Mr. Gu...

386
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,640
Is Gu Qianfan a man?

387
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,240
He is a piece of ice.

388
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,800
No woman would endure him long.

389
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,800
He managed to
make up with Pan'er this time.

390
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,680
What about next time?

391
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,160
I don't think they can make it work.

392
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,360
As the saying goes,

393
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,320
as long as you keep digging,

394
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,040
you'll finally sap the wall.

395
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,240
You're right.

396
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,360
It's been an hour.

397
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,360
Aren't you guys

398
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,160
tired?

399
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,000
He isn't tired. Neither am I.

400
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,080
Pan'er and I have businesses to do.

401
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,640
Why do you come with us?

402
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,520
She is my fiancée.

403
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,920
It's my official holiday today.

404
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,400
Is there any problem
with me going with her?

405
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,640
There is.

406
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,160
Take another carriage if you like.

407
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,800
Don't take mine.

408
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,480
Get off.

409
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,280
I won't.

410
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,640
I'm going to sit here.

411
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,760
What can you do with me?

412
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,960
You dummy.

413
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,800
Do you believe I'll reveal
all of your inside stories?

414
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,400
You dork.

415
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,480
Listen carefully.

416
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,520
Do you want your men to know

417
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,880
when you stopped
wearing open-crotch pants?

418
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,720
Your ages add up

419
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,240
to over ten, right?

420
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,960
One is the commissioner,
the other is the head of guilds.

421
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,320
Can you be even more
naive and immature?

422
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,600
Stop staring at each other.

423
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,080
Let's get down to business.

424
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,840
Shoot.

425
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,800
I've thought it over.

426
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,880
Even if the guild invites us,

427
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,240
we should turn down

428
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,440
the bidding next year.

429
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,240
Why?

430
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,440
If we get the franchise,

431
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,840
our restaurant will become
a registered one.

432
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,040
A registered restaurant
just has an exaggerated reputation.

433
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,440
We may not benefit from it.

434
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,560
I've just
got Yong'an Restaurant on track.

435
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,160
If we expand the business blindly,

436
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,440
we can't handle it well.

437
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,800
None of us know how to make wine.

438
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,720
We have to hire more hands
and vintners.

439
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,760
One mistake, and our reputation
will be ruined.

440
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,000
Business is a competitive activity.

441
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,600
We shouldn't just focus on expanding.

442
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,160
We should balance
tension and relaxation.

443
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Our restaurant has been
in the limelight for over a month.

444
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,960
Many people are jealous of us.

445
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,400
What's wrong with you?

446
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,240
How did you drive the carriage?

447
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,840
You hit my stall.

448
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,800
Sir,

449
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,280
your stall takes too much space.

450
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,000
There's an accident ahead.

451
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,480
Shall we make a detour?

452
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,760
Make a detour?

453
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,640
We'll be late.

454
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,360
Pack up your stall and leave.

455
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,280
Isn't the guild right in front?

456
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,000
Let's go on foot.

457
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,280
But my boots are new.

458
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,720
If we're late,

459
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,760
they'll think we're condescending.

460
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,280
Go.

461
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,800
Who let you set up the stall here?

462
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,600
You get in our way,

463
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,160
don't you know?

464
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,320
How could I get in your way?

465
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,480
The space is for the stall.

466
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,600
I set my stall here every day.

467
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,840
There's heavy traffic here.

468
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,440
You shouldn't have
set up the stall here.

469
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,560
You made my stuff
go all over the street.

470
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,640
I've lost several days of earnings.

471
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,560
Pan'er, continue.

472
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,640
When we attend the meeting,

473
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,040
we mustn't be arrogant.

474
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,800
We should keep a low profile

475
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,640
and don't let them think

476
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,160
we're going to steal their thunder.

477
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,920
And we'd better cut the prices

478
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,080
of the crabs and spices a little.

479
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,920
Don't push them too hard.

480
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,880
What do you think?

481
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,400
Yes.

482
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,160
What's wrong?

483
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,560
Don't you agree?

484
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,240
No.

485
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,640
I just think what you've said

486
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,960
was similar
to the ways of being an official.

487
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,920
Merchants and officials are the same.

488
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,320
Guan Zhong was a merchant
as well as the Grand Councilor.

489
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,360
We still have business to discuss.

490
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,920
Why are you chatting with him?

491
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,400
Pull.

492
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,280
OK.

493
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,120
I'll come next time.

494
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,880
OK.

495
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,360
I gotta go.

496
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,160
Have a look.

497
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,040
Are you tired?

498
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,520
Let's grab a bite.

499
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,080
OK.

500
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,080
I'm hungry.

501
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,000
They have some good stuff.

502
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,040
OK.

503
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,960
Watch out!

504
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,720
What happened?

505
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,880
Are they all right?

506
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,520
How did the logs drop?

507
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,440
Why were they so careless?

508
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,080
Yes.

509
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,280
Are they hurt?

510
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,960
What if they get seriously wounded?

511
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
They may get hurt.

512
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,880
It's dangerous.

513
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,320
What happened?

514
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,680
What happened?

515
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,320
Qianfan.

516
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,560
And then?

517
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,240
Did Uncle Gu die?

518
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,160
Don't say the inauspicious words.

519
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,560
He's fine.

520
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,680
But Aunt Pan'er's leg was hurt.

521
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,640
She can't move.

522
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,880
So she stays in Uncle Gu's house
recuperating from the injuries.

523
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,480
But I heard

524
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,160
the logs were this large,

525
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,000
and they dropped from a great height.

526
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,560
How could he be fine?

527
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,480
He's the Living Devil.

528
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,080
The devils dare not take him away.

529
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,680
That's just a nickname.

530
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,920
How can you take it seriously?

531
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,200
Am I right, Aunt Song?

532
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,520
Life is uncertain. Accidents happen.

533
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,560
I often feel like

534
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,240
I'm living in a drama.

535
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,560
The heroes in the Yuan dramas

536
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,000
are always fine even after
they've been through

537
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,760
numerous hardships.

538
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,000
Commissioner Gu may be a hero.

539
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,520
What about Mr. Chi?

540
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,840
Isn't he all right?

541
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,520
I haven't seen him for days.

542
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,840
He may feel humiliated.

543
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,320
Chief almost sacrificed his life
to save Pan'er,

544
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,040
but he only ran for his life.

545
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,360
When people of the government arrived,

546
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,080
he could barely talk.

547
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,760
So he was ashamed of himself.

548
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,240
Sir.

549
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,880
Do you come to see my mother?

550
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,080
I behaved in the academy recently,
didn't I?

551
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,360
Zifang, I have businesses
to discuss with Mr. Du.

552
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,920
Nowadays it isn't safe outside.

553
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,520
So I invited him over.

554
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,200
Mr. Du, you haven't eaten, right?

555
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,160
Have some.

556
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,400
Yeah, I haven't.

557
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,120
I haven't eaten yet.

558
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,440
Have some more.

559
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,880
Fortunately, Chen Lian
covered for us just now.

560
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,600
Seriously?

561
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,960
Why did you come
without informing me?

562
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,240
I was worried.

563
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,120
I heard something had happened.

564
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,600
So I went to Yong'an Restaurant.

565
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,920
But you closed early.

566
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,360
You don't have to be worried.

567
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,880
I'm strong.

568
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,200
I'm worried even if you got a scratch.

569
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,160
Let's get married,

570
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,200
or I'll always worry about you.

571
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,560
Didn't we agree to

572
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,320
get married after you're
granted with a post next year?

573
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,000
Besides, I'm busy
with the restaurant now.

574
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,520
How do I have time
to get married?

575
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,160
The wedding can wait.

576
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,760
But I don't want to keep it a secret.

577
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,320
Zifang just arrived

578
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,360
and he still clings to me.

579
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,200
I don't want to

580
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,880
tell him until he

581
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,040
adapts for a while.

582
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,080
Changfeng,

583
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,280
I know you love me.

584
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,520
I know it clearly.

585
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,320
Would you keep the secret

586
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,360
a little while just for me?

587
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,600
Fine. You call the shots.

588
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,120
I call the shots?

589
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,720
Exactly.

590
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,080
Pan'er's feet weren't badly hurt.

591
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,960
But the case is complicated.

592
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,440
The assassins were all dead

593
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,040
and people with Kaifeng Prefecture
arrived at the scene first,

594
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,120
so the Capital Security Office
has no jurisdiction over it.

595
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,200
That's why

596
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
Chief wants Pan'er to stay with him,

597
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,960
in case anything happens again.

598
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,440
So,

599
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,760
Pan'er asked me to tell you

600
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,600
Sanniang has to
take care of the kitchen.

601
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,400
You'll have to

602
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,680
take care of all the other things.

603
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,880
Tell her not to worry about it.

604
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,720
Has the Prefecture found out

605
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,280
who the murderers came at?

606
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,600
Is it possible that people
with the guild were jealous

607
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,400
and hired the murderers?

608
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,080
It's possible.

609
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,520
(Owner of Pan's Restaurant)

610
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,440
You really didn't do it?

611
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,320
Really.

612
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,680
Sir,

613
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,800
even if I wasn't happy with you

614
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,920
inviting Yong'an Restaurant
to participate in next year's bidding,

615
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,720
I wouldn't kill people in the street.

616
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,000
It's a felony
that may lead to death penalty.

617
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,680
Better not be you.

618
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,680
The Prefecture will
make a full investigation.

619
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,800
But we still have business to do.

620
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,440
Sounds fair.

621
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,120
Everyone, now that Ms. Song,

622
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,240
who only knows to play pipa,

623
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,560
has replaced Ms. Zhao as the manager,

624
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,040
we got a

625
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,080
perfect opportunity.

626
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,080
I think you're all clear about

627
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,720
what you have to do next.

628
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,120
- Yes.
- Yes.

629
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,560
He is right.

630
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,240
We're at your orders.

631
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,200
OK. Please.

632
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,680
Sir, how do you like the food?

633
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,640
It's great.

634
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,560
It's delicious.

635
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,080
Please.

636
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,400
Does the meat taste good?

637
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,320
- Yes.
- Great.

638
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,560
Ms. Song, long time no see.

639
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,560
Long time no see.

640
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,760
Ms. Song.

641
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,600
Hello, Ms. Song.

642
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,680
How do you like the food?

643
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,680
Good. It's good as always.

644
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,240
Without Ms. Zhao,

645
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,520
you take care of the restaurant
all by yourself.

646
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,560
You're great, really.

647
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,040
Yes.

648
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,960
I'm flattered.

649
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,240
Please enjoy yourselves.

650
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,400
OK.

651
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,800
Thanks.

652
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:05,960
She is capable.

653
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,240
Yinzhang, how is it going?

654
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,440
Are you okay? Can you make it?

655
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,200
I'm okay.

656
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,880
Don't worry about the kitchen.

657
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,720
They've learned from me
for a long time.

658
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,840
They know how to cook.

659
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,000
It doesn't matter if I leave for a while
and give you a hand.

660
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,560
Take a seat.

661
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,320
I thought before

662
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,000
it was tiring playing pipa all day
in a private room.

663
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,760
Now I know

664
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,720
it's more tiring
being a manager all day.

665
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,040
The guests worry about

666
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,960
Pan'er and Mr. Chi.

667
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,120
Do you think

668
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,680
we'll have troubles?

669
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,320
I managed to comfort them.

670
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,600
We got trouble.

671
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,760
What's wrong?

672
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,480
What happened?

673
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,680
We got a takeaway order from
Princess Changle's mansion.

674
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,360
He Si delivered the food just now.

675
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,760
But before long,

676
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,320
they filed a complaint
about our Orange Crab.

677
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
They said the crab was stinky.

678
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,600
What?

679
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,600
Stinky?

680
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,320
Look.

681
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,800
The food delivered
by Yong'an Restaurant is stinky.

682
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,360
How dare we eat there again?

683
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,240
Their food is expensive.

684
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,840
Really?

685
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,160
I've been to Yong'an Restaurant.

686
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,880
Their food is delicious

687
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,160
and not very expensive.

688
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:27,880
Yes.

689
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,360
Do you think the imperial clan

690
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,560
would wrong them?

691
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,160
Stop groaning.

692
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,320
I'm the manager of Yong'an Restaurant.

693
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,600
Let me talk to your steward.

694
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,160
(He's coming.)

695
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
(Listen to what she's going to say.)

696
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,760
You finally came.

697
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,080
How dare you sell us a smelly crab!

698
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,680
Don't rush to any convictions.

699
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,360
You said

700
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,600
we delivered bad food.

701
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,440
Where is the food?

702
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,040
Check it out for yourself.

703
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:09,920
They have evidence.

704
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,199
Are you sure
this was from our restaurant?

705
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,280
Of course.

706
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,440
Do you want to deny it?

707
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,480
Please.

708
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,120
Who is this?

709
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,320
The medical officer.

710
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,199
Medical officer?

711
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,159
Why do you take a medical officer?

712
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,199
Stinky crab is poisonous.

713
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,400
If someone is audacious enough

714
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,560
to frame our restaurant,

715
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,080
as the manager, I'm surely obliged
to report to the government

716
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,199
and ask the medical officer
to check it out.

717
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:51,960
(Exactly.)

718
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,120
(It's getting more interesting.)

719
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,679
(Yes.)

720
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,400
Ms. Song.

721
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,600
Did he find anything?

722
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,720
Everyone, please check.

723
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,800
Is the crab roe orange?

724
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,560
Yes, it's orange.

725
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,680
- Yes.
- Yes, it is.

726
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,600
Exactly.

727
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,960
Check it carefully.

728
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,920
- Red.
- It's red.

729
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,000
- Yes, it's red.
- Red.

730
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,560
You're right.

731
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,040
The dish

732
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
wasn't cooked in our restaurant.

733
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,000
Someone swapped it.

734
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,040
(Learn from wise)

735
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,120
Drop the crap!

736
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,920
Listen to me.

737
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,840
Only female crabs

738
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,160
have red roe.

739
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,520
Male crabs' roe is bright yellow.

740
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,800
Our guests who have

741
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,160
tried the dish

742
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,960
all know it.

743
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,880
The aquatic product guild
can testify for us, too.

744
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,160
We've never

745
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,480
bought a female crab from them.

746
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,520
To ensure the flavor of the dish,

747
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,040
in the city,

748
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,760
only our restaurant

749
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,680
cooks with precious Jiangnan crabs.

750
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,960
Others all use ordinary river crabs.

751
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,880
Their meat is totally different.

752
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,960
The medical officer can find out easily.

753
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,320
Everything is clear now.

754
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,360
Let him go.

755
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,000
Yes.

756
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
Ms. Sun, they tricked us deliberately.

757
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,760
They colluded with each other.

758
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,040
Isn't that the manager
of Wang's Restaurant?

759
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,520
Don't run.

760
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,720
You tied me up.

761
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,000
I must get even with you.

762
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,280
How dare you trick us?

763
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,320
We have the evidence now.

764
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,480
You'll be sued.

765
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,280
Does the imperial clan

766
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,120
have the right
to punish ordinary folks at will?

767
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
I'll ask the censors

768
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,280
when they come to our restaurant.

769
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,920
Ms. Song,

770
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,160
it was a misunderstanding.

771
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,800
We were tricked.

772
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,280
I'm sorry.

773
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,320
I'm so sorry.

774
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,080
Welcome to our restaurant
to try the new dishes.

775
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,240
Sure, we'll support you.

776
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,200
We'll definitely go.

777
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,800
Do you see it?

778
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,560
Thanks to the misunderstanding.

779
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,280
Pure gold, weighs eight liang.
[*liang: equals 50 grams.]

780
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,960
The steward of the princess

781
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,240
put it on me personally.

782
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,360
If it were me,

783
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,520
I'd be willing to be tied up
for ten times.

784
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,160
Well, I was afraid that
without Ms. Zhao,

785
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,960
we would lose the backbone.

786
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,880
It turns out Ms. Song

787
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,520
is great as well.

788
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,000
Sure.

789
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,600
Don't just flatter me.

790
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,480
We were framed up because
we were not careful enough

791
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,760
when we delivered the takeouts.

792
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,440
Though the customers
apologized again and again,

793
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,320
they insisted it was just
a misunderstanding

794
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,160
and they hadn't taken bribery
from Wang's Restaurant.

795
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,720
Think about it.

796
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,320
The registered restaurants

797
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,680
stooped to such low-down tricks on us.

798
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,000
We don't know

799
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,280
if they have other tricks.

800
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,800
They do have new tricks.

801
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,960
We're running out of wine.

802
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,080
Zhaodi went to Li Qing's to purchase.

803
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,920
But they wouldn't sell us.

804
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,360
They said if we want wine,

805
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,520
we have to exchange it with

806
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,560
all our curcuma and styrax.

807
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,480
Why should we?

808
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,000
They bully us in a flagrant way.

809
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,840
I'll go confront them.

810
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,000
You can't do anything.

811
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,480
Yes.

812
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,880
We need Mr. Chi to solve it.

813
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,040
Why? He still won't leave the house?

814
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,840
I'll go.

815
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,880
Get out. I don't want to see anyone.

816
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,120
Release the snake.

817
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,360
Snake!

818
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,880
Where is it?

819
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,560
Where is the snake?

820
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,360
Song Yinzhang, what do you want?

821
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,200
I was sleeping.

822
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:44,960
Are you insane?

823
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,880
I'm not, but you freaked out.

824
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,680
I didn't!

825
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,680
I was sleeping.

826
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,920
Except bullying the soft
and fearing the tough,

827
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,200
what else can you do?

828
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,440
No wonder Pan'er disapproves of you.

829
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,080
Now you disapprove of me, too.

830
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,080
The first time I met you,

831
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,600
I was so scared that I even cried.

832
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,320
But just now,

833
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,200
I almost made you cry.

834
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,480
Don't you think it's hilarious?

835
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,520
Pan'er's father was a general.

836
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,840
She used to see dead bodies
in childhood.

837
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,000
Gu Qianfan is the commissioner.

838
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,640
He lives a dangerous life.

839
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,360
To admit they're bolder than you

840
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,840
is really that shameful?

841
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,800
You worry about being laughed at.

842
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,480
Your restaurant is going to close down,

843
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,520
but you still hide in your house

844
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,320
like a turtle hides in his shell.

845
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,000
If the restaurant really closes down,

846
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,120
not only me, but the people
all over the city

847
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,960
will laugh at you.

848
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,400
Wait, stop there!

849
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,280
What did you say?

850
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,280
What happened to the restaurant?

851
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,200
The Wang's Restaurant
failed in framing us.

852
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,200
Now Li Qing won't sell us wine.

853
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,360
They ask us to exchange it with spice.

854
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,160
The rascals!

855
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,080
They tried to kill Pan'er.

856
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,920
Now they even try to get me in a corner.

857
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,440
Let's see.

858
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,640
What are you going to do?

859
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,920
Someone!

860
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,720
The restaurant guild can only

861
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,520
stop the registered restaurants
in the city

862
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,440
from selling us wine.

863
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,520
Can they stop those outside the city?

864
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,920
I'm going out of town to purchase wine.

865
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,600
I'm going to show them

866
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,040
how wealthy I am.

867
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,280
Sir, sir.

868
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,440
You haven't put on your clothes.

869
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,200
Aren't these clothes?

870
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,960
I'll just wear these.

871
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,120
You can't.

872
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,080
Don't, sir!

873
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,080
It's all right.

874
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,040
What are you doing?

875
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,240
Zifang, let me explain.

876
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,800
Zifang, I and your...

877
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,880
Shame on you!

878
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,280
- Zifang.
- Zifang.

879
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:14,960
Zifang.

880
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,760
Fu Zifang.

881
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,560
Don't come over.

882
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,840
Don't come over,

883
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,160
or I'll jump down.

884
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,760
Zifang, don't be silly.

885
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,760
Come to me.

886
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,480
Shut up!

887
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,120
I don't want

888
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,040
a woman of loose morals to be my mother!

889
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,840
You have an affair with another man!

890
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,240
Shameless!

891
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,560
You...

892
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,160
Zifang!

893
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,800
Zifang!

894
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,520
Yinzhang!

895
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,640
The river is shallow.
He won't be drowned.

896
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,520
Zifang!

897
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,840
What's there to see?

898
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,360
The mother is teaching
her ungrateful son, a swine.

899
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,320
Leave, people.

900
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,600
Just leave.

901
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,080
I'm not a swine.

902
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,240
Yes, you are!

903
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,520
- When you were in Qiantang,
- Leave!

904
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,840
your mother raised you and
took you as the apple of her eye.

905
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,360
How did you pay her back?

906
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,840
Since you came to the Eastern Capital,

907
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,600
your mother has
forgiven all your faults,

908
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,760
provided you with
the best food and clothing

909
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,160
and sent you to the best academy.

910
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,200
She's been a loving mother.

911
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,560
But are you a dutiful son?

912
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,840
Yinzhang, stop.

913
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,240
But she is my mother.

914
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,680
She is wrong to fool around

915
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,760
with the indecent man.

916
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,080
Fu Zifang,

917
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,640
listen carefully.

918
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,440
I'm your teacher,

919
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,680
the Presented Scholar,

920
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,480
an official appointed by
the imperial court.

921
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,120
I'm not an indecent man.

922
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,000
Your mother has a pure heart and spirit.

923
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,360
She is virtuous, frank,

924
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,640
amiable and respectable.

925
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,880
A gentleman and a lady

926
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,840
falling in love

927
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,760
is the most beautiful thing
in the world.

928
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,600
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

929
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,160
The reason why we didn't tell you

930
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,200
is because you just arrived
and you're young.

931
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,320
We're afraid you can't take it.

932
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,080
Still, I don't allow it!
