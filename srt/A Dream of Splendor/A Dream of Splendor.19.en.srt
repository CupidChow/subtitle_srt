17
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,520
When I was in the palace,

18
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,120
a thought suddenly crossed my mind.

19
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,240
I fear that it would upset you
if I tell you.

20
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,440
But I also fear that
it would upset you more

21
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,720
if I don't tell you.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,360
Actually, I was engaged.

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,840
You were engaged?

24
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,600
Good.

25
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,880
We're even now.

26
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,000
No.

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,960
I had never seen that girl before.

28
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,360
My grandpa arranged it for me.

29
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,480
Really.

30
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,680
My grandpa arranged it for me.

31
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,280
When they learned that
I joined the Capital Security Office,

32
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,280
they broke off the engagement.

33
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,320
I've been in the
Capital Security Office for long.

34
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,920
If I tell you

35
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,640
I had nothing to do
with any romance before,

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,120
you wouldn't believe it.

37
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,280
But I've never been in a relationship
with any young lady.

38
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,520
I've never had any flings.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,200
I'm done. That's all.

42
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,640
I fell into pariah rank when I was nine.

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,880
But I always remembered

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,480
my mother's words before she died.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,880
She said the more talented
an official maid-slave was,

46
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,880
the more ill-fated she would be.

47
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,240
So I played dumb.

48
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,040
Though I could play pipa and paint,

49
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,360
I dared not show it.

50
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,400
The instructor was disappointed
in my poor dancing skills.

51
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,760
So she ordered me to learn accounting.

52
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,640
When I was 16,

53
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,480
my father's former subordinates
found me.

54
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,200
They helped me
to drop the pariah status.

55
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,720
I thus escaped from the fate

56
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,280
of serving men with my prettiness.

57
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,120
After that, I started to learn
to do business.

Ouyang and I

59

were attracted to each other,
but we abided by etiquette.

You don't have to say that.

61
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,880

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,760

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,440
it's funny when you tell jokes

00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,240
By the way,

88
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,760
what were you drawing just now?

89
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
In case the teahouse
needs to be extended,

90
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,360
I'd better draw a blueprint

91
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,880
and make a plan in mind.

92
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,520
It hasn't been a month
since it was opened,

93
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,720
and you're already
thinking of extension?

94
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,480
Because I've earned money.

95
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,920
I always remember our wager.

96
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,760
The initial capital included,

97
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,120
I haven't lost money yet.

98
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,400
It doesn't matter if you lose money.

99
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,200
In any case,

100
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,400
all my money is yours,

101
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,640
as long as you don't feel sorry.

102
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,240
Ms. Song, this way, please.

103
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,800
What tune would you like?

104
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,040

00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,200
Please.

106
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,840
Savor the Lanya tea first.

107
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,080
The water is sweet spring water
newly fetched this morning.

108
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,920
Not bad.

109
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,480
It's sunny today.

110
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,560
Would you like the Floating Cloud Tune?

111
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,000
No hurry.

112
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,800
Try this loquat.

113
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,320
Mr. Shen,

114
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,800
I came to play pipa

115
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,880
instead of eating loquat.

116
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,480
I have to go back to
the Music Division later.

117
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,000
Pull in to shore.

118
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,400
Ms. Song,

119
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,960
I specially invite you over

120
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,160
in order to

121
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,840
enjoy your playing without distractions.

122
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,080
But your spirit isn't calm

123
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,360
and your temper isn't even.

124
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,840
You just want to slip by.

125
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,080
Whether you treat me fairly or not,

126
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,600
do you

127
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,400
treat your Moon fairly?

128
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,880
You've been staying
in the teahouse recently

129
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,840
and playing pipa
for those pedantic scholars.

130
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,150
You must be bored.

131
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,320
Finally, you get some time
to have a break.

132
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,600
Why do you leave in such a hurry?

133
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,360
I'm not bored.

134
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,600
Then why did you

135
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,480
get dressed up before you came here?

136
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,080
I didn't.

137
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,560
Shen Ruzhuo seems
to have a crush on her.

138
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,400
I wondered why

139
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,960
it was noisy on the lake.

140
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,200
It turns out she made all the noise.

141
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,280
Good. Good!

142
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,960
It isn't good.

143
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,080
I must go tell Zhao Pan'er.

144
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,560
Shen Ruzhuo loves to play the field.

145
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,240
Yinzhang can't handle him.

146
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,600
Don't go.

147
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
I'm warning you.

148
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,800
You can do whatever you like

149
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,280
except for this thing.

150
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,520
A wicked will be harassed
by another like ilk.

151
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,200
Zhao Pan'er,

152
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,800
when the man makes your sister,

153
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,080
Yinzhang, miserable,

154
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,920
I'll take my time to enjoy the show.

155
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,920
I'm lucky
to listen to your playing, Yinzhang.

156
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,240
I wonder when we can meet again?

157
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,520
Don't call me that.

158
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,120
I'll be busy recently.

159
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,000
The hairpin is returned intact.

160
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,040
I remember

161
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,200
you work at the Music Division

162
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,600
on the 9th and 23rd of each month.

163
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,040
I'll see you in five days.

164
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,160
After you finish your work,

165
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,880
I'll take you to ride a horse.

166
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,360
But I...

167
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,120
It's a deal.

168
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,320
I'm telling you again,

169
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,040
don't let out the secret.

170
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,360
Otherwise,

171
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,920
we're over.

172
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,240
It's a deal.

173
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,560
It's a deal?

174
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,800
Raise.

175
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,600
I'm thinking,

176
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,840
we need a cubicle

177
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,680
for Yinzhang to play pipa there
without distractions.

178
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,720
We also need
a few more hands in the kitchen,

179
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,160
so that Sanniang can focus on
developing new recipes.

180
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,400
What do you want to say?

181
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
I'm thinking,

182
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,920
if we really get married,

183
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,120
can I stay in business?

184
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,280
Do you like it?

185
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,000
If you like it,

186
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,520
you can stay in business forever.

187
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,600
Whether it's a teahouse

188
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,920
or a restaurant,

189
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,280
you can stay in any business.

190
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,000
Moreover,

191
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,120
don't say if we get married.

192
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,160
We'll definitely get married.

193
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,800
Aren't you afraid that
marrying a businesswoman

194
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,480
is bad for your reputation?

195
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,360
Which law of the Great Song

196
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,680
prohibits an official from
marrying a businesswoman?

197
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,640
Besides,

198
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,640
is there any speech official

199
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,720
who dares to offend
the Capital Security Office?

200
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,840
Really?

201
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,720
It's real if you believe it.

202
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,000
Gu Qianfan,

203
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,120
you're so kind to me.

204
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,240
But what can I give you?

205
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,960
Money,

206
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,160
power,

207
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,600
or family background,

208
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,440
I have none.

209
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,840
Are you obsessed
with doing business?

210
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,040
To be together forever

211
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,760
isn't a trade that requires fairness.

212
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,240
You stay with me

213
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,520
and know me well.

214
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,240
It's the best thing for me.

215
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,640
Gu Qianfan,

216
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,040
I like you.

217
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,240
I know.

218
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,520
I'll be busy recently.

219
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,240
Take good care of yourself.

220
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,160
Lei Jing asked to see you in a hurry.

221
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,160
Is there a big case?

222
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,440
Yes.

223
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,640
A hat demon case
happened in the south recently.

224
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,040
I assume you've heard of it.

225
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,520
It is said that

226
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,240
there's a demon
which looks like a straw hat.

227
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,120
It can fly.

228
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,480
Every night,

229
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,320
it turns into a giant wolf

230
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,680
which feeds on human.

231
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,920
Last night,

232
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,280
it appeared in Xiangfu County
50 miles away

233
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,240
from the Eastern Capital.

234
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,440
Is there really a demon in the world?

235
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,200
That's why Chen Lian asked you
to go back?

236
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,960
Greed makes a man demon.

237
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,440
Whether it's a man or a demon,

238
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,520
I'll kill it for good.

239
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,800
When the case is closed,

240
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,400
I'll take you to see my mother.

241
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,200
Then,

242
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,400
I'll ask a matchmaker
to propose to you.

243
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,080
But if you propose to me,

244
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,000
everyone in the Capital Security Office
will know.

245
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,920
Do you mean Lei Jing?

246
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,880
Don't worry.
Someone will take care of him soon.

247
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,200
I think we'd better not

248
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,520
let too many people
know about it recently.

249
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,800
I propose to you first

250
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,070
because I don't want you to be worried.

251
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,480
After Lei Jing is brought to justice,

252
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,440
I promise

253
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,640
I'll give you a fair and square wedding.

254
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,480
I'm not worried.

255
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,040
Sanniang already knew it.

256
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,480
It doesn't matter.

257
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,070
I didn't hide it from Chen Lian, either.

258
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,680
The point is Song Yinzhang.

259
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,160
She is a coach in the Music Division.

260
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,360
There are too many people
and conversation flows freely.

261
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,720
OK, I won't tell her.

262
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,840
By the way,

263
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,800
in your clan,

264
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,280
are there any living elders?

265
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,000
I don't think Sun Sanniang

266
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,560
should represent your family.

267
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,440
There should be.

268
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,520
They were all scattered
when my father was in exile.

269
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,560
My mother used to say we were from
the Zhao Family of Luoyang.

270
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,920
It's easy.

271
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,760
All over the world,

272
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,360
there's nothing we can't find out.

273
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,800
All right. Go inside.

274
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,600
You leave first.

275
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,320
I'll watch you go inside.

276
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,960
Go ahead.

277
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,120
I'll watch you leave.

278
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,000
Go.

279
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,000
All right. Stop here.

280
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,800
If you cross the bridge,
I'll have to walk you back.

281
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,960
Bye.

282
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,160
Bye.

283
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,320
Go back.

284
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,640
Go back now.

285
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,600
Pan'er.

286
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,680
You were so reluctant to part.

287
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,840
Do you still think I'm your friend?

288
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,640
He's going to propose marriage,

289
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
but you haven't told me yet.

290
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:26,960
Shh.

291
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,800
Yinzhang isn't asleep yet.

292
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,720
She fell asleep early.

293
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,360
After dinner,

294
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,400
she seemed unsettled.

295
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,320
While picking the outfits for
the Music Division tomorrow,

296
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,800
she changed three sets in a row.

297
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,160
Zhaodi is asleep, too. Rest assured.

298
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,320
Tell me about you and Gu Qianfan.

299
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,960
It was simple.

300
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,320
We cleared up all the misunderstandings.

301
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,440
He wanted to marry me
and I said yes.

302
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,640
It was really simple.

303
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,720
As a legal wife?

304
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
I told you.

305
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,520
God is fair.

306
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,400
You'll marry as a legal wife eventually.

307
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,240
Fortunately, Ouyang Xu the jerk

308
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,880
ran away.

309
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,480
He is just of the Eighth Rank.

310
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,560
Pretending to be some big shot,

311
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,400
he can't compete with Gu Qianfan at all.

312
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,720
Don't tell Yinzhang for now.

313
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,760
For one reason,

314
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,920
Qianfan said we should
keep it secret for safety now.

315
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,080
For another reason,

316
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
we agreed not to marry again

317
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,600
and to live together as sisters.

318
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,080
If she knows...

319
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,080
She spoke without thinking.

320
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,120
Why do you take it seriously?

321
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,720
Recently, she and Mr. Shen

322
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,800
are getting close.

323
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,480
Speaking of getting married,

324
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,760
she may marry before you do.

325
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,040
Qianfan said so, too.

326
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,080
Enough, you couldn't stop
calling him Qianfan.

327
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,880
When do you start to call him husband?

328
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,200
Let's go to bed.

329
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,840
Go to bed.

330
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,440
Put the red coral hairpin

331
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,480
next to your pillow.

332
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,240
It's like
Qianfan is sleeping by your side.

333
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,040
Good.

334
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,720
Good.

335
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,200
This is Osmanthus Lane.

336
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,440
I heard they live in this house.

337
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,440
Miss, what's wrong?

338
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,840
Nothing.

339
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,440
I may have a period.

340
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,280
Go and find me a cloak.

341
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,920
Yes.

342
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,440
Miss, what's wrong?

343
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,240
I...

344
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,240
Would you like to go inside
and have a rest?

345
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,160
Come on. Let me help you.

346
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,720
Come.

347
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,160
The dress is old.

348
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,240
Don't mind it.

349
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,600
Does it fit you?

350
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,160
Yes. Thanks.

351
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,280
Come and have some brown sugar water.

352
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,000
Thank you.

353
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,800
The dress fits me well.

354
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,680
Don't mention it.

355
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,360
What day are you on?

356
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,800
It's my first day.

357
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,040
I don't know what happened.

358
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,960
I just...

359
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
I just forgot it.

360
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,520
You'll feel better
after drinking the brown sugar water.

361
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,560
Brown sugar water?

362
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,600
It won't help.

363
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,840
I used to drink it.

364
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,760
But it still hurts.

365
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,600
It isn't normal brown sugar water.

366
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,480
It contains angelica,
astragalus and wolfberry.

367
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,880
It's good for regulating menstruation.

368
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,120
Don't worry.

369
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,840
I didn't put knock-out drops in.

370
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,400
I won't knock you out and sell you.

371
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,560
I don't...

372
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,320
The taste

373
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,200
is familiar.

374
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,920
My mother seemed to drink it
when I was a child.

375
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,360
Unfortunately,

376
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,120
she is...

377
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,360
Was your mother from Jiangnan?

378
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,480
Girls in Jiangnan

379
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,080
usually drink this
when they have periods.

380
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,680
Her ancestral home was in Mingzhou.

381
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,320
It's really helpful.

382
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,400
It doesn't hurt so badly.

383
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,640
Thank you.

384
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,760
By the way,

385
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,160
my maid

386
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
is probably looking for me outside.

387
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,760
I must go and have a look.

388
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,400
I'll come another day

389
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,080
to thank you for giving me your dress.

390
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,960
Don't worry about it.

391
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,000
Such things happen.

392
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,040
Thank you very much.

393
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,880
You're welcome.

394
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,920
Sanniang.

395
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,880
Pan'er.

396
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,720
It's you.

397
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,240
Are you blind?

398
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,040
Got you.

399
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,320
Let me fix you.

400
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,160
You...

401
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,240
Stop it.

402
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,960
What are you doing?

403
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,480
Get up. Get up.

404
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,520
Why did you fight?

405
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,320
Sanniang, she kicked me in there.

406
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,160
Where?

407
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,520
Make it clear. Where?

408
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,880
You hit my horse with a stone
at the wharf last time.

409
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,480
You almost knocked one of my teeth out.

410
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,360
You deserved it.

411
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
Did you ride your horse blindly?

412
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,640
It almost hit me.

413
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,600
You deserved it.

414
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,280
The Capital Security Office
was handling a case.

415
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,000
Why didn't you stay away?

416
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,760
Capital Security Office?

417
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,160
You're like a yellow weasel.

418
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,520
You're a yellow weasel!

419
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,600
Stop it!

420
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,040
Pan'er is working in the teahouse
by herself.

421
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
Go help her.

422
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,080
Hurry.

423
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Enough.

424
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,520
Enough.

425
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,640
Hurry.

426
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:54,960
Go.

427
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,440
Uncle De was tight-lipped.

428
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,080
He wouldn't tell me anything.

429
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,400
Miss, don't mind him.

430
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,480
Anyway,

431
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,880
when we receive the reply from Jiangnan,

432
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,360
everything will be clear.

433
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,400
If you want to know
what happened to Mr. Ouyang,

434
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,120
why don't you ask Master?

435
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
No.

436
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,960
My father was trying to

437
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,680
separate me and Xu.

438
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,360
Even if he hasn't been
engaged to another woman before,

439
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,640
as long as I ask him,

440
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,360
he'll probably tell me,

441
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,960
Xu has changed his mind.

442
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,160
Where have you been?

443
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,440
I went to burn joss sticks
at the Yufo Temple by Jinming Lake.

444
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,320
The other day when I was in the palace,

445
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,680
my aunt asked me to go to the temple
and transcribe scriptures for her.

446
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,120
I took Chuntao with me.

447
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,360
We burned Peace Incense for Nanny.

448
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,880
Did you?

449
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,840
Father, if you don't believe me,
ask the driver.

450
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,560
Walk her to her room.

451
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,560
Remember,

452
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,320
don't go out these two days.

453
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,240
The annulment letter from Ouyang Xu
will arrive soon.

454
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,680
I don't want you to
come up with any lousy idea.

455
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,800
Father...

456
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,440
Wait.

457
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,280
What's wrong?

458
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,640
The reason why I make bold
to present you the painting,

459
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,560
is that I have something

460
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,600
to tell you.

461
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,120
I'm Zhao Pan'er from Qiantang.

462
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,840
I was once engaged to Ouyang Xu.

463
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,040
Who on earth did you see?

464
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,800
I went to Jinming Lake.

465
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,400
I didn't see anyone.

466
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,160
Very good.

467
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,360
At this point,

468
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,920
you're still lying to your father.

469
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,240
You know clearly Ouyang Xu

470
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,680
lied to you,

471
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,400
but you're still
deceiving yourself and others.

472
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,520
Listen,

473
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,680
if you let her out again
these two days,

474
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,480
I won't spare you.

475
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:07,920
Master.

476
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,520
What's up?

477
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,000
Father, I won't break off
my engagement with Ouyang Xu.

478
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,240
If you won't,

479
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,960
don't call me Father again.

480
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,960
Miss, let's go.

481
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,200
Miss.

482
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,040
Master, urgent message from
Chief Military Inspector Liu.

483
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,960
(Hat demon caused casualties from
7:00 PM to 9:00 PM inside Fengqiu Gate.)

484
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,020
(Please keep your door closed
and your lights on. Take care.)

485
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,920
Hat demon?

486
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,520
Please have a look.

487
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,400
Look,
the patterned umbrella is beautiful.

488
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,640
Would you buy one?

489
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,190
OK.

490
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,720
I'll take this one.

491
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,040
What are you talking about?

492
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,000
See you.

493
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,840
Welcome next time.

494
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,160
See you.

495
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,160
There are many stalls.

496
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,800
Give me a discount next time.

497
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,480
Come on, let me tell you.

498
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,360
It's said the hat demon is this big.

499
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,840
It flies over quietly

500
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,000
without making any noise.

501
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,400
Really?

502
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,160
Then it covers on your head.

503
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,680
Click!

504
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,560
Your head is gone.

505
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,400
So scary!

506
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,760
Why did people from the wharf say

507
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,120
the hat turned into a wolf

508
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,320
and ate people directly?

509
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,960
It turns into wolf outside the city

510
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,760
while eats people directly in the city.

511
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,480
Anyway,

512
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,440
I saw it with my own eyes.

513
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,880
I'm telling you,

514
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,120
blood is flowing like stream
at Fengqiu Gate.

515
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,920
People utter dreary cries and screams.

516
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:36,960
Hat demon.

517
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,920
Hat demon is coming!

518
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,080
Hat demon.

519
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,000
Hat demon.

520
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,800
Where?

521
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,640
Where is it?

522
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,400
Over there.

523
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,480
Hat demon!

524
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,160
Run!

525
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,680
Hat demon is coming.

526
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,720
Run fast.

527
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,480
Hat demon is coming.

528
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,240
Hat demon is coming.

529
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,760
- Hurry.
- Run.

530
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,320
Hat demon.

531
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,040
Hat demon is coming.

532
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,560
Run.

533
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,400
Run fast!

534
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,680
Run!

535
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,440
Run!

536
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,040
The Capital Security Office in action.

537
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,240
Everyone dodge immediately.

538
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,040
The Capital Security Office in action.

539
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,360
Everyone dodge immediately.

540
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,760
Are you hurt?

541
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,400
Listen carefully.

542
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,800
According to law, those who mislead
people with heresy get floggings of 20.

543
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,920
Those who loot while in disorder

544
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,000
will be decapitated!

545
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,400
Those who have nothing serious to do,

546
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,200
close your stalls and go home.

547
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,080
Dismiss!

548
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,520
Go home.

549
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,160
Hurry.

550
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,000
Go.

551
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,040
Hurry.

552
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,600
You go to help Deputy Commissioner Gu.

553
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,760
Interrogate those who have contact
with the hat demon.

554
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,360
Don't miss any details.

555
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,080
- Yes.
- Yes.

556
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,160
Is he really with
the Capital Security Office?

557
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,640
Chief, are you all right?

558
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,160
Chief.

559
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,360
The Chief Military Inspector

560
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,320
asked us to send some men

561
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,720
to Xiangfu Official Post

562
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,760
to pick up Minister Duke Xiao.

563
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,040
He just arrived tonight.

564
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,440
Was it really so scary?

565
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,720
Yes.

566
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,160
Deputy Commissioner Gu

567
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,880
flew over in a short while.

568
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,360
Then bang,

569
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,960
half of the wall collapsed.

570
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,640
Was he fine? Was he injured?

571
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,120
I don't know if he was injured or not.

572
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,040
But Chen Lian went over.

573
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,280
He should be fine.

574
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,400
Do you know
Deputy Commissioner Gu, too?

575
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,520
He is the owner of our teahouse.

576
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,520
Don't worry.

577
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,120
Gu Qianfan is a skilled fighter.

578
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,840
We had been in danger many times

579
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,150
all the way from Qiantang
to the Eastern Capital.

580
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,080
Didn't we change danger into safety
every time?

581
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,960
Sure.

582
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,080
The Deputy Commissioner
of the Capital Security Office

583
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,480
isn't that easy to get hurt.

584
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,100
(White clouds shattered to pieces)

585
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,600
You've had a long day.

586
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,000
Why don't you go to bed early?

587
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,190
But...

588
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,520
No but.

589
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,120
By the way, when you were
in the Music Division today,

590
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,440
did you see Zhang Haohao?

591
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,880
Pan'er said last time,

592
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,710
she wanted to invite her over
to perform with you.

593
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,960
No.

594
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,720
I was instructing the girls.

595
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,480
I didn't see her.

596
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,720
Well,

597
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,040
put your things down.

598
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,720
Leave.

599
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,200
It's late. Go to bed.

600
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,520
Take your pipa.

601
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,720
Pan'er.

602
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,560
Qianfan.

603
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:33,960
Where are you going?

604
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,160
I'm afraid something happened to you.

605
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,040
So I intended to go to the market
and inquire about you.

606
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,200
I'm fine.

607
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,800
Chen Lian told me,

608
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,520
when the accident happened,

609
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,160
the little maid-servant
who lives with you was there, too.

610
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,200
I know

611
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,800
you must be worried
after you hear about it.

612
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,280
So I come to tell you I'm fine.

613
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,960
You are not injured, are you?

614
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,040
Rest assured.

615
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,520
To a man

616
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,640
who lives a dangerous life like me,

617
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,240
such things are normal.

618
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,480
But it's a little different now.

619
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,800
Now I have you.

620
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,760
I have another person to worry about.

621
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,800
Did you call me Qianfan just now?

622
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,160
Call me that from now on.

623
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,040
I like it.

624
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,840
You're a little different tonight.

625
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,600
How come?

626
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,080
You're very gentle.

627
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,560
Wasn't I gentle to you before?

628
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,800
Don't change the subject.

629
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,360
Tell me,

630
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,440
was something wrong?

631
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,800
No.

632
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,920
It's just I've been busy all day.

633
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,600
I'm a little tired and hungry.

634
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,960
Are you telling me
you haven't eaten anything?

635
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,360
I didn't have time to eat.

636
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,200
Come.

637
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,200
If I take you back to the yard now,

638
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,960
Yinzhang and Sanniang
would be awakened.

639
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,520
We have a tea hut here.

640
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,920
Usually, we cook tea here.

641
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,040
But occasionally,
we make a simple lunch.

642
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,920
There are some food and condiments.

643
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,360
Wait for me. I'll be back soon.

644
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,040
Mother.

645
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,960
Mother.

646
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,960
Mother, take me to my father!

647
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,040
Mother!

648
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,360
Mother, take me to my father!

649
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,320
- Mother, where is my father?
- Take me to my father!

650
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,440
The Chief Military Inspector

651
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,480
asked me to send some men
to pick up Minister Duke Xiao.

652
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,600
Our real enemy is Xiao Qinyan.

653
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,080
If you can uproot him,

654
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,880
I must request
an official title for you.

655
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,480
Your aunt's honorary title
will be within easy reach.

656
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,880
You're not my father.

657
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,280
Father!

658
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,040
Mother!

659
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,880
Were you asleep?

660
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,840
What dream did you have?

661
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,000
I just recalled some old stories.

662
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,040
What's this?

663
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,200
Pepper and chili soup.

664
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,760
We don't have many ingredients here

665
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,360
except for some lamb soup and flour.

666
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,880
Together with vinegar and pepper,

667
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,280
I cooked a bowl of thick soup.

668
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,800
My father used to
go on tours of inspection.

669
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,280
When he returned home,

670
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,000
my mother usually cooked this for him.

671
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,200
There's so much pepper.

672
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,280
It's delicious.

673
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,480
This thing is difficult to get.

674
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,480
I asked the merchants to bring it back
from the monopoly market of Guangzhou.

675
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,400
If it wasn't for you,

676
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,960
I wouldn't have put so much in it.

677
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:35,880
Is it good?

678
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,800
Yes.

679
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,160
It makes me feel warm all over.

680
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,640
Your compliment seems insincere.

681
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,000
It's May now. How cold could it be?

682
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,400
I really feel warm.

683
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,960
I really think it's delicious.

684
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,760
You should cook for me more.

685
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,280
I don't cook as well as Sanniang does.

686
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,360
No.

687
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,800
In my opinion, it's the most delicious.

688
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,240
I've been alone for a long time.

689
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,240
Now you're with me

690
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,960
and cook such delicious
pepper and chili soup for me,

691
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,640
I'm contented.

692
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,560
Come.

693
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,640
Lean over.

694
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:32,920
Hat demon.

695
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,480
You scared me.

696
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,480
It's a moth.

697
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,560
Where is the hat demon?

698
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,600
Did you see the hat demon?

699
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,720
Was it a real demon

700
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,560
or some crafty plot?

701
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,480
There's no real demon in the world.

702
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,280
Only inner demons cause disaster.

703
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,800
Well, I have something to show you.

704
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,880
I found this at the scene

705
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,600
where the hat demon showed up.

706
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,520
Silk?

707
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,200
Gunpowder?

708
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,640
Some evildoers made
a hat-shaped kite out of silk.

709
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,560
Every time when they fly the kite,

710
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,160
they kill lots of people.

711
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,080
People are scared.

712
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,920
When word spreads from one to ten,
ten to 100,

713
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,400
it becomes the hat demon.

714
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,640
They're so ruthless.

715
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,240
Does it
have anything to do with politics?

716
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,160
Do you remember when I told you

717
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,920
the ministers had formed
different cliques in the court?

718
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,080
His Majesty is in bad health.

719
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,400
The only prince
has been granted as king.

720
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,880
He's only 12

721
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,920
and can't manage the country,

722
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,320
so the Empress usually reads over
the memorials for His Majesty.

723
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,600
It aroused discontents
among many old ministers.

724
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,680
The other day,
Venus appeared in the day.

725
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,160
The prophecy that
"the Empress prospers" spread again.

726
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,480
So last time when I went to Qiantang,

727
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,840
on one hand, I was trying to find
the Night Revels;

728
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,360
on the other hand,

729
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,920
I was going to arrest the one
who made up the prophecy.

730
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,920
I got it.

731
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,840
The ancient books say

732
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,560
when abnormal omens frequently happen,
it implies the monarch loses his ethics

733
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,640
and Heaven is warning him.

734
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,280
His Majesty is a believer in Taoism.

735
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,160
So the prophecy and the hat demon

736
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,040
are aimed at the Empress.

737
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,360
They are afraid she'll become
the second Empress Wu Zetian.

738
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,760
The Empress is now high-powered.

739
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,760
Xiao Qinyan is coming to be

740
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,840
the Grand Secretary, too.

741
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,360
So, I don't think the Hat Demon

742
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,120
aims at civilians in the capital city.

743
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,240
It aims at officials
who support the Empress.

744
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,960
Does it have to do
with The Night Revels?
