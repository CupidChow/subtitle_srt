=Episode 11=

17
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,720
Why are there so many people?

18
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,320
Chen Lian, you've come back.

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,640
Boss.

20
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,760
Commander Gu, why are you here?

21
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,280
Are these foods for us?

22
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:09,960
These...

23
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,000
These were prepared by our boss.

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,680
Thank you, Commander Gu.

25
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,960
Put them down.

26
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,720
Hurry up.

27
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,760
Yinzhang, you know what?

28
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,560
Our boss

29
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,200
asked us to order them

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,000
for you from Yuezhou Pavilion.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,960
I've loved them since I was little.

32
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,920
Try them.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,560
Boss, why are you here?

34
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,680
These are all from Yuezhou Pavilion.

35
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,160
They make the best Jiangnan food

36
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,320
in the Eastern Capital.

37
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,280
You can try them.

38
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,360
Thank you for doing it.

39
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,080
Anytime.

40
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,600
Well,

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,520
I will go to the Office
to hand over my work.

42
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,840
I will keep investigating Ouyang Xu.

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,000
You can just have some rest here.

44
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,200
If you need anything,

45
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,160
tell Chen Lian.

46
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,680
Let's go.

47
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,480
Go, go, go.

48
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,440
Great, there're crisp cakes.

49
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,520
He's really thoughtful

50
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,080
to order Jiangnan food for us.

51
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,880
What's wrong? It tastes bad?

52
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,080
It tastes weird.

53
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,280
The potatoes are too roasted

54
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,200
and they're not cooked well.

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,640
The powder covering them

56
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,480
is puckery.

57
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,560
So people in the Eastern Capital
make Jiangnan food in this way.

58
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,320
No way, let me try.

59
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,040
Not bad.

60
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,520
But not good, either.

61
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,800
The waiter told me

62
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,480
that Yuezhou Pavilion

63
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,440
is one of the 72 official restaurants
in the Eastern Capital,

64
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,920
not something ordinary.

65
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,120
But the food they make

66
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,880
are not even comparable to mine.

67
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,680
I have an idea.

68
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,440
People in the inn love

69
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,760
Sanniang's desserts so much.

70
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,280
But her dishes are better
than her desserts.

71
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,680
How about

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
opening a restaurant
in the Eastern Capital?

73
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,840
Pan'er can be the manager.

74
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,560
Sanniang cooks.

75
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,270
I invite guests by playing pipa.

76
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,880
We can definitely earn our livings.

77
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,440
This is a good idea.

78
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,120
Last time you played pipa

79
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,280
in the inn,

80
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,440
lots of people came to watch.

81
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,840
It's good.

82
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,880
Forget it.

83
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,840
We are not familiar
with the Eastern Capital.

84
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,160
It's not easy to open a restaurant here.

85
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,240
Just eat them up.

86
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,320
I'll have to visit Ouyang Xu later.

87
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,520
- Visit him again?
- Visit him again?

88
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,600
Don't worry, I'm not going alone.

89
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,480
He wanted to get us out
of the capital today.

90
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,120
He must be happy now.

91
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,840
Like what is written
in Military Science of Sunzi,

92
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,080
I will knock him down by surprise.

93
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,320
You bent yourself too much just now

94
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,640
when you toasted.

95
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,040
Yes.

96
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,280
You're the Third Graduate.

97
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,920
You're going to be an officer.

98
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,840
The clean officers pay attention
to their integrity.

99
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,720
The sycophants are despised
by others.

100
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,640
(Gao Hu)
Today I take you to the feast

101
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,960
to teach you the rules of living.

102
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,640
I appreciate your guidance.

103
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,160
I'm not finished yet.

104
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,680
After meeting His Majesty
and getting a position,

105
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,800
Her Highness will ask for
the order of marriage.

106
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,960
The date of the wedding
has been decided.

107
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,360
16th of the next month.

108
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,240
A lucky day

109
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
that is suitable for marriage.

110
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,000
Where do you want to go?

111
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,120
I'm still young.

112
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,960
It's all up to you, Father.

113
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,440
How about Gongzhou?

114
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,280
Gongzhou is close
to the Eastern Capital.

115
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,160
Hui grew up in the Eastern Capital.

116
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,440
She can't live a hard life with you.

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,640
Three years later when you

118
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,960
come back to the capital,

119
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,920
you can be together

120
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,160
at that time.

121
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,440
Inspector Gao humiliated you.

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,400
How could the bride's family
decide the wedding date?

123
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,000
How could he decide your position?

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,840
Do you think

125
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,000
I haven't suffered enough tonight?

126
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,880
What do you want?

127
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,600
Pan'er.

128
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,400
Was he the one who bullied you?

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,960
Take the dog's dropping

130
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,520
and enjoy yourself.

131
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,240
Why am I here?

132
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,160
Because I figured out

133
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,520
you and the magistrate's plot.

134
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,240
You don't have

135
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,480
any one of the three stuff.

136
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,760
So you made a long short gamble

137
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,960
and tried to force us out of the capital

138
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,040
in this way.

139
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,160
Ouyang Xu.

140
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,840
You can rely on others, and so can I.

141
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,200
You play dirty tricks,
and I'll pay you back.

142
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,120
The reason I came here tonight

143
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,760
is that I hope you
still have a conscience.

144
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
The Night Revels

145
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,520
is related to the stunning case
in Jiangnan.

146
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,920
If you don't give the painting out

147
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,400
in three days,

148
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,400
Mr. Ouyang,

149
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,320
I assure you

150
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,120
that your position

151
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,040
will not be secured.

152
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,680
Ready?

153
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,320
Yes.

154
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,080
Hurry up.

155
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,280
Uncle De.

156
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,440
The doctor said
the assassin was cruel.

157
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,670
There're wounds
all over Uncle De's body.

158
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,280
His bones are not broken,

159
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,670
but hurt greatly.

160
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,920
He has to rest
for at least one or two years.

161
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,680
Shall I report it?

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,720
No.

163
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
You can go now.

164
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,240
Leave me alone.

165
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,320
Sir...

166
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,880
I said leave me alone.

167
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,280
OK.

168
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,240
The imperial envoy comes with an edict.

169
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,840
Imperial edict.

170
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,560
The top three graduates

171
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,880
come to the palace in the afternoon.

172
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,200
That's all.

173
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,560
Long live His Majesty.

174
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,040
Congrats, sir.

175
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,400
Thank you for coming at midnight.

176
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,920
Please stay and have a cup of tea.

177
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
Thank you for

178
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,200
coming at midnight.

179
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,960
You're welcome.

180
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,760
Now you've succeeded
in the Imperial Examination

181
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,360
and will be Empress Gao's
designated son-in-law,

182
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,040
you have a promising future.

183
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,880
I'd appreciate your guidance.

184
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,280
Just ask me

185
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,480
if you need anything.

186
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,880
Well,

187
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,480
I've heard

188
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,280
the case in Jiangnan

189
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,640
is serious.

190
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,440
You're well-informed.

191
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,720
I'm from Qiantang

192
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,120
and I'm meeting His Majesty
for the first time.

193
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,280
So,

194
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,560
I'm a bit worried that

195
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,480
His Majesty would…

196
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,000
Rest assured.

197
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,640
His Majesty won't

198
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,560
blame you anyway.

199
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,240
But this time,

200
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,480
His Majesty is really mad.

201
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,560
He didn't

202
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,960
eat anything yesterday.

203
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,120
Fortunately, there was the master
from Yuqing Palace

204
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,480
who persuaded him with the regimen.

205
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,520
Regimen?

206
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,520
This time,

207
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,000
perhaps several officers in the court

208
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,520
will be degraded.

209
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,800
Pan'er, isn't my idea good?

210
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,080
That guy must be so frightened.

211
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,520
It won't get you into trouble?

212
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,400
Don't worry.

213
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,200
There's no mark in the dagger.

214
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,800
Besides, when I beat that guy,

215
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,760
I used secret strength.

216
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,320
It won't show out.

217
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,480
Look at you.

218
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,240
Well, Pan'er.

219
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,240
If you think

220
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,080
I did a good job tonight,

221
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,320
could you please say something nice

222
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,480
about me to Commander?

223
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,040
After all, I'm a newcomer
to the Office.

224
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,040
Commander Gu is bad-tempered.

225
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,400
Well, you're both beautiful and kind.

226
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,400
You got to help me.

227
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,880
You don't seem to be afraid of him.

228
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,640
I forced the courage.

229
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,240
I just knew about it these days
by asking my colleagues.

230
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,680
If the Capital Security Office
is the hell,

231
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,720
Commander Gu will be the Living Devil.

232
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,040
People killed by him are
more than my hair.

233
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,400
I was born when my mother was
listening to the cross talk.

234
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,600
So I talk too much.

235
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,840
Don't take it seriously.

236
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,920
How about this?

237
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,120
If you keep the thing tonight secret,

238
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,040
I'll help you.

239
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,400
Keep it secret?

240
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,160
Well...

241
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,560
See you, Pan'er.

242
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,640
Gu Qianfan, you were serious.

243
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,440
You're really nicknamed
the Living Devil.

244
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,040
What have you done

245
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,200
to make people call you this way?

246
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,360
Let me check your wound.

247
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,920
What are you doing?

248
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,960
I have to check your wound by myself.

249
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,840
No need.

250
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,080
I'm alright now.

251
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,000
That's it.

252
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,960
I did that.

253
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,120
I know how it was.

254
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,520
You're alright now.

255
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,800
Why making a fuss?

256
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,560
How can you be so confident?

257
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,960
Don't forget that

258
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,760
you've put off my clothes on the boat.

259
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,440
That's different.

260
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,840
You were passed out then.

261
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,040
Let me stun you now.

262
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,520
I don't have so many rules like you.

263
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,800
Let me tell you,

264
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,840
when I torture the prisoners
in the Office,

265
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,000
I rip their clothes off

266
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,240
no matter for men or women.

267
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,320
Well, your explanations
are so meaningless.

268
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,880
Stop thinking about these nonsense.

269
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
Zhao Pan'er,

270
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,400
you're nothing but

271
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,200
an exiled person
depending on others for living.

272
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,840
Make it clear your identity.

273
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,560
Finding The Night Revels is
the top priority now.

274
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,680
Mr. Ouyang.

275
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,680
Thank you.

276
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,240
The palace looks so mighty.

277
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,240
I just lost my mind.

278
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,380
(Zichen Palace)

279
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,120
Stop.

280
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,500
Salute.

281
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,020
(Zichen Palace)

282
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,040
Master Tongxuan from Chengtian Temple

283
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,640
is respected by His Majesty.

284
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,540
He is awarded the sedan chair.

285
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,180
(Zichen Palace)

286
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,440
Wait a while, please.

287
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
(I don't kill scholars.)

288
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,000
(But I won't let them act wildly.)

289
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,440
(Pass my edict.)

290

is related to the stunning case
in Jiangnan.

293
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,240
If you don't give the painting out

294
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,840
in three days,

295
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,440
Mr. Ouyang, I assure you

296
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,200
that your position will not be secured.

297
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,400
Call Shen Jiayan

298
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,480
and another two scholars in.

299
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,440
Long live Your Majesty.

(Qian and Kun in Harmony)

Rise.

302
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,040
You're all knowledgeable scholars.

303
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,240
Today I won't test your knowledge.

304
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,160
Tell me what your hobbies are.

305
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,680
I know something about medicine.

306
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,360
OK.

307
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,160
Your Majesty,

308
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,440
I like music and art,

309
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,440
(Three Gods Worship)
and know a little about Go game.

(All Gods Under the Jade Empire)

311
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,960
Master Tongxuan from Chengtian Temple

312
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,440
is respected by His Majesty.

313

He is awarded the sedan chair.

Third Graduate,

315
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,040
I've heard about you from Empress Gao.

316
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,640
What's your hobby?

317
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,080
Your Majesty,

318
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,400
I don't have any hobby.

319
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,120
I only read Taoist texts

320
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,880
and study regimen.

321
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,520
Tell me,

322
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,520
what Taoist texts do you like?

323
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,800
I like Book of Dadongyu

324
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,080
and Book of Tranquility.

325
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,880
Besides, I remember the prose

326
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,520
composed by Minister Wang

327
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,760
when Your Majesty offered sacrifices
in Mount Tai:

328
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,840
The day before the sacrifice was
misty and windy

329
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,240
and it was unable to light candles.

330
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,840
When the ceremony began,
the wind stopped

331
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,640
and the sky was clear,
the candles were lightened.

332
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,360
Good.

333
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,920
There finally came a young man

334
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,680
who knows Taoism.

335
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,400
Yes.

336
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,360

planning to make a plaque
for the newly built Ziji Palace

339

and invite a master to be the host.

340
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,960
Now I need an edict.

341
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,400
Tell me,

342
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,800
how to compose it?

343
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,680
Could you please give me
the brush and ink?

344
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,760
OK.

345
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,420
(The master lives in the mountain.)

346
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,060
(The master lives in the mountain.)

347
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,120
The master lives in the mountain

348
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,800
and indulges his mind into the clouds.

349
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,480
People who know Tao

350
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,320
visit him.

351
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,680
Good.

352
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,520
Poetic writing.

353
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,840
You deserve to be the Third Graduate.

354
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,400
Third Graduate,

355
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,360
where do you want to take the position?

356
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,160
In ancient times,
Rongchengzi followed Yellow Emperor.

357
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,040
I want to be like him.

358
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,680
It's up to Your Majesty.

359
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,200
Well, I'll appoint you as

360
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,000
the Vice Envoy of Ziji Palace

361
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,160
to come to the Western Capital

362
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,280
and invite the master.

363
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,840
I'll accomplish the mission.

364
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
Since I'm the envoy,

365
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,240
I wish to go tomorrow

366
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,280
and work for Your Majesty.

367
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,200
Good. Good.

368
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:02,060
(Zichen Palace)

369
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,500
(Qian and Kun in Harmony)

370
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,360
Gu Qianfan caught

371
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,000
all the rumor makers

372
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,960
at the risk of his life,

373
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,480
and detected the private boat case
in Jiangnan,

374
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,600
getting rid of the evils
for our Great Song.

375
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,800
He's really a good officer.

376
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,240
Exactly.

377
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,400
Where are you from?

378
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,400
When did you
enter the Capital Security Office?

379
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,080
Your Majesty.

380
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,520
My ancestors were born
in the Eastern Capital.

381
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,600
My grandfather is Gu Shenyan,
the Minister of Rites.

382
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,400
My father is Gu Mingjing,
the Garden Manager.

383
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,360
I ranked the fifth in the Imperial Examination
in the year of Jiyou.

384
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,160
I was first appointed
the judger of Jizhou,

385
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,880
and entered
the Capital Security Office later.

386
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,760
You're Gu Shenyan's grandson

387
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,080
and a passer
of the Imperial Examination.

388
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,880
Why did you renounce the civil service

389
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
and join the Capital Security Office?

390
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,160
My father had once been
the governor of the North,

391
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,080
so I inherited his career.

392
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,960
For Your Majesty's information,

393
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,840
the shocking fire case

394
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,720
that occurred in Kaifeng in April,
the year of Yimao

395
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,840
was also solved by Gu Qianfan.

396
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,560
He was promoted to be
the commander then.

397
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,280
Good. Good.

398
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,680
You're good at
both literature and martial arts.

399
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,920
No wonder Minister Xiao

400
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,560
spoke highly of you in his memorial.

401
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,960
You've done a good job.

402
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,560
What do you want?

403
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,040
This case was solved
because of Commander Lei.

404
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,880
I dare not ask for anything.

405
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,880
But Jia Jiang

406
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,880
and other seven subordinates
of mine were sacrificed

407
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,400
in the mission.

408
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,600
If Your Majesty could do something
for them,

409
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,000
their family would be grateful.

410
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,800
What brotherly affection!

411
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,520
OK, pass my order.

412
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,120
Promote those who sacrificed this time

413
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,800
to the position of General Judges.

414
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,720
Award them.

415
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,560
Thanks, Your Majesty.

416
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,000
The criminals will be punished and
those who contributed will be praised.

417
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,520
Lei Jing

418
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,360
is promoted to be
the Magistrate of Mizhou

419
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,720
and work in the court,

420
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,360
still holding the position
in Capital Security Office.

421
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,920
Gu Qianfan

422
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,960
is promoted to be Deputy Commissioner

423
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,440
of Western Upper
Memorial Reception Staff.

424
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,840
Allow him to dress in red and
give him the silver fish pockets.

425
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,760
Long live Your Majesty.

426
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,400
Clam down, Father.

427
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,720
I'm no longer your father-in-law!

428
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,200
Father.

429
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,240
It's His Majesty's idea.

430
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,760
I dare not to go against him.

431
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,920
Normally the Third Graduate is offered
the Ninth Rank position.

432
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,160
I'm the Eighth Rank officer now.

433
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,520
It's all for Miss Hui's good.

434
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,120
I dare not claim
ties of kinship with you

435
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,600
who gets promoted by ghosts and gods.

436
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,040
Hui is not going to marry you

437
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,360
any more.

438
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,320
No, Father.

439
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,160
Miss, miss.

440
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,920
You can't do that.

441
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,960
- I must marry Ouyang.
- Pull her out.

442
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,800
Pull her out.

443
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,720
Father.

444
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,800
How can a girl rush in

445
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,400
with outer men in here?

446
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,400
Father.

447
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,520
Pull her out. Out!

448
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,880
Father, I'll only marry him!

449
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,480
Pull her out!

450
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,160
Father.

451
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,840
- I must marry Ouyang.
- OK, OK. Pull her out.

452
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,120
I must!

453
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:16,580
(Prudent In Business)

454
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,440
I'm the Fifth Rank officer now.

455
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,840
It's all thanks to you.

456
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,080
Don't mind the evil deeds

457
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
by the villains.

458
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,280
I have explained

459
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,920
the reasons to Minister Xiao.

460
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,120
I have no idea about

461
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,640
what you said.

462
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,120
Exactly.

463
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,520
Exactly.

464
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,040
Anyway,

465
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,320
now you're promoted by imperial order

466
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,880
to be the most important
military position

467
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,440
and the vice envoy of our office.

468
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,720
Therefore,

469
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,040
the detecting works

470
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,600
will be under your charge.

471
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,080
What do you think?

472
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,160
OK.

473
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,140
(Capital Security Office)

474
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,920
Well.

475
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,120
Remember,

476
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,480
you're a vice envoy now.

477
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,520
You're in a high position.

478
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,360
Don't do risky things

479
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,720
like in Jiangnan anymore.

480
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,320
Don't make us worry about you.

481
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,160
The Southern Office will be your office.

482
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,760
Yes, I'll leave now.

483
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,160
His Majesty gave him

484
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,080
the red uniform and fish pockets
that are exclusive to fifth-grade officials.

485
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,040
What good luck!

486
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,480
What?

487
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,160
Are you jealous?

488
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,000
If you can depend on Xiao Qinyan,

489
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,920
I can do it for you.

490
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,440
I dare not to.

491
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,280
I just feel sorry for you.

492
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,280
You treated him so well

493
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,440
for Minister Xiao's sake.

494
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,160
But he never paid back.

495
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,280
I almost killed him.

496
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,240
If he behaves like
nothing ever happened,

497
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,720
it would be dangerous.

498
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,560
Instead, he shows

499
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,000
no politeness to me now.

500
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,840
It means he's not an evil person.

501
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,480
Yes.

502
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,920
Don't violate him.

503
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,880
He won't do any harm to me.

504
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,320
But you, don't forget,

505
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,040
the Living Devil

506
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,960
can kill his friend Wan Qi

507
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,480
without hesitation.

508
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,880
Don't think you can act wildly

509
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,000
by deluding Hui.

510
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,280
If you're smart enough,

511
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,560
three months later,

512
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,920
find an excuse

513
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,160
to let the match-maker
cancel the marriage.

514
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,000
Otherwise,

515
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,800
if I heard anything unkind

516
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,600
about Hui,

517
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,320
I'll…

518
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,720
Get lost!

519
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,600
Calm down, Father.

520
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,120
I'll leave now.

521
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
Listen,

522
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,120
(Capital Security Office)
Commander Gu just got promoted.

523
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,400
He's your big boss.

524
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,320
I'm just inferior to him.

525
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,120
Clear?

526
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:50,720
Yes.

527
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,800
So, all of you,

528
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,480
spirit up.

529
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,760
Anyway,

530
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,720
clarify anything about

531
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,960
Ouyang Xu, no matter big or trivial.

532
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,840
But…

533
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,360
What? Is there anything wrong?

534
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,560
He's the Monastic officer
in the Western Capital now.

535
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,720
What?

536
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,680
He's only the Third Graduate,

537
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,680
and he volunteered to be
the Monastic officer in the Western Capital?

538
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,280
What's wrong with him?

539
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,600
Exactly.

540
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,440
What is a Monistic officer?

541
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,320
Monistic officer.

542
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,080
Mastic office.

543
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:20,840
Monistic officer.

544
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,880
No, it's Mastic office.

545
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,880
Monistic officer.

546
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,160
Monistic officer.

547
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:27,920
Monistic…

548
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,920
Officer.

549
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,880
Girls, it's Monastic officer.

550
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,720
Monastic officer.

551
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,160
What's that?

552
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,720
Has Ouyang Xu become a eunuch?

553
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,200
A Monastic officer

554
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
is the officer governing the temple.

555
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,960
And...

556
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,720
Normally,

557
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,680
they write some texts

558
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,640
and collect the scriptures.

559
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,720
How do you know?

560
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,760
I've seen them

561
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,960
in Qiantang County

562
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,160
when the Princess Qian held a feast.

563
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,520
People despise them.

564
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,240
They could only sit on the sideway

565
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,200
and can't even sit on the seat.

566
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,000
Exactly.

567
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,680
So, we all believe

568
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,080
there must be something wrong
with Ouyang Xu.

569
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,080
How could this be?

570
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,240
Mr. Du, you have no idea that

571
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,520
Pan'er pushed me so hard.

572
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,040
I have no other way to deal with it.

573
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,680
So, I made this plan

574
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,280
under the emergency

575
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,640
to leave the Eastern Capital.

576
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,600
Mr. Du.

577
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,160
I want to know

578
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,000
if I take the position
of Monistic officer,

579
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,680
will I be despised all my life

580
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,480
in the court?

581
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,040
Those clear officers

582
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,320
hate those who please His Majesty

583
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,440
and practice Taoism the most.

584
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,920
You're

585
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,840
a Presented Scholar.

586
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,840
It means betrayal for them.

587
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,160
You're ruining your future.

588
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,920
You're the courtier

589
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,720
associated with Xiao Qinyan.

590
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,400
Your career

591
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,480
is almost ruined.

592
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,720
Not almost.

593
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,720
Now,

594
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,760
the Gaos don't want me
as their son-in-law.

595
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,840
How could you be so mad?

596
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,160
He's not mad.

597
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,640
He's too afraid

598
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,920
so he took risky steps.

599
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,920
Last night when he saw us,

600
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,200
he was surprised and scared.

601
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,720
He's afraid that I'd reveal
our regret of engagement,

602
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,200
and he'd get involved
in Zheng Qingtian's case

603
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,320
and The Night Revels

604
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,040
just like what I said.

605
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,080
Therefore,

606
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,040
he'd rather run away.

607
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,440
Because Pan'er

608
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,600
wanted me to finish the three things

609
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,120
that I can't do.

610
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,920
Then Monastic officer
is still an officer anyway.

611
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,280
It's better than a civilian.

612
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,040
This woman is really despicable.

613
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,480
I was mean to her first.

614
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,840
I wasted three years of hers

615
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,600
and broke the engagement.

616
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,440
But now,

617
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,320
I've paid her back with my career.

618
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,280
We don't owe each other anymore.

619
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,640
He's gambling on
whether we will reveal the secrets.

620
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,680
We don't have any receipt

621
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,280
or a marriage contract.

622
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,920
His Majesty believes in Taoism.

623
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,960
Though we can rely on

624
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,640
someone powerful,

625
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,080
if we sue the envoy
appointed by His Majesty,

626
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,120
we may offend His Majesty.

627
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,720
Although we

628
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,920
stay in the Eastern Capital now,

629
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,280
we're women anyway.

630
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,360
We're not likely to travel
to the Western Capital.

631
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,080
Exactly.

632
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,880
Even if you go,

633
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,000
he can handle you easily.

634
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,040
There are no Dali Temple and the Gaos

635
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,000
in the Western Capital.

636
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,640
He can just prevent you
from entering the Taoist temple

637
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,200
or put you into prison

638
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,360
with an excuse.

639
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,000
You have no way to deal with it.

640
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,560
However,

641
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,600
if you stay in the Eastern Capital

642
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,920
with no relatives

643
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,080
and a job,

644
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,240
how do you survive?

645
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,480
The Monastic officer
is not a local officer.

646
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,230
He has no tenure.

647
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,000
If he knows that

648
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,190
you leave the Eastern Capital,

649
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,800
he can come to his father-in-law

650
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,190
and plead His Majesty.

651
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,710
Then, he can come back

652
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,880
and continue his career.

653
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,320
Pan'er,

654
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,800
he's really evil.

655
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,670
Why were you so blind

656
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,760
and fell in love with him?

657
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,840
What should we do now?

658
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,960
We should stick to our plan

659
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,040
and don't be disturbed by the opponent.

660
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,880
The reason why he left the capital

661
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,800
is that he believed

662
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,710
we wouldn't stay here for long.

663
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,520
But what if we will

664
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:43,400
and go against his plan?

665
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,880
Good idea.

666
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,230
Let's just stay

667
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,520
in the Eastern Capital,

668
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,230
coping with all motions
by remaining motionless.

669
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,440
I don't believe that

670
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,960
Ouyang Xu will stay away
from the Eastern Capital all his life.

671
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,160
Just do what we planned last night.

672
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,400
Pan'er will be the manager.

673
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,480
Sanniang the cook.

674
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,360
I'll be the waitress.

675
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,800
I have the money Zhou She paid me

676
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,880
and it can be used as the capital
to open a hotel.

677
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,880
No way.

678
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
A delicate lady like you

679
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,160
can't run a hotel.

680
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,040
Let's do our original business.

681
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,880
Open a teahouse.

682
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,600
A teahouse?

683
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,280
A teahouse can be opened anywhere.

684
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,240
Pan'er will take charge of the drinks.

685
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,120
I'll be responsible for the desserts.

686
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,080
We could make a living in Qiantang.

687
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,320
How could we starve to death

688
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,520
in the Eastern Capital?

689
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,200
Exactly.

690
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,880
Opening a teahouse is easier
than running a hotel.

691
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,480
There won't be smoke and fire.

692
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,520
It's easier to serve the drinks.

693
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:37,960
What's more,

694
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,680
we don't need a big storefront,

695
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,160
but just a small workshop.

696
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,000
We only have to establish a booth

697
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,560
and put some tables and chairs.

698
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,760
It's more natural and interesting

699
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,280
and won't cost a lot.

700
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,400
Today, I walked around.

701
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,120
I found the Horse Street was good.

702
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,040
There's no other teahouse

703
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,160
and it is quite busy.

704
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,360
It's also close to our place.

705
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,360
Girls,

706
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,880
what on earth are you going to do?

707
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,120
Do business.

708
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,120
Make money.

709
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,400
Feed ourselves.

710
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,720
You said that

711
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,240
it's hard for us women to live

712
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,120
in the Eastern Capital without a job.

713
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,440
We were famous in Qiantang.

714
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,360
What if we earn our fame

715
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,360
in the Eastern Capital
by running a teahouse?

716
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,160
Girls, this is the Eastern Capital.

717
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,240
It's not that easy.

718
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,120
Mr. Du.

719
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm going to leave the capital tomorrow.

720
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,200
You don't have to see me off.

721
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,760
But I wish you could take care of

722
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,200
my assets and servants

723
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,960
in the Eastern Capital.

724
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,720
Of course.

725
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,520
Rest assured.

726
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,000
No matter how things change,

727
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,800
you'll still be my good friend.

728
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,320
We're always friends
no matter life or death.

729
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,120
Try my tea.

730
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,080
Come on, try my cakes.

731
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,440
What do you think?

732
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,800
Do you think we can open a teahouse?

733
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:45,800
Yes.

734
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,480
Can I eat them all?

735
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,480
As long as you can help us.

736
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,520
We're unfamiliar
with the Eastern Capital.

737
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,280
We need your guidance to

738
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,480
find a place and buy the materials.

739
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,240
No problem.

740
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,520
I'll help you.

741
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,860
(Fengqiu Gate)

742
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,680
Excuse me. Excuse me.

743
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,200
Take your time.

744
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,340
(Wine)

745
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,600
Could it be cheaper?

746
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,520
Sachets, pendants.

747
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,080
Come next time.

748
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,360
Take it.

749
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:41,220
(The house is renting)

750
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,200
Is it for rent?

751
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,440
Yes.

752
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,760
What's the rent for a month?

753
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,240
30 strings per month.

754
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,080
30 strings?

755
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,120
It's too expensive. Could it be cheaper?

756
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,480
Each penny counts. Just take a look.

757
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,720
(Jinghua School)
(In the East Market she buys a steed.)

758
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,800
- (From the West Market she buys a saddle.)
- Sir.

759
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,000
- (From the South Market she buys a bridle.)
- Sir.

760
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,920
(In the North Market
she buys a long whip.)

761
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,080
(Jinghua School)
(At dawn she bids her family farewell.)

762
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,120
(At dusk she camps by the Yellow River.)

763
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,760
(She no longer hears
her parents calling.)

764
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,400
Take a look.

765
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,320
OK, thank you.

766
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,000
Take a look at this.

767
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,960
And this.

768
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,040
Well, and this.

769
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,640
This is also good.

770
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,320
Ouyang.

771
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,000
Miss Hui.

772
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,400
You gave me this

773
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,360
when we got engaged.

774
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,760
I thought

775
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,480
it would be better
if I give it back to you myself.

776
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,360
Ouyang, I didn't mean that.

777
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
You can't

778
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,480
marry the biggest laughing stock
in the capital.

779
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,000
Honey.

780
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,440
Ouyang Xu.

781
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,120
You, you...

782
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,440
What are you doing?

783
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,560
Miss.

784
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,360
- Nanny.
- Miss.

785
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,520
Miss Hui, I have my last words.

786
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,760
I won't fail you.

787
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,200
Go away and never return.

788
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,000
Sweetie, let's go.

789
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:31,920
Go, go, go.

790
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,280
Go away.

791
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,360
Go, Miss.

792
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,000
Go.

793
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,200
It's the first time

794
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,800
I've seen you in scarlet.

795
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,720
You look fresh.

796
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,480
Can I touch it?

797
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,640
The silver fish pocket is lovely.

798
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,600
If I could be like you,

799
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,200
my mother and two sisters

800
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,040
would be thrilled.

801
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,560
Commander,

802
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,800
no, Deputy Commissioner.

803
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,040
When do you think I can put this on?

804
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,840
Military leader doesn't
have an official rank.

805
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,400
If you don't risk your life

806
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,640
and work step by step,

807
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,240
it will take about 30 or 40 years.

808
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,360
I'd better not risk my life.

809
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,760
Working for you,

810
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,920
I won't suffer any loss.

811
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,640
Those who worked for me all died.

812
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,520
