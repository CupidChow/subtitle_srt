Stop.

26
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,220
(Officer Kong Wu of the Intelligence Agency
of the Capital Security Office)

27
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,360
It's such a rebellious rumor.

28
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,800
Who asked you to make it up?

29
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,160
I'll confess!

30
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,120
I'll confess!

31
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,200
I'll confess everything!

32
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,040
Put him down.

33
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,600
I'll confess.

34
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,920
The man behind us is

35
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,240
Wei Ying, Magistrate of Renhe County.

36
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,040
He said the Empress
lost her virginity a long time ago

37
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,640
and has deceived His Majesty
for a dozen years.

38
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,360
The painting is proof.

39
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,680
What painting?

40
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,520
What painting?

41
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,680
Where is it?

42
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,240
Where is the painting?

Gu...

Gu Qianfan.

45
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,520
Living Devil.

46
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,560
He's the Living Devil!

47
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,380
(Commander Gu Qianfan
of the Intelligence Agency)

48
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,070
(of the Capital Security Office)
Now that you recognized me,

49
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,120
(of the Capital Security Office)
tell me everything.

50
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
It's-It's in Qiantang County.

51
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,380

Qianfan, Qianfan.

54
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,440
Commissioner.

55
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,800
You're worthy of your reputation
as the Living Devil.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,360
You even flattened the suspect.

57
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,270
You flatter me. Thank you.

58
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,510
Don't be too modest.

59
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,640
His accomplice

60
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,308
(Commissioner Lei Jing)
confessed many clues.

61
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:25,680
(of the Capital Security Office)
confessed many clues.

62
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,840
You must be capable enough

63
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,880
to get to the bottom

64
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,400
of this case, right?

65
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm just getting ready

66
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,160
for a trip to Jiangnan Region.
[*South of the Yangtze River]

67
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,320
Qianfan, come.

68
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,200
I trust you more than anyone.

69
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,520
The Empress is a motherly model
of the nation.

70
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,240
Having assisted His Majesty for years,

71
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,880
she's incomparably virtuous.

72
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,988
(Officer Yu Zhongquan)
But upright officials

73
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:47,880
(of the Capital Security Office)
But upright officials

74
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,960
always find her exasperating.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,160
Shall I

76
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,160
bring back the painting

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,120
or shall I destroy it there?

78
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,440
Bring it back, of course.

79
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,160
But you must keep it secret.

80
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,320
It's the privacy
of Her Majesty, after all.

81
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,040
The fewer who know
about this, the better.

82
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,440
As for all the officials involved,

83
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,880
keep their mouths shut, too.

84
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,400
Aye.

85
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,680
Anyway, go forth and check it out.

86
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,840
Remember, we only take orders
from His Majesty

87
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,400
to investigate all kinds of misconduct.

88
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
We're neither affiliated to the Censorate
nor restrained by the Imperial Guards.

89
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,120
If anyone does not cooperate,

90
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,160
show him what you can do
as the Living Devil.

91
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,040
If you solve the case successfully,

92
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,560
I promise you'll have a great future.

93
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,880
I'll get packed and set off immediately.

94
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,640
All right.

95
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,580
(Qiantang County)

96
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,220
(Zhao Pan'er,
landlady of Zhao's Teahouse)

97
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,440
(Peach trees have blossomed.)

98
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,520
(Ouyang,)

99
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,760
(why haven't you come back yet?)

100
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,020
(Sun Sanniang, wife
of the next-door merchant)

101
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,360
Pan'er!

102
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,480
Sanniang.

103
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,160
I made some Luming cakes this morning.

104
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,800
I used osmanthus honey,

105
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,560
as a blessing for success
in the Imperial Examination.

106
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,560
Taste some and see if they're good.

107
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
I don't need to taste any.

108
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
All cakes you sell in my teahouse

109
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,600
can be sold out within half a day.

110
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,200
Customers say they like the tea I make.

111
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
But actually, most of them

112
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,600
visit my teahouse for your cakes.

113
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,360
Come on.

114
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,000
You're even more honey-lipped
than the osmanthus honey.

115
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,000
If I weren't your neighbor
for nearly nine years,

116
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,040
I would believe you.

117
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,740
(Delicate Fragrance)

118
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,920
God of Fame and Wealth,

119
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
please bless Ouyang.

120
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,840
Hope he won't fail
the Imperial Examination again.

121
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,880
He used to fail

122
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,280
because he had bad luck.

123
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,120
But since you saved his life,

124
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,000
you've taken good care of him

125
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,680
like a maid for three years.

126
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,400
He's no longer unlucky.

127
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,800
You'll see.

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,160
I'm not only

129
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,760
a good judge of pigs,

130
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,920
but also persons.

131
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,960
This time, Ouyang

132
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,340
(Zhao's Teahouse)
will certainly succeed.

133
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,080
(Zhao's Teahouse)
Not a maid, but a soulmate.

134
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,000
Sounds similar.

135
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,560
(Tea is Served)
Shall we compete today?

136
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,160
Let's see which will be sold first,

137
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,880
your tea or my cakes?

138
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,120
Bring it on.

139
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,560
Good morning, Ms. Zhao.

140
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,640
A pot of Xieyuan Tea, please.

141
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,720
- All right.
- No problem.

142
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,800
I won.

143
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,480
You did.

144
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,120
Who dares to be luckier
than Mrs. Ouyang,

145
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,080
the bride-to-be of a Presented Scholar?

146
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,520
How many times have I told you that?

147
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,160
Do not tell anyone else
about my relationship with Ouyang.

148
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,680
Scholars care about reputations most.

149
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,800
In Qiantang County, a lot of people know

150
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,960
what I used to be.

151
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,280
Don't worry too much.

152
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,080
After he takes you
to the Eastern Capital,

153
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,760
and marries you,

154
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,600
you'll always stay at home.

155
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,880
Who can recognize you, then?

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,150
That's exactly my plan.

157
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,400
So, I bought some farmlands
in my homeland.

158
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,600
When I'm in the Eastern Capital,

159
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,840
I'll be Ms. Zhao from Dengzhou.

160
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,880
Oh, you've got a plan already.

161
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,720
Then why were you worried

162
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,000
that Mr. Ouyang might fail?

163
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,360
What would you like, sirs?

164
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,080
A pot of Xieyuan Tea, please.

165
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,640
Xieyuan Tea.

166
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,240
Some Bean Cakes, please.

167
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,320
All right. Some Bean Cakes.

168
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,960
Someone ordered your cakes. Bean Cakes.

169
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,920
Got it.

170
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,800
Sirs, come in, please.

171
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,680
Thank you.

172
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,110
Come on.

173
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,000
Enjoy it, please.

174
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,240
Someone ordered your Bean Cakes.

175
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,160
Pan'er,

176
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,600
I heard girls in the Eastern Capital

177
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,000
can be very straightforward.

178
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,440
When you're there, you'll feel at home.

179
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,240
Ouyang told me

180
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,280
that there isn't a curfew
in the Eastern Capital.

181
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,160
The city is illuminated
throughout the night.

182
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,080
My husband went there once.

183
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,600
He told me

184
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,120
that girls in the Eastern Capital are

185
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,000
beautifully groomed just like fairies.

186
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,960
There are hundreds of colors

187
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,520
for lipsticks and face powder in stores.

188
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,800
The girls' clothes are

189
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,080
even stitched with gold threads.

190
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,480
You don't need to imagine.

191
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,760
You'll be there soon.

192
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,200
What cakes would you like?

193
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,120
Do you have Peach Blossom Cakes?

194
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,200
Yes.

195
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,400
Good tea is served here.

196
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,480
The new Perilla Drink

197
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,440
also tastes great.

198
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,000
Look.

199
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,400
This is the new Perilla Drink
Ms. Zhao just invented.

200
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,080
Enjoy the drink, please.

201
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,800
Commander, do you
find this teahouse noisy?

202
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,790
(Jia)
I heard that you love drinking tea.

203
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,080
(Jia)
It's the best teahouse in Qiantang County.

204
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,480
Here are good tea and delicious cakes.

205
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,480
The landlady is gorgeous, too.

206
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,920
Quite outstanding.

207
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,440
What is she doing?

208
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,360
The Tea Art, I guess.

209
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,520
It is.

210
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,040
How vivid!

211
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,800
That's right.

212
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,960
Kind of great.

213
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,400
Peach Blossom Cakes.

214
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,520
Thank you.

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,960
Here's your tea.

216
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,080
Ma'am, two cups of Fengsui Tea.

217
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,840
Be right there.

218
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,600
Here's your tea.

219
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,840
Plum Preserves.

220
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,560
They taste better with Ginger Salt.

221
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,040
Thank you, ma'am.

222
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,520
The gorgeous landlady?

223
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,720
A rural woman like her

224
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,920
can't be as beautiful

225
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
as young ladies in the capital city.

226
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,040
When you're done with this case,

227
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,920
I'll put you back in the Eastern Capital

228
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,720
so that you'll have better taste.

229
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,680
Really?

230
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,680
Thank you, thank you.

231
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,480
Let's get down to business.

232
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,240
Didn't that suspect confess

233
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,160
that Transport Assistant Yang Zhiyuan

234
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,720
of Liangzhe Region
[*Including 14 states and two military regions]

235
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,320
had The Night Revels?
[*Name of the painting]

236
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,680
Why haven't you got the painting yet?

237
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,080
Sorry, Commander.

238
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,640
But you asked me

239
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,920
to keep it as secret as possible

240
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,240
because it's the imperial privacy.

241
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,920
As far as I've investigated,

242
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,200
Yang Zhiyuan inadvertently
collected this painting,

243
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,520
without knowing the secret in it.

244
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,200
He is a high official

245
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,720
and quite stubborn.

246
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,760
If I broke into his house
and asked for the painting,

247
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,840
he would probably make a scene.

248
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,400
So, I had planned to sneak in
and steal the painting.

249
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,760
Unfortunately, he keeps it so secretly.

250
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,040
I failed to find it at all.

251
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,520
Stop!

252
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,380
(Zhao's Teahouse)

253
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,040
Stop running!

254
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,240
- Stop!
- After them!

255
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,800
- Put your blades down!
- Don't get any closer.

256
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,520
Put your blades down!

257
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,360
- Don't move.
- Stay back, all of you!

258
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,000
- Don't move.
- Don't move. Freeze.

259
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,160
Put your blades down!

260
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,680
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

261
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,840
Freeze, all of you!

262
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,240
Behave!

263
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,640
Stay back!

264
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,360
Put your blades down.

265
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,320
If you get any closer,

266
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,560
I'll kill them all.

267
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,440
Stop!

268
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,840
Put your blades down.

269
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,640
One, two...

270
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,720
Get up.

271
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Put your daggers down.

272
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,600
Get out of the teahouse!

273
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,520
Don't hurt people
and you can name anything you want.

274
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,800
We want five swift horses.

275
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,880
Don't kill me. I've got a lot of money.

276
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,800
Where is it?

277
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,520
Over there.

278
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,480
Go.

279
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,760
Sanniang, the copper basin.

280
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,280
Pan'er!

281
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,720
No, no, no, sir.

282
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,920
Come on, it hurts!

283
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,160
Thank you.

284
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,040
What did you scream for?

285
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,120
- Come over!
- Your breastbones are good.

286
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,160
Your thigh bones aren't broken, either.

287
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,760
Though your shanks just fractured,

288
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,800
you're not going to die.

289
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,640
You untaxed salt dealers,

290
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,960
you were just unlucky
to run into Sanniang.

291
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,560
She used to be a butcher.

292
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,960
She could have castrated you.

293
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,880
You seem to do martial arts.

294
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,160
Where are you from?

295
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,120
Tell me your name.

296
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,280
Don't be rude.

297
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,080
Sir, please stay.

298
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,960
Thank you for saving my life.

299
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,320
I can offer nothing in return,

300
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,400
but a cup of tea.

301
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,840
This is Lingyin Buddha Tea
of Qiantang County.

302
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,320
The annual yield is only ten liang.
[*Equals 500 grams]

303
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,840
Please have a taste.

304
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,720
You can't do martial arts.

305
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,040
But you still helped them.

306
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,800
If you were hurt or dead,

307
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,400
wouldn't you regret it?

308
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,720
I wouldn't.

309
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,520
Once I make a decision,

310
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,040
however it ends up,

311
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,120
I will not regret it.

312
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,800
Capital Security Office?

313
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,920
You don't look like someone
from the Capital Security Office.

314
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,480
You have to come with me.

315
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,980
(Capital Security Office)
Open your eyes and look carefully.

316
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,140
(Capital Security Office)

317
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,400
Sorry I didn't recognize you.

318
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,680
Please forgive me.

319
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,000
You may rise.

320
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,880
Get back to your own case.

321
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,120
I didn't mean to spill it.

322
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,240
I beg your pardon.

323
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,760
Never mind. Get me another cup of tea.

324
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,160
It's precious.

325
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,760
This is all I have.

326
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,320
Then, make some more.

327
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,160
I'm not finding an excuse,

328
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,440
but when the intruders were here,

329
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,590
they knocked over the stove.

330
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,310
This was the only water available.

331
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,880
The spring water is gone, too.

332
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,110
If you're really thirsty,

333
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,240
another teahouse is right over there.

334
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,640
When the water is gone,
go get some more.

335
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,280
When the stove is off, light it.

336
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,680
I insist on having some tea here.

337
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,200
If the tea you make doesn't taste good,

338
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,110
why not stop your business?

339
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,280
I'll have your teahouse torn now.

340
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,560
What do you think?

341
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,680
Oh my goodness.

342
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,680
He's from the Capital Security Office.

343
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,200
Why did you mess with him?

344
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,960
I just don't want them
to enjoy the tea I make.

345
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,800
It was the officers
of the Capital Security Office

346
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,080
who broke into my home
in the middle of the night.

347
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,840
It's been 14 years.

348
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,160
When I saw the Lion-head Token,

349
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,560
I just...

350
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,760
What are you adding to the tea?

351
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,600
Don't do anything stupid.

352
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,600
This is just sugar.

353
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,000
Don't worry.

354
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,960
I've got ways to torture them.

355
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,560
I told the chief alone

356
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,320
about our identities.

357
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,560
But rest assured, Commander.

358
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,080
I warned him

359
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,120
not to tell anyone else.

360
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,160
Dragon and Phoenix Ball Tea.

361
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,400
Pear and Peach Preserves.

362
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,440
Carved Preserves.

363
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,880
Mung Bean Cakes.

364
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,000
Snakes and wasps are poisonous,

365
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,040
but women can be worse.

366
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,280
Evil woman, how dare you
poison us in public?

367
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,280
Sir, what are you talking about?

368
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,120
I swear with my life

369
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,320
that the tea isn't poisonous.

370
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,440
If you don't believe me,

371
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,600
this is a silver hairpin.

372
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,440
Test the tea with it.

373
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,040
Dragon and Phoenix Ball Tea.

374
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,040
Pear and Peach Preserves.

375
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,760
Carved Preserves.

376
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,560
The preserves

377
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,720
seem to be ordinary sweets.

378
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,240
The smartest dish is this one.

379
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,360
Mung Bean Cakes.

380
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,040
People usually have such cakes with tea

381
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,960
unless they're brainless.

382
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,720
Dragon and Phoenix Ball Tea is named

383
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,440
for the Dragon-brain Leaves in it.
[*Dragon-brain Leaves: Dipterocarpus]

384
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,560
Dragon-brain Leaves taste bitter
while the mung is cold-natured.

385
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,680
Once I drink and eat together,

386
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,640
I will be all right at the moment.

387
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,320
But in four or five hours,

388
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,160
I'm afraid I'll be very sick
with diarrhea and vomiting.

389
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,200
I don't get your point.

390
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,360
I can't predict things.

391
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,320
How did I know

392
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,680
you would order Bean Cakes?

393
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,920
When you fought the intruders,

394
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,640
the move you used to avoid their blades

395
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,360
came from Luyao Dance.

396
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,160
As far as I know,

397
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,760
most of these dancers

398
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,120
can't be decent.

399
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,520
Also, when you

400
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,280
brought drinks to your customers,

401
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,600
you deliberately coquetted.

402
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,840
No offense,

403
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,400
but which brothel did you work in?

404
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,280
I'm a common woman.

405
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,000
Don't talk nonsense.

406
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,440
Sounds like she was a pariah.

407
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,120
Very well. Tell me
about your experiences.

408
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,640
Now that you hate
the Capital Security Office,

409
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,480
you must know our jobs.

410
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,880
If you're honest,

411
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,560
I'll let you go for now.

412
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,120
But if you lie or hide anything,

413
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,960
I assure you,

414
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,080
in less than three days,

415
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,840
everyone in Qiantang County
will be familiar

416
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,840
with whatever you have done.

417
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,720
I'm Zhao Pan'er,

418
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,240
24 years old.

419
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,440
I'm from Dengzhou.

420
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,120
At the age of nine, I was an official slave
because of my father's guilt.

421
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,120
I served as a music performer
in Hangzhou Music Bureau.

422
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,680
When I was 16,
the Governor announced an amnesty

423
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,920
and I was no longer a music performer.

424
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,200
Enough.

425
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,840
I know you're not
an ignorant rural woman.

426
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,720
But an unbending tree is easily broken.

427
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,400
I hope you can understand that.

428
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,200
Learn your lesson.

429
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,480
We should go.

430
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,660
(Tea is Served)

431
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,920
Don't take that personally.

432
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,200
Pretend he was talking nonsense.

433
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,640
I'm fine with that.

434
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,600
I was a pariah, so what?

435
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,560
It was my fate,

436
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,200
but it wasn't my fault.

437
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,840
At the pariah status, I was chaste

438
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,240
and I didn't sell my body.

439
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,800
When I'm a civilian,
I sell tea for a living,

440
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,200
instead of abandoning myself to vice.

441
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,760
I don't feel shameful at all.

442
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,200
What a filthy woman!

443
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,800
She's way too offensive!

444
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,560
Commander,

445
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,200
should I...

446
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,680
Gorgeous.

447
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,400
Rural woman.

448
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,160
Evil woman.

449
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,560
Filthy woman.

450
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,720
You indeed have a broad vocabulary.

451
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,000
This is where you stop.

452
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Do not make trouble for her.

453
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,960
You just heard her, right?

454
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,280
She was made a pariah
because of her father's guilt.

455
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,560
Under such circumstances,

456
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,480
she's very likely to be
the daughter of a guilty official.

457
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,800
She changed her attitude abruptly.

458
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,880
I guess her family were captured

459
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,920
by guards
of the Capital Security Office.

460
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,960
No wonder she doesn't behave

461
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,680
like an ordinary woman.

462
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,680
So, she was from an official family.

463
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,660
(Fu Zifang, Sanniang's son)

464
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,480
Nice kick, Ms. Zhao!

465
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,800
Fu Zifang, how dare you
skip classes again!

466
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,600
Come on. Come and hit me.

467
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,200
You can't get me.

468
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,800
How dare you still run!

469
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,200
Don't you dare!

470
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,120
Stop.

471
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:03,760
How dare you run!

472
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,440
You play truant every day!

473
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,240
Pan'er!

474
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,040
Yinzhang.

475
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,760
I heard your teahouse was broken into

476
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,800
and then I rushed over.

477
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,800
Are you all right?

478
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,340
(Zhao's Teahouse)

479
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,260
(Zhao's Teahouse)
Yinzhang.

480
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,040
(Zhao's Teahouse)
Yinping.

481
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,960
Who is this?

482
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,920
(Zhou She, Song Yinzhang, Yinping)

483
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,600
This is Zhou She.

484
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,840
In case I got too worried,

485
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,880
he dropped me off.

486
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,640
Zhou She?

487
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,560
I'm Zhou She.
Nice to meet you, Ms. Zhao.

488
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,080
Every day,

489
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,880
Yinzhang talks about you
at least ten times.

490
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,880
Ms. Zhao,

491
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,440
you're indeed bright and special.

492
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,680
Step in, please.

493
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,400
Let me help you.

494
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,460
(Zhao's Teahouse)
(Tea is Served)

495
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,680
Who's that man?

496
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,600
Yinzhang met him 15 days ago.

497
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,040
A lot of tea sets were broken.

498
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,920
What a pity!

499
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,640
Pan'er.

500
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,960
I know famous porcelain merchants
in Qiantang County.

501
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,520
If you need...

502
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,400
Don't bother.

503
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,560
I'm just doing small business.

504
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,520
Certainly nothing that would
require your thumb.

505
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,600
Come here, please.

506
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,960
Zhou She, be seated.

507
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,080
Today, we're here

508
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,880
because we have something to tell you.

509
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,200
According to Yinzhang,

510
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,080
you're like her real sister.

511
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,200
I had a crush on her

512
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,280
and I love her deeply.

513
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,160
So, I came to propose marriage.

514
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,880
My family has been doing business
in Huaiyang for generations,

515
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,160
trading fur products.

516
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,360
I have a dozen stores,
nearly a hundred servants,

517
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,200
and several houses.

518
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,280
If you kindly allow us to get married,

519
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,000
I will treat her as my lifetime treasure

520
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,920
and love her forever.

521
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,840
No. You can't marry him.

522
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,280
Yinzhang, you're still young

523
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,200
and you only focus on pipa playing.
[*Pipa: a plucked string instrument]

524
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,240
I told you how to judge people.

525
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,320
But I guess

526
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,840
you've never kept it in mind.

527
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,400
According to Yinping,

528
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,840
you've known Mr. Zhou

529
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,520
for even less than 15 days.

530
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,320
Think about it.

531
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,360
He's a traveling merchant

532
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,480
and he has seen
all kinds of beautiful girls.

533
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,520
Why did he have a crush on you
at first sight?

534
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,880
It's just our fate.

535
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,880
Yinzhang and I fell in love
because of a song.

536
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,760
Exactly.

537
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,240
That day, I was upset,

538
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
so I played the Song of Wang Zhaojun.
[*Wang Zhaojun: Famous beautiful girl in history]

539
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,040
He heard the song from afar on the lake

540
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,880
and then he played the flute with me.

541
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,200
Then we got to know each other.

542
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,120
Pan'er,

543
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,280
Zhou She is my soulmate.

544
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,000
What follows "She left the palace
for the desert desolate"?

545
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,800
He doesn't even know Du Fu's poem.
[*Du Fu: A famous poet of the Tang Dynasty]

546
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,920
What makes him your soulmate?

547
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,120
Such easy tricks for the demimonde

548
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,240
can only fool girls like you.

549
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,920
Pan'er, Zhou She isn't that kind of man.

550
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,960
Look how he's holding the teacup.

551
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,400
With his middle finger and thumb.

552
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,960
It's how a gambler holds the dice.

553
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,760
He also has the smell
of Freshening Incense.

554
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,280
This kind of incense

555
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,440
can only be afforded
in the costliest brothels.

556
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,840
He's good at playing the flute?

557
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,840
What kind of rich merchant

558
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,360
has time to play the flute?

559
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,560
He's nothing,

560
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,080
but a debauchee among brothels.

561
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,440
Ms. Zhao, let me explain.

562
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,400
- Don't bother to explain.
- I...

563
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,000
Stop making up more stories.

564
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,080
Anyway,

565
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,640
I don't allow you to get married.

566
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,760
But Pan'er...

567
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,520
In this case,

568
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,600
I'll take my leave.

569
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,800
Do yourself a favor and leave.

570
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:48,100
(Tea is Served)

571
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,080
Zhou She, don't leave!

572
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,000
Yinzhang, say no more.

573
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,600
I was being nice to her

574
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,880
just because she's your sister.

575
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,040
But what did she do to me?

576
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,040
I do business everywhere

577
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,160
and I need to be respected.

578
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,720
She just cared too much about me.

579
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,600
In this world,

580
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,840
only you and she

581
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,360
care about me.

582
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,240
I know she's concerned about you.

583
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,960
But if I have to wait for this long,

584
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,840
I can't bear it.

585
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,720
I'll go persuade her.

586
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,620
(Zhao's Teahouse)

587
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,760
If you still regard me as your sister,

588
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,880
do not hang out with him anymore.

589
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,160
Pan'er,

590
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,720
I'm not as lucky as you.

591
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,240
You met Ouyang

592
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,440
and you two love each other.

593
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,800
Now that I can't marry a scholar,

594
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,640
marrying a rich merchant

595
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,240
for the rest of my life

596
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,440
would be the best choice for me.

597
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,840
You were set free a long time ago

598
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,840
and you don't know

599
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,400
how hard life could be
for pariahs like us.

600
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,840
I used to be a fool.

601
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,520
Over the years,

602
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,040
I cared for nothing,
but pipa and music scores.

603
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,800
I thought of myself as a musician

604
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,120
that even noblemen respected

605
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,360
and I always looked down

606
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,480
on those singing performers
who pleased others by their beauties.

607
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,800
It was not until you told me

608
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,440
that a musician was a music performer

609
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,640
did I wake from my dream.

610
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,480
The pariah statue is handed down
through generations.

611
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,320
A pariah can't marry a common civilian

612
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,480
or redeem herself.

613
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,000
Pan'er, I don't want to accompany guests

614
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,800
in drinking at official banquets.

615
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,920
I don't want to be caged forever.

616
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,960
Didn't I tell you?

617
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,440
When Ouyang passes the Imperial Exam
and becomes an official,

618
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,640
he'll come back
and plead with Prefect Xu

619
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,960
for setting you free.

620
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,440
What if he fails?

621
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,800
What if Prefect Xu doesn't help?

622
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,160
I'm not your biological sister, anyway.

623
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,920
And I'm the best pipa player
in Hangzhou.

624
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,960
Will Prefect Xu easily get me
out of the pariah status?

625
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,240
I don't want to wait
for even a single day.

626
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,360
Now, Zhou She wants to marry me.

627
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,560
And he's rich.

628
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,720
He's rich?

629
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,400
But are you short of money?

630
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,040
You know that.

631
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,440
No registered musician

632
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,760
can be redeemed with money
before she's 35.

633
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,880
If you only have a wedding,

634
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,320
you can't be a common civilian.

635
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,680
Actually, you aren't even a concubine.

636
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,120
I'll be his wife, of course.

637
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,000
Zhou She promised,

638
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,520
as long as I marry him,

639
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,920
he will beg his uncle,
Controller-general of Yingtian Prefecture.

640
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,640
With his uncle's help,

641
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,200
I can soon become a civilian.

642
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,800
If Prefect Xu doesn't free you,

643
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,240
how can Zhou She's uncle do that?

644
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,800
How can a Controller-general
of Yingtian Prefecture

645
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,400
interfere with Hangzhou Music Bureau?

646
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,230
Think it over.

647
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,230
If Zhou She were really that perfect,

648
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,630
why did he suddenly
come to Qiantang County?

649
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,560
And why would he marry no one but you?

650
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,000
I know life is hard
for registered musicians.

651
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,760
But you get paid by the Music Bureau,

652
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,630
accept rewards from noblemen,

653
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,560
and enjoy a rich and carefree life.

654
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,840
You even have a maid.

655
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
Compared to what we suffered,

656
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,840
your life is already wonderful.

657
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,230
Instead of being a trapped parrot
in the gold cage,

658
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,520
I prefer to be a free wild bird
in the field.

659
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,320
But how do you know

660
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,080
that he isn't up to something else?

661
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,920
He just loves me and cares about me.

662
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,400
What else can he be up to?

663
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,280
He's already rich.

664
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,920
Why would he be greedy for my money?

665
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,920
You always expect
to marry a Presented Scholar.

666
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,920
Why can't I marry a rich merchant?

667
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,480
Fine. I'll stop arguing with you.

668
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,000
Leave and marry him

669
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,160
as you wish.

670
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,360
But the stores and assets

671
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,200
I'm taking care of on your behalf...

672
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,800
Never dream to take away any of them.

673
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,560
They belong to me.

674
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,960
Why can you hang onto them?

675
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,520
Because before your sister died,

676
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,720
she asked me to look after you.

677
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,320
You say that he'll be nice to you,

678
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,720
fine.

679
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,400
Let him prove it.

680
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,200
Ask him to marry you officially
in Qiantang County.

681
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,440
If he does that,

682
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,760
I'll give you

683
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,040
every penny of yours.

684
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,280
And the dowry I have
long prepared for you.

685
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,120
Otherwise,

686
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,960
I would rather throw your money
in the West Lake.

687
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,240
Did Yinzhang really say that?

688
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,800
If I did not do something harsh,

689
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,760
she would not wake up.

690
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,000
All these years,

691
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,840
you've been protecting her too much.

692
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,200
She isn't silly.

693
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,840
She's just simple-minded.

694
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,440
But I have to protect her.

695
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,440
I owe her sister, anyway.

696
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,960
Where on earth does Zhou She live?

697
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,560
To deal with such a man,

698
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,960
we should just punch him.

699
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,040
Come on,

700
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,840
why didn't you tell me earlier?

701
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,840
You were busy punishing your son.

702
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,760
Mother, I'm your son.

703
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,440
If you hurt me,

704
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,760
who else can make you
an official's mother?

705
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,680
How dare you come back!

706
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,800
If I didn't come back, no one could
notify you of something.

707
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,080
When I was on Ren'an Bridge,

708
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,120
I saw Ms. Song and Mr. Zhou

709
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,080
getting out of the town by boat.

710
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,080
Her maid Yinping

711
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,840
stayed with them.

712
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,200
They were taking a lot of cases.

713
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,960
Can they be eloping?

714
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,240
What did you say?

715
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,680
Commander, what do we do?

716
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,840
Go to Yang Zhiyuan's house immediately,

717
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,080
tell him who you are
and ask for the painting.

718
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,200
If he still doesn't give it to you,

719
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,880
I have to go and meet him personally.

720
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,800
Aye.

721
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,360
Did you fail to catch up?

722
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,680
Take it easy.

723
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,880
Zhou She is from Huaiyang, right?

724
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,840
We know his identity.

725
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,320
He can't run away.

726
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,280
I asked in the fur store.

727
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,520
Zhou She isn't a merchant
from Huaiyang at all.

728
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,920
And among all controller-generals,

729
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,880
no one has a wife named Ms. Zhou.

730
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,560
So, he's a fraud?

731
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,600
Luckily, Yinping is sensible.

732
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,720
Now that she has left with Yinzhang,

733
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,960
she will try to send us messages.

734
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,200
Hope so.

735
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,360
My teahouse is smashed.

736
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,920
Sanniang, stop cleaning.

737
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,040
Ouyang used to say

738
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,640
that a scholar would have
a bad reputation

739
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,480
if he married a businesswoman.

740
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,200
I was worried

741
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,480
about who would take care of my teahouse

742
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,840
after I went to the capital city.

743
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,960
Looks like

744
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,240
this is just my fate.

745
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,320
You don't need to close the teahouse.

746
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,080
I can't make tea.

747
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,640
But I can make cakes

748
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,720
and drinks.

749
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,680
I can also serve as the cashier.

750
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,320
You should solve
Yinzhang's problem first.

751
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,360
Yinzhang is a silly girl.

752
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,360
She doesn't know

753
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,920
that she will be flogged
for leaving without permission.

754
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,920
If authorities of the Music Bureau know

755
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,560
that she eloped, what would happen?

756
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,280
Then what do we do?

757
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,800
I want to request Mr. Yang Zhiyuan

758
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,080
to plead for Yinzhang
with the authorities.

759
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,560
Mr. Yang came occasionally for the tea

760
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,720
and bought some paintings from you.

761
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,400
Will he take on
such a big responsibility?

762
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,120
I can't care for so much now.

763
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,760
He kind of owes me, after all.

764
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,040
Mr. Yang lives out of the town.

765
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,840
And it's getting dark.

766
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,640
Be very careful.

767
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:24,760
I will.

768
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,560
Ms. Zhao, be patient, please.

769
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
Master is busy
with the river engineering work

770
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,840
and he seldom comes out of his study
these two days.

771
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,040
How about waiting in the back room?

772
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,680
I'll check it out in his study.

773
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,240
But I'm in such a hurry
that I can't wait.

774
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,280
Let me tell Master
about your visit, all right?

775
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,000
These are cakes for Mrs. Yang.

776
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,040
Please give them to her.

777
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,120
Thank you, Ms. Zhao.

778
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,320
Be seated, please.

779
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,480
How daring!

780
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,720
I'm Transport Assistant Yang Zhiyuan
of Liangzhe Region!

781
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,440
Who dares to break into my house?

782
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,880
(Commander Gu Qianfan of the Intelligence Agency)
I'm Gu Qianfan,

783
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,160
Commander
of the Capital Security Office.

784
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,320
You...

785
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,960
Oh, I see. Since I don't sell
the painting to you,

786
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,600
you broke into my house so late.

787
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,440
How...

788
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,440
How lawless you are!

789
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,160
Stop!

790
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,200
Search. Search carefully!

791
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,000
You stop!

792
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,200
What do you think you're doing?

793
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,280
Don't break anything!

794
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,520
Even if you're from
the Capital Security Office,

795
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,560
you can't be such a bully!

796
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,600
Give me The Night Revels
and I'm leaving immediately.

797
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,400
Why must you have that painting?

798
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,660
(Augury)

799
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,390
(Transport Assistant Yang Zhiyuan)
Augury?

800
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,000
I came to Jiangnan Region

801
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,760
to arrest Magistrate Wei
of Renhe County.

802
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,120
I don't mean to hurt you.

803
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,760
But if you don't appreciate
my kindness...

804
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,600
I'll just give you the painting.

805
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,960
Commander, here it is.

806
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,000
Gu Qianfan!

807
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,120
Are you the grandson of Gu Shenyan,
the former Vice Director of the Ministry of Rites?

808
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,400
I am. Why, ma'am?

809
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,880
It is really you.

810
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,160
Honey, Honey,

811
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,760
he's Gu Qianfan. The Living Devil!

812
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,080
He came here because of the augury.

813
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,640
We mustn't mess with him.

814
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm not scared of him!

815
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,040
Honey, Honey...

816
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,600
Shuniang,

817
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,800
(Mrs. Yang)
if you could feel in heaven,

818
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,960
have a good look.

819
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,000
Look how your ridiculous son is

820
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,520
bullying your old friend!

821
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,360
As a literary family
for five generations,

822
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,840
the Gu Family has unyielding integrity.

823
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,760
But you're an exception, scoundrel.

824
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,320
You even work for eunuchs!

825
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,480
Honey, Honey, stop.

826
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,480
She's sick.

827
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,200
- You frame officials and attack opponents!
- Get her back to her room, hurry!

828
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,440
You're so wicked, just like your father!

829
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,320
Hurry.

830
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,440
My wife was a little bit crazy

831
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,400
and she was just talking nonsense.

832
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,320
Commander, please don't be angry.

833
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,720
