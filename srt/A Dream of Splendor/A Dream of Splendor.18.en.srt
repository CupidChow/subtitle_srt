17
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,200
I have the antidote, but only for one.

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,080
The first person who confesses
will have it.

19
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,320
If none of you speaks,

20
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,240
I'll throw it into Bian River.

21
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,960
One.

22
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,880
Two.

23
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,440
Three.

24
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,000
I…

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,680
- I'll speak.
- I'll speak.

26
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,840
- I owe someone money…
- You docked his sister's wage…

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,030
He forced me to pay off the debt.
I had no money,

28
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,630
so he asked me to make trouble here.

29
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,520
You lied to me.

30
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,960
You told me

31
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,040
they broke your sister's leg.

32
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,640
Who's behind this?

33
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,560
Mr. Gao or Mr. Xiao?

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,240
He was instructed by
Sir Eighth from the dock.

35
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,600
But Sir Eighth got the money
from a female.

36
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,040
She's in her 40s.

37
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,600
She looks like a maid-nurse
of a rich family.

38
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,840
Wait.

39
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,880
How can you be so sure

40
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,000
that she's a maid-nurse
of a rich family?

41
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,600
I saw her feet.

42
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,040
Her feet are big and fat.

43
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,680
And her shoes were
made of poor-quality fabric

44
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,840
and looked outdated.

45
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,480
No mistress would wear shoes
like those.

46
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,960
But she got to sit in a big carriage

47
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,760
and order servants around,

48
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,600
so I'd say she's either a maid-nurse

49
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,000
or a wet nurse.

50
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,000
Smart you.

51
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,040
Can you write?

52
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,320
Yes.

53
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,000
Then write down

54
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,880
what happened
from the beginning to the end,

55
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,760
and leave your fingerprints
on the paper.

56
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,040
Come here and write.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,960
Have the officers arrived?

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,840
Write, now.

59
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,200
Gentlemen.

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
You have witnessed the whole thing.

61
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,240
Half-hidden is aggrieved.

62
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,320
Yes.

63
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,160
If anyone else slanders us

64
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,680
by saying our food is poisonous,

65
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,200
please help defend us.

66
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,160
Much appreciated.

67
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,600
You're welcome.

68
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,240
We will. We sure will.

69
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,040
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

70
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,780
(Statement Ge Zhaodi Sun Daqiang)

71
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,640
We are kind of confused.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,910
(Sun Daqiang Ge Zhaodi)
Didn't you

73
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,960
feed them with hush drug?

74
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,280
It was just borneol in water.

75
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,880
It would irritate the throat at first.

76
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,560
See how talkative they were just now.

77
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,480
You're composed

78
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,120
and resourceful, Ms. Zhao.

79
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,480
You look quite young.

80
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,120
We'll let you off.

81
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,040
Just go

82
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,320
before the officers are here.

83
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:12,960
You…

84
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,640
Wait.

85
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,640
Girls shouldn't have scarred hands.

86
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,120
Go buy some medicine.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Oh, here they are.

88
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,960
Who called us here?

89
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
- The officers are here.
- Officers, officers.

90
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,640
What happened?

91
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,840
It's all good. It's all good now.

92
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,600
There was a misunderstanding.

93
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,360
- You go upstairs.
- Are you sure?

94
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,840
Now that you are here,

95
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,120
why not come in for a cup of tea?

96
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,840
- Thanks but no.
- Yes.

97
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,800
We'll be off, then.

98
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,320
Thank you, officers.

99
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,280
Thank you.

100
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,040
Sanniang,

101
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,520
- we'll be off, too, if that's all.
- See you next time.

102
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,360
Thank you, sir.

103
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,320
Goodbye.

104
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
Ms. Zhao, goodbye.

105
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,720
It was Gao Hui's wet nurse Mrs. Jiang.

106
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,640
She was at the door all the time,

107
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,240
ready for a good show.

108
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,800
She later found things went south,

109
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,880
and escaped in a hurry.

110
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
So it is the Gao family
as I expected.

111
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,000
I told you they'd come for you.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,240
Gao Hui is merciless.

113
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,880
Her wet nurse has been a bully
under her wing.

114
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,800
I asked you to wait for me
at the end of the Zhou Bridge, didn't I?

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,960
Why are you back in the teahouse?

116
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,720
Is it because it took me too long
to get here?

117
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,880
I met an elder on the way.

118
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,400
You said you'd treat me with sincerity.

119
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,000
Didn't you?

120
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,360
I did.

121
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,440
So can you tell me

122
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,480
who stopped you just now?

123
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,280
That was…

124
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,560
Xiao Wei, Xiao Qinyan's son.

125
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,120
Can't believe you try to fool me.

126
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,200
If you were going to treat me
with sincerity,

127
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,040
if he was Xiao Wei,

128
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,080
who did harm to both me and you,

129
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,760
you must hate his guts.

130
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,200
However,
from the way you looked at him,

131
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,520
and the tone he used
when he spoke to you,

132
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,680
it's obvious that you weren't enemies.

133
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,760
I have been doing business
for many years.

134
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,960
That's something I can tell.

135
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,480
Come on, Pan'er,
what are you talking about?

136
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,360
That really was Xiao Wei.

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,840
Please listen to me.

138
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,240
I don't really care who he is.

139
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,120
I only care
how sincerely you treat me.

140
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,280
If it's just for show

141
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,720
when you said you'd marry me,

142
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,600
then I have no interest in
wasting my time on you.

143
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,440
I have the stuff to do. See you.

144
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,800
Don't you worry about the Gao family!

145
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,040
Chief. Chief.

146
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,120
What?

147
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,680
Mr. Lei asked me to fetch you.

148
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,440
"It's urgent", he said.

149
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,560
Also, Mr. Xiao sent his man
to invite you

150
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,920
to see him in his villa

151
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,400
as he's coming to the capital city.

152
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,200
The evidence you have gathered

153
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,440
is enough to bring Lei Jing to justice.

154
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,280
But at the end of the day,

155
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,520
he's but a small fry.

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Our true arch-enemy

157
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,160
is Xiao Qinyan.

158
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,840
What's the matter with you?

159
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,910
Did the officers get suspicious?

160
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,160
I'm wondering

161
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,000
who's behind all this.

162
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,800
When I saw that person
lie on the floor,

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,200
I honestly thought

164
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,960
our haw drink was harmful.

165
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,600
Pan'er,

166
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,280
how did you realize it was off?

167
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,200
When in Qiantang,

168
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,400
I was ripped off.

169
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,480
So have you guessed who's behind this?

170
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,760
The Gao family.

171
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,720
The Gao family?

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,880
What a vicious set-up.

173
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,440
Should Deputy Commissioner Gu
be informed?

174
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,760
No.

175
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,360
No?

176
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,200
You are going to handle
this on your own again?

177
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,240
That's the Gao family.

178
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,960
It's wiser to go
for the head of the gang.

179
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,920
Instead of dealing with

180
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,600
all the trouble-makers they send here,

181
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,840
why don't we confront the ringleader?

182
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,200
Today is 16, right?

183
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,160
You keep things in order here.
I'm going out.

184
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,520
Are you going to see Gao Hui?

185
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,800
You can't.

186
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,400
What if she sends
her men against you?

187
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,200
What are you going to do?

188
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,160
I know what to do.

189
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,100
(House of Elegance)

190
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,880
I'm told you're offering a high price

191
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,640
for a Southern Tang artist
Xu Xi's painting.

192
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,960
I happen to have one.

193
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,240
Let me see.

194
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,480
Give me a minute.

195
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,680
Sir, there's an update

196
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,520
on the painting of Xu Xi you asked.

197
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,960
A girl came to sell his
painting of crane and bamboo.

198
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,280
Let me have a look.

199
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,840
The seller is downstairs.

200
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,440
Would you like to see her?

201
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,600
Yes.

202
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,240
How much do you price

203
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,840
this painting of crane and bamboo?

204
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,640
Zero coins.

205
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,640
I'd like to offer you the painting
for free

206
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,360
in order to explain my situation
to you, Inspector Gao.

207
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,720
I'm Zhao Pan'er from Qiantang.

208
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,800
I was once engaged to Ouyang Xu.

209
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,520
I'm privileged to see you,

210
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,600
Inspector Gao.

211
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,560
You were once engaged to Ouyang Xu?

212
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,880
Indeed.

213
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,880
Three years ago, he failed the exam
and roamed to Qiantang.

214
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,240
I saved him from a lake,

215
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,600
paid for his school so he could
take another exam in the capital.

216
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,640
He once promised me marriage.

217
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,280
But now that he's made it,

218
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,920
he abandoned me,

219
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,080
and chose to marry to the Gao family.

220
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,080
But…

221
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,280
But why are you here to see me?

222
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,680
Ever since I learned

223
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,520
that Ouyang Xu left the capital,

224
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,960
I've had this feeling that I'd
see you someday,

225
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,760
so I was prepared beforehand.

226
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,680
(I thought)

227
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,600
(although you were a meritorious
member of the royal family,)

228
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,320
(you chose Ouyang Xu,)

229
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,520
(you had to have an interest
in literature and art.)

230
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,280
(I asked around,)

231
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,040
(House of Elegance)
(and learned that you'd)

232
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,560
(come here to buy books or paintings
in every 10 days.)

233
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,680
(Also, you asked the owner)

234
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,920
(to be on the lookout
for Xu Xi's paintings.)

235
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,080
(I had a small business
back in Jiangnan Region,)

236
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,440
(so I happen to have some collections
of the works of some artists.)

237
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,720
(I traded two paintings
with a collector)

238
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,120
(for the painting of crane and bamboo.)

239
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,800
(That's how I earned my chance
to see you.)

240
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,920
You're quite bold.

241
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,960
I never broke any law,

242
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,880
I never did anything shady,

243
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,680
so I'm certainly fearless.

244
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,720
However, you, Inspector Gao,

245
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,360
are in deep trouble.

246
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
Ouyang Xu broke his betrothal
with you.

247
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,880
It has nothing to do with me.

248
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The Gao family

249
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,280
disowns the relationship

250
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,600
with this unfaithful man.

251
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,640
You can sue him,

252
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,640
or make a big deal out of it.

253
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,480
It's up to you.

254
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,800
If the Gao family had broken up
with Ouyang Xu,

255
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,440
why would your daughter's
wet nurse set me up?

256
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,200
Her jealousy turned into hate,

257
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,640
so she set me up

258
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,400
and worked with law enforcement

259
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,600
in an attempt to discredit me
and inflict a lawsuit on me.

260
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,360
Inspector Gao,

261
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,640
is this your family culture?

262
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,760
What are you getting at?

263
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,280
I have a teahouse on Mahang Street.

264
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,120
Someone made trouble at my place.

265
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,120
I saw them through

266
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,760
and made them write a statement.

267
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,720
On the paper, they admitted

268
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,440
that Mrs. Jiang, your daughter's
wet nurse paid them to do it.

269
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,400
You have no witness

270
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,480
or evidence.

271
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,080
You plan to frame up my family

272
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,960
with this groundless statement alone?

273
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,640
I didn't publicize it.

274
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,160
Nor am I blackmailing you.

275
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,880
How come it's framing-up?

276
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,960
You can carry out an investigation

277
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,280
to find out its authenticity.

278
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,000
I swear to God,

279
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,040
ever since
I saw Ouyang Xu's true colors,

280
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,800
I have dissociated from him.

281
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,680
I didn't come here

282
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,400
to start a conflict with you.

283
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,360
I only came here
to give you a friendly warning.

284
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,520
I'm sure your beloved daughter

285
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,400
is well educated,

286
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,080
but what if the servants

287
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,360
make errors?

288
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,400
You're a high-level official.

289
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,760
A good reputation

290
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,320
must mean much to you.

291
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,200
Are you threatening me?

292
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,560
I dare not.

293
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,920
I came here

294
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,440
with the hope of you
regulating your people.

295
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,200
Please kindly leave us be.

296
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,200
I forgot to mention

297
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,320
that this is a copy of the statement.

298
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,040
My sister has the original one.
She's outside the government office.

299
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,560
If I don't return to them

300
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,360
in four hours,

301
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,440
she'll file the statement.

302
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,160
Y-Y-You…

303
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,720
What…

304
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,320
What paintings did you trade
for the painting of crane and bamboo?

305
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,720
Huang Jucai's painting of pheasant.

306
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,520
And Guan Tong's painting of creek.

307
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,320
Y-You said you ran a small business.

308
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,240
How did you come by

309
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,440
these valuable paintings?

310
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,760
Wang Lun was a villager,

311
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,320
but he admired Li Bai's poems.

312
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,160
I'm a businesswoman,

313
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,240
but my interest lies in art works.

314
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,320
Art works?

315
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,160
You…

316
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,880
You are a pretty girl,

317
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,160
and you sound educated.

318
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,240
Why would Ouyang Xu foolishly

319
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,480
abandon you?

320
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,590
Because I was once
one of the underclass.

321
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,320
I know my status

322
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,080
can't compete

323
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,640
with your beloved daughter.

324
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Yes, I once hated Ouyang Xu

325
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,760
for his unfaithfulness,

326
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,320
but now, I have put it all behind me.

327
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,040
Inspector Gao,

328
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,600
I have dissociated
from Ouyang Xu completely.

329
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,160
It's only me and my sisters
in the Eastern Capital.

330
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,680
We just wish

331
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,320
to run our small business in peace.

332
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,200
That's all we ask for.

333
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,600
I asked Ouyang Xu

334
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,120
whether he was engaged.

335
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,440
His answer was no.

336
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,200
My family

337
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,160
won't take anything by force.

338
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,080
Much less from you,

339
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,760
a frail girl.

340
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,320
Thank you, Inspector Gao.

341
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,440
Goodbye.

342
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,000
Wait.

343
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,840
Ouyang Xu broke up his promise,

344
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,040
but did he give you a hard time?

345
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,000
He bribed civil dispute official
and accused me of extortion.

346
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,320
He tried to kick me out of the capital.

347
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,520
But you chose to stay

348
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,840
and then opened up a teahouse.

349
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,600
Aren't you worried that he's
going to come at you later?

350
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,840
I do have such a concern.

351
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,080
Well, in this case,

352
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,200
why don't you
pledge your service to me?

353
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,240
Trust me.

354
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,840
I guarantee you

355
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,800
that Ouyang Xu won't show up again
in the Eastern Capital again

356
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,200
and that no one will ever
give you a hard time.

357
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,880
A smart girl like you

358
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,280
isn't supposed to make a living

359
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,680
by selling tea out there.

360
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,480
You deserve

361
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,120
to be preserved in a safe chamber.

362
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,000
I beg to differ, Inspector Gao.

363
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,240
Who are you?

364
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,600
How dare you eavesdrop
on our conversation?

365
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,700
(Capital Security Office)

366
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,720
The Capital Security Office.

367
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,520
Inspector Gao, relax.

368
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,400
I was only there on standby.

369
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,440
I didn't hear any of your secrets.

370
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,960
However,

371
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,760
my wife is but an ignorant woman.

372
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,600
I don't think she deserves
to be described as smart.

373
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,640
Your wife?

374
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,760
You just broke up with Ouyang Xu.

375
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,120
And you've already found another man?

376
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,000
Not as quickly as how you got your

377
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,800
presented scholar son-in-law,
Inspector Gao.

378
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,880
I'm Gu Qianfan, Deputy Commissioner
of the Capital Security Office.

379
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,880
So you're Gu Qianfan.

380
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,840
Exactly.

381
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,800
It's so lucky of you.

382
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,440
Thank you, Inspector Gao.

383
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,320
If you need me to do anything,

384
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,440
just let me know.

385
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,680
You're too kind, Deputy Commissioner Gu.

386
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,760
I'd love

387
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,040
to attend your wedding.

388
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,240
It's my pleasure.

389
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,960
Ms. Zhao.

390
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,760
Ouyang Xu won't be back here again.

391
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,560
Are you happy

392
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,440
with my gift for you?

393
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm happy

394
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,480
if my future husband is happy.

395
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,480
Goodbye.

396
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,960
So I-I will take the painting.

397
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,540
(House of Elegance)

398
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,400
Safe travels.

399
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,520
Gao's carriage.

400
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,540
(Gao)

401
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,640
You were calling me
hubby a moment ago,

402
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,920
now you disown me?

403
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,600
That's cheeky of you, isn't it?

404
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,160
You…

405
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,400
What?

406
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,280
Am I wrong?

407
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,640
Remember you told

408
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,040
me to stay out of your business?

409
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,440
Hadn't I followed you

410
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,280
because I was concerned about you,

411
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
you would have become

412
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,000
Ouyang Xu's stepmother by now.

413
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,960
I made a wrong judgment.

414
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,080
Mr. Zhuoshi said

415
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,120
Inspector Gao was a man of integrity.

416
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,200
Who would have known he isn't.

417
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,120
To us Capital Security Officers,

418
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,840
a wrong judgment

419
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,680
could be the death of us.

420
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,000
Think about it.

421
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,800
The moment that old pig heard
his future son-in-law was going to be

422
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,960
a Taoist Temple Administrator,
he broke the betrothal right away.

423
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,440
How could he possibly be decent?

424
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,120
Zhao Pan'er,

425
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,080
can you please not do anything
that concerns me

426
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,880
every time we have a dispute,

427
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,640
is that okay?

428
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,400
What if that old pig

429
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,200
wanted to take your life instead
of your body?

430
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,440
What if he had someone tie you up

431
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,400
and throw you into the river?

432
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,680
Did that occur to you?

433
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,360
What am I supposed to do
when you become a ghost under water,

434
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,120
Mrs. Gu?

435
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,000
What…

436
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,360
What are you talking about?

437
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,600
What's wrong with "Mrs. Gu"?

438
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,400
I said I'd marry you,
and you agreed.

439
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,320
So you're Mrs. Gu.

440
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,040
I won't be a concubine of yours.

441
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,800
I wouldn't marry you

442
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,520
if I wanted a concubine.

443
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,160
What I meant

444
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,320
is a formal marriage.

445
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,280
I want you to be my legal wife.

446
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,160
At first, I didn't understand
why you were mad.

447
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,200
After Chen Lian reminded me,

448
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,600
I kind of understand.

449
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,080
Did you hear me speak to that man

450
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,560
at the teahouse?

451
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,640
Yes.

452
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,200
I heard you say, "It's just for show",

453
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,080
and you thanked them
for pairing you up with a noble girl.

454
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,560
Do you know who that is?

455
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,560
He's Lei Jing, my boss.

456
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,640
He's the Commissioner
of the Capital Security Office.

457
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,360
He took 200 thousand strings of copper
from Zheng Qingtian, and wants me dead.

458
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,320
Do you think
I should be honest with him?

459
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,680
Talking about
"Abandon, no repudiation".

460
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,080
We're only faced with minor trouble,

461
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,640
and you have already started
to be suspicious of me.

462
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,640
You are not

463
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,240
as bold as you think you are.

464
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,520
Yes, I know
someone once hurt your feelings,

465
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,480
that it's hard for you
to love another man wholeheartedly,

466
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,160
so once you're emotionally hurt,

467
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,000
you won't get it off your chest,

468
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,560
you'll just be sulking over it.

469
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,000
At the end of the day,

470
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,280
you don't want to be looked upon.

471
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
That's why you fought
to marry a Presented Scholar,

472
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,880
to be his wife.

473
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,440
You fought to earn your footing
in the Eastern Capital.

474
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,080
But you know what?

475
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,920
No one looks upon you.

476
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,400
The one who looks upon you

477
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,720
is yourself.

478
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,480
Gu Qianfan.

479
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,400
What? Am I wrong?

480
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,960
Have I peeved you?

481
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,680
Yes, I admit I'm self-contemptuous

482
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,200
and that I don't trust you.

483
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,560
Because what I want

484
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,200
isn't sweet talks,

485
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,240
but the love of eternity.

486
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,360
When you

487
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,960
proposed to me and vowed,
I felt happy.

488
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,120
But

489
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,840
my afterthought told me,

490
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,120
why would the Deputy Commissioner
of the Capital Security Office

491
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,440
marry a girl from the underclass?

492
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,080
Won't you regret it?

493
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,080
You won't believe a single word

494
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
that comes out of my mouth, right?

495
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,160
Fine.

496
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,920
I now have three land deeds

497
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,080
and four keys here.

498
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,200
These are all I have earned

499
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,720
over the past twelve years
as an official.

500
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,120
You can keep them.

501
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,200
It's OK
if you haven't thought it through.

502
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,240
You can take your time at home.

503
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,800
I can wait for you.

504
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,920
Gu Qianfan.

505
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,240
Wait.

506
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,840
Just make it real next time, alright?

507
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,520
Well, it worked on you.

508
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,560
Do you really mean it?

509
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,880
Are we really going
to have a legitimate wedding?

510
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,920
We had a drink
in Huating County, remember?

511
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,040
I think I fell for you

512
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,760
at that very moment.

513
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,280
Later, when I saw

514
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,600
you safe and sound in jail,

515
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,560
I felt a rush of desire to marry you

516
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,640
and protect you.

517
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,680
You wanted to be the wife
of a Presented Scholar, right?

518
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,120
Well, I was Second Category.

519
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,720
You won't lose anything
marrying me.

520
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,160
What about your career?

521
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,320
You don't want a good reputation?

522
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,360
Do I have a good reputation now?

523
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,280
Just ask around.

524
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,280
Between a horrible
Capital Security Officer

525
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,440
and a former music performer,

526
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,920
who's more dislikable?

527
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,600
You made the choice.

528
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,480
Are you sure about it?

529
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,720
If you stay faithful,

530
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,640
so will I.

531
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,320
If we have problems again,

532
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,440
please give me some time

533
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,800
so I can explain.

534
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,080
I didn't lie to you

535
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,480
about Xiao Wei.

536
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,080
It's just my relationship
with the Xiao family

537
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,120
is way too complicated.

538
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,200
And it implicates the business
in the Capital Security Office,

539
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,480
so I couldn't find a way

540
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,800
to explain to you.

541
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,040
I won't dwell on the Xiao family,

542
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,200
but I know you too little

543
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,720
while you can order your men

544
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,800
to find out all about me easily.

545
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,560
I can do nothing but wait
for you to show up.

546
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,240
Who are your friends?

547
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,360
Who do we stay on guard against?
Who do we keep away from?

548
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,840
I have no clue.

549
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,880
Gu Qianfan,

550
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,120
you have so many secrets.

551
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,640
I don't even know

552
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,560
how a Presented Scholar was assigned
to the Capital Security Office.

553
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,840
Other than your name

554
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,520
and your martial arts,

555
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,800
I basically know nothing about you.

556
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,280
The past is the past.

557
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,680
In the future, I'll tell you

558
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,480
everything about me.

559
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,400
Keep flogging!

560
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,360
Stop.

561
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,280
Father.

562
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,800
Mrs. Jiang served me for years.

563
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,520
She doesn't deserve this.

564
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,320
What mistake did she make

565
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,800
that causes you to punish her so hard?

566
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,480
You weren't home most of the time
when I was little,

567
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,200
Mrs. Jiang brought me up.

568
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,600
If she's beaten to death,

569
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,360
I'll kill myself.

570
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,800
Miss Gao.

571
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,480
Mrs. Jiang.

572
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,560
Mrs. Jiang.

573
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,440
Miss Gao, please
don't talk Mr. Gao back.

574
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,720
I stole money from the family.

575
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,000
I deserve it. I deserve it.

576
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,760
You didn't.

577
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,880
I don't believe it.

578
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,200
Master, I deserve it.

579
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,280
I…

580
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,320
Mrs. Jiang! Mrs. Jiang!

581
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,720
Mrs. Jiang, are you okay?

582
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,640
Mrs. Jiang, stay with me! Mrs. Jiang!

583
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,560
Fetch a doctor.

584
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,240
Help! I need help!

585
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,280
- Mrs. Jiang!
- Mother!

586
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,160
- Mrs. Jiang!
- Mother!

587
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,840
Why did you choose
the Capital Security Office

588
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,000
over all the other institutions?

589
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,400
Like the Imperial Guards,

590
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,680
the Capital Security Office, too,
is a force under His Majesty.

591
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,320
Work hard and you will get

592
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,360
fast promotions.

593
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,080
My father left me very early,

594
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,720
so my mother raised me.

595
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,560
But they were divorced,

596
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,240
so she isn't able to be buried
in the ancestral grave of the Gu family.

597
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,360
That's why I must be promoted
to a position of the fifth rank.

598
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,080
The mother of a rank-5 officer

599
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,880
shall receive a title of honor.

600
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,840
With that,

601
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,440
she'll have a decent burial.

602
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,280
How about I pay her
a visit some other day?

603
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,360
What? Inappropriate?

604
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,160
You rejected me, remember?

605
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,160
Now the ugly wife

606
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,440
is anxious to see
the future mother-in-law?

607
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,360
Ugly?

608
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,240
Me.

609
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,360
What did you just say?

610
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,800
I'm ugly, okay? My bad.

611
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,800
I didn't mean

612
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,240
to disturb you.

613
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,760
But an order
from the imperial palace says

614
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,880
that His Majesty expects to see you.

615
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,600
Got it. I'll be on my way.

616
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,880
Pan'er,

617
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,600
what's wrong with Mr. Gu?

618
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,200
His hearing is so good

619
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,080
that he can hear me speak ill of him

620
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,440
30 meters away.

621
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,240
Today, I followed him
all the way up here,

622
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,520
but he didn't notice me.

623
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,720
Pan'er, help! Help!

624
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,960
All right, enough.

625
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,240
I've got stuff to do at the teahouse.

626
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,120
I need to go.

627
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,200
Wait.

628
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,080
Don't leave after the day's over.

629
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,360
I'll go see you.

630
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,480
Sure.

631
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,480
Flowers for sale. Flowers for sale.

632
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,680
Miss, this pomegranate flower
may bring you the blessing

633
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,640
of a happy marriage.

634
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,280
Take it.

635
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,720
Thank you, miss.

636
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,560
What makes you so happy?

637
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,640
The pomegranate flower looks nice.

638
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,400
Have you settled
with the Gao family?

639
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,080
Let me tell you a secret.

640
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,480
The betrothal between Ouyang Xu

641
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,360
and Miss Gao is canceled.

642
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,640
Great.

643
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,400
He deserves it.

644
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,200
Where's the owner?

645
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,440
I'll answer him.

646
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,600
She seems too happy

647
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,640
about Ouyang Xu's mishap.

648
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,560
My guess is,

649
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,320
she's back together with Gu Qianfan.

650
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,000
I told you to buy medicine.

651
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,160
What's with your wounds?

652
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,760
Where's your brother?

653
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,480
He's not my brother.

654
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,640
We're just from the same village.

655
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,680
He tricked me.

656
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,960
So I beat him up.

657
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,800
Girl,

658
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,440
you've got the strength.

659
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,720
Who's the girl here?

660
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
You are.

661
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,160
Can't women fight?

662
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,400
I even broke his rib.

663
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,480
Well, she's kind of like me.

664
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,710
You're tough.

665
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,760
Why are you back?

666
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,560
You want a waitress, right?

667
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:18,960
I can do that.

668
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,560
I want no money.

669
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,120
You just give me food.

670
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,080
I'm a person
who tells right from wrong.

671
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,040
Although someone tricked me
into framing you,

672
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,520
I still think

673
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,120
it was my fault.

674
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,840
I don't have any money,

675
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,190
so this is how I make it up to you.

676
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,080
I worked as a waitress back in town.

677
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,190
I know what to do in a shop.

678
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,800
Actually,

679
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,160
we do need more people.

680
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,960
Not her, obviously.

681
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,200
What if she poisons us?

682
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,480
I won't.

683
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,920
We can sign a contract.

684
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,840
If I try to harm you again,

685
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,080
you can do whatever
you like with me.

686
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,360
Don't trust her.

687
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,920
When she caused the trouble,

688
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,360
her acting was better than this.

689
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,160
It isn't acting.

690
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,560
I'm serious.

691
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,480
Show me your hands.

692
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,200
Other than the beatings,

693
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,040
what else caused your wounds?

694
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,360
The unloading.

695
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,240
I can carry a 20-kilogram bag
at a time.

696
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,480
Your name is Ge Zhaodi.

697
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,240
Where's your little brother?

698
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,280
I have no little brother.

699
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,440
All my family died.

700
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,080
So you're here in the city on your own?

701
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,560
Yes.

702
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,720
I don't have a family anymore,

703
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,280
so I go wherever I can find jobs.

704
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,520
People say they pay more
in the Eastern Capital,

705
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,800
so here I am.

706
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,040
Not only am I feeding myself

707
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,200
but I also saved some money.

708
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,560
You have money, huh?

709
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,840
Why don't you give us the money?

710
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,680
I…

711
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,600
I had some money.

712
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I beat that guy up, so I needed
to pay for his medication.

713
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,560
And due to this,

714
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,560
I lost my job at the dock.

715
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,080
I'm hard-working.

716
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,840
I know how to use an abacus.

717
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,800
I don't eat much.

718
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,320
Plus, you know my crime.

719
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,280
I'm an economical option.

720
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,640
She actually makes sense.

721
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,960
Sure I do.

722
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,200
That was quite an event.

723
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,360
If you keep me here,

724
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,240
firstly, it shows you're lenient,

725
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,680
secondly, I may deter

726
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,480
the one who set you up.

727
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,520
Two birds, one stone, right?

728
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,120
You're pretty smart.

729
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,480
You can find a job anywhere.

730
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,680
Why do you insist on working for us?

731
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,440
Because you gave me the money
to buy medicine,

732
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,960
and you said,

733
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,920
"Girls shouldn't have scarred hands."

734
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,600
I don't want to be bullied

735
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,720
at work,

736
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,440
so I always dress up like a lad.

737
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,840
Some saw me through.

738
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,560
Some didn't.

739
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
But other than you,

740
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,520
no one told me

741
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,840
to look after myself.

742
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,920
Besides, among the three of you,

743
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,800
one is an excellent pipa player

744
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,000
who attracts customers.

745
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,160
One is a tough woman

746
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,520
who scares ruffians off.

747
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,880
One is a clever lady

748
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,760
who manages to blow my cover.

749
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,040
So I'm sure

750
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,280
this place can make big money.

751
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,360
Just be quick about it.

752
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,320
Will you hire me or not?

753
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,520
Well, there will be a trial.

754
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,600
Starting from now.

755
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,880
Neat.

756
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,720
Interesting.

757
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,880
Money-saving.

758
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Pan'er,

759
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,840
why are you still
on the account book?

760
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,840
Have you forgotten

761
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,720
that we're supposed to buy new clothes

762
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,320
for Zhaodi?

763
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,360
She can't serve customers in this,

764
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,520
can she?

765
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,760
There's an error.

766
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,720
I need to start over.

767
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,120
How about

768
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,920
you take her to the clothing shop?

769
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,640
I'll go home after I'm finished.

770
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,080
Just take the account book home.

771
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,960
Yeah…

772
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,080
I'm hungry.

773
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,880
Your body's still growing, huh?

774
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,480
Fine, let's go.

775
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,960
Come on, let's give her some time alone

776
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,360
so that she can be more efficient.

777
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,060
(Grains)

778
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,680
It looks so nice.

779
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:20,880
Hold on a minute.

780
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,040
Did you pull my sleeve

781
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,080
because you knew something?

782
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,000
It's my first day.

783
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,120
How could I possibly know anything?

784
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,880
Sealing your lips, huh?

785
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,280
I had a cousin back in my hometown.

786
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,120
Why do you mention your cousin?

787
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,440
Because every time my cousin

788
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,400
went out to see her love,

789
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,040
she'd find an excuse

790
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,320
to drive us away

791
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,720
just like Pan'er did.

792
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,640
Good girl.

793
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,800
Meat for you tonight.

794
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,840
The meat stand is that way.

795
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,640
We have meat at home.

796
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,320
(Gao's Mansion)
(Tell me, why did my father flog Mrs. Jiang?)

797
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,160
(Gao's Mansion)
(Don't tell me she stole money.)

798
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,560
She has taken care of my money
for over a decade,

799
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,880
and not a single coin is missing.

800
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,520
The last time my father was this mad

801
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,760
was ages ago.

802
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,480
If he wasn't livid,

803
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,360
he wouldn't have

804
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,560
punished an old servant so hard.

805
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,680
I…

806
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,240
You think I won't flog you?

807
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,400
Sorry.

808
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,400
Tell me now.

809
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,840
My mother

810
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,440
set up a woman.

811
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:23,000
She and Mr. Ouyang were once engaged.

812
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,800
What?

813
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,520
What did you say?

814
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,360
Engaged?

815
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,200
Ouyang Xu was engaged to her?

816
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,720
Yes.

817
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,820
(Behave In Humble Reverence)

818
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,280
Look at us.

819
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,440
It's like Luyao Dance.

820
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,440
You're quite collected.

821
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,800
Sure I am.

822
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,760
I had quite an experience earlier today.

823
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,520
So I've gotten bolder.

824
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,720
There's something

825
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,600
that I don't have the courage
to tell you before I kiss you.

826
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,200
What is it?

827
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,240
Seriously, listen.

828
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,960
When I was in the palace,

829
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,560
I recalled something.

830
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,760
I'm really worried
that it may upset you.

831
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,000
But if I didn't tell you,

832
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,240
you'd be more displeased.

833
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,320
So…

834
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,840
I'm actually engaged.
