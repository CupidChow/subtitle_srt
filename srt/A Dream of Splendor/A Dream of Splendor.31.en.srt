00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,700
=Episode 31=

17
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:40,919
I think

18
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,680
it's you snobs

19
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:45,559
that are the worst.

20
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,599
Yeah!

21
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,120
Right!

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,680
Well said!

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,199
Well said!

24
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,680
Arrest them!

25
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,519
Yes, sir.

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,125
- Who dares to act against me?
- What do you want to do?

27
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,199
A few days ago, when Hat Demon
showed up on the Bian River,

28
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,720
two female criminals escaped.

29
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:12,279
I recognize them now.

30
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,600
It's you two!

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,679
- Ah?
- Ah?

32
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:15,600
You're slandering them!

33
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,759
They're not Hat Demons!

34
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,960
Go ahead!

35
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,880
They colluded with the Hat Demons.
They are accomplices.

36
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,720
Take them down!

37
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,775
You're talking nonsense! Come on!

38
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,839
Yinzhang.

39
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,360
Who are you?

40
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,960
My last name is Song.

41
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,679
Do you know

42
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:53,960
the two characters on my pipa?

43
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,075
(Strength of Character)

44
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,600
What? No.

45
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,320
Strength...

46
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,440
What are the characters?

47
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,320
I can't see it clearly.

48
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:04,080
- Aren't they from the Half-hidden?
- Come closer.

49
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:05,100
What are the characters?

50
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,631
Well.

51
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,440
Since when do you see better than me?

52
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,520
Take a look.

53
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:10,559
The three of us

54
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,039
run a teahouse together
on Mahang Street.

55
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,000
We eat together and live together.

56
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,279
If they are accomplices

57
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:29,919
of the Hat Demon as you said,

58
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,600
not only will it implicate me,

59
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,080
but Ke Zheng, Minister Ke,

60
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,240
who gave me this inscription,

61
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,279
and Xiao Qinyan, Minister Xiao,

62
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,080
will also be implicated.

63
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,720
Since you are so discerning,

64
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,240
why don't you arrest us now?

65
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,800
I can show you the way
to the minister's mansion.

66
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,160
Ms. Song, don't talk nonsense.

67
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,720
The Hat Demon case is a big deal.

68
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,080
The ministers you mentioned
are senior officials in the court.

69
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:05,950
How could you get them involved at will?

70
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,240
Just make an interrogation

71
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,720
and you'll know
if she is making wild charges.

72
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,360
But I remember

73
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,239
the Capital Security Office
is in charge of the Hat Demon case.

74
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,720
Since when is it your turn

75
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,559
to handle the case as a Superintendent
of Canal Transportation in Kaifeng?

76
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,359
Father-in-law.

77
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,075
Eh?

78
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,679
What are you doing here?

79
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,679
I took the Emperor's order
to visit the Taoist

80
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,839
and returned to the capital yesterday.

81
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,850
The Emperor summoned me

82
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,125
and that's why I'm in the palace.

83
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,850
I haven't seen you for a long time.

84
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,399
Are you still in good health?

85
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:04,839
Cut it out!

86
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,040
Your engagement with my daughter
has been broken off.

87
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:10,160
Who is your father-in-law?

88
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,839
Father-in-law.

89
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,559
Do you want the Emperor to hear

90
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,679
our dispute here?

91
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,799
Father-in-law, you can
get back to your business now.

92
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,160
Anyway,

93
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,760
we'll stay under the same roof

94
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,475
for the decades to come.

95
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,440
There is no rush.

96
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,079
Am I right?

97
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,475
Let me tip you off.

98
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,040
Her husband is the Living Devil
in the Capital Security Office.

99
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,775
You don't believe me?

100
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,799
Which woman has the nerve
to call me weak

101
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,275
in front of so many people?

102
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,320
Three ladies.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,880
I had a few drinks

104
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,679
and mistook you for someone else.

105
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,239
Please don't sink to my level.

106
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,519
I'll send gifts to you later.

107
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,959
Please show some mercy.

108
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,750
Do you think
we're giving you a hard time?

109
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,160
Are you apologizing to us

110
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,679
because you think
you did something wrong

111
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,839
or because you fear

112
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,799
the power of the high officials?

113
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,959
Making up stuff
and taking revenge out of anger

114
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,119
is bullying.

115
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:47,760
Using the influence of high officials
to intimidate others

116
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,839
is also bullying.

117
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,279
There is no difference between them.

118
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,040
We are all the people
of the Eastern Capital.

119
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:55,679
We drink water from the Bian River

120
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,920
and we live in Kaifeng Prefecture.

121
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,160
After such a serious natural disaster,

122
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:00,559
no one feels good.

123
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:03,320
You care about the people

124
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,839
and the river bank.

125
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:07,519
There is nothing wrong

126
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:08,799
with lecturing Young Master Chi.

127
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:11,480
After all, he's always up to no good

128
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,359
and has been unruly.

129
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,720
Since he has a reputation
of a swaggering bully,

130
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,480
he deserves to be called names.

131
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:21,365
That's right.

132
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,000
Why are you scolding me?

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,279
I was defending you.

134
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:27,760
But even in this case,

135
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:28,920
it was also him

136
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,959
who came here early in the morning

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,675
and led us to dredge the river
and repair the bank.

138
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,760
Yes, some of us are tradesmen
and porters.

139
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,000
Some of us are female merchants.

140
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,239
We're not as graceful as scholars

141
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,079
nor as brave as officials.

142
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,600
But without us carrying baskets

143
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:44,720
and selling wine and tea in the streets,

144
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,119
the Eastern Capital
wouldn't be so prosperous,

145
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,440
and the Great Song
wouldn't be so peaceful.

146
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,399
Just like the Bian River is indispensable
to the Eastern Capital,

147
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,559
we are also indispensable
to the Great Song.

148
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,839
Well said!

149
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,119
- Well said!
- Yeah!

150
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:58,320
- Great!
- Yeah!

151
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,480
Well said!

152
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,799
Good!

153
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:06,799
Well said.

154
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:10,200
Write down what Ms. Zhao said
and memorize it.

155
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,200
Okay!

156
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:13,200
- Well said!
- Well said!

157
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,600
I was wrong.

158
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,640
Ms. Zhao, please enlighten me.

159
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,239
The best way
to clear the misunderstanding

160
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,320
is to make your enemy a friend.

161
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,559
Superintendent, as long as you share
weal and woe with the civilians,

162
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,959
I believe your good name
will spread far and wide.

163
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,320
Folks,

164
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,400
Superintendent would like to lead us
to repair the river channel.

165
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,799
What do you say?

166
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,850
- Okay!
- Okay!

167
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,000
I owe you a favor, Ms. Zhao.

168
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,479
Follow me, guys.

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,679
Let's work!

170
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:49,880
- Yes!
- I'll go with you!

171
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,840
- Lyu Wu, follow me!
- Yes!

172
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:51,900
Let's work.

173
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:56,975
Pan'er.

174
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:28,000
Father.

175
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:29,599
Hui.

176
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,599
What's wrong?

177
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:36,500
Ouyang Xu

178
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:38,520
is back.

179
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:40,280
I know.

180
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,599
Has he been here?

181
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,280
No.

182
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,919
But he sent me a letter

183
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,640
and this.

184
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,080
What is it?

185
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:05,400
Father.

186
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:13,159
Hui. Did you give this to him?

187
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,719
I lost my mind at that time.

188
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,919
He said he missed me
in the Western Capital.

189
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,575
So I...

190
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,200
When our housekeeper
went to get the divorcing letter,

191
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,640
I only asked them

192
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,159
to take my correspondences
with Ouyang Xu.

193
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,479
I forgot about this.

194
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,280
Father, the other half of it

195
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,760
has the character of Hui on it

196
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,799
that I embroidered myself.

197
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:53,640
Don't just cry.

198
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,919
What happened?

199
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:57,119
Did Shen bully you?

200
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,080
No. I've been bullying him,

201
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,000
but he lied to me.

202
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,719
He presented me to his superior
as an object

203
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,479
so that he could get promoted.

204
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,799
- What?
- What?

205
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,359
Luckily, I got out in time.

206
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,359
Pan'er.

207
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,919
You must ask Gu Qianfan
to teach him a lesson.

208
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:22,440
It's over

209
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,000
between Gu Qianfan and I.

210
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,520
He is exactly like Ouyang Xu.

211
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:37,440
He also disappeared suddenly.

212
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,200
We can't open a restaurant now

213
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:44,080
and the teahouse was damaged
by the wind.

214
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,200
Sorry, Pan'er.

215
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,200
It's not your fault.

216
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,239
It's just an unlucky year.

217
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,239
The good thing is
you didn't get hurt by Shen Ruzhuo.

218
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,119
It's my fault for being neglectful.

219
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,760
It's scary indeed
when I think about it now.

220
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:16,479
I almost failed to

221
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,840
take care of you
as your sister entrusted me.

222
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:21,520
No.

223
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,200
I'm responsible for it all along.

224
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,320
But for my vanity and jealousy,

225
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:31,119
I wouldn't have been used twice

226
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:33,679
by Shen Ruzhuo and Zhou She.

227
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,400
If I hadn't lost my temper and left,

228
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,080
it wouldn't have turned out like this.

229
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,880
You always advise me

230
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,760
not to rest my hopes on others.

231
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,599
But I always capitalized on my talent

232
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,640
in hopes of meeting someone

233
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,559
who would take me seriously
and cherish me

234
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:56,960
the way Shi Chong treated Lyu Zhu.

235
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:01,799
That's why I made mistakes
over and over again.

236
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,760
Fortunately,

237
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,520
I finally woke up
from the dream yesterday

238
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,400
and took revenge on Shen Ruzhuo.

239
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:14,719
I put in every ounce of resentment

240
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,640
I had when I was abused by Zhou She.

241
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,280
I got him fall on his sword
and ruined his reputation

242
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,919
to let him know

243
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:26,440
that it cost blood to lie to a woman.

244
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,479
Blood?

245
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,880
What did you do last night?

246
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,400
No one was killed, right?

247
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,840
Don't worry. I didn't lose control.

248
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,200
I just made him suffer a little bit.

249
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:43,200
Besides, I have something on him.

250
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,080
He's not going to play any tricks.

251
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
I've come to my senses.

252
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:50,719
Well, the strength of character

253
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,640
is not only
the pursuit of scholar-officials,

254
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,320
but also the foundation
of being a woman.

255
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,159
Whether it's a teahouse or a restaurant,

256
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,599
as long as we run it on our own

257
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,239
and don't steal, rob,
flatter, or prostitute,

258
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,239
the money we make

259
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:08,039
is no different
from the money made by noble people.

260
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,840
So what if the teahouse was damaged?

261
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,760
Even the dock can be rebuilt.

262
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,919
We can also start over.

263
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,239
If there is no money,

264
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,760
I have some jewelry

265
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,919
worth a lot of money.

266
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,599
I can also play the pipa.

267
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,359
I'm gonna make a lot of money.

268
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,479
It's not about money.

269
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,440
I've lost my drive.

270
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,280
I don't have the strength
to do business anymore.

271
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:39,719
I want to go back to Qiantang.

272
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,719
Pan'er.

273
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:45,760
When the three of us decided
to stay in the Eastern Capital,

274
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:49,440
the most essential reason
was not Gu Qianfan.

275
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,000
It's because we refused
to accept our fate.

276
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,880
You could take Ouyang Xu as a dead man.

277
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,919
Why can't you do the same thing
to Gu Qianfan?

278
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,520
Why should we forget
our original aspiration

279
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,520
for a man or a storm?

280
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,000
You're right.

281
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,679
I refuse to accept my fate.

282
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:16,919
Well, if we are going
to open a shop again,

283
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,119
should it be a teashop or a tavern?

284
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,679
Considering the condition
of the teahouse,

285
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,840
it will take a lot of time and money

286
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,719
to repair it.

287
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:29,239
It's okay! You have me!

288
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,159
I have a restaurant and I have money!

289
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,599
What are you doing?

290
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:35,159
Nothing.

291
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,880
I just want to join hands
with you three.

292
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:40,440
During all these years
in all corners of the country,

293
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:42,919
the most important thing
for me is my reputation.

294
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,719
When I saw

295
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,679
Superintendent Ren was speechless today,

296
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,000
I've never been so proud in my life.

297
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:52,000
Besides, what Ms. Zhao said today

298
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:54,039
hit the right note with me.

299
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:55,559
Well,

300
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,479
we had a feud before,

301
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:00,440
but I won't mention it anymore.

302
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,479
As the old saying goes,

303
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,400
no discord, no concord.

304
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,640
We're gonna be good buddies from now on.

305
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,840
Come on, give me a hug.

306
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,479
Get off!

307
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:13,200
Pan'er, don't trust him.

308
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,239
He knew that Shen Ruzhuo
was trying to hurt me

309
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,119
and he still asked Haohao
not to tell me.

310
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,039
Don't talk nonsense, Pipa Siren.

311
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,119
Let me explain.

312
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:22,440
I won't listen to a play boy.

313
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:24,359
That's not true.

314
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,280
Our unpleasant history is in the past.

315
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,840
Let me explain. Let me explain.

316
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,440
Get away!

317
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,719
Don't hold me up.

318
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:32,840
Stop her!

319
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,599
Master, Ms. Zhao just saved your life.

320
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:35,239
Cut the crap!

321
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:35,960
I'll fire the both of you

322
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
if you can't stop her!

323
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,559
Go now!

324
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,960
My butt.

325
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,119
Are you an idiot?

326
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:44,640
How could you drop me like that
even if I told you so?

327
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,640
Wait for me!

328
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,200
Wait for me!

329
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,919
Chase her!

330
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,479
Ms. Zhao!

331
00:16:54,425 --> 00:16:55,200
Stop! Stop!

332
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,100
Ms. Zhao!

333
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,825
Don't run!

334
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,640
- Stop!
- Come back!

335
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,239
Ms. Zhao!

336
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:00,719
- Don't run!
- Stop!

337
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,559
Surround them!

338
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,320
Ms. Zhao!

339
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,520
Ms. Zhao!

340
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,239
Sorry about this.

341
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:08,359
What do you want?

342
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:09,920
Especially her.

343
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,719
Come on, hold her down.

344
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:11,800
Hold her down.

345
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,920
Do you think you can run away
after hitting me?

346
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,199
Don't you know I have more people?

347
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:17,040
Chi Pan, are you crazy?

348
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,959
I'm not crazy!

349
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,760
I just want you to hear me out.

350
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,680
Don't you dare hurt Sanniang?

351
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,550
I...!

352
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,000
Du Changfeng, what are you doing here?

353
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:31,018
Oh!

354
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:35,479
Does it break? Does it break?

355
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:36,950
Sanniang, I'm here to protect you.

356
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,280
How did you get here?

357
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,400
I went to your teahouse.

358
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,560
It collapsed.

359
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,719
There was a lot of blood on the floor.

360
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,199
I thought something happened to you

361
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:46,160
and we would be separated forever.

362
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,920
Are you hurt...

363
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
I'm okay!

364
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,680
What blood are you talking about?

365
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,640
A jar of red fruit drink broke.

366
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,800
Du Changfeng, are you nuts?

367
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,239
I was talking to the three of them.

368
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:57,359
Does it have anything to do with you?

369
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,520
Look what you did to me!

370
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,560
I can't bear to see you

371
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,719
bullying weak girls.

372
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,880
Weak girls?

373
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,160
Is she weak?

374
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,079
She even threw you in the river.
Do you call that weak?

375
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,839
You three beat me this hard.

376
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm the weak one!

377
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,640
I'm in so much pain, He Si.

378
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:14,880
I miss my mother right now.

379
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,920
Young Master, don't cry.

380
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,280
What else can you do
except call me Young Master?

381
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,760
Take me to the hospital.

382
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,479
Okay, okay. The hospital.

383
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:23,280
Let's go.

384
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Hold on.

385
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,280
Zhao Pan'er, don't leave

386
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,040
if you have a conscience.

387
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,920
Young Master! Young Master!

388
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:33,079
Young Master!

389
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:34,359
Make way!

390
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:34,839
Young Master!

391
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:35,560
Make way!

392
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,680
- Make way!
- Go to the hospital!

393
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,680
Young Master!

394
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,000
Are you all right, Young Master?

395
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,719
Be careful. Be careful.

396
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:40,560
Young Master, hang in there!

397
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,599
He looks badly hurt.

398
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:46,199
I'll check him out.

399
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,425
It hurts!

400
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,199
No.

401
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm dying. I'm dying.

402
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,079
Young Master, hang in there!

403
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,920
Is he gonna be all right?

404
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:19,560
Don't worry.
Bad people usually live long.

405
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,599
He won't die.

406
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,760
(Consolidate Foundation and Extend Life)

407
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,850
Don't worry.

408
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:25,439
I'm the one who hit him.

409
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,319
If he is dead,

410
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,959
I'll just go to jail.

411
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:30,959
I'm not worried.

412
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,239
Have you ever seen

413
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,839
a dying man screaming so loud?

414
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,479
Why do you have to meddle in this?

415
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,280
Do you think I would let him bully me?

416
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:41,719
You're a Presented Scholar at least.

417
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,439
Can you use your brain

418
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:45,160
before you do anything?

419
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:46,959
If anything happens to him,

420
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:49,199
doesn't it mean your ten years
of hard study will go to waste?

421
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:52,280
I was wrong. I know
you are worried about me

422
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,239
Who's worried about you?

423
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,319
Don't flatter yourself.

424
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:33,319
You're finally back.

425
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,199
I came back as soon as
I received the secret message.

426
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,280
How's Chief? Is he awake?

427
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,439
The gold needles are used
for bloodletting,

428
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:38,199
but he is still in a coma.

429
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:39,880
The doctor said his condition
is worse than expected

430
00:20:40,175 --> 00:20:41,280
with the old wounds and new ones.

431
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,040
How did this happen?

432
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:45,119
Chief.

433
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,760
You should leave. It's okay.

434
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,959
Minister Xiao has been here
several times lately.

435
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:55,439
He tried to move Chief
to somewhere else yesterday.

436
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,680
I don't understand
what's going on between them,

437
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,760
but I remember

438
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,280
Chief had a beef with the Xiao family.

439
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,719
I used Chief's order as an excuse

440
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,520
and didn't let them take him away.

441
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:04,880
You are the closest with Chief.

442
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:05,839
What to do now?

443
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,079
What to do?

444
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,119
I'm not a doctor. How would I know?

445
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,160
By the way,

446
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,160
did you tell Pan'er about this?

447
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:15,680
Who?

448
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:17,959
Chief's fiancée,

449
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:18,800
Zhao Pan'er.

450
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:22,000
Is Mr. Gu going to get married?

451
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:22,959
Cut it out.

452
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,119
Miss Zhao did come
to see Mr. Gu some time ago.

453
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:28,800
She looked anxious.

454
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,280
I sent someone to inform him.

455
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,359
Miss Zhao has also been here a few times

456
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,880
since Chief got back to the capital.

457
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,079
But Deputy Director Lei asked us

458
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,680
to keep Mr. Gu's injury a secret.

459
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,800
So I asked the doorman to stop her.

460
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,439
What a bonehead.

461
00:21:43,175 --> 00:21:43,959
Well,

462
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:45,760
I need you to get me the men

463
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,599
who had been keeping an eye
on the teahouse.

464
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,599
And also, send someone to my house

465
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,239
and ask my mother

466
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:50,880
if she has seen Pan'er lately.

467
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,599
Okay.

468
00:21:53,075 --> 00:21:53,875
Eh?

469
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,040
What's this?

470
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,400
A silver knife.

471
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:58,520
The doctor said using the gold needle
for bloodletting is too slow.

472
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,920
A silver knife might work.

473
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,839
But Mr. Gu has lost a lot of blood.

474
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,719
I dare not take the responsibility.

475
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,319
He will die if he keeps
staying unconscious.

476
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,000
I'll be fully responsible
no matter what happens.

477
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:16,560
Do it.

478
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,425
Please leave.

479
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:04,100
(Superb Medical Skill)
Ms. Zhao!

480
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,479
Only you can save our Young Master.

481
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:13,280
Young Master Chi?

482
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:13,925
Yes.

483
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,920
What's wrong with him?

484
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,400
It hurts!

485
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,079
He has been afraid of needles
since childhood.

486
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:25,079
He refuses to get
acupuncture treatment now.

487
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:27,520
He said he will let the doctor treat him

488
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:29,350
if you go to see him.

489
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,400
Ms. Zhao.

490
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:35,640
I'll go.

491
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,400
Well...

492
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,650
You...

493
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,079
Ms. Zhao, he wants you there.

494
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,719
It hurts!

495
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:47,520
No.

496
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,359
I'm dying. I'm dying.

497
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,350
You won't die if you let the doctor
insert needles into you.

498
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,959
Well, can you hear me out

499
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,319
before I die?

500
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,450
Go ahead.

501
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,160
Why is it you?

502
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,320
I don't want to talk to you!

503
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,640
I don't want to talk to you!

504
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:16,200
I want to talk to Pan'er!

505
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,475
I know there have been

506
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,599
many misunderstandings between us.

507
00:24:38,575 --> 00:24:40,295
But you just said

508
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,920
the best way

509
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,280
to clear the misunderstanding

510
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,599
is making your enemy a friend.

511
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,475
You must walk the talk, right?

512
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,119
Go on.

513
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:54,400
I wasn't joking when I said

514
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:56,319
I want to join hands with you.

515
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:58,239
As you know,

516
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:03,050
I'm the Head of 12 Guilds
in the Eastern Capital.

517
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,439
There is one thing
that bothers me the most.

518
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,880
I can't rank with

519
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:12,400
the restaurant gild.

520
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,880
I do own a restaurant

521
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,239
called Yong'an Restaurant.

522
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,800
Everything is good about it

523
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,319
except for the bleak business.

524
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,319
No matter how much money
I give to the guild,

525
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,000
the owners of the registered restaurants
still look down on me.

526
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,280
The most irritating thing

527
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,839
is that they won't even allow me
to sit at the table

528
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,439
when they offer sacrifices
to the kitchen god every year.

529
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,560
Every time I thought about it,

530
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:36,839
I got so furious

531
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:38,880
that I lost the card game
more than ten times in a row.

532
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,239
All I saw was darkness

533
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,760
before I met you guys.

534
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,839
But ever since I met you,

535
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,959
my world has been lightened up.

536
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,760
Well, Sanniang's cooking skills

537
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,920
and Yinzhang's pipa

538
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,599
conquered me a long time ago.

539
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:02,319
Your spirit and ability

540
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,959
really impressed me today.

541
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,880
What you said

542
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,775
really spoke my mind.

543
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:10,640
Why can't merchants

544
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,520
be proud?

545
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,359
Hold on a second.

546
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:14,479
Who are you to call her Sanniang?

547
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,400
Don't call me Yinzhang.

548
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,800
Well, I'll still call you Pipa Siren,

549
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:19,560
okay?

550
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:22,640
Could you show me some sympathy?

551
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:25,959
You guys did this to me

552
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,439
without an apology!

553
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:28,839
Now you even won't let me

554
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,520
call your names?

555
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,719
Does justice still exist?

556
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,719
Ouch, it hurts.

557
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:33,479
Get down to business.

558
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,520
Get down to business.

559
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,439
I think

560
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:45,680
if you could run a teahouse so well,

561
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,280
you would be able

562
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,719
to run a restaurant well, too.

563
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,400
So I'd like to officially
invite you three

564
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,920
to run Yong'an Restaurant for me.

565
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,119
If it loses money, I'll bear the loss.

566
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,959
If it makes a profit,
we'll split it 50-50.

567
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,079
As long as you can
fulfill my lifelong dream

568
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:02,880
of changing my nickname

569
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,150
to the awe-inspiring
Thirteenth Young Master,

570
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,239
I'll do anything.

571
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,839
The enmity is too deep between us.

572
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:14,280
I'll never forget

573
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,719
you made me kneel down and sing.

574
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,640
I don't want to work
with someone like you.

575
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,119
Did he make you kneel down?

576
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,319
Stay away! Stay away!

577
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:23,959
I'm afraid of you.

578
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,319
I once said

579
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,280
I don't deserve to be a human
without avenging this humiliation.

580
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,479
That was a misunderstanding.

581
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,920
Gu Qianfan

582
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,439
also threw me out before.

583
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:37,280
What's the big deal?

584
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,000
I'm not finished!

585
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:41,375
Wait for me!

586
00:27:42,575 --> 00:27:43,560
Take them off me!

587
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,950
(Genuine and Kindhearted)
Take them off me!

588
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,520
(Genuine and Kindhearted)
Why did you put so many needles on me?

589
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,119
Take them off me! Now!

590
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,199
(Superb Medical Skill)
Three ladies!

591
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,439
Three ladies, listen to me!

592
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,719
Three ladies!

593
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,319
Hold on! Hold on!

594
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,000
I made you kowtow three times that day.

595
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,839
Today I kowtowed to you four times.

596
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,280
Is it okay now?

597
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:34,520
Ms. Zhao, I mean it.

598
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:36,719
I've apologized to you
in front of all these people.

599
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:38,040
I can't be more sincere.

600
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:39,599
Please trust me.

601
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,640
How about this,

602
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,079
as long as you will run
Yong'an Restaurant,

603
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,199
I promise

604
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,040
I'll have 100 or so

605
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,640
cute boys

606
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,800
follow you around every day

607
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:52,319
to massage your back
and pour tea for you.

608
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:56,479
I'm sure if Gu Qianfan sees this,

609
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:57,640
he will die of anger

610
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,719
and then come alive for being too angry.

611
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:00,119
Okay?

612
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:05,560
Three ladies, I'm begging you.

613
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,280
Don't go back to Qiantang, okay?

614
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,920
Qiantang?

615
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:09,680
Who is going back to Qiantang?

616
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,319
They're going back to Qiantang.
I heard it with my own ears.

617
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,239
Trust me, they are going back
to Qiantang.

618
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:13,000
Really.

619
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
No, no.

620
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,119
Absolutely no.

621
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,199
Who are you to say no?

622
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:17,280
Does it have anything to do with you?

623
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:18,119
Because...

624
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,599
Because...

625
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,439
Say it.

626
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:24,520
Because Ms. Song has been registered
in the Music Division.

627
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,119
She can't relocate
without authorization.

628
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:28,119
If they leave,

629
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,040
are they going to leave Ms. Song alone
in the Eastern Capital?

630
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,880
It's not appropriate.

631
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,239
Well said, well said!

632
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
Thank you for saying that.

633
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,560
I wasn't hit for nothing.

634
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,920
Three ladies.

635
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,560
Even if you won't stay
for the sake of my serious injury,

636
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:46,040
can you stay

637
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,319
for the sake
of Changfeng's sincere love?

638
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,319
Sanniang.

639
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:50,319
What are you talking about?
What sincere love?

640
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,719
Nothing...

641
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:55,319
You haven't made
your relationship public yet?

642
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,625
No.

643
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,599
Sorry. Sorry.

644
00:29:58,959 --> 00:29:59,920
Well,

645
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:03,000
I'm talking about Changfeng and me.

646
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,599
His true love for me!

647
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,400
We are not biological brothers,

648
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,000
but we are closer
than biological brothers.

649
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,760
Right?

650
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:12,520
We hit it off at first sight.

651
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,880
- No discord, no concord.
- Yes, yes.

652
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,450
Enough.

653
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,199
Sanniang, what do you think?

654
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,280
I think it's okay.

655
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,319
Yinzhang?

656
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:39,880
Will you really bear the loss

657
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,079
and split the profit 50-50 with us

658
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,760
as you said?

659
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,560
Swearing to God is useless..

660
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,640
Let's sign a contract now.

661
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:48,599
I'll run the restaurant.

662
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,319
Sanniang will be
in charge of the kitchen,

663
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,199
and Yinzhang will be
in charge of the entertainment.

664
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,640
There is also Zhaodi
who will be in charge of serving guests.

665
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,839
We'll talk about the salary later.

666
00:30:57,239 --> 00:31:00,000
You can supervise
the running of the restaurant,

667
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:01,280
the personnel and the accounting,

668
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:04,160
but you and your men mustn't intervene.

669
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,239
No problem.

670
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,160
Do you hear that?

671
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,400
- Yes!
- Yes!

672
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,359
The contract is for one year.

673
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,079
If we are not satisfied,

674
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,959
we're free to leave anytime

675
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,880
without paying you anything,

676
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:17,680
and you shall not hinder us.

677
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:20,560
Footboy, bring the paper.

678
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:21,800
Hurry!

679
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:22,920
Coming!

680
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,359
Here is my fingerprint on it.

681
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:44,000
You can write the contract yourself.

682
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,100
Am I sincere enough now?

683
00:32:08,439 --> 00:32:09,160
Chi Pan.

684
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,400
Why do you suddenly trust us so much?

685
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:13,640
Why did you

686
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,319
stand up for me earlier?

687
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:19,040
Although I can be

688
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,400
like a rogue sometimes,

689
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:26,040
and I'm also domineering sometimes,

690
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:28,640
I'm still a man with wisdom and insight.

691
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,040
I've been looking for someone

692
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:33,319
who can work with me

693
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:35,040
to make Yong'an Restaurant famous

694
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,760
and piss off those arrogant old fellows

695
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,359
in the restaurant guild.

696
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,400
Three ladies.

697
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,040
Are you with me?

698
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:15,959
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

699
00:33:17,725 --> 00:33:18,560
Yeah!

700
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,959
Ms. Zhao, please.

701
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,199
Let's go.

702
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:27,040
Ms. Sun, please.

703
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,959
Ms. Song, please.

704
00:33:32,439 --> 00:33:34,280
Well, I'll make an announcement!

705
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:35,359
From now on,

706
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,199
this will be our head manager,
the second-in-command,

707
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:39,160
and the little manager!

708
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:41,199
Be respectful, do you hear me?

709
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:42,479
- Yes!
- Yes!

710
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:43,520
Repeat after me,

711
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:46,319
best wishes to the three managers!

712
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,640
- Best wishes to the three managers!
- Best wishes to the three managers!

713
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,650
Well, is this ostentatious enough?

714
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:57,959
I have just one question.

715
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,680
Go ahead.

716
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,760
Where is

717
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,359
Yong'an Restaurant?

718
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,560
Right here.

719
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,679
Why is it so quiet here?

720
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:13,840
Because there are no guests.

721
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,520
The restaurant is not in operation now.

722
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,120
So I've kept a bunch of idlers here

723
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,439
who can gamble with me when I have time.

724
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,000
What are you looking at?

725
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:26,679
I'm thinking

726
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,360
how Haohao fell for you
in the first place.

727
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:29,840
How can someone like you

728
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,239
become the head of so many guilds?

729
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,840
I'm capable. Any problem with that?

730
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,560
Can't I gamble and do business
at the same time?

731
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,320
Let's make it clear.

732
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,199
I've moved on from my relationship
with Zhang Haohao.

733
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,639
If you mention Zhao Haohao again,

734
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,239
I'll talk about Shen Ruzhuo
in front of you.

735
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:44,919
- Don't you dare!
- Don't you dare!

736
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,919
I dare not.

737
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,399
Anyone can snap at me now.

738
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,520
Who begged me

739
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,360
for mercy in tears

740
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,479
when just coming
to the Eastern Capital?

741
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,600
Don't forget
we just signed the contract.

742
00:34:57,879 --> 00:34:59,600
As the third manager
of Yong'an Restaurant,

743
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,040
I can lose all of your money
at any time.

744
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,080
Am I right, Master Twelve?

745
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,040
Don't call me that!

746
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,080
Lead the way.

747
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:07,900
Oh.

748
00:35:09,225 --> 00:35:09,959
This way, please.

749
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,439
You walk ahead.

750
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,000
Young Master, morning.

751
00:35:25,439 --> 00:35:26,560
It's noon now, still morning?

752
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,159
Come over!

753
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,919
Are you still sleeping?

754
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,919
What time is it now?

755
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,919
Come down! Hurry up!

756
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:33,879
Come down. Hurry.

757
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:35,120
Stand still.

758
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,040
Come down, hurry.

759
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,050
Come on.

760
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,679
Here. Stand here.

761
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,800
Be quick.

762
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:45,800
Greet Ms. Zhao, Ms. Sun and Ms. Song.

763
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:48,439
They're the head manager,
the second manager and the third manager.

764
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,919
From now on, Yong'an Restaurant
will be at Ms. Zhao's command.

765
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,760
If you understand,

766
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,120
hand over the money,
the key, and the ledger.

767
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,679
Go ahead.

768
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:55,239
Lyu Wu,

769
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,950
go to the kitchen and get the cook here.

770
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:57,575
Yes.

771
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,040
If you don't understand,

772
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,120
kneel down on the street
and figure it out!

773
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,879
Do you understand now?

774
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,840
- Yes.
- Yes.

775
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,825
Why don't you start moving?

776
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,080
Do I have to kick you?

777
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,679
Hurry!

778
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:05,360
Okay. Okay.

779
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,280
Let's go. Hurry.

780
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,520
Young Master, here is the ledger.

781
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,800
I told you to listen to Ms. Zhao
from now on.

782
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:12,300
Oh.

783
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,000
Here is the ledger.

784
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,840
Here is the key.

785
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,399
The money is in the storeroom.

786
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,925
You didn't use
the Four Pillars of Destiny.

787
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:27,639
It's just a day-to-day account.

788
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:31,159
How many guests are here every day?

789
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,399
How many courses are there on the menu?

790
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:36,520
How much is the ingredients money?

791
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:37,600
How much food is left?

792
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,719
How much is wasted?

793
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,275
Yes.

794
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:48,560
Here is the cook.

795
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,075
Are you in charge of the kitchen?

796
00:36:50,094 --> 00:36:50,600
Yes.

797
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:52,600
How many stoves
are there in the kitchen?

798
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,080
How many dish cooks
and staple-food cooks do you have?

799
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,450
Well...

800
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,040
All right, I'll check it out myself.

801
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,400
This way.

802
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,159
See?

803
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,159
These managers I hired

804
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,000
are all competent..

805
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:08,959
Young Master, smart move!

806
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,000
In this case,

807
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,040
there is hope for Yong'an Restaurant.

808
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,280
Can anyone take us to the east wing?

809
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,399
The east wing.

810
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,879
The east wing is over here.

811
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:26,120
Young Master.

812
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:27,399
Coming.

813
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,239
Has Yong'an Restaurant

814
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,800
always been like this?

815
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:33,080
You tell me.

816
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,000
It's an unregistered restaurant.

817
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,159
We can't sell alcohol.

818
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:38,320
What else can we do

819
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:39,280
besides buying food, selling food
and serving food?

820
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:41,520
No wonder your men are not clear.

821
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,919
You're not clear yourself.

822
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,439
Why would I pay you

823
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,560
if I could figure it out myself?

824
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,159
It's not like I have so much money
that I want to make it burn.

825
00:37:49,879 --> 00:37:51,560
You lost 1,000 strings of coins a year.

826
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:53,800
You do have a lot of money to burn.

827
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:55,600
1,000 strings of coins?

828
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:58,600
If I had known that,

829
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,040
I might have closed it

830
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,439
and lost the money in the casino.

831
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,479
But I'm rich.

832
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:04,959
Sometimes I just don't remember

833
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,959
such trifles as 1,000 strings of coins.

834
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,000
1,000 strings of coins turn out
to be just a trifle

835
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,800
for you, Young Master Chi.

836
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:14,800
A slip of the tongue.

837
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,199
I didn't mean to pick on you

838
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:20,000
when I didn't lend you
300 strings of coins.

839
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,439
I was just playing a joke.

840
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,760
Lyu Wu!

841
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,000
- Yes.
- Come here! Hurry!

842
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:29,560
Go to the pawn shop
to get the deed of the teahouse

843
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,560
and give it back to Pan'er.

844
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:31,199
Yes.

845
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:31,919
Hurry up.

846
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:33,000
Take me over there.

847
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,040
This way, please.

848
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,479
Marry him?

849
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:42,320
Father, are you serious?

850
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,879
Yes, I am.

851
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,719
You were the one who cried so hard

852
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,360
and wanted to marry him.

853
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:52,239
You got yourself into this.

854
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:54,800
If you had listened to my advice

855
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,840
and become sober and prudent,

856
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,679
how would you end up being like this?

857
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:02,479
It's not too late now.

858
00:39:03,439 --> 00:39:04,479
I'll fight him with my life

859
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:05,639
A life for a life.

860
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,159
Ridiculous.

861
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:12,600
Hui.

862
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:14,760
He used to be like an ant

863
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,560
in the Western Capital.

864
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,959
We could squeeze him to death easily.

865
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,320
But now

866
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:21,159
he is a Hanlin Scholar.

867
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:25,399
He is on guard for sure.

868
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:30,000
If anything goes wrong,

869
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:33,520
he'll make a scene
to let everyone know it.

870
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,280
Do you fear such a petty official?

871
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,439
Of course not!

872
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,919
I fear the one behind him.

873
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:45,439
I know

874
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,320
this is not fair to you.

875
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,320
But think about it,

876
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,479
since the ancient times,

877
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,719
has marriage been easy for a woman?

878
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,320
Father.

879
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,239
I...

880
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:03,800
I'll give you a 30% more dowry.

881
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,879
That's not what I want.

882
00:40:04,879 --> 00:40:08,975
Since Ouyang Xu is quite shrewd now,

883
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:12,000
let him win this time.

884
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:14,080
He'll be nice to you.

885
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,679
But...

886
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,560
As for the past,

887
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,800
just forget about it.

888
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,959
Pan'er, please.

889
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,479
I've heard about what happened
to Wangyue Restaurant.

890
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,639
I'll help you

891
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,320
kick the ass of that scoundrel.

892
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:43,959
Okay?

893
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,239
Don't be mad, ma'am.

894
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,800
Don't call me that.

895
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,479
All right, I won't.

896
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,719
I'm just trying to be respectful.

897
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,320
I have so many men working for me.

898
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,439
When they see me respect you,

899
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,959
they will surely show more respect.

900
00:40:56,439 --> 00:40:58,399
Gu Qianfan is one month younger than me.

901
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:01,479
Don't mention him in front of me again.

902
00:41:01,479 --> 00:41:03,080
No problem, I won't mention him again.

903
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,150
Let me show you the second floor.

904
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,199
Watch the steps.

905
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:14,199
It used to be a pleasure quarter.

906
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,080
The owner sold it to me at a discount.

907
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,239
I turned it into a restaurant later.

908
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:21,000
I don't even know
how to run a restaurant well,

909
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:23,159
not to mention

910
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:24,520
running a pleasure quarter.

911
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,360
So I just leave it this way.

912
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,639
Look, the wood is already rotten.

913
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,520
When I was a child,

914
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,600
my father used to frequent here with me.

915
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,479
I would watch sumo here with my father.

916
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:42,840
There were also puppet shows.

917
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:45,399
It was crowded at that time,

918
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,639
especially at night.

919
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,159
When the lights were on,

920
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,719
people were everywhere

921
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:51,679
upstairs and downstairs.

922
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,040
I would sit right here,

923
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,879
having some sunflower seeds
and pastries,

924
00:41:58,199 --> 00:41:59,040
and play with Gu Qian...

925
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:05,399
Play with the neighborhood kids

926
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:06,760
for the whole night.

927
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,040
I was beside myself with joy back then.

928
00:42:10,439 --> 00:42:11,959
There is also such a place in my heart.

929
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,719
Now

930
00:42:22,479 --> 00:42:23,679
this place fell into disrepair.

931
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,320
But it's always

932
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,520
like heaven in my heart.

933
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,239
That's why I couldn't

934
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:31,520
tear it down and build something else.

935
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,479
Otherwise, in such a good location,

936
00:42:34,479 --> 00:42:35,760
if I had opened a jewelry shop,

937
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,080
I must have made a fortune.

938
00:42:37,479 --> 00:42:38,320
Am I right?
