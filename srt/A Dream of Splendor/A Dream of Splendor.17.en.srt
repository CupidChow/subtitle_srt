17
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,840
When did you come?

18
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,640
I had been here when you ground tea.

19
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,560
So you saw everything?

20
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,200
Saw what?

21
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,120
I ground tea while dancing.

22
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,120
They gossiped about
me being a registered performer.

23
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,120
Pan'er.

24
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,600
Don't call me that.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,880
And don't come over.

26
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Last time I told you

27
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,000
to think clearly about the attitude
with what you should face me

28
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,640
before you come over again.

29
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,640
Have you thought it clearly?

30
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,520
I came to tell you,

31
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,480
I've thought it through.

32
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,440
I fell in love with you.

33
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,040
I want to marry you.

34
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,400
I want to tie the knot with you.

35
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,800
I want to grow old with you.

36
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,400
Are you insane?

37
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,760
Didn't you see

38
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,200
the way I danced in there?

39
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,680
Do you still remember

40
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,040
I put on heavy make up

41
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,680
and flirted with Zhou She?

42
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,760
You know,

43
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,680
except for the face
you're familiar with,

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,840
I have

45
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,240
another face.

46
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,120
You're an official
appointed by the imperial court,

47
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,920
but I used to be a music performer.

48
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,280
And you know what,

49
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,080
after today,

50
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,520
I'm afraid the whole city will know it.

51
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,960
So what?

52
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,360
I'm going to marry you, not them.

53
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,560
But...

54
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,390
There's no but.

55
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,600
Concerning love and relationships,

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,880
I may be slow.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,520
I don't give sweet talks.

58
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,560
But just like you,

59
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,680
once I've made my decision,

60
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,480
I won't regret it.

61
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,320
Noble or humble,

62
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,080
high status or low status,

63
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,520
it really doesn't matter

64
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,320
to a man who lives a violent life

65
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,880
like me.

66
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,040
You just said,

67
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,320
whether the tea-leaves are picked
in the mountain of Qiantang,

68
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,280
or in the imperial tea garden,

69

as long as
they have a long lasting aroma,

70
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,000
they will attract appreciators.

71
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,040
I want to be your appreciator.

72
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,040
I haven't made full preparations.

73
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,120
Would you take this

74
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,000

It's so cool.

It's you.

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,040
Why are you here?

112
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,320
First time strangers,
second time friends.

113
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,600
Yinzhang, you're quite interesting.

114
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,120
You alter at ease

115
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,240
between a fairy pipa master

116
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
and an average person

117
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,720
who helps to serve tea and drinks.

118
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,150
I just don't like one thing.

119
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,320
Why are you like a mouse before a cat

120
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,000
every time you see me?

121
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,440
Last time when I helped your sister,

122
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,640
you kindly invited me over
to listen to you playing pipa.

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,480
But since I informed you of
your opponents' situation,

124
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,960
you haven't talked to me again.

125
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,040
You're really a cruel young lady.

126
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,040
Stay away from me.

127
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,280
I'm not used to
being so close to others.

128
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,880
You're surprisingly strong.

129
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,440
My pipa weighs 16 catties

130
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,600
and I hold it every day.

131
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,440
Surely I'm not weak.

132
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,960
You approach me again and again.

133
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,400
What on earth do you want?

134
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,320
Guess.

135
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
I was married once.

136
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,200
You show me excessive attention

137
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,480
because I'm kind of good-looking.

138
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,200
Moreover, you think I'm a new
official performer in the capital,

139
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,440
who you can dally with at will.

140
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,600
But what Pan'er said yesterday

141
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,680
woke me up completely.

142
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,880
Even though I'm a registered performer,

143
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,520
I can still be self-respecting
and independent.

144
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,800
I'm not a kitten or a puppy

145
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,520
that you can tease at will.

146
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,600
Mr. Shen,

147
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,960
I'm not an innocent young lady.

148
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,000
I got married and divorced.

149
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,960
I sent my ex-husband to prison
personally.

150
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,280
Mr. Shen, you're from a famous family.

151
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,960
Take my advice.

152
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,880
Don't mix with

153
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,840
such a notorious woman like me.

154
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,880
Otherwise, I'm afraid
your reputation will be ruined.

155
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,800
Ms. Song, are you worried about me?

156
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,880
Unfortunately,

157
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,280
I already knew everything about you.

158
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,600
Your case in Huating County

159
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,200
created quite a stir.

160
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,200
Got tattooed on face
and exiled to 3,000 miles.

161
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,760
Ms. Song,
don't you think you're cruel?

162
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,480
You already knew?

163
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,520
Of course I knew everything.

164
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,760
You're timid and cowardly
when problems crop up,

165
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,280
while calm and steady
when you play pipa.

166
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,840
You fear me like I'm a monster.

167
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,760
You were cruel to your ex-husband.

168
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,360
Ms. Song, how many faces do you have?

169
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,400
Be careful.

170
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,040
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,760
I was impetuous.

172
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,600
I just made a joke,

173
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,680
not expecting to scare you.

174
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,240
What on earth do you want?

175
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,560
I just want to know more about you.

176
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,840
You said I paid you excessive attention
because you're kind of good-looking.

177
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,560
You were wrong.

178
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,640
The Shen Family has lasted through
three regimes.

179
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,480
I've seen numerous beauties.

180
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,680
I'm really fond of you,

181
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,680
but it has nothing to do
with your looks.

182
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,240
What first attracted me

183
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,600
were your pipa skills
that reached the acme of perfection.

184
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,960
After I learned about your past,

185
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,280
my pity for you turned to love

186
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,320
and my respect
turned to affection.

187
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,828
(Gao's Mansion)
(Mother, did Ms. Zhao)

188
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:18,640
(Gao's Mansion)
(really have a pariah status?)

189
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,440
Yes. I've been looking into it for days.

190
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,920
The magistrate said she admitted it.

191
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,000
It must be real.

192
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,000
That explains why Ouyang Xu

193
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,000
didn't think properly suddenly.

194
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,200
Instead of being a promising official,

195
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
he'd rather supervise the Taoists,

196
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,840
and leave the capital.

197
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,960
It turns out he was afraid
of being exposed

198
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,920
and ran away.

199
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,960
If she was really engaged to Ouyang,

200
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,720
who broke the pledge,

201
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,680
she is pitiful.

202
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,280
Is she?

203
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,240
Miss Hui is the one who is pitiful.

204
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,840
Shall we tell Miss Hui about it?

205
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,120
No.

206
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,560
But she will find out eventually.

207
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,520
If she's gone,

208
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,520
Miss Hui doesn't have to know about it.

209
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,000
Mother, what are you going to do?

210
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,800
Ms. Song,

211
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,880
you're the top pipa player in Jiangnan.

212
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,480
Beautiful and highly gifted as you are,

213
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,040
you were cheated
and tortured by a villain.

214
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,640
You must be extremely painful.

215
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,360
That's why you think you're notorious.

216
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
But, Ms. Song,

217
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,040
like player, like tune.

218
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,200
Your tune is open and bright.

219
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,760
Why do you care about

220
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,640
a little dust on the bright pearl?

221
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,720
You really don't think I'm dirty

222
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,840
and humble?

223
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,840
I don't.

224
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,080
I think as a delicate woman,

225
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,320
you swallowed humiliation
to wreak revenge.

226
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,760
It reflects wisdom.

227
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,840
You went far to the capital

228
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,080
and started a business
with your friends.

229
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,560
It reflects courage.

230
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,120
I'm just an average man.

231
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,480
In the face of such a wise, brave

232
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,760
and glamorous young lady,

233
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,800
how can I not be attracted?

234
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,880
Ms. Song, you may have heard that,

235
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,000
when a reckless young man

236
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,640
doesn't know how to face

237
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,440
his favorite young lady,

238
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,520
he may tease her and bully her.

239
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,800
I used to think

240
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,160
it's just a cliché in dramas,

241
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,760
not expecting that

242
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,000
I would make the same mistake.

243
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,640
I...

244
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,640
I'm really...

245
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,280
Ms. Song,

246
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,280
since I repent

247
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,320
my error sincerely,

248
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,200
would you stop being mad at me

249
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,120
and give me another chance?

250
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,840
Please don't do this.

251
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,720
I won't blame you.

252
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,280
Really?

253
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,760
In that case,

254
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,680
would you let me

255
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,240
be your duster

256
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,560
and brush away the old dust
covering on you?

257
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,480
No.

258
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,200
Yinzhang.

259
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,320
Sanniang, I'm cleaning upstairs.

260
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,560
Do you need my help?

261
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,040
No, I can do it myself.

262
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,600
Leave.

263
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,040
Don't you like me playing pipa?

264
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,240
Leave now. I'll play for you next time.

265
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,480
It's a deal.

266
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,560
But

267
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,120
not in here.

268
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,800
Jinming Pond outside Shuntian Gate.

269
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,080
You haven't been there yet, have you?

270
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,120
It's a royal garden.

271
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,000
It only opens to the public
for several months a year.

272
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,480
Now it's almost time
to close the garden.

273
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,800
I'll wait for you by the pond
in three days.

274
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,320
I want you to play only for me.

275
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,240
You always wear this hairpin.

276
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,920
I'll keep it as a proof in case
you go back on your words.

277
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,920
See you.

278
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:22,800
Move!

279
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,110
Step aside!

280
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,160
Move.

281
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,000
Move.

282
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,840
Sir, your foot just got better.

283
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,080
If you want to pick on Zhao Pan'er,

284
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,360
there's no need to hurry.

285
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,120
How can I not hurry?

286
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,000
Because of her,

287
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,280
Haohao wouldn't talk to me now.

288
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,840
If I don't teach her a lesson,

289
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,840
I won't stop feeling oppressed.

290
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,880
Don't think I don't know.

291
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,120
Yesterday you interceded for He Si.

292
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,400
You betrayed me for the sake of glory.

293
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,520
I'm going to deal with her first.

294
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,280
Then I'll fix you guys.

295
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,320
Send a message to Half-hidden.

296
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,400
Tell them someone is going to
pick on them.

297
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,440
Leave quickly
if they don't want to die. Go.

298
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,480
Why does the boy run so fast?

299
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,320
Are you going to fight, too?

300
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,760
Run!

301
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,320
There's a fight. Everybody run!

302
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,360
(Half-hidden)
You're going to have trouble. Run!

303
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,000
Run fast.

304
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,920
There's a fight. Everybody run.

305
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,720
Move.

306
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,320
Run fast.

307
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,400
Who are they?

308
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,920
Half-hidden hired guards.

309
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,720
Sir, they're their guards.

310
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,400
Don't be afraid.

311
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,080
What's the noise?

312
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
Two groups are having a fight.

313
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,720
Close the door.

314
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,600
OK.

315
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,160
This is Mahang Street.

316
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,080
There are unavoidably
grumpy businessmen passing by.

317
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,800
Don't mind them.

318
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,680
Young Master is hurt.

319
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,920
My feet.

320
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,040
Young Master is hurt.

321
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,320
Sir.

322
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,360
Sir. Hurry.

323
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,120
Put me down.

324
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,880
I can still fight.

325
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,960
Put me down.

326
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,360
Run.

327
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,000
Young Master is hurt.

328
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,040
Run fast.

329
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:07,540
(Half-hidden)

330
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,640
Be gentle.

331
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,200
You deserve it.

332
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,960
You'd better
not pick on Zhao Pan'er again.

333
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,760
I told you last time

334
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,800
I'm working with them.

335
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,720
The big show of the Music Division
will open in seven days.

336
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,880
I'm counting on Song Yinzhang

337
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,560
to back me by pipa.

338
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,520
If you really smashed Half-hidden,

339
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,800
I won't let you off.

340
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,280
I didn't say I would smash her teahouse.

341
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,400
I'm the head of the Tea Guild.

342
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,880
Since she opened the teahouse,

343
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,720
she has never sent me any gifts.

344
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,160
Can't I go to her teahouse
and discipline her?

345
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,800
Now you're disciplined.

346
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,920
Did you find out?

347
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,960
Where did the scumbags come from?

348
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
No, I haven't yet.

349
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,560
But,

350
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,560
our men tore a piece of cloth

351
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,080
off the clothes of their head.

352
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
It's cotton cloth actually.

353
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,920
- Look.
- Cotton cloth?

354
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,720
It's expensive.

355
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,320
I've only seen businessmen from
Guangdong and Guangxi wearing this.

356
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,280
Ordinary yard guards can't afford it.

357
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,720
Is there

358
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,960
someone behind Zhao Pan'er?

359
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,400
Maybe Yinzhang asked
the Music Administrator for help.

360
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,600
If it really involved officials...

361
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,600
Officials?

362
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,560
We can't offend them.

363
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,880
I'll ask Zhao Pan'er in a few days.

364
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,080
As for you,

365
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,400
don't ever pick on them again.

366
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,920
Every time you did,
you got more embarrassed.

367
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,320
Why bother?

368
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,540
(Dengyun Restaurant)

369
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,080
Welcome.

370
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,760
Bring us your best snacks

371
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,440
and drinks.

372
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,080
Yes.

373
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,960
It isn't the first time
we come to a restaurant together.

374
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,560
Why do I feel out of place today?

375
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,240
It's different now.

376
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,600
Why do you smirk?

377
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,680
I guess their drinks

378
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,160
are not as good as yours.

379
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,320
Strangely enough,

380
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,040
yesterday,

381
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,320
you were impatient to me

382
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
and were anxious to drive me out.

383
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,000
Why do you become so gentle today?

384
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,680
Because I was scared

385
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,520
on hearing your words yesterday.

386
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,120
Then I got back and thought,

387
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,280
now that you've decided to

388
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,200
be with me,

389
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,640
why should I care?

390
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,880
Besides, you're cute.

391
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,760
I have nothing to lose.

392
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,720
Just because I'm cute?

393
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,000
Of course.

394
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,040
The young man on the path
is casual and elegant.

395
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,680
I shall marry him
and spend my life with him.

396
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,520
Though being discarded...

397
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,360
Enough. Stop reciting.

398
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,840
I'm not the second Ouyang Xu.

399
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,320
I promise you

400
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,360
I'll protect you and love you
all my life.

401
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,080
I'll never abandon you
or embarrass you.

402
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,880
By the way,
as for Yu Zhongquan's case,

403
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,960
how is it going?

404
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,960
And Xiao Qinyan.

405
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,680
What was going on?

406
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,240
You can't talk about it, can you?

407
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,640
No. I...

408
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,640
I was just thinking

409
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,760
how to tell you.

410
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,440
Minister Duke Xiao
is an old friend of my elder's.

411
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,600
But he doesn't
have a good reputation

412
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,840
in the court and the commonalty.

413
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,560
So I barely had any dealings with him.

414
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,320
Last time, I was driven desperate

415
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,160
by Zheng Qingtian.

416
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,280
So I turned to him for help.

417
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,720
It explains the matter.

418
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,920
How did Yu Zhongquan relate to him?

419
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,600
After Minister Duke Xiao
saved me several times,

420
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,040
his son became jealous of me.

421
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,320
When Yu Zhongquan knew about it,

422
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,840
he tried to use Xiao Wei
to deal with me.

423
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,720
But don't worry.

424
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,520
I've taken care of all the troubles.

425
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,800
Yu Zhongquan is dead.

426
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,840
I've punished Xiao Wei severely.

427
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,400
If he dares to hurt you again,

428
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,720
I'll get even with Xiao Qinyan first.

429
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,000
Do you believe me?

430
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,080
I'm not in the same camp with
Xiao Qinyan.

431
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,680
Of course I know.

432
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,280
I just wonder

433
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,480
have you offended Xiao Qinyan

434
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,400
by leaving no room last time?

435
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,600
He saved you after all.

436
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,120
He also saved me indirectly.

437
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,440
If you go bother him
because of his son,

438
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,640
it's kind of ungrateful.

439
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,880
Since you two are not in the same camp,

440
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,720
you'd better stay away from him.

441
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,120
Neither bother him,

442
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,360
nor get close to him.

443
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,800
What do you think?

444
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,800
OK.

445
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,080
Last time,

446
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,800
you suffered a lot for me.

447
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,840
I'm sorry.

448
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,000
It's nothing.

449
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,200
I wasn't badly hurt anyway.

450
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,080
And I'm prepared.

451
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,040
Such things would happen

452
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,800
if I'm with you.

453
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,000
Pan'er,

454
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,520
what you've suffered for me recently,

455
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,680
I'll keep it in mind.

456
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,080
In the future,

457
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,840
I'll pay you back with double happiness.

458
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,160
Try this.

459
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,760
Red bayberry ginger drink?

460
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,920
I can't drink it.

461
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,760
I feel itchy all over
when I drink ginger water.

462
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,160
And the balsam pear.

463
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,480
It's so bitter.

464
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,240
How could it be a snack?

465
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,760
Nothing suits your taste.

466
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,160
You're like a picky boy.

467
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,360
Shall I buy you
a clay sculpture to play with?

468
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,120
Who's the woman?

469
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,400
She is probably his lover,

470
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,080
the shopkeeper of a teahouse
called Half-hidden.

471
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,160
Hanging out with a businesswoman.

472
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,680
Gu Qianfan

473
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
doesn't have any sense of propriety.

474
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,520
Young Master,
I didn't lie to you, did I?

475
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Commander Gu

476
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,480
doesn't look like Master at all.

477
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,440
No, I always feel like I knew him.

478
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,680
My father and I never touch ginger.

479
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,840
When my mother forced me
to eat something,

480
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,560
I would take a sip of water,

481
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,080
close my eyes and wash it down.

482
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,240
Is he really...

483
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,960
My third brother
doesn't look like my father either.

484
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,040
But he looks exactly like my mother.

485
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,280
He looks a few years older than me.

486
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,440
Is the man really my father's...

487
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,400
I dare not say.

488
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,200
If it's true,

489
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,920
he is the eldest son.

490
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,320
No wonder Master would...

491
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,280
I remember

492
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,640
my father released his former maid

493
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,720
and her family before.

494
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,640
Though the maid is dead,

495
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,960
her son and his family
still live outside Guzi Gate.

496
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,320
Go find him.

497
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,280
If necessary, use a knife or a rope.

498
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,360
Do let him tell you

499
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,280
which women was my father with

500
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,200
before he married my mother.

501
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,200
Yes.

502
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,160
Gu.

503
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,840
Gu.

504
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,920
I'm going to say hello
to the man inside.

505
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,440
Wait for me outside.

506
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,520
There are many strangers here.

507
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,400
You should be prudent, sir.

508
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,400
I need to relax occasionally.

509
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,800
Gu, you're so lucky.

510
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,000
Is she the woman
Yu Zhongquan captured

511
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,880
and used against you last time?

512
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,800
She is an acquaintance of Chen Lian,

513
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,760
who was mistakenly arrested
by Yu Zhongquan.

514
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,200
I didn't know her.

515
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,680
Then who she is?

516
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,440
You've followed me for several years.

517
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,320
It's the first time I've seen you
with a woman.

518
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,240
I arranged for her to be my informant

519
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,680
among the people.

520
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,000
You arranged for her?

521
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,680
As far as I can see,

522
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,560
she was arranging for you just now.

523
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,440
Coming out together, hands in hands.

524
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,280
It's a big thing.

525
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Sir, you're perspicacious.

526
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,920
Indeed, I have some true feelings
for the woman.

527
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,240
But please don't regard a game

528
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,360
as deep love.

529
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,120
I won't be pleased with it.

530
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,400
OK.

531
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,800
Gu, you're clear headed.

532
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,880
A former performer

533
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,920
could only be a concubine.

534
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,720
If you marry her,

535
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,360
you'll screw up your promising career

536
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,760
just like Ouyang Xu did.

537
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,680
A young talent as you

538
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,160
deserves the daughter of a noble family.

539
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,680
I'll keep an eye on it for you.

540
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,000
Thank you, sir.

541
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,040
What's wrong?

542
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,440
Can we have an honest talk?

543
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,840
Who is he?

544
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,440
A friend.

545
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,280
I'm going to catch up with him.

546
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,440
Would you go back first?

547
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,680
Big brother, is this my sister-in-law?

548
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,320
No.

549
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,560
No, wait for me at the bridgehead.

550
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,160
Big brother, why do you
regard me as an outsider?

551
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,960
I can't afford to be your big brother.

552
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,880
My surname is Gu.

553
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,040
I've found out

554
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,640
my father once had a marriage

555
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,000
when he was young.

556
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,880
His wife's surname was Gu.

557
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,680
There are thousands of people

558
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,720
with the same name.

559
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,040
But you're the only one
my father cares for.

560
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,320
My grandfather is Qi Changbo.

561
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,920
The eldest son
of my father's legal wife

562
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,440
must be me forever.

563
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,120
If you're tactful,

564
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,520
get away from...

565
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,320
I think you should be tactful.

566
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,200
Even your father dares not
threaten the Capital Security Office,

567
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,480
let alone Qi Changbo.

568
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,400
I'll tell you again.

569
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,640
My surname is Gu.

570
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I have nothing to do
with the Xiao Family.

571
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,320
I don't covet your status
as the eldest son.

572
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,400
Feel at ease to be the Young Master
of your family.

573
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,880
Stay away from me and my men.

574
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,600
Otherwise,

575
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,240
I won't just send a deer leg

576
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,680
to Xiao Qinyan next time.

577
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,520
Qianfan.

578
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,720
Qianfan.

579
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,760
Uncle Qi.

580
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,360
Why did you lay your hands

581
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,920
on Xiao Qinyan's eldest son?

582
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,200
He instigated Yu Zhongquan

583
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,120
to frame me up.

584
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,960
I just warned him a little.

585
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,600
You're still a youth of hot blood.

586
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,000
To deal with them,

587
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,880
you needn't beat them in the street.

588
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,280
Xiao Qinyan is returning to the capital
as Prime Minister soon.

589
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,320
None of his sons

590
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,920
is reliant.

591
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,320
They'll definitely abuse their power
and bully people.

592
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,600
Keep an eye on them.

593
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,000
Wait until they commit a felony

594
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,440
and arrest them directly in the name
of the Capital Security Office.

595
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,040
Then get rid of them completely.

596
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,480
By doing that,

597
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,840
we'll shake Xiao Qinyan's foundation.

598
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,560
Why?

599
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,280
Are you reluctant?

600
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,280
No.

601
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,400
I was thinking about how to do it.

602
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,040
That's good.

603
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,080
Come on. Sit.

604
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,800
By the way,

605
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,000
the evidences of Lei Jing's crime
sent to you the other day

606
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,280
were from

607
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,520
Yu Zhongquan's most trusted followers.

608
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,360
Last time, when I investigated
the Jiangnan case,

609
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,230
you said it wasn't the right time
to attack him.

610
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,630
Now we've got these.

611
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,630
There shouldn't be any problems, right?

612
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,080
Qianfan,

613
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,840
why have you been

614
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,160
restless recently?

615
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,800
I told you to
pay attention to Xiao Qinyan,

616
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,880
but you just latched on to Lei Jing.

617
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,680
The evidence you've gathered

618
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,400
would bring Lei Jing to justice.

619
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
But in the end,

620
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,920
he's just an insignificant person.

621
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,760
Our real enemy

622
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,000
is Xiao Qinyan.

623
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,200
Yes.

624
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,000
I'll take care of Lei Jing's case.

625
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,440
It will only take a few more months.

626
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,000
I know you want to get rid of him
as soon as possible,

627
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,240
so that you'll ascend to the Fifth Rank

628
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,880
and request an honorary title
for your aunt.

629
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,360
But it's complicated
in the imperial court.

630
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,880
I must consult with other people
of our faction

631
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,800
before we take action.

632
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,240
I didn't mean to urge you.

633
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,960
I arranged for you
to join the Capital Security Office,

634
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,760
not just because I wanted to
get rid of Lei Jing.

635
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,800
I hoped that aided
by the power of the Office,

636
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,640
you would help us
to rectify the imperial court.

637
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,200
Qianfan, you shouldn't
have the order reversed.

638
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,680
Do you understand?

639
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,960
I do.

640
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,020
(Half-hidden)

641
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,320
Your haw drinks.

642
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,080
Ma'am, the bill, please.

643
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,920
OK.

644
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,040
How are you doing, Mr. Cai?

645
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,560
The business is bad.

646
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,320
Really?

647
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,800
What big business are you doing?

648
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,000
No, just some small business.

649
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,320
Mr. Zheng, you're too polite.

650
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,600
Come on.

651
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,840
Let's drink tea.

652
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,840
Come on, drink tea.

653
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,120
You shouldn't fill the cup up with tea.

654
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,760
There are strict rules.

655
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,320
Mr. Li, you're an expert.

656
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,880
What's wrong?

657
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,480
You were happy
when you went out at noon.

658
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,280
But now you're upset.

659
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,920
Did you have a fight with Gu Qianfan?

660
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,560
Don't mention him.

661
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,960
Ms. Zhao.

662
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,600
Yuan Tuntian is coming.

663
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,680
Mr. Yuan.

664
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,800
Ms. Zhao,

665
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,720
how do you like my calligraphy?

666
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,680
It's vigorous as well as graceful.

667
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,360
Your calligraphy will

668
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,200
light up our humble teahouse.

669
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,080
I'll let people cut blocks for printing.

670
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,120
Ms. Zhao, you've made a good deal.

671
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,760
Each of Mr. Yuan's calligraphy
is worth a thousand pieces of gold.

672
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,320
By printing it on pastry wrappers,

673
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,920
good lord,

674
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,520
you can definitely encourage those
arty scholars to buy your pastries.

675
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,440
You got me.

676
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,320
Yuan Tuntian's calligraphy is great.

677
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,080
My paintings aren't bad themselves.

678
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,120
Of course.

679
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,520
Ms. Zhao, I wanted to ask you before,

680
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,240
at such a young age,

681
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,640
how did you collect so many

682
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,160
famous porcelains and paintings?

683
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,760
My father collected some before.

684
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,720
I also collected some
when I was in Jiangnan.

685
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,440
They are old collections.

686
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,440
Daqiang!

687
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,480
Daqiang!

688
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,160
Daqiang, what's wrong with you?

689
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:38,960
What happened?

690
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,800
What happened?

691
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,080
(Ge Zhaodi)

692
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,120
(Ge Zhaodi)
How should I know?

693
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,400
My brother was fine before.

694
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,480
After he came here

695
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,760
and had your haw drink,

696
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,800
he became like this.

697
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,160
Daqiang!

698
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,960
He is spitting blood.

699
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,760
Poison. Your fruit drink is poisonous!

700
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,600
Poisonous!

701
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,480
I made the haw drink myself.

702
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,360
How could it be poisonous?

703
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,440
You're trying to deny it?

704
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,200
Your brother may have an old illness.

705
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,120
Look.

706
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,000
Isn't it poisonous?

707
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,600
Isn't it?

708
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,880
Isn't it poisonous?

709
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,560
Isn't it poisonous?

710
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,180
Isn't it poisonous?

711
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,680
Is it because the haws we bought

712
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,040
were fumigated with sulphur?

713
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,760
Silver blackens

714
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,960
when it contacts sulphur.

715
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
I don't want to die.

716
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,040
Hurry. Run.

717
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,000
A man is poisoned here.

718
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,680
Don't leave.

719
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,560
Daqiang!

720
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,520
How do you feel, Daqiang?

721
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,680
Say it!

722
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,920
Calm down.

723
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,560
Why did you poison my brother?

724
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,040
You must pay with your life!

725
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,160
Uncles,

726
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,720
could you notify the government?

727
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,880
Please do me a favor.

728
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,680
Don't go.

729
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,440
I'm sorry.

730
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,840
We didn't do it on purpose.

731
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,000
Something wasn't right.

732
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,840
I have money.

733
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,240
Let me compensate you first.

734
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,160
Do you want 50 or 100 strings?

735
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,320
I don't want your money.

736
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,600
I want you to pay with your life.

737
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,360
Kind uncles,

738
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,840
I'm begging you.

739
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,720
I'm begging you
to notify the government.

740
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,480
I want the murders to be put in jail.

741
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,800
I'm begging you.

742
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,040
Well...

743
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,280
Help me.

744
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,600
- Help me.
- Ms. Zhao.

745
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,000
A man is dead in your teahouse.

746
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,360
You can't cover it up.

747
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,080
You should notify the government.

748
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,600
Don't just stand there.

749
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,280
Find out what was wrong.

750
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,680
When the yamen runners come,
you can explain to them.

751
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,640
Think about it.

752
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,720
Was any rat poison mixed in the drink?

753
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,120
We can't notify the government.

754
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,080
If we do, we're all finished.

755
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,800
Daqiang!

756
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,240
Daqiang!

757
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,320
Daqiang!

758
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,000
Daqiang.

759
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,440
Wake up.

760
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,520
Daqiang!

761
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,000
Daqiang!

762
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,200
Pan'er.

763
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,440
What are you doing
with the haw drinks?

764
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,320
Keep her under control.

765
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,360
Go.

766
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,960
I'm afraid he can't live.

767
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,720
Notify the government quickly.

768
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,600
Go.

769
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,800
You must give me an explanation.

770
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,760
I have to pay with my life anyway.

771
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,040
What are you doing?

772
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,080
What do you want?

773
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,360
Open your mouth.

774
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,480
Since it's poisonous,
you'd better die with him.

775
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,480
I'm already a murderer.

776
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,000
- I don't mind murdering one more.
- What did you feed me?

777
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,960
- Sanniang, Yinzhang, close the door.
- What did she feed her?

778
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,080
Why did they close the door?

779
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,760
What are they doing?

780
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,320
Yeah.

781
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:08,960
Daqiang.

782
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,000
Dead people's eyes don't roll.

783
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,200
Let me see if he's really dead.

784
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,200
Don't you run!

785
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,360
The corpse came back to life.

786
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,920
He faked his death.

787
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,560
They tried to blackmail them.

788
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,000
Knowing your brother was dead,

789
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,280
you didn't examine his breath,

790
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,400
or feel his pulse,

791
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,280
or send for a physician.

792
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,480
You didn't want any compensation.

793
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,600
Instead, you only wanted me
to be arrested.

794
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,960
Say it, who instigated you?

795
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:40,800
Say it!

796
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,400
I don't know
what you were talking about.

797
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,520
I just woke up.

798
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,200
I spat blood
after I had your fruit drink

799
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,360
(Sun Daqiang)
just now.

800
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,360
Don't wrong an innocent man!

801
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:50,960
Then drink more.

802
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,040
And spit out more.

803
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:54,960
Feed him.

804
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,680
Drink.

805
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,320
I added magnolia coco
in the drink before.

806
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,680
I don't know if it would kill you.

807
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,600
But I do know
being mixed with haw drink,

808
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,880
it becomes dumb drug.

809
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,160
If you don't take antidote in an hour,

810
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,520
you can never talk again.

811
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,000
I have only one portion of antidote.

812
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,880
Whoever talks first can get it.

813
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,160
Otherwise,
I'll throw it into the Bian River.
