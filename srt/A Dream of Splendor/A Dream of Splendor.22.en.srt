Sir,

54
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,560
is the cricket
worthy of five strings of coins?

55
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,920
I bought the valuable Yutoutuo specially

56
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,080
to coax Haohao.

57
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,480
Go away.

58
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,960
Where is the cricket?

59
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,160
Where is my cricket?

60
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,920
Help me find it.

61
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,680
Where is it?

62
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,280
Zhao Pan'er?

63
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,200
Why does bad luck come upon me
every time I see you?

64
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,760
Why are you here?

65
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,200
Gu Qianfan?

66
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,640
Why are you here, too?

67
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,600
Why can't I be here?

68
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
Do you know each other?

69
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,560
No.

70
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,080
Did you say you don't know me?

71
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,840
Xiao...

72
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,000
Gu Qianfan,

73
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,040
I've known you
since you wore open-crotch pants.

74
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,000
Dare you say you don't know me?

75
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,080
I haven't finished yet.

76
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,920
Stop.

77
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,160
I wonder why I had bad luck today.

78
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,480
It turns out my two deadly enemies

79
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,160
have hooked up together stealthily.

80
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,800
You...

81
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,360
You collude in doing evil,

82
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,200
stoop to secret dealings,

83
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,040
wallow together in the mire,

84
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,240
and join each other in your evildoing.

85
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
Not bad. You blurted out so many idioms
in one breath.

86
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,040
Congratulations.

87
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,800
You seem to know
more than 100 characters now.

88
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,720
How dare you laugh at me?

89
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,160
I knew you used to punch like that
since we were children.

90
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,120
I remember it.

91
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,840
Don't stop me.

92
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,760
I'll help you to remember it
more clearly.

93
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,240
Stop.

94
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,800
Stop. Don't go. Let's fight.

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,400
Let go.

96
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,120
Let go.

97
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,720
Let go.

98
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,240
I won't.

99
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,120
Sir.

100
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,400
- I won't.
- Let go.

101
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,280
I won't.

102
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,160
Let go.

103
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,120
I won't.

104
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,480
Give me back my shoe.

105
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,160
A great person doesn't harbor grievance.

106
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,160
We're acquaintances.

107
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,200
Please be easy on us.

108
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,280
Who is your acquaintance?

109
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,880
Give me back.

110
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,480
No. No. Behold.

111
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,640
Sir, what did you do?

112
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,120
We've found your cricket.

113
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,720
Where is it?

114
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,480
Sir.

115
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,440
Yes.

116
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,280
I found it.

117
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,800
My Yutoutuo.

118
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,400
Why did it lose a tentacle?

119
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,880
Yutoutuo?

120
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,360
You haven't seen Yutoutuo, have you?

121
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,040
Yutoutuo has a red head,

122
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,840
a bluish green neck, golden wings,

123
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,120
and a forehead
with gold and silver lines.

124
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,520
Look at the thing in your hands.

125
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,120
It doesn't look like a Yutoutuo at all.

126
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,240
Is it a dung beetle?

127
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,000
Why do you bother to tell him so much?

128
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,920
Everyone in the city knows

129
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,440
he is the easiest to be fooled.

130
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,880
Is it worthy of five strings of coins?

131
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,720
It doesn't even worth 50 coins.

132
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,960
You're lying!

133
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,040
Don't mind him.

134
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,200
Don't touch it.

135
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,200
Yes.

136
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,080
It doesn't look expensive, does it?

137
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,120
Put me down. I can walk.

138
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,240
What about this?

139
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,520
How do you like it? Does it fit?

140
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,920
Yes.

141
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,200
Sir.

142
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,840
Thank you.

143
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,320
Why are you smiling?

144
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,600
I was thinking

145
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,440
you must look imposing
when you fought with Chi Pan

146
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,960
in open-crotch pants

147
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,880
as a child.

148
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,440
Don't be mad at me.

149
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,680
Why did he call you Qianfan?

150
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,720
It sounds like you were close.

151
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,760
He lived next door to me
when we were children.

152
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,840
He is a notorious rascal

153
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,200
in the Eastern Capital.

154
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,600
How come you had dealings with him?

155
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,920
He was no match for me
in kicking balls

156
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,200
and rolling dices.

157
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
So he became angry from shame.

158
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,920
Except for crickets,

159
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,600
you also know well about
kicking balls and rolling dices?

160
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,800
We haven't married yet.

161
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,920
It isn't late
if you go back on your words.

162
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
No, I mean,

163
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,320
I like kicking balls
and rolling dices, too.

164
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,680
If you like,

165
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,400
shall we compare notes next time?

166
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,960
Sure enough, you and Chi Pan
were childhood friends.

167
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,120
You're birds of a feather.

168
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,820
(Cai River)

169
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,200
With my connections
with the Music Administrator,

170
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,040
it's easy for me to help you

171
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,400
drop the performer status,

172
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,240
let alone offer you a chance
to perform for His Majesty.

173
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,080
Yinzhang.

174
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,400
Yinzhang.

175
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,600
Come and lend me a hand.

176
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,480
While I was free today,

177
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,360
I made a summer robe

178
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,280
for my son, Zifang.

179
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,000
The robe

180
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,400
will be softer

181
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,000
after it's washed and dried.

182
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,160
I wonder if his father

183
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,840
has prepared him summer clothes.

184
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,920
When Zifang grows up,

185
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,800
he'll beg you to forgive his mistakes.

186
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,720
I hope so.

187
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,640
Tell me the truth,

188
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,120
where did you go the other morning?

189
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,000
And what were you thinking just now?

190
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,560
All right. You don't have to tell me.

191
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,520
Help me collect the handkerchiefs.

192
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,640
Sanniang.

193
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,280
I have a question.

194
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,160
Go ahead.

195
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,840
Someone told me

196
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,360
he could use his connections
to help me drop the performer status.

197
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,480
Do you think he was lying?

198
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,920
Is his surname Shen?

199
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,360
No.

200
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,240
Yinzhang,

201
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,520
you mustn't be fooled again.

202
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,760
Don't believe the outright lies of men.

203
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Have you forgotten
what Pan'er said before?

204
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,600
Women should be independent.

205
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,040
Dropping status isn't that easy.

206
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,520
Don't expect

207
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,320
those dignitaries to help you.

208
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,600
They said that

209
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,840
because they had ulterior motives.

210
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,880
I wasn't talking about me.

211
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,360
It's Haohao.

212
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,440
The other day when I was
backing her with pipa,

213
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,120
she told me Chi Pan was trying to

214
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,200
help her drop the performer status.

215
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,280
That's possible.

216
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,280
Chi Pan

217
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,640
likes Zhang Haohao very much.

218
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,600
And he is rich.

219
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,680
If he manages to grease the wheels,

220
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,080
the Music Administrator may say yes.

221
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,000
I also heard

222
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,360
Landlord Sun's wife

223
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,000
was a singing performer before.

224
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,760
He helped buy her freedom back.

225
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,160
But they're different

226
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,080
with us.

227
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,680
Don't worry.

228
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,160
Gu Qianfan

229
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,240
will help you get your freedom
sooner or later.

230
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,840
Deputy Commissioner Gu?

231
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,920
Is he willing to help me?

232
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,760
Of course.

233
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,480
Pan'er said he promised her.

234
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,680
So, be patient for a while.

235
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,360
You'll be fine.

236
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,080
OK.

237
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,320
Are you going to investigate
the Hat Demon case tonight?

238
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,680
We're about to pull in the net.

239
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,120
In fact, the suspects
are a bunch of people

240
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,000
who differ from Xiao Qinyan.

241
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,360
They made troubles
in the name of the Hat Demon.

242
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,960
Xiao Qinyan is supposed to

243
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,200
be granted as the Prime Minister
after his birthday banquet.

244
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,480
The case may ruin

245
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,880
his chance to assume the post.

246
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,560
You should focus on the case

247
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,000
and don't meddle in other business.

248
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,160
Once you meddle in politics,

249
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,040
it won't be easy to get out of it.

250
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,640
OK.

251
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,360
Honey, thank you for teaching me
how to be an official.

252
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,680
Deputy Commissioner Gu.

253
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,200
Why are you here again?

254
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,680
Well,

255
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,360
I ran into your sister on the road.

256
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,720
So I walked her home.

257
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,520
By the way, last time I gave you
a score of an ancient tune.

258
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,480
How's the practice going?

259
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,200
I've almost mastered it.

260
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,000
Come with me. I'll play it for you.

261
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,320
Forget it. Deputy Commissioner Gu
has business to do today.

262
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,120
Let's take a rain check.

263
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,200
But,

264
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,880
I'll perform at Minister Duke Xiao's
birthday banquet

265
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,640
the day after tomorrow.

266
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,320
I want Deputy Commissioner Gu
to listen to it first.

267
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,760
I'll be quick. Just one part.

268
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,240
Sanniang,
come and listen to my new tune.

269
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,220
(Liangzhou)

270
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,880
Great!

271
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,640
Yinzhang, you played well.

272
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,880
Yinzhang, it was great.

273
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,080
Deputy Commissioner Gu,
I'm expecting your comments.

274
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,280
Do you want me to tell the truth?

275
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,960
Please do.

276
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,600
I think you did

277
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,480
a lousy job.

278
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,000
Pipa speaks for the player's heart.

279
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,920
The inferiors show their skills.

280
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,640
The masters build artistic conception.

281
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,590
Complete Song of Liangzhou was a
famous tune at the northern-frontier.

282
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,560
It described a scene of warriors
drinking their fill

283
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,110
before they went out to battle.

284
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,070
It's like a slender
but unyielding plum tree.

285
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,040
Yuan Zhen,
the poet of the Tang Dynasty said,

286
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,000
Complete Song of Liangzhou
is loud, hurried and complicated.

287
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,400
But what did you do?

288
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,120
You didn't convey to us the feeling
of shining spears and armored horses,

289
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,480
instead, you showed us a delightful,

290
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,000
soft and tender little woman.

291
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,120
It's a big mistake.

292
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,880
Mr. Xiao is a master player of pipa.

293
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,880
If you want to perform
at his birthday banquet,

294
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,480
I suggest you choose another tune.

295
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,840
Otherwise,
you'll be laughed at by experts.

296
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,040
Practicing pipa is like
practicing martial arts.

297
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,480
Move forward or you'll fall behind.

298
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,240
There are many masters in
the Music Division,

299
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
who have many different abilities.

300
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,840
In my opinion,

301
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,440
you've been

302
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,040
resting on your laurels recently.

303
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,880
That's why you played so badly.

304
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,400
I was wrong.

305
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,600
I'll remember your instruction
and practice hard.

306
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,240
Try to do your best.

307
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,440
Don't fail to live up to your duty
as the coach of Pipa Branch.

308
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,360
Don't fail to live to
people's expectations for you

309
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,600
and my good intentions
of giving you the music score.

310
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,320
Deputy Commissioner Gu,

311
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,800
she'll do better

312
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,280
after more practice.

313
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,800
Give her some time.

314
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,240
Don't you have business to do?

315
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,760
You should get back to work.

316
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,760
Pan'er, walk Deputy Commissioner Gu out.

317
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,720
OK.

318
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,280
Yinzhang, it's fine.

319
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,240
You just need to practice more.

320
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,880
You've been tired recently.

321
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,480
Go back to your room and have a rest.

322
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,720
Help her.

323
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,280
Let's go to your room, Yinzhang.

324
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,480
I've tipped you many winks.

325
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,560
Was I wrong?

326
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,920
Don't you think she did a lousy job?

327
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,160
You should be careful
to tell the truth.

328
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,840
You know she's always preoccupied.

329
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,320
I don't think she is a sister to you.

330
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,840
She is more like a daughter to you.

331
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,120
Moreover,

332
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,880
I just did my duty
as her brother-in-law.

333
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,680
By scolding her and clearing her head,

334
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,760
I protected her from

335
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,480
being embarrassed

336
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,080
in front of the guests
at the birthday banquet.

337
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,600
All right, you're reasonable.

338
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,680
You should go back now.

339
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,600
Go ahead.

340
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,560
Take a break first.

341
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,040
Put the pipa down, OK?

342
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,840
Can you hear me?

343
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,840
Take a break.

344
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,760
She's been behaving strangely
after Gu Qianfan criticized her.

345
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,080
She wouldn't let go of the pipa.

346
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,680
What did you do?

347
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,800
Don't worry. I called back
her spirit by scaring her.

348
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,280
Look, isn't she all right now?

349
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,640
She is.

350
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,440
Yinzhang,

351
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,120
would you like some pastries

352
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,880
or some tea?

353
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,920
Are you hungry?

354
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,760
I caught a fish.

355
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,920
Sanniang can cook it for you.

356
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,160
Let's go.

357
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Where did you go?

358
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,640
I couldn't find you anywhere.

359
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,680
I went to clean up the pond silt.

360
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,200
I also caught a fish.

361
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,600
We'll have fish for dinner.

362
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,840
Did you hang out again?

363
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,080
I didn't hang out. I was making money.

364
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,840
If there is too much silt in the pond,

365
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,800
fish won't grow fat.

366
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,400
So we must clean it in time.

367
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,920
I earn 500 coins a day.

368
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,080
Chen Lian found the job for me.

369
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,960
Even the foreman dares not
pocket my money.

370
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,120
From now on,
when the teahouse is closed,

371
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,080
I'll work there.

372
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,320
The job is much easier
than those at the wharf.

373
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,120
Chen Lian? Did you make up with him?

374
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,200
Why do you work so hard?

375
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,960
We paid you enough, didn't we?

376
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,080
Yes.

377
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,880
But nobody thinks
he has enough money.

378
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,480
I'm saving my dowry money.

379
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,160
Dowry?

380
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,760
How old are you?

381
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,720
Why are you so anxious?

382
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,160
Of course I'm anxious.

383
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,400
Women in Great Song

384
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,760
must have large dowries
if they want to live a happy life.

385
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,640
My mo...

386
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,640
My...

387
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,680
My friend in Liangzhou told me,

388
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,760
because she only

389
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,000
had a dowry of 10 strings of coins,

390
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,720
she's been bullied
by her husband's family.

391
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,720
She was also given a nickname

392
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,400
called Wife of Ten Strings.

393
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,080
I calculated it carefully.

394
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,160
If I work here for five years,

395
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,960
I'll earn 70 strings.

396
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,000
If I make some extra money,

397
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,280
I'll save 100 strings.

398
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,920
In that case, I can straighten my back

399
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,600
in my husband's family.

400
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,400
You're quite far-sighted.

401
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,560
Of course.

402
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,920
Didn't Pan'er say

403
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,320
a man without distant thought
must have sorrows?

404
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,760
I'd better
prepare everything in advance.

405
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,440
Though I don't know who I'll marry,

406
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,320
it's always right

407
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,240
to save up enough dowry

408
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,200
with my own hands.

409
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,360
You are smarter

410
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,520
than Yinzhang.

411
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,360
She always thinks of

412
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,240
finding a good husband
so that she'll get rid of her status.

413
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,520
That's why she made such a huge trouble.

414
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,440
To live a happy life,

415
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,720
women must rely on themselves.

416
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,640
How can they pin their hopes on men?

417
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,720
You're right.

418
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,560
Why are you smiling?

419
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,840
Don't be mad at me if I tell the truth.

420
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:43,960
Shoot.

421
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,560
You usually say that you used to
force Zifang to study

422
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,600
because you wanted him
to be a Presented Scholar

423
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,520
and become an official,

424
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,480
then you would be

425
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,840
a madam wearing a chaplet
and official robes.

426
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,680
But isn't it relying on men

427
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,120
if you rely on your son?

428
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,160
Sounds fair.

429
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,920
Pour me the water.

430
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,040
Pan'er,

431
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,640
was my playing really that bad?

432
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,800
In my mind, your pipa skills

433
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,400
are still the best in the world.

434
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,360
Don't give up.

435
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,760
Didn't Gu Qianfan suggest you

436
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,960
choose another tune
to perform at Xiao's Mansion?

437
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,120
Don't listen to him.

438
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,600
Keep practicing this one.

439
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,720
Practice hard.

440
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,200
I believe you'll astound the guests
with your skills.

441
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,560
At that time, we'll ask him
to take back his words

442
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,840
and apologize to you.

443
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,120
What do you say?

444
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,160
She's been playing for a long time.

445
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,360
The porridge is getting cold.

446
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,560
She keeps playing

447
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,720
and doesn't eat anything.

448
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,000
What if her hands get hurt?

449
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,240
Let her go her own way.

450
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,360
She is proud.

451
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,800
Only in this way

452
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,840
could she ease her anxiety.

453
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,000
I think Yinzhang plays well.

454
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,720
Stop.

455
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,640
Don't run.

456
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,280
Stop.

457
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:37,960
Stop.

458
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,000
Stop.

459
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,640
Stop.

460
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,520
Stop.

461
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,800
Be careful.

462
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,680
Move.

463
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,400
Move.

464
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,800
Sir.

465
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,960
This is the first suspect caught alive

466
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,760
since we began to chase the Hat Demon.

467
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,320
Interrogate him carefully.

468
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,120
Make sure he confesses.

469
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,720
Remember,

470
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,800
don't torture him.

471
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,040
Don't let him commit suicide.

472
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:53,920
Yes, sir.

473
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,920
Chief,

474
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,760
the Office of Imperial Guards
asked to fetch him for interrogation.

475
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,400
Commander Cui came.

476
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
He came to pick up the prisoner?

477
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,520
The prisoner is very important.

478
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,920
I can't turn him over to you.

479
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,680
Deputy Commissioner Gu,
you've gone too far.

480
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,960
With the letter of Mr. Yang,
our inspector-in-chief,

481
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
can't I transfer

482
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,920
a petty swindler?

483
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,960
If I remember correctly,

484
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,800
the Office of Imperial Guards

485
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,360
is in charge of prisoners

486
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,680
that committed felonies.

487
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
Why do you come specially
for a petty swindler

488
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,480
in the middle of the night?

489
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,460
(Commander Cui,
Office of Imperial Guards)

490
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,360
Deputy Commissioner Gu,

491
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,680
what do you mean?

492
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,360
We've been working hard
for half a month.

493
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,200
As soon as we caught the suspect,

494
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,400
you came to transfer him.

495
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,320
I wonder what's your intention?

496
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,280
Shut up.

497
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,800
You don't get to talk.

498
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,920
I must take the prisoner away tonight.

499
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,720
Deputy Commissioner Gu,

500
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,040
don't refuse a toast
only to drink a forfeit.

501
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,480
I've been working here
for more than a decade

502
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,400
without drinking a forfeit.

503
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,840
Really?

504
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,600
Enough.

505
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,480
Mr. Commissioner.

506
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,320
We're all colleagues.

507
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,120
We should be kind to each other.

508
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,440
Mr. Lei.

509
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:51,960
Sir.

510
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,720
At ease.

511
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,760
Gu,

512
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,160
the Office of Imperial Guards
informed me in advance.

513
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,240
You should let them
pick up the prisoner.

514
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,080
They'll take the responsibility
if something happens.

515
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,040
Since they bothered you,

516
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,920
I surely won't
turn the prisoner over to him.

517
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,560
Mr. Lei,

518
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,960
that's how you do your business?

519
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,120
Mr. Cui, wait for a minute.

520
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,080
Gu Qianfan, come with me.

521
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,200
Gu, don't be so arrogant.

522
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,920
I allow you to take charge of
the South Section at will,

523
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,040
but you shouldn't...

524
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,800
Sir,

525
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,360
who told you they would come to

526
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,920
pick up the prisoner?

527
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,240
Mr. Guo, the Commander-in-chief.

528
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,920
Actually, I found that

529
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,680
the man behind the Hat Demon case

530
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,400
was related to those
who framed Minister Duke Xiao.

531
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,920
The Office of Imperial Guards
is the Emperor's own troop.

532
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,520
Mr. Guo is of the Second Rank.

533
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,160
Instead of sleeping without anxiety,

534
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,200
why would he rather

535
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,800
owe you a favor
and send his man here

536
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,680
to pick up a petty prisoner
in the middle of the night?

537
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,560
I don't know what Mr. Guo

538
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,360
gave you in exchange for the favor.

539
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,160
I just don't want you

540
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,920
to be involved in their conspiracy

541
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,640
for no reason at all.

542
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,880
Don't wait any longer.

543
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,600
Mr. Lei is gone.

544
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,840
Please leave.

545
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,200
Deputy Commissioner Gu,

546
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm sorry I offended you.

547
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,040
But I'm under strict orders.

548
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,520
I must take the prisoner away.

549
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,600
Please do me a favor.

550
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,680
Deputy Commissioner Gu,

551
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,400
we both take orders secretly from

552
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,000
Qi Mu, the Vice Censor-in-Chief.

553
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,720
Why do you make it so hard for me?

554
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,240
What did you say?

555
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,220
(Qi)

556
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,560
This is Mr. Qi's signature for secrets.

557
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
I bet you've seen it.

558
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,320
I see.

559
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,280
Please leave.

560
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,360
The matter is of great importance.

561
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,160
If Mr. Qi really wants the prisoner,

562
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,920
why didn't he tell me personally?

563
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,720
Why did he send you?

564
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,800
I swear by my life I wasn't lying.

565
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,760
You tell Mr. Qi after you return

566
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,280
that the prisoner is kept
under my own guard.

567
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,000
I would never let him

568
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,640
say anything that shouldn't be heard of.

569
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,560
And I wouldn't do any harm to him.

570
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,400
If he needs anything else,
he should tell me personally.

571
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,440
See you.

572
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,520
Go.

573
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:37,940
(Flourishing Trees Outside the Gate)

574
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:00,060
(Meet me tomorrow
at Xiao's birthday banquet.)

575
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,420
(Meet me tomorrow
at Xiao's birthday banquet.)

576
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,180
(Qi)

577
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,360
This is Mr. Qi's signature for secrets.

578
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,710
I bet you've seen it.

579
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:50,400
Princess Anding presents
the white jade Maitreya

580
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,630
to congratulate Minister Duke Xiao
on his birthday.

581
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,190
The white jade Maitreya is so big.

582
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,360
- Really?
- Let's go have a look.

583
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,240
I only saw small ones before.

584
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,680
Maintain your decency.

585
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,600
Don't disturb the honorable guests.

586
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,240
Are you nervous?

587
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,040
Don't worry.

588
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,280
You'll soon get used to it.

589
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,320
I'll give you hints later.

590
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,320
Thank you.

591
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Imperial edict from His Majesty.

592
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,600
Please receive.

593
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,320
Imperial edict?

594
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,560
His Majesty sent a messenger
to congratulate Mr. Xiao's birthday.

595
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,760
It's a huge compliment to him.

596
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,160
By the grace of Heaven...

597
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,640
Look, that's Minister Duke Xiao.

598
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,520
That's Vice Censor-in-chief Qi.

599
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,640
On the right is Mr. Ke,
the former Minister Duke.

600
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,480
(Ke Zheng, Former Chancellor)
He's Mr. Xiao's deadly enemy.

601
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,240
He was dismissed
from the post of Chancellor.

602
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,280
Now he has to leave the capital
and take office as a local official.

603
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,160
Xiao Qinyan, receive the imperial edict.

604
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,680
Yes, sir.

605
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,320
My gratitude to His Majesty.

606
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,920
Congratulations.

607
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,520
Thank you.

608
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,840
Keep it safe.

609
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,320
Please.

610
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,920
Congratulations.

611
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,360
Thank you, everyone.

612
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,800
Please come in.

613
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,240
By the way,

614
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,320
that's Inspector Gao,
elder brother of Consort Gao.

615
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,800
These officials

616
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,160
are at each other's throats in private,

617
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,160
while in public,

618
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,720
they seem to be polite and pleased.

619
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,720
I wonder if their gifts are poisonous.

620
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,280
Why haven't you got changed yet?

621
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,120
I'll get changed now.

622
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,840
Are you ready?

623
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,000
Yes.

624
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,680
Come. It's our turn now.

625
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,120
Evade.

626
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,040
Come with me to get changed.

627
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,000
Have you put away the imperial edict?

628
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,360
Rest assured, Master.

629
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,120
Hasn't Qianfan come yet?

630
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,160
Yes.

631
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,640
I told the doorman,

632
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,760
as soon as Deputy Commissioner Gu
arrives...

633
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,520
Enough.

634
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,080
He really cherishes his reputation.

635
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,640
In order to keep a distance from me,

636
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,080
he'd rather not give me
a birthday present.

637
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,560
Fine.

638
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,000
I don't care if he comes or not.

639
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,440
Anyway,

640
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,960
keep the quiet seat

641
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,200
beside the column for him.

642
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,640
Prepare him some cushions.

643
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,480
And his favorite southern pastries,

644
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,800
remember to get them ready.

645
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,440
Master, rest assured.

646
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,920
Who?

647
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,720
Father, it's me.

648
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,440
I come to get changed, too.

649
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,120
With my absence,

650
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,800
you left the guests behind
and came here.

651
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,360
Do you want all the officials
to laugh at our family

652
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,840
for neglecting the guests?

653
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,760
I dare not.

654
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,160
I bet you dare.

655
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,040
His Majesty's imperial edict,

656
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,400
I received it respectfully
with my both hands

657
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,760
before I asked you to keep it safe.

658
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,640
But you

659
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,920
banded it over to him casually in public

660
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,560
with one of your hands.

661
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,000
And you dared take it out on Mr. Ke.

662
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,200
You were arrogant enough that
people might think it was your birthday.

663
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,800
I was wrong.

664
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,160
I dare not do it again.

665
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,400
But I feel aggrieved for you.

666
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,120
You are the newly granted
Prime Minister.

667
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,080
Mr. Ke is just a loser

668
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,480
who has lost His Majesty's favor.

669
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,520
He has been downgraded to Prefect,

670
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,360
yet he dares to be rude
to you in public.

671
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,120
Even though I defeated him this time,

672
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,640
he is still Ke Zheng.

673
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,800
Do you know why I can defeat him

674
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,160
and become Prime Minister this time?

675
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,640
Because I can swallow insults.

676
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,160
Ke Zheng and his like

677
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,760
hate me to the core.

678
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,240
But do you know

679
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,720
why they still
come to my birthday banquet?

680
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,520
Because they must save their dignity.

681
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,880
The harsher they are to me,

682
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,080
the kinder I'm to them.

683
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,600
They'll have to
suppress their anger.

684
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,520
Only by enraging them

685
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,000
and flustering them,

686
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,080
could I have the chance to
get rid of them all.

687
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,360
Do you understand?

688
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,880
Yes, I understand.

689
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,480
All right, go to the kitchen

690
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,840
and check if the humps are ready.

691
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,960
Remember,

692
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,360
if you do anything wrong again,

693
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,920
I have other sons to rely on.

694
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,240
(If he is one-tenth talented
as Qianfan,)

695
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,120
(I won't be worried.)

696
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,500
(Duke of State An)

697
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,560
There may be some delays inside.

698
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,800
We have to wait a little longer.

699
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,920
It's almost been an hour.

700
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,920
I can hardly hold it.

701
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,840
Put it on the ground.

702
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,680
Pick it up. Don't forget yourself.

703
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,360
The doorman of the Prime Minister is
equal to an official of the Third Rank.

704
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,280
Servants are difficult to deal with.

705
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,760
Though the dignitaries
are polite to us usually,

706
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,960
after all,

707
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,360
we are of pariah status.

708
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,360
We should remember our status.

709
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,680
We should remember our status.
