Who are you?

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,400
Under the command
of the Capital Security Office,

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,000
we're here to arrest the spies.

21
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,920
The spies?

22
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,520
This is the evidence.

23
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,120
Evidence?

24
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,560
Of colluding with the foreign enemy.

25
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,800
Take her away.

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,760

33
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,040
Pan'er was taken away.

34
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,960
Where to?

35
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,040
That carriage.

36
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,280
Are they with the Gao Family?

37
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,480
No, they're with
the Capital Security Office.

38
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,920
Why did they take her away?

39
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,800
Don't worry.

40
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,080
I'm going to see Chen Lian right away.

41
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,760
He must be with Gu Qianfan.

42
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,840
They'll tell me what's going on.

43
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,360
Yes.

44
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,000
Go back to the teahouse.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,640
Yes.

46
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,440
How could this happen?

47
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,960
We're in the Eastern Capital.

I'm here

49
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,920
to talk with you about Shen Ruzhuo.

50
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,800
He is the son of Shen Ming,
the Inspector of Council of Rites.

51
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,280
They are from
a great clan of the capital.

52
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,600
His favorites are mode, dance and music.

53
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,760
I live in the Left Street
of Changle Residential.

54

If you want to play pipa
or prattle about tea,

55
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,520
I'll await you respectfully.

56
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,280
Zhao, how dare you be so audacious

57
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,800
to collude with Western Xia spies?

58
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,560
I don't know
what you were talking about.

59
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,320
The evidence is irrefutable.

60
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,400
Say it!

61
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,200
You act in collusion with your lover,
Gu Qianfan.

62
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,120
How many of our military secrets
have you sold?

63
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,880
You're trying to frame us.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,120
You want me to put my thumb print
on your fake evidence

65
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,000
in order to frame
Deputy Commissioner Gu?

66
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,510
Forget it!

67
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,460

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,480
Master, Ms. Song is visiting you.

70
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,680
Ms. Song, why are you here?

71
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,920
What can I do for you?

72
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,280
Sorry to interrupt you.

73
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,680
But my sister is in trouble.

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,280
I'm begging you to help her.

75
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,660
(Gu Qianfan and Zhao Pan'er
collude with the enemy)

76
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,840
Do you really think

77
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,480
you've done
everything perfectly tonight?

78
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,600
I've already asked my friends
to send a message.

79
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,360
Where are Sun and Song?

80
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,320
Neither of them is in the teahouse.

81
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,560
Search their house.

82
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,400
Yes.

83
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,320
They are not there.

84
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,760
I told them,

85
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,840
if I didn't return by 9:00 PM,

86
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,520
something bad might have happened.

87
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,320
Who did you ask them
to send the message to?

88
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,920
Tell me!

89
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,880
If you kill me,

90
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,960
you'll get nothing.

91
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,600
As long as you make a confession,

92
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,080
I'll spare your life.

93
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,040
You deliberately plan to frame
Deputy Commissioner Gu and me,

94
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,680
but how come you didn't even

95
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,480
check the characters

96
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,560
on the paper in your hand?

97
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,200
You plot against my life

98
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,000
and frame me for colluding with
Western Xia spies,

99
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,040
but the characters on that paper
aren't even Western Xia characters.

100
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,960
Those are Liao characters.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,200
You can't read them, can you?

102
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,040
Let me tell you.

103
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,440
It says,

104
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,080
His Majesty lives forever.

105
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,240
Would you please tell me
which royal law has it violated?

106
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,000
How can it be an evidence
of colluding with the foreign enemy?

107
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,400
You've long prepared it, haven't you?

108
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,120
I had noticed it

109
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,560
since you checked our accounts.

110
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,480
I have other enemies
in the Eastern Capital.

111
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,360
I've made preparations
in case they try to deal with me.

112
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,160
I left marks

113
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,120
on all the important parts.

114
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,720
I also hid my hairs
in the account book.

115
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,800
If anyone touches it,

116
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,400
I'll find out at first sight.

117
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,160
There are two ways
to mess about with the account book,

118
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,320
(Account Book)
tampering with or adding things to it.

119
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,960
The thing you hid
in the cover of the account book

120
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,960
was as clear as daylight
after I dug into it.

121
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,200
I couldn't read the characters.

122
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,240
But fortunately, I have a good memory.

123
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,800
I memorized every one of them

124
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,920
and asked a professional.

125
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,040
Would you tell me what's this?

126
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,660
(Account Book)

127
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,900
(His Majesty lives forever.)
(Account Book)

128
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,480
You swapped my note

129
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,640
and changed the characters on it?

130
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,600
Exactly.

131
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,000
Did you hear it?

132
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,240
To plot against Deputy Commissioner Gu,

133
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,760
he fabricated the evidence
and cooked up the charges.

134
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,760
You're all military officers
of the Capital Security Office.

135
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,040
You're public servants

136
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,920
instead of his personal troops.

137
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,520
It's a felony

138
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,800
involving foreign countries.

139
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,960
You and Gu Qianfan
have got your lies lined up.

140
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,280
You were stalling for time!

141
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,160
Fine, if I have to die,

142
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,320
I'll take you with me.

143
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,160
I beg to see Deputy Commissioner Gu.

144
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
I beg to see Chen Lian.

145
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,000
Deputy Commissioner Gu...

146
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,280
Chen Lian, I'm Sanniang!

147
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,440
Stop yelling.

148
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,240
OK, I'll stop.

149
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,640
I'll wait outside.

150
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,000
Yinzhang, don't worry.

151
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,320
She's going to be fine.

152
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,150
Help!

153
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,320
Are you not afraid of offending
Deputy Commissioner Gu?

154
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,440
Let go!

155
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,520
Let go!

156
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,720
This is the real evidence
of collaboration.

157
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,080
Yu Zhongquan,

158
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,240
as an officer of
the Capital Security Office,

159
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,840
you dared to collude with the enemy

160
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,080
and framed your superior?

161
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,600
The evidence is irrefutable.

162
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,120
Take him into custody.

163
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,000
How do you like it when others
deal with you as you deal with them?

164
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,600
Commissioner.

165
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,000
Commissioner, help me!

166
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,080
Pan...

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,320
Ms. Zhao, are you all right?

168
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,240
Who is she?

169
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,200
The shopkeeper of Half-hidden.

170
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,440
I only went to her teahouse
a couple of times,

171
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,560
not expecting Yu Zhongquan
would take advantage of it.

172
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,440
He took her here,

173
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,480
trying to fame me up and implicate you.

174
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,840
She is innocent.

175
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,960
Take her away.

176
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,560
Yes.

177
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,320
Ms. Zhao.

178
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,200
Pan'er, I'm sorry.

179
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,680
I have to drop you here.

180
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,960
Take care of yourself.

181
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,360
OK.

182
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,480
Thank you.

183
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,360
Pan'er.

184
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,520
Pan'er.

185
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,680
Pan'er.

186
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,000
Be careful.

187
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,160
Yinzhang.

188
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
Why are you here?

189
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,880
I...

190
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,360
This is Mr. Shen.

191
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,800
We met at the Music Division.

192
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,200
I'm Shen Ruzhuo,

193
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,960
a good friend of Ms. Song's.

194
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,360
Her sister was in trouble.

195
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,760
How could I look on and do nothing?

196
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,760
Who took you away?

197
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,960
The Gao Family?

198
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,120
How did you get out?

199
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,480
Who is she?

200
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,520
She is the shopkeeper of Half-hidden.

201
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,520
Take her away.

202
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,520
It was Master Chi Pan.

203
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,960
What a jerk!

204
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,160
Where is Sanniang?

205
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,840
She went to ask for Chen Lian's help.

206
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:21,960
Also...

207
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,400
We were so worried about everything,

208
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,120
so I went to ask Mr. Shen for help.

209
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
Sanniang told me

210
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,600
to meet her at the restaurant
near the teahouse.

211
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,560
Let's go.

212
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,720
Ladies, please get in.

213
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,200
He just holds some
old grudges against you,

214
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,440
and goes to extremes.

215
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,120
So, he took an unwise decision.

216
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,800
Gu, you should be tolerate.

217
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,160
Sir, you must be joking.

218
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,400
How could you regard it
as my personal affair?

219
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,960
Colluding with foreign spies

220
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,480
is a violation of the law of the state.

221
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,440
That's why I invite you over
in the middle of the night

222
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,440
so you can punish him yourself.

223
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,200
What do you want?

224
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,880
Yu Zhongquan has followed me
for decades.

225
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,960
Everyone in the Office knows
he's my trusted follower.

226
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,080
In that case,

227
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,840
you should know
he holds grudges against me.

228
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,600
Why didn't you warn me early?

229
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,480
Is it because the imperial edict

230
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,480
ordering Minister Duke Xiao to return
as the Prime Minister

231
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,680
hasn't been issued?

232
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,720
I've just taken my new office.

233
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,240
If I don't make an impact,

234
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,640
I don't deserve the trouble

235
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,440
you've taken to create me.

236
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,240
Besides,

237
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,800
you regard Yu Zhongquan
as a trusted follower,

238
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,040
but he may not think likewise.

239
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,480
These are title deeds and Fei-qian

240
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,840
my men found

241
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,280
in his private house.

242
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,000
Look,

243
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,760
is the residence of
the Great Xiangguo Temple

244
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,000
the one you used to live in?

245
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,520
Great Xiangguo Temple?

246
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,960
How come I don't remember it?

247
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,640
Yu Zhongquan is really bold!

248
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,440
He dares to take possession

249
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,560
of my private property

250
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,880
and sign it over to himself.

251
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,480
You must bring it to trial

252
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,040
and look into it.

253
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,320
I'll leave it to your South Section.

254
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,120
Sir,

255
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,920
it involves a lot of people.

256
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,400
I'm afraid it's inappropriate
for the South Section to do the job.

257
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,640
Do you want...

258
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,040
Sir, don't forget

259
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,800
I'm also known as the Living Devil.

260
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,840
Yu Zhongquan was seriously injured
while pursuing the foreign spies.

261
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,640
Give him a good hot bath.

262
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,680
Sir, good idea.

263
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,240
What's the deal with that?

264
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,560
The blood doesn't
coagulate easily in hot water.

265
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,520
Isn't him miserable?

266
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,020
(Capital Security Office)

267
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,400
Have you seen him clearly?

268
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,440
For the grace of the commissioner,

269
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,280
we should take good care of
Commander Yu.

270
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,760
But the number of his days is fixed.

271
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,200
It all depends on
whether the hell will accept him.

272
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,320
Those who are Commander Yu's followers,

273
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,640
give Kong Wu your names today.

274
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,040
As long as you

275
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,440
keep your mouth shut in the future,

276
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,240
I promise

277
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,160
I'll give you a way out.

278
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,880
At your disposal, sir!

279
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,100
(World at Peace)

280
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,280
Pan'er.

281
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,640
Pan'er.

282
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,720
I'm so relieved you're fine.

283
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm so relieved you're fine.

284
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,350
I'm useless.

285
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,240
You saved Pan'er, Yinzhang.

286
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,800
You are so devoted to each other

287
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,960
like you're biological sisters.

288
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,960
Thank you for today, Mr. Shen.

289
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
You're welcome.

290
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,240
Actually, I didn't help.

291
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,720
Ms. Zhao escaped by herself.

292
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,480
We've barely met each other before,

293
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,040
yet you did us the favor.

294
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,440
How could you say that?

295
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,440
We felt like old friends
at the first meeting.

296
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,160
In fact,

297
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,400
I went to your teahouse once,

298
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,720
but I didn't earn the honor
to get in the snug.

299
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
I wonder next time

300
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,080
if you could give me the honor.

301
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,200
No problem.

302
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,560
I told you last time

303
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,600
that we would meet again.

304
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,680
Now that Ms. Zhao arrived home,

305
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,520
I'd better get going.

306
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,880
Be careful.

307
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,280
I'll cook you ginger decoction later.

308
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,120
You were in such big trouble today.

309
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,040
Don't go to the teahouse tomorrow.

310
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,520
Have a good rest.

311
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,040
Why is Deputy Commissioner Gu here?

312
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,640
I come to see her.

313
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,920
The men who took her were related
to the Capital Security Office.

314
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,160
Yinzhang.

315
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,320
Let me walk you to your room.

316
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,760
I'll bring you some tea later.

317
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,200
Do you want to ask me

318
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,760
how I knew the account book
was changed?

319
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,080
Because I made a mark on it.

320
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,040
The reason why I soaked
the account book

321
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,400
and took it to the backyard
to dry it in the sun

322
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,200
was because I assumed

323
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,160
the villain must be afraid

324
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,040
that the characters would blur

325
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,200
after the paper was soaked.

326
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,160
He would send someone
to examine it.

327
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,840
I didn't know the characters.

328
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,440
But I separated them...

329
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,800
But I separated them

330
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,960
and asked Yuan Tuntian.

331
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,000
Then I found the words
"military" and "horse" were included.

332
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,920
I became even more suspicious.

333
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,040
So I soaked the account book with clove.

334
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,200
People hardly smell its fragrance,

335
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,720
but dogs can.

336
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,400
People in the theatre

337
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,000
usually used it in

338
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,160
pursuing debtors.

339
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,680
And then?

340
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,800
Then I checked the
sun-dried account book.

341
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,720
I found something was done to it.

342
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,360
I asked He Si to take a dog

343
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,400
to follow the trail.

344
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,760
In the end, they were led to the
residence of Minister Xiao.

345
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,000
I assumed

346
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,520
it must have something to do with you.

347
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,600
So I went to Chen Lian.

348
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,040
That was the whole thing.

349
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,760
Now I'm done. I'm tired.

350
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,600
I'm going to rest.

351
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,200
That's all you want to say?

352
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,640
What else do you want to hear?

353
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,240
I wonder

354
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,480
why you can be this bold.

355
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,600
Do you know

356
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,320
that if I came a bit late,

357
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,640
you'd be finished?

358
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
That's the officer
of the Capital Security Office.

359
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
How could you go to him alone?

360
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,720
Have you said enough?

361
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,360
I haven't asked you,

362
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,840
but you blamed me first.

363
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,920
You said you didn't know me, right?

364
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,040
Why do you care about me?

365
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,840
Have you lost your conscience?

366
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,360
What did you mean by that?

367
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,000
I rushed from Xiangfu County
to the Eastern Capital

368
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,920
for three hours overnight.

369
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,760
Who did I do this for?

370
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,040
In the dungeon,

371
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,800
I saw half of your body
was soaking in the bucket.

372
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,200
Do you know how worried I was?

373
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,680
If I hadn't pretended
that I didn't know you,

374
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,040
and let those who regard me
as a thorn in their eye

375
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,920
know that you were my weakness,

376
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
what would you do?

377
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,840
What would we do?

378
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,680
What did you say?

379
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,480
I'm your weakness?

380
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,920
Aren't you?

381
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,520
So what's our relationship?

382
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,080
Have you forgotten
I was with a pariah status?

383
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,200
There is a great difference

384
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,400
in our social standings.

385
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,080
With what kind

386
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,320
of a mood

387
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,840
and a status

388
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,280
are you talking to me like that?

389
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,840
Pan'er.

390
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,240
You're teasing me
before you make up your mind.

391
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,000
What do you think I am?

392
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,800
It's late and cold.

393
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,480
There is a prudent reserve
between men and women.

394
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,520
Please excuse...

395
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,680
Please excuse my leave.

396
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,200
Please go back.

397
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,480
Boss, don't go in there.

398
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,880
Believe me this time.

399
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,680
If you haven't made up your mind

400
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,920
on how you should treat Pan'er,

401
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,520
you'd better not go in.

402
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,200
Otherwise, nothing would comfort her.

403
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,920
I have something important
to deal with

404
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,880
in the Xiao's Mansion.

405
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,240
About the question you asked me,

406
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,400
I'll figure it out

407
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,560
and give you an answer.

408
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,480
These days,

409
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,320
I'll have Chen Lian protect you.

410
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,280
Feel at ease doing your business.

411
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,600
You caught a cold today.

412
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,240
Take a hot bath and have a good rest.

413
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:48,880
Sanniang.

414
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,480
Are you all right?

415
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,480
I'm fine.

416
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,360
Where is Yinzhang?

417
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,600
She is tired and frightened.

418
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,320
She's asleep.

419
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,600
I lit her a Tranquility Incense

420
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,320
and got her to sleep.

421
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,840
You should take a rest now.

422
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,560
Don't go to the teahouse tomorrow.

423
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,120
Yinzhang, Xiaocui and I
will take care of it.

424
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,680
It won't do.

425
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,680
We managed to reopen the teahouse.

426
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,960
I don't want to mess it up.

427
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,400
I'm all right.

428
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,520
I'm fine now.

429
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,680
Sanniang.

430
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,160
Are we so untrustworthy?

431
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,320
No, Sanniang.

432
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,680
I just...

433
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,320
I've wanted to say something
for a long time.

434
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,040
You're the proudest person
I've ever seen.

435
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,360
You worry about everything.

436
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,480
You do everything by yourself.

437
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,920
Have you ever thought that

438
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,360
Yinzhang and I are also the owners
of the teahouse?

439
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,880
When I first married into the Fu Family,

440
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,360
I used to run a restaurant.

441
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,640
Why?

442
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,000
Do you think Yinzhang and I
can't take care of it for just one day?

443
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,720
Do you think

444
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,120
I can only be the person who always says

445
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,040
"Yes,

446
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,560
you're right",

447
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,800
who is always a parrot

448
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,720
and always follows you?

449
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,200
No, Sanniang.

450
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,600
It's not that you don't trust me.

451
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,000
You're just a worrier.

452
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,400
You like to
take all the responsibilities.

453
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,840
Have you ever thought that

454
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,560
when you made every decision
for Yinzhang,

455
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,840
was she really happy?

456
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,440
And today,

457
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,120
you didn't tell me anything.

458
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,120
You just went to
face the danger all alone.

459
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,000
Have you ever thought about
me and Yinzhang?

460
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,560
We would be worried,

461
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,520
upset,

462
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,920
and afraid that
something might happen to you.

463
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,800
If you don't want to talk about
you and Gu Qianfan,

464
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,000
I won't ask you.

465
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,240
As for the teahouse,

466
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,800
I just couldn't stand it.
I had to say a few more words.

467
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,600
I know

468
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,040
the reason why Fu Xingui discarded me

469
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,560
was because I spoke bluntly.

470
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,440
Sanniang, I'm sorry.

471
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,720
I...

472
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,400
I get it.

473
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,960
I used to say,

474
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,400
Yinzhang,

475
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,800
don't feel yourself inferior.

476
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,600
But in fact, I look down upon myself.

477
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,960
Because of the pariah status,

478
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,960
I'm always afraid that
people would despise me.

479
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,160
So I want to

480
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,160
do everything perfectly.

481
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,880
I want to

482
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,600
keep everything under my control.

483
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,280
All right. Stop crying.

484
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,520
We have a friendship of life and death.

485
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,760
Everything will be fine as long as
we make it clear.

486
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,680
Have a good rest today.

487
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,280
And just try it once.

488
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,440
Wait and see if the sky would fall down

489
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,800
if you don't work tomorrow.

490
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,720
OK.

491
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,200
Don't cry again.

492
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,280
Do they actually make

493
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,800
different pastries every day?

494
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,800
Of course.

495
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,760
Would you sing the same tune

496
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,360
to your guests every day?

497
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,360
Help yourselves. Don't hesitate.

498
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
It's delicious.

499
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,080
The flavor is special.

500
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,360
Haohao,

501
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,040
why are you on such good terms
with Half-hidden?

502
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,600
I had people wait in the queue
for three days

503
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,520
without getting anything.

504
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,000
You're lucky.

505
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,680
They send you these every day.

506
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,560
- You can't blame me for being popular.
- Try this.

507
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,680
Coach Song of the Pipa Branch

508
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,160
and Ms. Zhao, the shopkeeper

509
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,000
call me sister respectfully.

510
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,880
How do I bear to turn them down?

511
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,160
It's early in the morning,

512
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,680
who has pissed you off already?

513
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,040
Couldn't you figure it out?

514
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,400
Chi Pan,

515
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,920
are you too bored?

516
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,840
If you're bored...

517
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,120
I'm pissed.

518
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,080
You know Zhao Pan'er is my enemy.

519
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,240
Why do you still accept her gifts?

520
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,680
Why shouldn't I accept them?

521
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,520
I hate Mr. Zhang,

522
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,880
but you treat him
every two or three days

523
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,840
at Yong'an Restaurant.

524
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,640
I was taking care of my business.

525
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,400
It's not the same.

526
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,960
I'm taking care of my business, too.

527
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,200
Your nasty little place?

528
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,600
Knock it off.

529
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,800
As long as I'm here,

530
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,960
you won't be short of money.

531
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,840
Dare you say it again?

532
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,560
Ms. Zhang, sit, please.

533
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,120
Well.

534
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,000
It's my honor that you're willing to

535
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,960
spend my money.

536
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,080
Though Shuangxi Pavilion is small,

537
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,440
you've put your heart and soul into it.

538
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,200
Much better.

539
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,640
Could you show me some respect?

540
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,600
You know Zhao Pan'er is my mortal enemy,

541
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,960
but you're still cooperating with her.

542
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,200
It makes me look bad.

543
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,760
What grudges do you have?

544
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,720
Is it because you couldn't
take liberties with Yinzhang,

545
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,480
or you couldn't top her in
kicking the ball

546
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,880
or rolling the dice?

547
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,000
Besides, if you hate her so much,

548
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,280
why did you ask Lyu Wu

549
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,920
to wait in their queue
for half of the day?

550
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,800
I didn't know

551
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,560
she owned the teahouse.

552
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,600
He Si is to be blamed.

553
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,080
He sent me their pastry containers
again and again.

554
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,080
I just ate the pastries once.

555
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,400
They're quite tasty.

556
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,520
But I must make it clear today.

557
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,440
If you don't make a clean break
with Zhao Pan'er,

558
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,240
I won't talk to you again.

559
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,840
Then you should drive me away.

560
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,720
Drive me away.

561
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,520
Dare you?

562
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
I dare not.

563
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,760
Haohao, pack it in, OK?

564
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,040
Just listen to me once.

565
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,080
Chi Pan, tell you what,

566
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,840
I've spent over 20 years
in the Music Division.

567
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,960
The thing that annoys me most

568
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,440
is someone threatening me.

569
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,960
You always buy me dresses and jewelry,

570
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,840
but you know what matters most to me?

571
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,600
The thing that matters most to me

572
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,600
is to be the top
singing performer forever.

573
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,440
Do you think what Zhao Pan'er gave me

574
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,920
was just a box of pastries?

575
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,480
You don't even know that.

576
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,840
No wonder you could do nothing
to fight her back

577
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,240
except for holding the God of Earth
and crying.

578
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,120
He Si!

579
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,960
Lyu Wu!

580
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,080
Sir.

581
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,920
Who told her about me crying

582
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,960
at the Temple of God of Earth?

583
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,560
Who did it?

584
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,880
He Si.

585
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,480
He Si, what are you eating?

586
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,400
Tasty pastries.

587
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,480
Where did you get them?

588
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,800
Pan'er gave me.

589
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,080
Why did she give you?

590
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,480
Because I did her a favor.

591
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,760
Did her a favor?

592
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,040
Sir.

593
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,000
Do you work for her or work for me?

594
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,840
I work for you.

595
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,600
But didn't you tell us

596
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,840
we should follow her orders?

597
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,440
We dare not turn a deaf ear to you.

598
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,760
Did I say it?

599
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,000
I'm so pissed off!

600
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,040
Sir, we should be honest.

601
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,000
How dare you teach me

602
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,190
while you're eating her food?

603
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,080
I must kick you.

604
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,400
Sir.

605
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,150
Sir, do you want to try it?

606
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:38,800
It's quite tasty.

607
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,760
Stop eating it!

608
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,320
It's all Zhao Pan'er's fault.

609
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,190
Don't dream of
making a living in the capital

610
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,320
after you offended me.

611
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,120
I'll give you a hard time.

612
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,710
Fan from beneath.

613
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,280
I dare not hide anything.

614
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,600
When Yu Zhongquan went to
Xiao's Mansion,

615
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,760
he only saw Young Master Xiao.

616
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,920
I dare not deceive you, sir.

617
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,120
Spare me, sir!

618
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,280
Sir, spare me!

619
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,520
Take him away.

620
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,440
Sir!

621
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,800
Sir, spare me!

622
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,360
Sir, I dare not lie to you!

623
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,400
He isn't a fool.

624
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,400
I was wondering from the beginning,

625
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,080
Minister Duke Xiao is kind to you,

626
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,520
how could he
collude with Yu Zhongquan to harm you?

627
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,880
It turns out his son did it.

628
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,360
Minister Duke Xiao

629
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,760
always hides a dagger in his smile.

630
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,440
He wouldn't kill me.

631
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,160
But giving Zhao Pan'er problems,

632
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,600
or taking advantage of that

633
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,040
to force me out of the Office
and work for him

634
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,160
is kind of what he would do.

635
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,560
What should we do now?

636
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,080
Yu Zhongquan is dead.

637
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,360
Except for the testimonies of his men,

638
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,560
we don't have any solid evidence.

639
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
To warn someone,

640
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,400
we should punish his followers first.

641
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,480
This is the gift from
the Capital Security Office.

642
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,560
Why doesn't Yu Zhongquan
come to see me

643
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,480
but bring me this instead?

644
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,360
This isn't from Yu Zhongquan.

645
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,240
Get out of my way.

646
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,080
Young Master.

647
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,840
How dare

648
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,120
a petty official bully me?

649
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,840
I'm not afraid of the direful
Capital Security Office.

650
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,000
- Young Master.
- Young Master, don't.

651
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,800
Don't try to stop me.

652
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,640
- Young Master.
- If I don't get even with it,

653
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,600
I'm not worthy of my noble surname.

654
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,160
Young Master.

655
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,880
Young Master, greetings.

656
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,040
Uncle Zhong.

657
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,640
Did my father send you back?

658
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,760
How's he?

659
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,320
Master is well.

660
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,280
He heard that

661
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,160
you did a good job

662
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
managing domestic affairs.

663
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,200
So he specially sent me back
to help you.

664
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,080
Did he really say that?

665
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,200
You're my father's
most trusted steward.

666
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,480
I dare not bother you.

667
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,000
How about this,

668
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,680
Uncle Zhong, you take a rest first.

669
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
I'm going out to run an errand.

670
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,680
We'll talk after you have a good rest.

671
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,960
Young Master, wait.

672
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,520
I have a letter for you.

673
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,080
Please listen to it on your knees.

674
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,200
What?

675
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,160
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

676
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,080
But Master said clearly,

677
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,560
you must listen to the letter
on your knees.

678
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,720
To my unfilial son,

679
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,600
when I left the capital,
I urged you repeatedly

680
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,520
to be dutiful and not to bring trouble.

681
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,080
But you dared collude with villains

682
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,280
to harm our family.

683
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,440
You mustn't harbor a vile intent

684
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,840
and make trouble out of nothing.

685
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,440
If you behave arrogantly again,

686
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,080
you won't be my son anymore.

687
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,320
Young Master, did you hear it clearly?

688
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,160
I did.

689
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,160
In that case,

690
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,280
before Master returns,

691
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,520
you'd better stay at home

692
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,720
and read more holy books.

693
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,520
How did my father know about it?

694
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,080
Because Deputy Commissioner Gu

695
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,200
sent him a deer leg and the confession

696
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
of Yu Zhongquan's confidant
at top speed.

697
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,360
Why is my father partial to him?

698
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,920
I just wanted to give him a hard time.

699
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,160
Is it worthy of him being furious?

700
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,240
Master will soon be the Prime Minister.

701
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,080
He just doesn't want

702
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,440
anything to happen before that.

703
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,880
The Capital Security Office
is His Majesty's own troop.

704
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,080
They investigated the Empress
under orders before.

705
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,600
All this...

706
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,880
Don't fob me off with this.

707
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,120
My father is a fool.

708
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,160
For Gu Qianfan,

709
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,200
he's gone completely off his head.

710
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,320
He sent you back
riding at top speed for two days

711
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,320
just to scold me for his sake?

712
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,840
I'm going to tell Mother.

713
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,760
Young Master,

714
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,280
with all due respect,

715
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,200
as an officeholder by Inheritance,

716
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,680
you don't have an actual official post.

717
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,040
Ma'am can't get you anything

718
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,280
by crying and complaining.

719
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,960
Listen to my advice.

720
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,600
Gu Qianfan isn't a man you can offend.

721
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,240
Besides,

722
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,520
he isn't your enemy.

723
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,820
(Half-hidden)

724
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,360
I'm exhausted,

725
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,280
playing pipa and making drinks.

726
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,960
I wish I could be in two places at once.

727
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,560
Why don't you let me help?

728
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,600
Mr. Shen, greetings.

729
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,920
Yinzhang, why are you so surprised?

730
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,320
Didn't you invite me over

731
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,800
to listen to you playing pipa?

732
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,640
But you didn't say you would come today.

733
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,560
And nobody informed me just now.

734
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,000
Why do you
need to be informed in advance?

735
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,680
Are you afraid of me?

736
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,080
A few days ago,

737
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,360
when you went to my house
and asked for my help,

738
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,120
you were bold, weren't you?

739
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,560
Mr. Shen,

740
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,720
I appreciate your kindness

741
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,240
for helping us that day.

742
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,120
But I don't know you well.

743
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,600
Please don't call me by my maiden name.

744
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,480
How cool you are!

745
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,960
I'm so sad.

746
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,520
If I'd known this before,

747
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,560
I wouldn't flatter myself

748
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,040
and come to give you a tip.

749
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,440
What's this?

750
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,280
See for yourself.

751
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:32,920
This...

752
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,320
How shameless!

753
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,320
I'm so pissed off.

754
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,960
Shen Ruzhuo said,

755
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,960
this afternoon,

756
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,040
there were at least four tea houses
in the Tea Lane

757
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,040
that were selling the fakes.

758
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,840
They didn't have sales limitations

759
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,960
and only sold 100 coins per box.

760
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,920
It looks like my work.

761
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,840
Mr. Shen is really warm-hearted

762
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,320
to come here to warn you.

763
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,240
The teahouses not only
fake our pastries,

764
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,520
but also fake our drinks.

765
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,960
They've stolen

766
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,120
all our drink recipes.

767
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,520
More annoying is,

768
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,240
Qingming Teahouse has hired
two pipa players,

769
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,360
who play pipa
in the teahouse all day long.

770
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,080
What about the Tea Art?

771
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,160
Did they learn it too?
