(Commander Cui?)

18
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
Gu Qianfan,

19
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,480
this is none of your business.

20
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,520
He's with the Capital Security Office.

21
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,880
Don't let him live.

22
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,360
Or we would die instead.

23
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,360
Kill him.

24
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,280
Gu Qianfan!

25
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,200
Qianfan!

26
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,040
Qianfan.

27
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,920
Qianfan.

28
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,440
Qianfan!

29
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,600
Brother.

Qianfan.

32
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,760
Brother.

33
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,760
Qianfan.

34
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,280
Such a big fire.

35
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,200
Such a big fire.

36
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,600
Qianfan!

37
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,160
Somebody! Somebody!

38
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,320
We're assassinated. We're assassinated.

39
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,520
Someone's on that boat.

40
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Help them.

41
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,680
Qianfan!

42
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,560
Make way, please.

43
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,720
Can anyone swim?

44
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,560
Look, look.

45
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,320
Too dangerous.

46
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,840
Danger.

47
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,200
Will it work?

48
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,920
It's way too dangerous.

49
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,320
Can anyone swim?

50
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,240
Will she throw it over?

51
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,280
Yeah.

52
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,480
Look. She made it.

53
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,960
Great. That's great.

54
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,200
Will it work?

55
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,840
Yeah.

56
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,120
We can't just watch them

57
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,880
get burned.

58
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,440
That's right.

59
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,000
Hurry. Do it together.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,080
- Go help her.
- Help me!

61
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,840
Go help her.

62
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,760
Come on.

63
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,960
Harder.

64
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,640
One, two.

65
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,960
One, two.

66
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,600
One.

67
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,760
One.

68
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
The boat is coming over.

69
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,680
- Harder!
- Harder!

70
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,040
Hurry.

71
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,160
It's almost here.

72
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,480
Very close.

73
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,720
It's here.

74
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,560
It's anchored.

75
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,800
Qianfan!

76
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,040
Qianfan!

77
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,080
Qianfan!

78
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,800
You?

79
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,760
You're with the Capital Security Office?

80
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,840
What are you doing?

81
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,400
Stay away.

82
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,200
He... He...

83
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,320
What are you... Don't squeeze it.

84
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,440
Why are you squeezing it?

85
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,040
Stop it. Or he'll die.

86
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,960
Be gentle.

87
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,800
There was poison in his wound.

88
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,320
Can't you see the dark blood?

89
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,840
Quickly!

90
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,840
Get out of the way!

91
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,560
Out of the way!

92
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,400
Get out of the way.

93
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,800
Quickly.

94
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,240
Come and help.

95
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,720
What's this?

96
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,800
Honey stops bleeding. It works better
than the healing powder.

97
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,440
Hurry. Press the wound.

98
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,720
- Get him up. 
- Get him up.

99
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,960
He's quite badly wounded.

100
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,600
Yeah.

101
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,360
Get out of the way!

102
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,120
Out of the way!

103
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,160
Get out of the way!

104
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,840
Make way!

105
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,320
Get out of the way!

106
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,880
Hurry.

107
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,680
Chief.

108
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,840
Somebody come! Hurry.

109
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,000
Come on.

110
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,480
Pan'er, why are you here?

111
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,400
He's still alive.

112
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,280
He was stabbed in the right breast.

113
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,800
The wound is about four cun.
[*Four cun: Equals about 13cm]

114
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,400
There's poison in the wound.

115
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,200
I squeezed as much as I could.

116
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,800
Don't worry.

117
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,560
About this...

118
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,880
Rest assured.

119
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,120
I didn't see anything.

120
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,160
I'll go back home by myself.

121
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,240
But whether he lives or dies,

122
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,720
please let me know tomorrow.

123
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,080
I'll be waiting in the teahouse.

124
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,240
All right.

125
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,400
Be careful.

126
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,000
Come on.

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,720
- Here.
- Hurry.

128
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,280
Be gentle.

129
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,040
Come!

130
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,840
Hurry.

131
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,960
Go. Hurry.

132
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,200
You losers!

133
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,720
Where were you just now?

134
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,960
I needed you at that critical moment.

135
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,790
But you...

136
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,640
Useless!

137
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,760
Come with me!

138
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,920
(Zhao Pan'er, remember.)

139
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,480
(You didn't see anything just now.)

140
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,380
(Hard Work Matters)

141
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,720
I just fed him some ginseng soup.

142
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,720
He...

143
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,520
You must bring
Deputy Commissioner Gu back to life.

144
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,360
It's the strict order
from Minister Duke Xiao.

145
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,440
Otherwise, don't dream to leave
the Capital Security Office.

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I've applied the best healing powder.

147
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,240
If he makes it through tonight,
he will survive.

148
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,040
All right, fine.

149
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,800
Anyway, do your best to treat him.

150
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,480
As long as you bring him back to life,

151
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,320
we will give you a reward.

152
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,240
Minister Duke Xiao,

153
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,000
and even His Majesty
will highly reward you, too.

154
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,840
Got it.

155
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,400
Chen Lian.

156
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,160
Chief.

157
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,880
Be gentle.

158
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,520
Qianfan.

159
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,240
Chen Lian,

160
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,280
go to see Censor Qi.

161
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,720
Tell him I woke up

162
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,960
and bring a message to him.

163
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,560
Aye.

164
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,800
Qianfan!

165
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,360
Qianfan!

166
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,720
If he can't make it through tonight...

167
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,640
Xiao Qinyan was already furious.

168
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,720
So hard.

169
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,400
So hard for me.

170
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,680
Forget it.

171
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,920
I'll just submit a report

172
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,400
to impeach the Office
of Imperial Guards first.

173
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,680
Pan'er.

174
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,760
Pan'er, why are you back so late?

175
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,680
Because I looked on something.

176
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,680
Is everything all right?

177
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,720
Yes.

178
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,440
Pan'er.

179
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,600
Pan'er.

180
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,960
Pan'er, I have something to ask you.

181
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,960
For what happened earlier,

182
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,400
I apologized already.

183
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,240
At Minister Xiao's birthday banquet,
Deputy Commissioner Gu helped me

184
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,040
so that I didn't offend those officials.

185
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,200
After thinking about it,

186
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,680
I want to give him a feast

187
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,480
just to express my gratitude.

188
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,200
But I don't know how to find him.

189
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,960
Could you ask Chen Lian about it?

190
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,080
Excuse me?

191
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,600
At Minister Xiao's birthday banquet,

192
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,200
Deputy Commissioner Gu helped me

193
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,680
so that I didn't offend those officials.

194
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,680
After thinking about it,

195
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,560
I want to give him a feast

196
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,840
just to express my gratitude.

197
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,080
But I don't know how to find him.

198
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,720
Could you ask Chen Lian about it?

199
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,640
Don't bother. He's been busy lately

200
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,000
and he doesn't have time.

201
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,680
Why?

202
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,960
And how do you know that?

203
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,280
I just know!

204
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,520
I'll go check on her.

205
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,520
Pan'er.

206
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,560
Pan'er, are you all right?

207
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,160
I'm all right.

208
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,600
Would you like something to eat?

209
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,280
Go to sleep early.

210
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,840
Let me know if you need anything.

211
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,400
Pan'er,

212
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,750
you barely slept last night.

213
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,320
Don't go to the teahouse today.

214
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,720
We have to work, no matter what happens.

215
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,600
Don't go.

216
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,400
Pan'er,

217
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
Yinzhang said she didn't feel very well

218
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,640
and she wouldn't play pipa
in the teahouse today.

219
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,840
Whatever.

220
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,080
Pan'er doesn't look right.
What happened?

221
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,280
Don't ask.

222
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,720
Go to the teahouse with her.

223
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,440
I'll catch up.

224
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,400
Fine.

225
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,860
(Half-hidden)

226
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,320
It's way too muggy.

227
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:06,990
It is.

228
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,320
Here's the food.

229
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,480
Have some pastries first.

230
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,920
What kind of tea would you like?

231
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,120
Sanniang,

232
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,640
doesn't Ms. Song come every day?

233
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,480
Why isn't she here today?

234
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,520
She doesn't feel very well.

235
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,080
When will she come, then?

236
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,400
I'm not sure.

237
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,920
Why isn't the tea served yet?

238
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,960
It's too hot.

239
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,640
Yeah.

240
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,920
I feel too hot to breathe.

241
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,480
Zhaodi,

242
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,640
get me a Honey Bean Smoothie.

243
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,840
Right. I want that, too.

244
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,120
Why isn't my smoothie served yet?

245
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,520
Ours isn't served, either.

246
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,200
In a minute. In a minute.

247
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,360
Yeah. Ours isn't served, either.

248
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,400
- Come on.
- Serve it quickly.

249
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,000
Sanniang,

250
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,360
we don't even have any ice.

251
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,400
How can we make any smoothie?

252
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,120
Then go buy some ice at Wang's Ice Shop.

253
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,920
I went there this morning,

254
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,400
but all the ice had been sold out.

255
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,680
I don't know when it'll be replenished.

256
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,040
Pan'er has gone there again.

257
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,760
Fine, then.

258
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,400
What about the customers?

259
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,840
I'll see what I can do.

260
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,040
You go and tell them the truth.

261
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,200
Come on.

262
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,160
Sorry, everybody.

263
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,320
No smoothie today.

264
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,320
Why?

265
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,920
- Why is there no smoothie?
- We have no ice.

266
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,600
Yeah, why...

267
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,280
We have no ice.

268
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,680
How can we do without ice
on such a hot day?

269
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,160
Yeah.

270
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,800
Ms. Song isn't here, either.

271
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,000
Fine. We should go.

272
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,600
We'll take our leave.

273
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,040
Come tomorrow.

274
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,680
We should go, too.

275
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,200
Go, go, go.

276
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,040
My tea isn't served yet.

277
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,160
Please come tomorrow.

278
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,240
Ice will be available tomorrow.

279
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,180
(Wang's Ice Shop)

280
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,200
Isn't this ice?

281
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,640
Why can't you sell any to me?

282
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,200
Ms. Zhao, let me get this straight.

283
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,640
I can't sell any ice to you.

284
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,840
Moreover, nearly all the local ice shops

285
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,000
will not sell any ice to you.

286
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,360
Why?

287
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,960
Did you offend Young Master Chi?

288
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,400
He's the head of the ice industry.

289
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,520
He threatened us.

290
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,600
If anyone sells ice to you,

291
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,520
he'll kill that man.

292
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,520
I think he just wants to screw you.

293
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,320
What do we do, then?

294
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,040
We don't get along with Young Master Chi

295
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,480
for quite a few days.

296
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,080
Let's figure out another plan.

297
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,680
I'll go ask He Si for help

298
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,000
or consult Zhang Haohao.

299
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,320
Are you going right away?

300
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,240
I'm waiting for a message.

301
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,600
I can't leave this street
for the moment.

302
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,160
It's way too hot.

303
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,120
Go back home and wait.

304
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,440
I'll take care of everything here.

305
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,560
Check if Yinzhang had lunch.

306
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,920
She always has a bad appetite in summer.

307
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,040
I wonder

308
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,640
if she wants to talk to us.

309
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,400
Zhaodi and I will go
and try to buy some ice.

310
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,000
Zhaodi, here we go.

311
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,160
Be right there.

312
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,000
Pan'er, we'll take our leave.

313
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,400
Without ice in summer,

314
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,200
it's hard to do business
in the Eastern Capital.

315
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,840
Pan'er even wants to open a restaurant.

316
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,600
If we can't solve the ice problem,

317
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,760
she will not realize her dream.

318
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,240
We will solve the problem.

319
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,960
We even met

320
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,440
bigger problems.

321
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,960
We're looking for the restaurant site.
We're looking for ice, too.

322
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,640
If big ice shops don't sell ice to us,

323
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,040
we can try small shops.

324
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,760
You know a lot of people

325
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,960
near the wharf, right?

326
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,760
Could you ask around?

327
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,560
I'm on it.

328
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,840
By the way,

329
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
I heard about some small
ice shops in Fanshan.

330
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,440
Give me some money.

331
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,320
If ice is available there,

332
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,200
I'll buy some back.

333
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,760
All right.

334
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,240
Take it all.

335
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,040
I'm going there immediately.

336
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,200
Sir, pull over, please.

337
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,840
All right.

338
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,160
Be careful.

339
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,040
There he is. Shoot.

340
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,440
Hurry.

341
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,400
Shoot. Shoot.

342
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
Who did this?

343
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,960
How dare you!

344
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,680
Run. Hurry.

345
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,320
Pull over, please.

346
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,600
Thank you.

347
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,880
Where are your glasses?

348
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,640
Broken again?

349
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,240
No.

350
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,080
I usually put them on
after I arrive at the academy.

351
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,560
Unexpectedly...

352
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,000
The books are wet.

353
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,440
Are you a dummy?

354
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,560
When they shot you,

355
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,200
why didn't you even dodge or scold them?

356
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,760
When Chen Lian told me you were bullied,

357
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,720
I could hardly believe him.

358
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,000
But I witnessed it just now.

359
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,280
You're even more cowardly
than how Chen Lian described.

360
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,280
I'm a teacher.

361
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,200
How can I get angry with my students?

362
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,000
They were just joking.

363
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,720
Joking?

364
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,800
Look how they hurt me!

365
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,880
Oh, you're bleeding.

366
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,640
How lawless they are!

367
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,120
I can't bear it.
I must teach them a lesson.

368
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,080
Where are you going?

369
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,240
You...

370
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,560
You can't get in there.

371
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,400
It hurts.

372
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,160
Who shot me?

373
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,680
- He.
- He... He did.

374
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,520
Be gentle.

375
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,240
Tell the truth!

376
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:34,880
Sanniang.

377
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,560
Tell me who did that!

378
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,080
Sanniang.

379
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,800
Be... Be gentle.

380
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,600
Stand there.

381
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,240
What a woman! What do you want?

382
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,400
Principal, let me explain.

383
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,280
You're the principal, right?

384
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,800
Your student hurt me.

385
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,640
And as you can see,

386
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,920
neither of them admitted it.

387
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,800
Please help me find out

388
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,320
who hurt me, too.

389
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,920
I'll get even with them.

390
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,080
Apologize.

391
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,320
We hurt you by accident.

392
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,560
Sorry.

393
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,800
You hurt me by accident.

394
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,480
What about him?

395
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,960
Did you hurt him by accident, too?

396
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,840
It's not your first time
to bully Mr. Du.

397
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,560
He's your teacher.

398
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,920
Why do you never respect him?

399
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,840
What have you learned from books?

400
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,160
We indeed bullied him.

401
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,640
It's because he has such poor eyesight

402
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,480
and can't see clearly.

403
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,760
He has poor eyesight?

404
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,280
Step out.

405
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,040
How dare you blame it on him!

406
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,640
Stop, Ms. Sun.

407
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,360
I'm the son of Count of Loyalty.

408
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,440
If you dare to beat me,

409
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,600
believe it or not, I'll report you!

410
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,240
Report me?

411
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,840
I don't care who you are!

412
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,960
If you want to report me, go ahead.

413
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,080
But now,

414
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,480
I'll take off your pants

415
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,520
and spank you.

416
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,160
Don't, don't.

417
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,320
When officers come

418
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,560
and see you being spanked by a woman,

419
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,920
let's see how shameful you'll be!

420
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,000
Stop it.

421
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,880
Stop it. Just stop it.

422
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,080
Don't. Don't take off his pants.

423
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,120
- I won't report you. I won't.
- Don't take off his pants.

424
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,480
Have you realized your mistake?

425
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,120
Have you?

426
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,880
Sorry, Mr. Du.

427
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,640
I shouldn't have bullied you.

428
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,800
This is an academy.

429
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,600
An academy in the Eastern Capital.

430
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,960
Do you know how hard it is

431
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,160
to study in such an academy?

432
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,760
My son is in Qiantang County.

433
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,240
It's thousands of miles away from here.

434
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,480
I saved money for six months

435
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,920
before I finally got a teacher

436
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,200
to give him classes

437
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
who once stayed in the Eastern Capital.

438
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,040
We even dream to study
in this kind of academy.

439
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,920
What about you?

440
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,920
Your teacher is
this year's Presented Scholar,

441
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,920
but you never cherish him.

442
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,280
I don't mean to look down on you.

443
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,200
Your family members may be officials.

444
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,720
But you're not officials, anyway.

445
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,640
Why do you find yourselves
superior to others?

446
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,800
One of my ancestors
used to be a high official, too.

447
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,080
What about now?

448
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,200
I still served as a butcher
and I sell tea now.

449
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,160
Mr. Du failed to be an official yet.

450
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,880
But this year,

451
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,240
he became the Presented Scholar

452
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,200
with his real knowledge.

453
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,720
He will get a chance to be an official.

454
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,240
Look how generous he is

455
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,800
to bear you for such a long time.

456
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,760
What kind of man is he?

457
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,520
He's the bigger person!

458
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,880
Principal,

459
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,320
I'm an ignorant woman.

460
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,360
But when you teach students,

461
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,960
shouldn't you teach them how to behave

462
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,520
apart from how to study?

463
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,360
I guess

464
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,240
you know it better than I do.

465
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,960
You...

466
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,160
You're just like my ungrateful son.

467
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,040
You don't cherish those

468
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
who really care about you.

469
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,120
Instead, you...

470
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,800
Forget it. I'll say no more.

471
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,480
Hope you'll behave yourselves.

472
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,160
Ms. Sun, your basket...

473
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,200
(Capital Security Office)
We know very clearly

474
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,480
how Deputy Commissioner Gu treats us.

475
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,160
Yes.

476
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,960
Search the river very carefully.

477
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,840
Whether the assassins are alive
after they fell into the water,

478
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,480
we must find them!

479
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,600
- Right. Let's find them.
- Let's find them!

480
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,440
- Doctor.
- Doctor, doctor.

481
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,240
Doctor.

482
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,360
How is he?

483
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,240
Go without me.

484
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,000
Go.

485
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,040
Didn't you say when he made it
through last night...

486
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,100
Shh.

487
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,520
Why hasn't he woken up yet?

488
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,200
Minister Duke Xiao

489
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,880
got an imperial physician
from the Palace.

490
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,640
He's excellent at acupuncture.

491
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,680
Whether Deputy Commissioner Gu will live

492
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,640
counts on him.

493
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,240
Sanniang!

494
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,800
Sanniang, your basket.

495
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,480
Take it easy. I'll get it next time.

496
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,480
But...

497
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,800
I...

498
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,400
I should...

499
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,920
I should thank you for defending me.

500
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,320
When you came to the inn

501
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,040
and tried to persuade Pan'er
for Ouyang Xu,

502
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,280
you were quite talkative, weren't you?

503
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,480
But in front of the boys,

504
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,760
why didn't you dare to say anything?

505
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,080
You're just a cowardly bully.

506
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,880
Right. Right. I'm a coward.

507
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,280
So, I disgraced myself
in front of His Majesty.

508
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,400
I stammered and couldn't make my point.

509
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,520
Only stammered?

510
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,920
Nothing else?

511
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,960
Shameful! Shameful!

512
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,600
Don't bring it up ever again.

513
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,040
Since I made a fool of myself
in front of His Majesty,

514
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,280
no one has defended me like this before.

515
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,240
It's no big deal.

516
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,880
Never mind.

517
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,960
Yeah. It's no big deal.

518
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,960
Thank you, sir.

519
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,840
No problem. Thanks for buying.

520
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,120
How much is this?

521
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,680
Take a rest.

522
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,440
Come on.

523
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,840
Ge Zhaodi.

524
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,400
I'll see how you can get away again.

525
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,040
Let go of me!

526
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,200
Stop!

527
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,480
I got you!

528
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,080
Stop running.

529
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,160
What are you doing?

530
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,080
What do you want?

531
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,800
I got you.

532
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,960
- Don't dream to run away.
- Let go of me.

533
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,440
Come and look.

534
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,920
She's beating her own mother.

535
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,560
Let go of me!

536
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,320
Stop yelling.

537
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,080
Or I won't give you any money.

538
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,400
After ten months of pregnancy,

539
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,640
I just have such an ungrateful daughter.

540
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,600
I'll give you some money.

541
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,240
Give it to me.

542
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,480
It's what my employer has given me.

543
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,320
I can only give you a little.

544
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,680
Don't just say thank you.

545
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,920
If you're really grateful,

546
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,040
give me money.

547
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,880
I... I have one string.

548
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,960
Is it enough?

549
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,840
Take it.

550
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,000
Why did you really give me money?

551
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,080
I won't take it.

552
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,200
You won't?

553
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,600
I'm glad to hear that.

554
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,840
Tell me.

555
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,040
Can you see faintly in the day

556
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,440
but nothing at night?

557
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,280
Were you able to see things

558
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,760
but lost your eyesight in recent years?

559
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,360
How... How do you know that?

560
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,960
You're sick.

561
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
I'm... I'm sick?

562
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,800
(Fresh vegetables for sale.)

563
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,920
I know a folk recipe.

564
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,340
(Pork Seller)

565
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,120
This piece, please.

566
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,200
What's this?

567
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,880
Take it.

568
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,120
It's pork liver.

569
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,520
Haven't you tasted any?

570
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,840
I have. But it didn't look like this.

571
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,240
Eat one piece each day.

572
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,520
For 30 days in succession.

573
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,200
Don't be scared.

574
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,720
I've been a butcher for a dozen years.

575
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,920
Quite a few people's shortsightedness

576
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,360
has been cured by the pork liver.

577
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,560
Remember to eat it.

578
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,600
But how shall I cook it?

579
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,360
Any way you want.

580
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:57,920
But...

581
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,840
(Pork Seller)
Sir, how shall I cook it?

582
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,800
Didn't she tell you? Any way you want.

583
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,760
Chief.

584
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,880
You must wake up, Chief.

585
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,120
It's been a whole day.

586
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,800
Pan'er is still waiting for my message.

587
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,000
Don't make me send her the bad news.

588
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,800
Chief.

589
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,360
Chief, I guess you don't know this yet.

590
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,240
This time,

591
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,520
Pan'er saved your life again.

592
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,080
If she hadn't arrived in time that day,

593
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,040
you would be...

594
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,880
Chief, don't disappoint her.

595
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,200
You must live.

596
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,480
I won't.

597
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,800
Chief.

598
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,880
I won't disappoint her.

599
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,000
I knew it.

600
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,640
Doctor, he's awake.

601
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,280
Come and check on him, doctor.

602
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,920
All right.

603
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,600
He's awake?

604
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,040
Did you do what I told you to?

605
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,400
Yes.

606
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,200
What did he say?

607
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,960
When Censor Qi saw the messenger,

608
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,720
he first asked,

609
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,240
"When did Commander Cui die?

610
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,040
What about Xiao Qinyan? Still alive?"

611
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,800
When did he ask about me?

612
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,160
In the 36th sentence he said.

613
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,240
Get me up. Get me up!

614
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,400
No way, Chief.

615
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,600
You need to recuperate.

616
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,840
You mustn't get up.

617
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,680
I said, I don't want it!

618
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,480
Song Yinzhang,

619
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,960
don't push it.

620
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,520
I don't know
why you're angry with Pan'er.

621
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,550
But I haven't offended you.

622
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,360
Sorry. My bad.

623
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,590
Stop.

624
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,150
Don't hurt your precious hands.

625
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,110
If you can't play pipa,

626
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,400
you'll blame us
for hurting your self-esteem.

627
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,840
I've been expecting
to say something for days.

628
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,440
And I'm going to say it now.

629
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,520
Right, you got famous
at Minister Xiao's birthday banquet.

630
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,240
But why are you often showing off

631
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,880
back at home?

632
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,760
The day before yesterday,
you gave us attitude.

633
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,720
Yesterday, you ran away, crying.

634
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,160
Today, you smashed the bowl.

635
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,600
Do you really think you're a princess

636
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,080
just because of the autograph
on your pipa?

637
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,360
Whenever you were aggrieved

638
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,360
or felt unhappy,

639
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,360
Pan'er cheered you up.

640
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,520
But what did you do?

641
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,040
Just because of a little argument,

642
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,080
you even don't play pipa
in the teahouse.

643
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,840
Is it still the teahouse

644
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,120
we three run together?

645
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,560
Sanniang,

646
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,080
I really don't feel very well.

647
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,000
Then why were you strong enough
to smash the bowl?

648
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,120
Pan'er really doesn't feel well.

649
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,480
Since last night,

650
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,960
she couldn't even walk straight.

651
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,400
But she still went to the teahouse.

652
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,120
She even told me

653
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,280
that you had a bad appetite in summer

654
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,320
and asked me to prepare
light food for you.

655
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,840
What have you been doing to her?

656
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,000
Have you ever cared about her?

657
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,040
I'm a rough woman

658
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,080
and I don't know about arts.

659
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,480
I just know one thing.

660
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,720
You and she aren't real family members.

661
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,440
She doesn't owe you anything.

662
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,400
She isn't your mother, either.

663
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,680
Pan'er.

664
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,480
I know you would live.

665
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,920
You're the Living Devil.

666
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,040
No one dares to take your life.

667
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,520
My silly girl.

668
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,200
I couldn't feel relieved
until I saw you.

669
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,720
Without me,

670
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,440
who would quarrel with you?

671
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,200
Who would take a walk with you?

672
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,000
Who would accompany you
when you run the teahouse?

673
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,240
Come and say thank you
to Mr. Gu who saved us.

674
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,600
It's him who helped us out.

675
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,640
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

676
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,480
You're welcome.

677
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,560
Let me check on your hand.

678
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,360
The money is enough for you

679
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,000
to redeem your father's jade pommel.

680
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,280
It's all right.

681
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,560
Why are you so depressed?

682
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,280
You know what?

683
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,680
Ouyang Xu expelled you
from the Eastern Capital.

684
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,480
But I can get you back there.

685
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,480
Leave me here. You should go back.

686
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,440
No. I can't rest assured
until I see you enter the room.

687
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,040
Deputy Commissioner Gu?

688
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,520
Pan'er.

689
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,360
It's already this late.
Why are you here together?

690
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,960
Ge Zhaodi is involved
in the Hat Demon case.

691
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,280
Pan'er is her employer.

692
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,400
She was then interrogated
in the Capital Security Office.

693
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,240
Yinzhang,

694
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,200
I found you, at last.

695
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,360
Why did you suddenly

696
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,200
run out of our home?

697
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,520
I'm sorry.

698
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,720
Just now...

699
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,720
Just now, I...

700
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,240
I was being too mean.

701
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,200
My apologies.

702
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,880
I'm all right.

703
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,440
I ran out because

704
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,280
I left the score
Deputy Commissioner Gu gave me

705
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,760
in Zhang Haohao's room.

706
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,520
If it's lost, it'll be awful.

707
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,720
I'm glad you're all right.

708
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,320
If...

709
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,960
If it's really lost,

710
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,760
Deputy Commissioner Gu may get angry.

711
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,480
Do you think I can ask Pan'er

712
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,960
to intercede for me?

713
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,880
Sure. Sure.

714
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,120
They're getting engaged soon.

715
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,960
The score isn't a big deal.

716
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,120
They are?

717
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,560
That's... That's great, then.

718
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,160
I'm... I'm going to see Haohao now.

719
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:02,960
To Shuangxi Pavilion, please.

720
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,720
All right.

721
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,280
Here we go.

722
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,120
Miss, are you all right?

723
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:27,960
Yes.

724
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,360
I just got to know

725
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,920
that I had been kept in the dark.

726
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,480
So, everyone knew it,

727
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,840
but me.

728
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,000
Don't take me to Shuangxi Pavilion.

729
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,560
To Left Street
of Changle Residential instead.

730
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:51,720
All right.

731
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,360
Yinzhang, there you are, at last.

732
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,760
You said something to me that night.

733
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,160
Does it still count?

734
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,320
Of course.

735
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,680
Say it again.

736
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,280
You're a treasure.

737
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,800
You're not supposed
to fall into the mire.

738
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,560
Let me take care of you

739
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,360
and protect you,

740
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:33,760
will you?
