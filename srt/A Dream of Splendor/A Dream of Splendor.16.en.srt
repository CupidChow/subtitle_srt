=Episode 16=

17
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,280
They've stolen

18
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,440
all our drink recipes.

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,840
More annoying is,

20
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,560
Qingming Teahouse
has hired two pipa players,

21
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,680
who play pipa
in the teahouse all day long.

22
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,400
What about the Tea Art?

23
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,480
Did they learn it too?

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,480
Not that, though.

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,800
Well, that's it.

26
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,120
Also,

27
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,440
you can't keep accusing them
of selling fakes, can you?

28
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,040
No law

29
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,120
or rule

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,440
says that only we have the right
to sell Peach Blossom Cakes.

31
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,920
Pan'er,

32
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,840
why do you defend them?

33
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,920
Ever since the first
Peach Blossom Cake was made,

34
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,840
I had known it'd be

35
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,680
stolen sooner or later.

36
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,200
But

37
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,320
it's actually a good thing.

38
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,040
How can it be a good thing?

39
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,320
Taste it.

40
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,520
Too sweet.

41
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,160
The filling is too greasy,
and the dough is too hard.

42
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,240
It's not good.

43
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,080
The problem has solved itself, then.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
They can steal the recipe,

45
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,160
but once being eaten,

46
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
the difference can be told.

47
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,720
But those who never tried ours

48
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,640
can't tell the difference.

49
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,760
Shen Ruzhuo said

50
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,320
that loads of people queued
for their cakes in Tea Lane.

51
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,440
If they have more customers,

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,880
we have less, right?

53
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,680
Let me ask you,

54
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,280
if you go watch a play,

55
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,960
would you like to see one person
play the sword

56
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,760
or a combat of several men?

57
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,080
More men, of course.

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,680
I get it.

59
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,560
The Peach Blossom Cake

60
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,000
is better to be advertised

61
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,160
by our competitors

62
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,440
rather than us alone.

63
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,960
Once it's eaten,

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,440
they'll immediately tell good from bad.

65
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,080
It's only the three of us.

66
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,360
The best we can do

67
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,480
is sell several dozens of boxes a day.

68
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,480
We have less than 100 customers
on a daily basis.

69
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,080
Why would we

70
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,600
compete with the peers in Tea Lane?

71
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,040
We'll choose a way of doing business
to our advantage,

72
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,280
focus on ingenuity,
gracefulness, and exquisiteness.

73
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,160
We just remain
as the groundbreakers in Qiantang,

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,600
and the more follow our lead,

75
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,720
the better for the reputation

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,680
of Half-hidden.

77
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,720
As for the pipa players who copy you…

78
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,270
- Bravo!
- Bravo! Bravo!

79
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,760
Someone calls herself Ms. Zhao
asks to see you outside.

80
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,480
Ms. Zhao?

81
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,640
Ms. Zhao.

82
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,880
Gentlemen.

83
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,400
We have opened for seven days.

84
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,680
To repay your support,

85
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,600
there will be
an extra pipa performance.

86
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,720
Please go upstairs.

87
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,160
Are you saying

88
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,440
we can listen to the music upstairs

89
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,000
without buying osmanthus nectar?

90
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,920
The drinks are ready for you.

91
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,120
- Joy falls from Heaven.
- Wonderful.

92
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,480
Thank you, Ms. Zhao.

93
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,880
Keep it down, please?

94
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,640
Great.

95
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:06,880
Come on.

96
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,600
It's just excellent.

97
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,680
Wonderful.

98
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,560
This way, please.

99
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,680
But it feels like

100
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,880
there are many customers.

101
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,840
You didn't come yesterday.

102
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,600
You were at Tea Lane, weren't you?

103
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,040
Their osmanthus nectar

104
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,600
costs less,

105
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,200
but

106
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,960
their cakes

107
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,560
can't really compete

108
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,360
with the ones Half-hidden makes.

109
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,720
It does feel unfilled here.

110
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,680
Indeed.

111
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,520
I see the refreshments are ready.

112
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,080
Sit, please.

113
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,560
I feel very welcome.

114
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,000
Sit.

115
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,160
Ms. Song is an amazing musician.

116
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,000
Her Song of Wang Zhaojun

117
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,240
is full of emotions.

118
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,280
It's like music from Heaven.

119
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,280
I, however, think

120
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,040
the music sounds backward

121
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,000
compared to what she played
a few days ago.

122
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,600
The Song of Wang Zhaojun, again?

123
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,800
What…

124
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,680
Is it Ms. Song in the room?

125
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,770
Come on. Let's go.

126
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,040
I'd like to offer
a handsome amount of gold

127
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,400
for you to accept me as your student.

128
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,400
W-What…

129
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,120
Arise, please.

130
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,840
As fellow pipa players,

131
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,640
we'll look to exchange experience.

132
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,480
A teacher-student
relationship isn't necessary.

133
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,760
Come. We'll talk inside.

134
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,840
Suniang is a fine musician,

135
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,400
but in comparison,

136
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Ms. Song is slightly better.

137
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,720
More than slightly.

138
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,720
Suniang's Song of Wang Zhaojun is good,

139
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,480
euphonic.

140
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,440
It's top-level music.

141
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,680
But think about it.

142
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,760
Wang Zhaojun crossed border
for the nation.

143
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,120
She had more in her heart
than a female's interest.

144
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,240
That's why

145
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,040
Ms. Song's music

146
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,680
combines euphony,

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,160
weariness,

148
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,520
homesickness,

149
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,840
and, most importantly, resolution

150
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,360
and patriotism.

151
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,480
It delivers Wang Zhaojun's

152
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,400
noble wish for a forever secure border
of the Han dynasty.

153
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,600
Well said.

154
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,160
However,

155
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,560
the imitator

156
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,840
never competes with the originator.

157
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,440
It applies to the music,

158
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,680
so to the food.

159
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,280
Indeed.

160
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,560
You can tell the differences

161
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,920
from the details.

162
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,520
You can go to Tea Lane

163
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,480
if you like.

164
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,040
From this day on,

165
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,200
this will be the only place
where I enjoy the recreations.

166
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,920
Wait…

167
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,040
The fewer customers,

168
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,840
the more Ms. Song's pipa music for me.

169
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,840
I'll only come here

170
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,120
just like you.

171
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,200
W-W-What does
Song Yinzhang look like?

172
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,480
I-I didn't really catch her look.

173
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,760
What's the matter
with your pair of big eyes?

174
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,800
Oh, thank you.

175
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,160
You have missed too much.

176
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,520
What?

177
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,480
(Mr. Hu, Owner of Qingming Tea House)
They even took Suniang away?

178
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,960
That's a slap in our face.

179
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,240
So they treat all the tea houses

180
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,840
in Tea Lane

181
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,240
like dirt!

182
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,440
The weather is nice.

183
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,160
Nice. Really nice.

184
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,880
Anybody here?

185
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,640
Anybody?

186
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,800
Where are the waitresses?

187
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,640
Sorry, gentlemen, but we're full.

188
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,400
That's strange.

189
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,840
Ms. Zhao,

190
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,760
you stole Suniang from us,

191
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,000
and here you pretend

192
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,880
that you don't know we're owners
of tea houses in Tea Lane?

193
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,400
Oh, isn't it Mr. Hu,
the owner of Qingming Tea House?

194
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,880
Mr. Hu.

195
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,080
Mr. Hu.

196
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,600
To what do I owe the honor?

197
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,640
Half-hidden outshines us all.

198
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,120
It's our honor to see you.

199
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,560
We only came here

200
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,360
to greet you.

201
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,440
From days of old, the philosophy of tea

202
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,160
has always been about virtues,

203
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,760
peace, and harmony.

204
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,720
However, Half-hidden self-assertively

205
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,720
prices their services high,

206
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,400
and they even came up
with the disgraceful idea

207
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,600
of attracting customers with music.

208
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,760
It's an approach that brothels adopt.

209
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,520
They have disgraced the tea ceremony.

210
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,960
A disgrace.

211
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,920
A total disgrace.

212
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,640
A disgrace.

213
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,280
We despise such behaviors.

214
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,440
So we'd like to inform you

215
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,360
that from tomorrow on,

216
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,600
all the 27 tea houses in Tea Lane

217
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,320
won't receive those who spend money

218
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,880
in Half-hidden.

219
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,720
- You're not welcome.
- Yes.

220
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,560
W-W-Why do you

221
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,640
have to do this?

222
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,240
We're all neighbors,

223
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,480
friends.

224
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,680
Today, we have fun in Half-hidden,

225
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,400
but we'll also go to Tea Lane

226
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,840
some other day with our pals.

227
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,560
Yes, yes.

228
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,920
Mr. Hu, harmony brings wealth.

229
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,440
Harmony brings wealth, right?

230
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,880
Mr. Zhuoshi,

231
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,960
enough of your persuasions.

232
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,640
As the saying goes,

233
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,960
different people go different ways.

234
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,280
Though we're only businessmen,

235
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,360
we can't tolerate being compared

236
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,400
with these depraved

237
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,640
harlots.

238
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,160
Who do you call harlots?

239
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,000
Shut your dirty mouth.

240
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,320
All right, all right.

241
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,640
It appears

242
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,440
you're here to look for trouble.

243
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,520
Well, this is my question for you.

244
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,520
Since you despise Half-hidden so much,

245
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,000
why do you keep stealing
our business ideas?

246
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,600
From our drink recipes,
our cakes, to the pipa music,

247
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,800
you missed nothing.

248
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,880
Everyone prices their items differently.

249
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,920
You said I sell my tea for high prices,

250
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,160
then answer me.

251
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,960
Why do you sell the fan

252
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,320
with your Peach Blossom drawing

253
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,200
for 50 strings of copper coins,

254
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,000
yet that of an average painter sells
only for 50 copper coins?

255
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,440
And what's more absurd is,

256
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,240
you spitefully call

257
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,720
a cup of tea over music disgraceful.

258
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,840
Here's another question for you.

259
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,680
When the former emperor granted
the officials the tea of Beiyuan

260
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,960
25 years ago,

261
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,720
a musician played
the Spring Dawn on the scene.

262
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,080
Ms. Song

263
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,400
often plays music for His Majesty
in the imperial palace,

264
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,360
yet you call her a depraved harlot?

265
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,840
Are you saying

266
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,200
that His Majesty has no taste?

267
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,040
Well said. Well said.

268
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,200
Yes, yes. That's true.

269
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,720
We won't argue with women.

270
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,960
Anyway, from tomorrow on,

271
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,480
you choose between Tea Lane
and Half-hidden.

272
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's either them or us.

273
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
How do we make the choice?

274
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,880
Right, right.

275
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,880
It's too difficult for us.

276
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,520
See you.

277
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,240
Stop.

278
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,760
You came to look for trouble,

279
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,920
and you don't get away with it.

280
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,040
None of you gets out of here.

281
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,120
What? What do they want?

282
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,960
What is all this?

283
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,200
You're pushing us

284
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,600
to close our business.

285
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,920
But there are still rules.

286
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,160
Before we opened Half-hidden,

287
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,600
we registered and paid money

288
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,320
in the tea association
of the Eastern Capital.

289
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,960
If this doesn't end well,

290
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,920
I'll leave my business here,

291
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,640
sue you in the local government

292
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,680
and let everyone here see

293
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,720
who's right and who's wrong.

294
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,040
You...

295
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,280
Why are you

296
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,240
such a vicious woman?

297
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,640
Compared to what you did,

298
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,080
I'm a lot nicer and kinder.

299
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,240
When you bullied

300
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,320
and insulted us,

301
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,040
didn't you think we'd get back at you?

302
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,720
Or you think you can push us around

303
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,960
just because we're women?

304
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,360
You actually believe we'll
listen to your nonsense

305
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
and close our shop that easily?

306
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,200
Uh… It's…

307
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,840
They're new in the capital city,

308
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,440
and already, they have opened
this large tea house.

309
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,080
I don't think it's a good idea
to escalate the friction.

310
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,120
But we mustn't yield at this point.

311
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,440
Then what do you want?

312
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,720
Zhao Pan'er.

313
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,120
Don't think we'll be threatened

314
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,000
if you play a badass.

315
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,760
How about

316
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,480
a match of tea ceremony with me?

317
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,080
You ask for a contest?

318
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,840
Correct.

319
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,920
If you lose,

320
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,200
you are to close
your business immediately.

321
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,920
If we lose,

322
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,360
we'll pour tea to apologize to you,

323
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,960
and we won't say any bad word

324
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,640
against Half-hidden anymore.

325
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,920
So?

326
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,240
Do you accept the challenge?

327
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,000
Sure.

328
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,680
I take the challenge.

329
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,160
Come and see. Come and see.

330
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,760
The tea house owners from Tea Lane
challenge Half-hidden.

331
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:09,830
- Come and see.
- Come on. Let's have a look.

332
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,200
Come and see.

333
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,440
The tea house owners from Tea Lane
throw down a challenge.

334
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,590
Come here. Come here.

335
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,800
Who are you?

336
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,720
Sun Li.

337
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,480
I heard your voice from a distance.

338
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,560
Why are you hanging
around the street?

339
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,310
Go to school now.

340
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,830
Come on, Mr. Du.

341
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,200
The tea house owners from Tea Lane

342
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,920
came to challenge Half-hidden.

343
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,960
That's fun.

344
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,280
You wouldn't like to miss out on that.

345
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,280
- That's more interesting than school.
- Challenge?

346
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,040
So it's a tea ceremony contest?

347
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,880
I'll teach you
what a tea ceremony contest is.

348
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,640
What are the rules
in the Eastern Capital?

349
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,240
There are three aspects.

350
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,920
Color, water trace, and the taste.

351
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,560
We pick our own tea bricks and water,

352
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,360
and we'll have five tasters.

353
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,280
Best out of 3.

354
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,480
Do you accept the rules?

355
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,520
Sure.

356
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,800
Good.

357
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,760
I shall use

358
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,560
Beiyuan Early Spring Tea.

359
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,960
As we all know,

360
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,200
tea picked before Qingming Festival
values as much as gold.

361
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,640
Since we're from Qiantang,

362
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,280
we'll, of course, use
Jing Shan Tea before Grain Rain.

363
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,400
I can't find my eyeglasses.

364
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,200
Tell me what's going on.

365
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,200
Mr. Hu has a gold grinder.

366
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,440
It's dazzling.

367
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,560
The water I shall use

368
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,880
is Chan spring from Mt. Tiantai.

369
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,040
- Whoa. Chan spring.
- Chan spring.

370
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,320
That's professional.

371
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,080
Yes.

372
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,800
We'll use

373
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,920
ordinary rainwater.

374
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,280
That's…

375
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,640
Rainwater?

376
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,160
In this case,

377
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,120
Half-hidden sets themselves
at a disadvantage at the start.

378
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,000
Beiyuan Tea

379
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,000
is tribute tea of this year.

380
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,160
Jing Shan Tea?

381
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,440
I've never heard of that.

382
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,640
And it's before Grain Rain.

383
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,480
According to Lu Yu's Book of Tea,

384
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,400
spring water from the mountain

385
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,480
is best for making tea.

386
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,120
Rainwater can't compete

387
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,040
with Chan spring from Mt. Tiantai.

388
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,120
Exactly.

389
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,160
Here.

390
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,440
This is the gold grinder passed down
by Lu Tong, the God of Tea.

391
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,720
It's gold.

392
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,640
A gold grinder overtops all.

393
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,960
It won't stain or taint the tea.

394
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,160
The tea ground by it

395
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,960
is fine and fragrant.

396
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,600
In contrast, Ms. Zhao's

397
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,440
little grinder

398
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,640
seems cheap.

399
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,200
Just grind the tea.

400
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,120
What's with the coquettish dance?

401
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,320
How about a dance-off?

402
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,080
It's obviously the brothel way.

403
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,400
Watch your mouth.

404
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,920
Great men can have poor births.

405
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,840
Shi Le was but a slave,

406
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,160
yet he would become
the founding emperor of a dynasty.

407
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,160
The contestants are allowed
to show off their own skills.

408
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,080
Half-hidden never called
his gold grinder superficial.

409
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,400
Mr. Hu's bitter words

410
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,880
have made himself look bad.

411
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,880
This is new.

412
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,280
She's a good dancer.

413
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,200
Whoa.

414
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,160
With the fan in her hand,

415
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,240
it looks like the dance of butterfly
at the festivals.

416
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,520
Time for tea-making, right?

417
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,880
Yes. Mr. Hu has begun.

418
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,960
Drip like the breath
of a silver dragon.

419
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,480
Stir with proficiency.

420
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,040
He's an adept tea-maker from Tea Lane.

421
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,520
Ms. Zhao's stirring

422
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,160
is similar to
an instrument-playing technique.

423
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,920
It… It's…

424
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,480
Yes.

425
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,680
Although Ms. Zhao rarely plays
to the audience,

426
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,360
but she has spent over a decade

427
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,560
on practicing zither.

428
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,360
Gentlemen, please listen.

429
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,560
A Parting Tune
with A Thrice Repeated Refrain?

430
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,240
Ms. Zhao plays a piece of music

431
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,080
using the bowl.

432
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,040
It's…

433
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,600
My tea is done.

434
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,530
I'm not sure. Let me see.

435
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,720
Who is the winner?

436
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,480
The color, the water trace, the taste.

437
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,120
So it's a contest of not only the taste

438
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,800
but also the color and the foam.

439
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,880
It means the tea with a nicer color

440
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,800
and a better foam wins.

441
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,920
The winner's tea should be whiter

442
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,160
and the foam should last longer.

443
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,160
Pretty much, yes.

444
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,520
The tea color

445
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,280
looks good.

446
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,680
Good tea, indeed.

447
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,520
Yes.

448
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,560
Both pure white.

449
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,280
Both bowls of tea are top quality.

450
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,960
A draw

451
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,040
for the tea-color round.

452
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,080
Bravo.

453
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,840
Next,

454
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,520
the foam.

455
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,960
Oh, no.

456
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,840
Ms. Zhao's foam starts to dissipate.

457
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,220
(Tea)

458
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,180
(Tea)

459
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,880
Ms. Zhao,

460
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,800
I'm afraid

461
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,600
you lost the water-trace round.

462
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,840
- Bravo. Bravo.
- Bravo.

463
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,720
Bravo.

464
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,520
Gentlemen,

465
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,360
please look closely.

466
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,320
It's…

467
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,120
Look.

468
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,840
It's Tea Art, the drawing of tea.

469
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:46,620
Amazing.

470
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,520
Tea Art.

471
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,200
Haven't seen this for ages.

472
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,880
Where did you learn it, Ms. Zhao?

473
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,120
Guys,

474
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,800
who's the winner

475
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,520
for the water-trace round?

476
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,720
Ms. Zhao, of course.

477
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,960
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

478
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,840
Bravo.

479
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,800
Nice.

480
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,960
Just excellent.

481
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,400
Excellent. Amazing.

482
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,160
The last round is the taste.

483
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,080
We may win.

484
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,560
Beiyuan Tea

485
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,400
has a mellow taste.

486
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,800
It is the king's tea.

487
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,280
A treasure, indeed.

488
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,710
- Bravo.
- Bravo. Bravo.

489
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,440
What about Half-hidden's tea?

490
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,670
Please try our tea.

491
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,000
It's the first time I try Jing Shan tea.

492
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,840
I don't feel the wonder of it.

493
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,160
It has no bitterness

494
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,160
but the taste of freshness.

495
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,520
As if I were now at home

496
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,920
watching the chrysanthemum.

497
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,560
It feels like the cool autumn.

498
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,840
The same for me.

499
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,560
From the first sip,

500
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,120
before the fragrance and taste kick in,

501
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,960
it's the feeling of ethereality.

502
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,280
Like I transcended.

503
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,880
Yes, yes. That's right.

504
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,120
Exactly. Exactly.

505
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,440
People's spiritual heights are leveled.

506
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,880
So is tea.

507
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,920
You don't need the best water and leaf

508
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,400
to make the best tea.

509
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,000
The best match

510
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,720
brings the tea to higher levels.

511
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,080
Enough of the intangible stuff.

512
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,840
Tea is all about the taste.

513
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,680
Yes.

514
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,800
Who wins this round?

515
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:18,920
Great.

516
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,560
Thank you, sir.

517
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,280
Great. We win.

518
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,720
Perfect.

519
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,480
Yes.

520
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,240
- We win!
- We win! We win!

521
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,080
Sorry, guys.

522
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,560
After deliberation,

523
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,080
I decide

524
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,680
that although your tea is good, Mr. Hu,

525
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,240
I can get it anywhere

526
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,640
outside Tea Lane

527
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,080
if I want.

528
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,680
I'll just invite a tea expert

529
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,040
to my house.

530
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,280
However,

531
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,760
Ms. Zhao's tea is unique.

532
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,240
Only she can make it.

533
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,400
So, gentlemen,

534
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,480
I'm on Half-hidden's side.

535
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,760
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

536
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,360
We win.

537
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,760
Good work.

538
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,720
Gentlemen,

539
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,800
in terms of tea ceremony,

540
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,000
one can play to their strengths

541
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,560
as long as the rule allows it.

542
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,000
Yes,

543
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,320
I was degraded to a music performer
due to my father's sin.

544
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,040
But my name has been removed.

545
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,080
I'd like to apply my dance skills
learned in childhood

546
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,040
to tea-making.

547
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,480
People say,

548
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,840
tea and personality are correlated.

549
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,160
If the tea is emotionally invested,

550
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,040
it will be appreciated.

551
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,640
If so,

552
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,080
it doesn't matter whether the leaf
is from the imperial tea garden

553
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,400
or the mountain in Qiantang, does it?

554
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,120
Well said. Well said.

555
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,160
Good point.

556
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,280
Ms. Zhao, you have enlightened me.

557
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,120
You're more skilled than me.

558
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,240
I admit defeat.

559
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:59,400
You're welcome to visit us
in Tea Lane, Ms. Zhao.

560
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,240
Let's go.

561
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:09,800
Come on.

562
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,320
Congratulations.

563
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,120
- Half-hidden is better.
- Congrats.

564
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,720
Yes.

565
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,240
Thank you for your support.

566
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,880
Please have some fresh air
at the backyard.

567
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,240
We have prepared free baked breads

568
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,080
and chrysanthemum drinks

569
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,600
for you.

570
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,520
Good. Excellent.

571
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,560
Let's go. Let's go.

572
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,160
Please, please.

573
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,840
Wonderful.

574
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,280
You go to school.

575
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,320
Go. Quickly.

576
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,480
Outstanding.

577
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,160
Come on. Come on.

578
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,680
Please.

579
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,600
Sirs.

580
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,040
Interesting.

581
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,600
We enjoyed a good match,
and we'll have free food.

582
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,080
Did you see the final moment?

583
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,120
I couldn't see clearly,

584
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,040
but that one drop of water…

585
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,280
What's…

586
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,360
Thanks.

587
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:08,880
Get up.

588
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,480
Get up.

589
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,760
I'm really sorry.

590
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,440
- I'll clean you up.
- Sorry.

591
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,200
No, no, no.

592
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,480
I'll do it myself. No bother.

593
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,880
Thank you

594
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,280
for your supportive comments earlier.

595
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,320
You're welcome.

596
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,520
Thank you, too.

597
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,080
No problem. No problem.

598
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,280
Do come here more often.

599
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,080
How come you look kind of familiar?

600
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,240
You look familiar, as well.

601
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,560
Du,

602
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,680
you know…

603
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,640
Look,

604
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,840
this is an actual white-faced scholar.

605
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,480
Yes.

606
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,200
You don't hit on a girl
in the cliché way

607
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,280
of acting clumsy.

608
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,440
It's but a misunderstanding.

609
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,120
No clumsiness at all.

610
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,920
Yuan Tuntian,

611
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,320
I'm fine with you mocking me,

612
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,280
why do you have to
make fun of this scholar?

613
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,760
You won't get cakes anymore.

614
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,040
No. Please.

615
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,200
All right. All right.

616
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,080
You silly short-sighted man.

617
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,600
Without your eyeglasses,

618
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,320
you're virtually blind.

619
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,720
Put them on.

620
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,720
Unbelievable.

621
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,120
What a kind and lovely lady.
