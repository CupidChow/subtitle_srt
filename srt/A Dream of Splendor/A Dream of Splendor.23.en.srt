17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,760
The doorman of the Prime Minister is
equal to an official of the Third Rank.

18
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,680
Servants are difficult to deal with.

19
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,080
Though the dignitaries
are polite to us usually,

20
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,360
after all,

21
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,640
we are of pariah status.

22
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,680
We should remember our status.

23
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,000
We should remember our status.

24
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,400
Deputy Commissioner Gu?

25
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,560
You can't hold it already?

26
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,480
Then how can you perform
in front of the guests?

27
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,520
If you can't bear it,

28
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,160
fight back with your pipa

29
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,920
as if you held a sword.

30
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,360
Deputy Commissioner Gu.

31
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,120
That's how you keep them waiting?

32
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,960
Look at the sweat on their foreheads.

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,240
I was thoughtless.

34
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,600
Go.

35
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,160
Get the ladies to groom themselves.

36
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,560
Aye.

37
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,920
Go get whipped ten times.

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,440
Aye.

39
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,360
There you are at last.

40
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,840
- Master has been waiting for you.
- This way, please.

41

(Do Not Slacken or Panic)

42
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,200
Young Master, don't be angry.

43
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,360
What is he doing here?

44
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,480
Didn't he say that he hated this family?

45
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,440
I didn't sleep a wink for two nights.

46
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,080
Father only scolded me.

47
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,200
But to him, Father...

48
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,880
Do hold your temper.

49
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,200
You have to return to the banquet.

50
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,680
What if others see you're angry?

51
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,920
Stop thinking about it.

52
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,520
Master's birthday banquet matters more.

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,960
Anyway, his family name is Gu,

54
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,160
instead of Xiao, right?

55
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,080
His Majesty praised Ms. Zhang
for her beautiful voice.

56
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,560
Would you all like to enjoy it?

57
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,120
- Good idea.
- Sure.

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,880

So, please do not disturb me.

83
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,720
Minister Ke, what do you think
of this song?

84
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,080
The singing was just so-so.

85
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,240
However,

86
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,440
this girl played pipa beautifully.

87
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,000
Minister Ke is famous
for his calligraphy.

88
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,040
He used to be a master of music, too.

89
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,840
It's really rare

90
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,880
that he compliments someone.

91
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,960
Thank you for your compliment,
Minister Ke.

92
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,760
In this case,

93
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,000
Ms. Song, please play another tune.

94
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,560
Yes, Minister Duke Xiao.

95
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,720
It's boring to enjoy the pipa alone.

96
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,160
There should be more fun.

97
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,400
Deputy Commissioner Gu,

98
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,320
I heard you're a sword master.

99
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,160
Why not swing a sword with Ms. Song

100
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,280
just like what Ms. Gongsun
and Lei Haiqing did

101
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,840
in the previous dynasty
to celebrate my father's birthday?

102
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,640
It will be

103
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,360
a much told tale.

104
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,160
This isn't appropriate.

105
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,080
As the saying goes,

106
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,320
rules are rules.

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,520
Deputy Commissioner Gu used to be
a Second-Rank Presented Scholar.

108
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,040
His Majesty promoted him personally.

109
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,280
If he dances with performers like us,

110
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,680
he'll be humiliated.

111
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,480
Besides,

112
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,160
Ms. Gongsun and Lei Haiqing

113
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,080
only performed together
for their emperor.

114
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,720
Even if Minister Duke Xiao is
a high-ranking official,

115
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,280
Young Master Xiao,
you still need to watch your tongue.

116
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,910
Ridiculous!

117
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,480
Scholars value their self-esteem most.

118
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,680
You proposed something improper first.

119
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,640
I just told the truth.

120
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Why am I ridiculous?

121
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,480
You...

122
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,880
Thank you, Ms. Song.

123
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,280
I'm indeed not good at dancing.

124
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,440
But I can do

125
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,800
a little bit of swordsmanship.

126
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,680
Is there any carp available?

127
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,760
Yes, yes.

128
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,560
The first emperor of our dynasty

129
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,080
bestowed Raw Perch Slices
on Prime Minister Zhao Pu.

130
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,200
I'd like

131
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,880
to make this dish
for Minister Duke Xiao's birthday.

132
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,000
Good!

133
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,980

(Diligence and Peace)

135
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,640
Orange is cut for raw fish slices.

136
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,080
The dish smells great.

137
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Perfect fish...

138
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Perfect fish and swordsmanship.

139
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,840
Inspector Gao was right.

140
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,840
Ms. Song,

141
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm still waiting for your second tune.

142
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,200
Thank you for your appreciation.

143
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,880
The tune is called Liangzhou.

144
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,800
If you can't bear it,

145
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,280
fight back with your pipa

146
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,480
as if you held a sword.

147
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,440
Ms. Song, you look weak,

148
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,840
but you played pipa so vigorously.

149
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,360
With such wonderful skills,

150
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,600
you can be as famous as Lei Haiqing,
the greatest musician of the Tang Dynasty.

151
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,360
Is this pipa made of
thunder-struck wood?

152
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,000
Exactly.

153
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,640
Its name is Moon.

154
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,080
Awesome.

155
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,120
Get me the writing brush.

156
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,800
Ms. Song,

157
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,000
I'd like to write something
as a thank-you gift.

158
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,800
Thank you, Minister Ke.

159
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,840
Minister Ke

160
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,040
hasn't written anything
for others for decades.

161
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,400
Ms. Song, about what you said just now,

162
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,680
I couldn't agree more.

163
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,400
Scholars value

164
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,160

their self-esteem most!

165
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:19,240
Ms. Song, you have
the same self-esteem, too.

166
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,160
I've been the Grand Secretary
for more than ten years.

167
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,960
Tomorrow, I'm leaving
the Eastern Capital for another job.

168
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,520
I have to entrust you

169
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,200
with the heavy responsibility
of governing the state.

170
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,520
I hope you'll always have self-esteem!

171
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,040
Do not flatter anyone.

172
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,760
Do not crawl to anyone.

173
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,560
Do not be conceited.

174
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,160
Do not stick to extravagance.

175
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,160
You mustn't be wasteful or sycophantic.

176
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,240
You must be upright and frank!

177
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,680
Minister Ke made a great point.

178
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,480
Everybody, take up your cup with me

179
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,120
and let's make a toast

180
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,360
to see Minister Ke off.

181
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,160
To Minister Ke!

182
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,520
To Minister Ke.

183
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,080
Minister Ke, please stay.

184
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,560
Minister Ke.

185
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,000
Minister Ke.

186
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,080
You're old, after all.

187
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,160
Don't catch a cold.

188
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,120
Or His Majesty and us
will have to worry about you.

189
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,520
Don't worry.

190
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,920
I've never done anything I'm ashamed of.

191
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,720
I'm not scared of ghosts

192
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,040
or any diseases.

193
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,600
When His Majesty wakes up

194
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,960
and no longer trusts
treacherous officials,

195
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,960
he'll leave the evil empress
and appoints the Crown Prince.

196
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,480
Then I'll come back and work for him.

197
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,440
Well,

198
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,880
let's wait and see, then.

199
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
Just you wait!

200
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,040
Minister Duke Xiao, I've got
something else to attend to.

201
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,520
Sorry, but I have to leave.

202
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,200
Minister Duke Xiao,

203
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,840
at tomorrow's morning court,
you'll be the Grand Secretary.

204
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,600
I'd highly appreciate
your kind guidance.

205
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,680
You flatter me.

206
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,840
Sir,

207
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,160
after Minister Ke leaves,

208
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,040
you'll be the leader
of upright officials.

209
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,280
I really expect you

210
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,800
to ask me for less trouble.

211
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,720
I would appreciate it.

212
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,960
Anyway,

213
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,160
we're colleagues.

214
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,120
If I can't sleep very well,

215
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,520
you have to be sleepless, too.

216
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,200
What do you think?

217
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,240
I'll take my leave.

218
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,880
Duke An.

219
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,800
I should go.

220
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,120
See you.

221
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,760
Ms. Song is back.

222
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,560
Let's have a look.

223
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,200
Ms. Song.

224
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,800
Is this what Minister Ke wrote?

225
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,760
(Self-esteem by Ke Zheng)

226
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,600
Don't touch it.

227
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,520
Ms. Song,

228
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,440
you became famous overnight.

229
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,400
You flatter me. I'm not that good.

230
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,000
Don't be modest.

231
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,920
Minister Ke praised you
for your self-esteem.

232
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,280
Minister Ke?

233
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,960
There were many ministers there.

234
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,880
What makes Minister Ke different?

235
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,880
You don't know Minister Ke?

236
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,680
Ms. Song has just been here
from the Jiangnan Region

237
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,640
for a couple of months.

238
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,520
Sorry. I forgot that.

239
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,400
Ms. Song, you have no idea.

240
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,880
Minister Ke has been
the Prime Minister for 30 years.

241
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,160
He once supported His Majesty
to go out to battle in the North Desert.

242
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,480
He's the backbone of the whole court.

243
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,800
Even if he's old now

244
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,880
and has to work in another city,

245
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,520
he's still a powerful upright official

246
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,040
and the leader of scholars.

247
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,520
If Presented Scholars or Hanlin Scholars

248
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,840
get any attention from Minister Ke,

249
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,400
they'll be too happy to fall asleep.

250
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,320
Unexpectedly,

251
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,760
he wrote something on your pipa.

252
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,560
Just wait.

253
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,240
In the future, a lot of people

254
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,280
will beg to listen to your music.

255
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:15,960
That's right.

256
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,360
- According to the officials,
- Yeah.

257
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,120
it's easy to be praised by His Majesty,

258
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,080
but it's hard to be commented
by Minister Ke.

259
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,360
Yeah.

260
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,120
Awesome.

261
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,920
You're so great.

262
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,160
Ms. Song, you're awesome.

263
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,720
Let's go.

264
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,080
Continue.

265
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,120
Why did you stop?

266
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,280
Haohao,

267
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,600
thank you for cooperating with me.

268
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,160
Don't say that. We're friends.

269
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,840
I still expect to cooperate with you.

270
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,400
I'll go get changed, then.

271
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,120
These days,

272
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,040
the temperature has gone up so quickly.

273
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,080
It's the weather in the Central Plains.

274
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,480
No wonder the Black Plum Drink
sells well lately.

275
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,760
Pan'er,

276
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,320
should we buy some more ice?

277
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,600
I've ordered some.

278
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,560
It'll be delivered
the day after tomorrow.

279
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,720
We not only need ice in the tea,

280
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,440
but also huge ice cubes in the snugs.

281
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,400
Otherwise,

282
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,520
when customers and music players
crowd in one room,

283
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,920
how can they enjoy themselves?

284
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,960
I wonder how Yinzhang is doing

285
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,840
in Minister Duke Xiao's Mansion.

286
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,960
Don't worry about her.

287
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,920
Gu Qianfan promised

288
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,080
that he would protect her for you.

289
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,280
Besides, the Xiao's Mansion
isn't a hazardous place.

290
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,560
She won't be hurt.

291
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,960
Pan'er.

292
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,000
Pan'er.

293
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,120
Relax.

294
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,600
Chief asked me to send you a message.

295
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,840
You should go to the Xiao's Mansion

296
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,000
and get Yinzhang back immediately.

297
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,920
Otherwise, she may not
be able to come back.

298
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,280
What happened?

299
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,200
Great news.

300
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,240
Yinzhang played pipa very well

301
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,520
so that Minister Ke praised her

302
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,800
and even wrote something on her pipa.

303
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,920
Minister Ke wrote on her pipa?

304
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,640
Yeah.

305
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,120
Now the Xiao's Mansion is crowded

306
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,520
with people who want to see Yinzhang.

307
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,760
When the banquet is over,

308
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,440
it'll get worse.

309
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,360
Take care of the teahouse for me.

310
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,160
I'll go check on her.

311
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,760
Wait.

312
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,240
Iced Black Plum Drink. Take it.

313
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,880
I didn't mean to give this to you.

314
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,640
Sanniang made me.

315
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,920
Got it. Thanks.

316
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,720
Zhao Pan'er?

317
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,040
Stop the carriage.

318
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,160
Ms. Zhao.

319
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,640
Ms. Gao?

320
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,960
Is there anything wrong
with your carriage?

321
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,520
The axle is broken.

322
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,840
Where are you going?
Let me give you a ride.

323
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,800
All right.

324
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,560
Sorry to disturb you.

325
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,160
I was on my way to pick up Yinzhang,

326
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,760
but my carriage went broken.

327
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,160
Luckily, you passed by.

328
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,240
It's all right. It's the least I can do.

329
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,040
For what my wet nurse did...

330
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,080
I haven't apologized to you yet.

331
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,520
I'm sorry.

332
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,960
You don't need to apologize.

333
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,200
She did everything
without letting you know.

334
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,840
But she did it in my name.

335
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,840
I have to apologize to you.

336
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,520
If you hadn't visited me,

337
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,440
I would never know

338
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,040
that she had done so many bad things

339
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,320
without letting me know.

340
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,400
Not only her,

341
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,440
but Ouyang Xu.

342
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,880
(To Ms. Gao)

343
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,400
Look. It's the letter he wrote to me.

344
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,240
All honeyed words and solemn vows.

345
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
When he was in the Eastern Capital

346
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,040
for the Imperial Examination,

347
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,960
he wrote such letters to me, too.

348
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,200
My father is right.

349
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,880
In case you told on him,

350
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,120
he made a fool of himself

351
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,560
so that he was demoted to
a Taoist official in the Western Capital.

352
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,120
Now, he even wants to beguile me
into going to the Western Capital

353
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,320
and eloping with him

354
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,000
so that what is done cannot be undone.

355
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,880
Then my father has to accept him

356
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,960
and transfer him back
to the Eastern Capital.

357
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,080
You and I must have been blind.

358
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Why did we like such a malicious man?

359
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,200
Maybe he wasn't so malicious before.

360
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,480
He was just seduced
by the prosperous city.

361
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,640
I don't care.

362
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,160
I just know

363
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,760
whoever dares to deceive me

364
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,640
has to pay the price.

365
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,640
Go this way
and you'll reach the west gate.

366
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,240
It's less crowded along this way.

367
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,960
I told Pan'er to pick you up.

368
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,640
The carriage will be waiting there.

369
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,440
Deputy Commissioner Gu,
thank you for just now.

370
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,480
I should be thanking you
for helping me out.

371
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,080
But remember.

372
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,160
No matter who you try to defend,

373
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,440
don't say anything so offensive again.

374
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,000
All right. This is where I leave you.

375
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,120
I'll visit you in the teahouse
in a day or two.

376
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,080
Off you go.

377
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,520
Come, please.

378
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,840
Miss, are you lost?

379
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,040
Stay away!

380
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,720
Shall we walk you back home?

381
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,280
Stop!

382
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,080
Who?

383
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,720
Who are you?

384
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,440
Get lost!

385
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,120
Ms. Song, are you all right?

386
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,040
What are you doing here?

387
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,520
Informed by the Music Administrator,

388
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,800
I came to pick you up.

389
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,720
What?

390
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,160
Don't you thank me for helping you out?

391
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,640
Let's go.

392
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:07,800
Let go of me.

393
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,560
I'm going home.

394
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,880
Going home?

395
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,040
You're all alone.

396
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,280
Don't you fear you may
run into ruffians again?

397
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,560
My boat is nearby.

398
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,840
Let me protect you.

399
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Trust me.

400
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,360
Come on.

401
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,400
Let's go.

402
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,080
Deputy Commissioner Gu, this way.

403
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,320
When will the banquet be over?

404
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,600
In about one hour, I'm afraid.

405
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,400
Please tell Minister Duke Xiao

406
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,480
that I should go now.

407
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,680
Please stay.

408
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,560
Master specially said

409
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,760
that you sliced the fish

410
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,440
at the banquet

411
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,720
so that further embarrassment

412
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,240
had been avoided.

413
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,840
When the banquet is over,

414
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,000
he wants to drink with you.

415
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,600
I guess he'll be busy

416
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,880
instructing his own son.

417
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,120
I won't disturb them.

418
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,320
By the way, please tell him

419
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,920
that Ms. Song is

420
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,080
Zhao Pan'er's friend.

421
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,520
Entrusted by Pan'er,

422
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,680
I have to help her out.

423
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,920
He doesn't need

424
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,280
to investigate her secretly.

425
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,480
I'll take my leave.

426
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,560
Aye.

427
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,000
Haohao, you're back?

428
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,960
How was your performance?

429
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,600
You must have gained whole cheers.

430
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,600
Shut up.

431
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,560
Say "Hello, sir."

432
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,320
Say it.

433
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,440
I didn't ask you to peck me.

434
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,320
Say "Hello, sir."

435
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,560
Not "Ah." Say "Hello, sir."

436
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,520
"Hello, sir."

437
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,920
Stop. Ask it to stop!

438
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,840
Sounds terrible.

439
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,560
When were you back?

440
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,600
What?

441
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,600
Your performance bombed?

442
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,720
It didn't at all!

443
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,280
When did my performance bomb?

444
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,680
Then why are you
losing your temper on me?

445
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,600
Did anyone

446
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,440
bully you on your way back?

447
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,760
Tell me. I'll teach him a lesson.

448
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,320
Come on. You can't even
afford to offend him.

449
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,680
I can't?

450
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,160
Then I shall make a detour.

451
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,280
You know what?

452
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,000
Making a detour does some good.

453
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,840
Look. I made a detour here

454
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,760
and I bought you a grackle.

455
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,440
It cost 30 strings.

456
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,360
It chirps as beautifully as you sing.

457
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,360
Come on. Chirp.

458
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,480
Say "Hello, sir."

459
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,720
Say "Hello, sir."

460
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,440
Make it stop!

461
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,400
Are you out of your mind?

462
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,080
Why are you losing your temper on it?

463
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,000
It took me so much trouble

464
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,120
to get this bird to you!

465
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
It cost 30 strings!

466
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,040
Why are you yelling at me
for simply 30 strings?

467
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,640
It's not just about money!

468
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,360
But I asked for a pair of crickets!

469
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,800
Crickets, crickets!

470
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,480
They escaped!

471
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,800
Escaped? I think you were just tricked.

472
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,400
How can you call yourself a businessman?

473
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,360
I wasn't tricked!

474
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,880
What's wrong with you?

475
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,000
Your performance bombed,
but why are you snapping at me?

476
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,120
My performance didn't bomb!

477
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,360
Come on.

478
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,840
Just admit it.

479
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,120
Your performance didn't bomb?

480
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,600
Then you must have lost to someone else

481
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,240
even if you tried your best!

482
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,120
Did you lose to Song Yinzhang?

483
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,560
What? I hit the nail, right?

484
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,560
What did I tell you?

485
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,480
I asked you to stay away from
those three jinxes!

486
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,440
You just didn't listen.

487
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,160
You're so stupid.

488
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,040
When people adored you,

489
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,200
did you really think

490
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,400
you were a singing genius?

491
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,520
You practice singing every other day.

492
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
What about Song Yinzhang?

493
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,480
She's more talented,

494
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,640
more beautiful,

495
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,520
and even younger than you!

496
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,840
Say it again.

497
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,600
All right.

498
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,960
Speaking of talent, appearance, and age,

499
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,240
you're all inferior to Song Yinzhang!

500
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,000
You!

501
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,960
If I had expected this day,

502
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,000
I wouldn't have listened to
your sugared words

503
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,760
and got together with you.

504
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,920
Say it again, too!

505
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,520
All right.

506
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,200
I, Zhang Haohao,

507
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,800
regret getting together with you.

508
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,120
Did you get it?

509
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,400
Fine.

510
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,360
I got together with you

511
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,720
just because we liked each other.

512
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,960
Now that you're fed up,

513
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,400
I'll just leave!

514
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,360
(Farewell!)

515
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,800
I didn't allow you
to interrogate that criminal

516
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:46,080
not because I wanted the Imperial Guards
to take credit from you

517
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,440
but I wanted to protect you instead.

518
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,630
Thank you for defending me.

519
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:56,920
How about this?

520
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,440
I'll ask them to come again.

521
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,960
As for that criminal...
What will you do?

522
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,720
I get it.

523
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,240
I'll tell others

524
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,360
the criminal failed to bear the torture

525
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,760
and then committed suicide.

526
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,800
Good.

527
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,960
You're done with the Hat Demon case.

528
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,320
Let the Imperial Guards
take care of the rest.

529
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,560
Yes.

530
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,840
Ms. Song,

531
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,680
have some tea and cool down.

532
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,880
Actually,

533
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,040
I've always wanted
to tell you something.

534
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,800
I've never seen

535
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,520
such a delicate

536
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,440
and talented young lady like you.

537
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,320
You're a treasure.

538
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,680
You're not supposed
to fall into the mire.

539
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,200
Let me take care of you and protect you,

540
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,360
will you?

541
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,360
Though the dignitaries
are polite to us usually,

542
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,720
after all,

543
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,040
we are of pariah status.

544
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,040
We should remember our status.

545
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,280
With my connections
with the Music Administrator,

546
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,080
it's easy for me to help you

547
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,440
drop the performer status,

548
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,080
let alone offer you a chance
to perform for His Majesty.

549
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,480
What? You don't want it?

550
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,560
No.

551
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,880
My mind is just a mess.

552
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,560
Could you let me think it over?

553
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,960
May I reply in a couple of days?

554
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,320
Of course.

555
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,520
I've been waiting for such a long time.

556
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,640
I don't rush.

557
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,920
But I believe

558
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,480
you will say yes one day.

559
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,680
Why?

560
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,520
Because you're already famous
in the Eastern Capital.

561
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,400
You're the lady

562
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,480
Minister Ke praised.

563
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,680
How can you still play pipa

564
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,880
for those pedantic scholars

565
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,240
in the teahouse?

566
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,560
And I...

567
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,320
I will build a big house
for a treasure like you.

568
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,600
How is a lady from an official family

569
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,840
involved with music performers

570
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,440
in the Music Division?

571
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,760
Ms. Zhao is from a decent family.

572
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,560
She's running a teahouse

573
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,600
on Mahang Street.

574
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,840
What?

575
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,720
She's a businesswoman?

576
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,280
She saved my life.

577
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,200
In my heart,

578
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,560
there's no difference
between officials and civilians.

579
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,640
So, if you think my proposal to her

580
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,760
will disgrace you...

581
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,960
Stop, stop.

582
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,680
I was just trying
to be more considerate.

583
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,760
Don't always be sarcastic.

584
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,760
Qianfan,

585
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,960
do you remember your wish?

586
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,800
I wished to be a Fifth-Rank official

587
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,160
and get my mother mandated.

588
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,080
You told me personally

589
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,040
that you didn't like to do martial arts.

590
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,320
You wanted to be a civil official

591
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,440
and take a much-honored position

592
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,920
so that you could
collect works of the Gu Family.

593
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,280
That's my lifetime goal.

594
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,760
But if you marry Zhao Pan'er,

595
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,280
you can never be a civil official.

596
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,600
No laws prohibit officials

597
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,560
from marrying businesswomen.

598
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,880
But you used to be a military officer.

599
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,240
The Fifth Rank is high enough for you.

600
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,760
If your wife used to be a businesswoman,

601
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,960
those imperial censors
won't let you get away with it.

602
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,480
Qianfan,

603
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,680
think more carefully about it.

604
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,600
Chief.

605
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,920
Anything wrong?

606
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,440
Later, submit a report for me,

607
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,280
saying the criminal committed suicide

608
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,480
because he couldn't bear the torture.

609
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,840
And then?

610
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,200
Give his body to whoever comes for it.

611
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,560
OK.

612
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,040
The Hat Demon case is such a big case.

613
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,760
Imperial Guards work for His Majesty.

614
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,520
It's better to give them

615
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,840
such a difficult case.

616
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,400
I shouldn't have said that.

617
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,560
Not your problem.

618
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,800
I'm just wondering something.

619
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,280
What's wrong, Chief?

620
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,680
Even I didn't have time

621
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,120
to interrogate that criminal.

622
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,320
How did he figure out

623
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,720
that Duke An was behind

624
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,000
the Hat Demon case?

625
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,000
Who?

626
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,480
The man I just met.

627
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,560
Then he's very likely

628
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,480
to be the real evil-doer
of the Hat Demon case.

629
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,400
Master,

630
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,080
I'll go get some dry wood

631
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,240
and some food.

632
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,200
All right.

633
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,880
Why are you back so quickly?

634
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,840
Are you Ouyang Xu?

635
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,760
Who are you?

636
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,160
I came to get something from you.

637
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,920
What is it?

638
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,840
Don't you know what you have?

639
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,240
Trying to rob me?

640
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,600
Search!

641
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,260
(I won't fail your affection.)

642
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,700
(Miss Hui)

643
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,640
What are you looking for?

644
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:36,880
I got it.
