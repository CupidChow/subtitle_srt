=Episode 21=

17
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:51,780
(Be Discreet)

18
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,680
When we met last time,

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,120
the moon was as round as a mirror, too.

20
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,760
When we meet right here and now,

21
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,160
the moon is even brighter.

22
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,040
Here. Have more beef tendon
Ms. Zhang made.

23
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,750
I remember

24
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,560
this is what you loved most
when you were little.

25
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,800
Here. Taste some.

26
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,960
Come on.

27
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,120
How does it taste?

28
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,080
Great, huh?

29
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,080
If you like this dish,

30
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,320
come often.

31
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,400
I've brought back the chef

32
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,080
who used to work for us.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,400
Your favorite Fried Shrimps

34
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,200
and Ruyi Cakes...

35
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,320
He still remembers how to make them.

36
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,880
I was badly wounded
a couple of years ago.

37
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,440
On rainy days,

38
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,320
the wound burns.

39
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,040
The physician asked me
to eat less seafood.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,160
Let him cook some other dishes, then.

41
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,720
Such as Roast Pork Ribs,

42
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,200
or Roast Duck.

43
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,920
Don't bother, Minister Duke Xiao.

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,520
I don't know why you invited me today.

45
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,440
But I still want to congratulate you

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,800
on returning to the Eastern Capital,
being the Prime Minister again,

47
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,640
and regaining trust from His Majesty.

48
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,920
But such a high position or great wealth

49
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,160
has nothing to do with me,
a deputy commissioner

50
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,440
of the Capital Security Office.

51
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,640
How can you say so?

52
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,160
As the saying goes,
father and son cooperate perfectly.

53
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,560
I'm back in charge
of the Grand Secretariat.

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,040
I'll certainly arrange
a better career for you.

55
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
I will work hard

56
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,320
for my own career.

57
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,640
You have other sons.

58
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,760
They'll cooperate perfectly with you.

59
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,200
Are you still angry with Wei?

60
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,720
He is just too young and childish.

61
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,800
I've heavily punished him already.

62
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,000
You're his eldest brother.

63
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,760
Don't let him get to you.

64
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,040
On my certificate, Gu is my family name.

65
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,040
Your other sons share your family name.

66
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,040
Do you want me to deceive His Majesty?

67
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,880
Qianfan, here.

68
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,180
(Qiantang County)

69
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,320
(Don't just eat! Say something!)

70
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,800
Be patient.

71
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,640
After I finish eating,

72
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,400
(Gao Lu)
I'll tell you all about it.

73
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,980
(Gao Fu)

74
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
Don't worry.

75
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,400
I'm indeed Sun Sanniang's son.

76
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,240
What happened
between Pan'er and Ouyang Xu...

77
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,080
I know all about it.

78
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,560
Are you from the Gao Family?

79
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,560
How do you know that?

80
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,280
How do you know that?

81
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,360
My mother told me

82
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,640
that Ouyang Xu would marry a lady

83
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,160
of the Gao Family
in the Eastern Capital,

84
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,440
so he abandoned Pan'er.

85
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,600
You have the accent
of the Eastern Capital.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,400
And this character is on your robe.

87
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,560
(Gao)
I can certainly tell your identities.

88
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,520
Umm...

89
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,600
Was Ouyang Xu really
engaged to Ms. Zhao?

90
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,320
He was.

91
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,920
Why do many neighbors say

92
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,920
that Ouyang Xu only rented
Zhao Pan'er's house?

93
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,120
Are you lying to me?

94
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,360
I'm not lying.

95
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,880
It's because

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,880
Pan'er has been doing business.

97
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,480
Think about it.

98
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,400
If Ouyang Xu became an official

99
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,240
and others knew

100
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,920
that his wife was a businesswoman,

101
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,520
he would have a bad reputation, right?

102
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,240
So, they were in a secret relationship.

103
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,720
If Ouyang Xu really succeeded,

104
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,160
he would take Pan'er
to the Eastern Capital and marry her.

105
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,240
In this way, no one else would know

106
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,400
that Pan'er used to be a businesswoman.

107
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,640
Minister Duke Xiao,

108
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,840
I appreciate your care and kindness.

109
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,840
As for the rest of the stuff,
I don't want it.

110
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,480
A toast to you.

111
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,080
Wish you good luck,
longevity, and a smooth road to success.

112
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,120
What if it's a rough patch of road?

113
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,440
Have you thought about it?

114
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,640
I've got a lot of political opponents.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,360
Ke Zheng and Qi Mu hate me, too.

116
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,440
They all want to kill me.

117
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,920
And your useless younger brothers...

118
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,240
They're only powerless officials.

119
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,920
When I'm in a fatal disaster,

120
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,960
who

121
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,520
can help me?

122
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,920
But you're truly trusted
by His Majesty and Her Majesty.

123
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,080
His Majesty is seriously ill.

124
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,680
The Crown Prince
hasn't been appointed yet.

125
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,560
If Her Majesty doesn't
stay steady in power...

126
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,960
During a regime change,

127
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,240
Grand Secretaries
and Prime Ministers usually die.

128
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,280
Qianfan,

129
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,420
I need your help.

130
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,080
The Capital Security Office
has unexpected power.

131
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,160
Now that you don't want to help me,

132
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,720
why did you go to Suzhou
and ask me to save your life?

133
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,800
Who got Zheng Qingtian's vast wealth?

134
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,800
I got to survive.

135
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,800
You got a sudden windfall.

136
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
I don't owe you anything.

137
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,920
Very well.

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,720
Very well!

139
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,040
I brought you up.

140
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,600
But now you're calculating?

141
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,600
My mother brought me up, exactly.

142
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,920
Actually, I came today

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,400
because I had something to tell you.

144
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,440
I'm getting married soon.

145
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,560
I will

146
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
marry Zhao Pan'er

147
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,960
who came here with me
from Qiantang County.

148
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,880
Her?

149
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,280
Didn't you tell me

150
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,400
that you weren't
in a relationship with her?

151
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,240
You can't marry her.

152
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,440
She used to be
a singing performer, I remember.

153
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
She isn't good enough for me!

154
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,520
She is.

155
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,240
I'm the son of a treacherous official
and she used to be a singing performer.

156
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,480
A perfect couple.

157
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,280
Qianfan!

158
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,120
I haven't lost my mind.

159
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,640
I don't mean to annoy you
with my marriage, either.

160
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,680
Maybe in your heart,

161
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,120
she's only a humble businesswoman.

162
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,640
But in my heart,

163
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,280
she's a treasure like no other.

164
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,760
In the dark life I've been living
for a dozen years,

165
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,360
she's been the only hope

166
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
and light for me.

167
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,040
So, I beg you to let go of us.

168
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,720
Do not use your tricks of all kinds

169
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,920
to break us up.

170
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,640
Otherwise,

171
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,600
I swear to my mother in heaven

172
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,600
that I will make you regret it.

173
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,480
Fine.

174
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,320
Fine, fine.

175
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,600
Do anything you want.

176
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,520
You can do anything you want, all right?

177
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,660
(Be Discreet)

178
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,560
I will not help you.

179
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,360
I won't hurt you, either.

180
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,280
If upright officials want to kill you,

181
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,200
I won't let you die.

182
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
The Hat Demon case happened lately...

183
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,080
I'm afraid it's against you.

184
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,920
There's a rumor

185
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,320
that the state will be in chaos
and there will be a demon.

186
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,680
Right at this moment,

187
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,960
you're back as the Prime Minister.

188
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,160
People can't help suspecting you.

189
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,640
His Majesty always
believes in superstition.

190
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,360
So...

191
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,440
Are you caring about me?

192
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,600
I just want you

193
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,480
to give blessings to Zhao Pan'er and me.

194
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,000
I hope that one day

195
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,800
Pan'er and I can take our children

196
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,760
to visit his grandfather.

197
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,800
Farewell.

198
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,000
My 50th birthday banquet
will be held within a few days.

199
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,200
Could you come?

200
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,880
For a moment.

201
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,920
Just a moment.

202
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,340
(Be Discreet)

203
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,640
Shuniang,

204
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,880
we will have a grandson.

205
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,960
I hope this time

206
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,200
he'll be more like me.

207
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,520
More like me.

208
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,080
Wrong.

209
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,600
Wrong.

210
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920
Pure, Serene Music,
not Butterflies over Flowers.

211
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,880
You look so languid
in the early morning.

212
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,280
And you have dark circles.

213
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,440
What?

214
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,480
Did you miss your lover last night

215
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,320
so that you didn't sleep very well?

216
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,120
No.

217
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,320
I was practicing a new song last night

218
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,120
and I didn't sleep very well.

219
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,960
Liar.

220
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,640
You're a pipa master.

221
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,800
What kind of song

222
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,720
did you need to practice
the whole night?

223
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,800
Someone gave me an ancient score.

224
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,920
It's a birthday banquet, after all.

225
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,840
I want to practice it perfectly.

226
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,000
You make sense.

227
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,400
His Majesty and Her Majesty

228
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,040
asked to hold this birthday banquet

229
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,120
for Minister Duke Xiao
who just returned.

230
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,040
We're ordered to perform.

231
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,400
We have to do a good job.

232
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,000
By the way, who was so nice to you

233
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,440
(Pure, Serene Music)
that he gave you this score?

234
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
Shen Ruzhuo?

235
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,680
Don't be shy.

236
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
Shen Ruzhuo

237
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,880
visits the Music Division
every other day

238
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,320
and he loves to collect scores.

239
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,560
If it wasn't him,

240
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,080
who could it be?

241
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,640
It wasn't him.

242
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,640
Someone else gave me that.

243
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,160
Yinzhang,

244
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,240
let me remind you.

245
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,400
Men in the Eastern Capital

246
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,120
can be all complicated.

247
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,080
Don't fall in love with a man

248
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,280
just for his honeyed words

249
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,240
or small gifts.

250
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,800
Otherwise, you'll suffer.

251
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,440
He isn't that kind of man.

252
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,480
He...

253
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,200
Fine. Do as you wish.

254
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,400
Young girls like you

255
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,800
won't be amenable to good advice

256
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,160
until you're taken in.

257
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,040
Luckily, you have Pan'er around.

258
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,560
You won't lose a lot.

259
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,840
Let's continue.

260
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,090
♪Plum trees blossom before dawn♪

261
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:11,770
♪Fragrance wafts everywhere♪

262
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,220
♪Around railings♪

263
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,160
♪Flowers are red and white♪

264
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,080
Hello.

265
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,360
She's so timid.

266
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,360
Funny. So funny.

267
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,680
I freaked Song Yinzhang out.

268
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
I didn't know she could be so timid.

269
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,520
Did you see that?

270
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,600
By the way,

271
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,880
you didn't remind her
to guard against Shen Ruzhuo, did you?

272
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,600
I didn't. Satisfied?

273
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,360
That's more like it.

274
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,160
When you want to revenge on Zhao Pan'er,

275
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,760
why don't you just go to her?

276
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,000
Why must you make use of Song Yinzhang?

277
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,160
She's just a young girl.

278
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,040
As a newcomer,
she doesn't know anything.

279
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,840
I don't want her to be deceived.

280
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,800
What? Feeling sorry for her?

281
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,680
She respects me

282
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,600
and plays pipa for me attentively.

283
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,560
I should be nice to her.

284
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,600
When you were out there,

285
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,760
you heard it, right?

286
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,360
When she played pipa,

287
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,480
I sang beautifully, right?

288
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,760
Quite otherworldly.

289
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,240
Then tell me.

290
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,600
Which sounds better,

291
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,040
her music or my voice?

292
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,000
If you insist,

293
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,680
she plays pipa better.

294
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,240
After all, I listen to your songs
every day.

295
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,760
You nearly sing my ears off.

296
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,600
I think you should sing something else.

297
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,920
What do you think?

298
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,640
Bad idea.

299
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,920
What? Trying to explain?

300
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,720
Too late!

301
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,310
I hate this kind of life.

302
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,320
She even tried to kill me.

303
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,020
(Gao's Mansion)

304
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,440
(Gao's Mansion)
She wanted to see me?

305
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,400
The man coming with her seems classy.

306
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,040
He looks like an official.

307
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,860
(It's been months since we parted.
I miss the happy days we had.)

308
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,780
(We promised to grow old together.
I will not betray you, my girl.)

309
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,660
(After I succeed, I'll return to you.
By Ouyang Xu in the Eastern Capital)

310
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,400
Miss.

311
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,460
(To Pan'er)

312
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,240
Miss, what's wrong?

313
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,160
(It's his handwriting.)

314
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,180
(Hope you'll get more of this.
by Ouyang Xu)

315
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,080
Miss.

316
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,040
Take them to the backyard.

317
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,040
Aye.

318
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,840
Chuntao.

319
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
Don't let my father know it.

320
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,600
I won't.

321
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,060
(By Ouyang Xu in the Eastern Capital)

322
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,360
Liar.

323
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,160
Ouyang Xu isn't that kind of man.

324
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,080
So,

325
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,640
you didn't send the men

326
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
to Du Changfeng?

327
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,160
Who is Du Changfeng?

328
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,760
He's Ouyang Xu's friend,

329
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,960
a Presented Scholar of the same year.

330
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,320
Miss Gao,

331
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,400
what I just said

332
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,880
might be too cruel.

333
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,280
But it's completely true.

334
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,560
Your father must have investigated it.

335
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,360
Such evidence works better than my oath.

336
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,960
So, my father knew

337
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,160
what happened between you and Ouyang Xu

338
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,480
and that's why he forced me
to break off the engagement?

339
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,150
(Be Dedicated)

340
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,920
Exactly.

341
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,120
In this world, no one cares about you
but your parents.

342
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,840
They only love you and never hurt you.

343
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,080
But I don't believe this!

344
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,760
Why did he deceive me?

345
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
He's the Third Graduate.

346
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,720
He told me

347
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,880
that before he met me,

348
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,880
he hadn't loved any other woman.

349
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,200
He said that.

350
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,800
On high, we'd be two birds
flying wing to wing.

351
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,920
On earth, two trees with branches
twined from spring to spring.

352
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,400
The monarch could not save her
and hid his face in fear.

353
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,840
Turning his head, he saw her blood
mixed with his tear.

354
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,600
Even Emperor Xuanzong can't be trusted.
[*The author of the above poem]

355
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,520
Not to mention a mere scholar.

356
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,800
You should listen to your father.

357
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,560
Break off the engagement
with a man like him

358
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,600
will only do you good, instead of harm.

359
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
You're a good girl.

360
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,000
You deserve a better man.

361
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,240
Father.

362
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,360
It's all right.

363
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,360
You always have me.

364
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,760
Inspector Gao,

365
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,720
please don't blame us

366
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,080
for visiting your daughter
without permission.

367
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,600
Don't say that, Deputy Commissioner Gu.

368
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,280
I should say thank you to you.

369
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,920
When you get married,

370
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,640
I'll attend your wedding.

371
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,000
It'll be our honor.

372
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,600
We'll take our leave, then.

373
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,540
(Be Dedicated)

374
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,200
What a surprise!

375
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,520
According to Du Changfeng,

376
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,400
Gao Hui is a murderous woman.

377
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,880
But she turns out to be

378
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,520
such an ignorant young lady.

379
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,080
We can't judge someone by appearance.

380
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,320
You just met her twice.

381
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,960
How do you know

382
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,520
she isn't a merciless woman?

383
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,200
By intuition.

384
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,480
And I have you,

385
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,800
the clear-sighted Living Devil

386
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,360
who has solved countless cases.

387
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,160
If she were really a scheming lady,

388
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,760
you would have stopped me

389
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,720
from persuading her.

390
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,080
Are you being too clever

391
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,560
or are you just being too bold?

392
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,880
Whatever. I don't care.

393
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,360
You're clever enough.

394
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,480
When Gao Hu came in,

395
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,000
you hid behind me.

396
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,680
What an old man!

397
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,000
When he held her daughter in his arms,

398
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,720
he was staring at you.

399
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,200
Luckily, he promised

400
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,480
to attend our wedding.

401
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,120
Looks like he won't try to hurt you
for the moment.

402
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,480
I'll be relieved, then.

403
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,680
He did dirty things.

404
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,160
But he's indeed a good father.

405
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,520
What?

406
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,880
Nothing.

407
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:21,700
(Gao's Mansion)

408
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,040
When I have a day off,

409
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,320
I'll take you to the cemetery

410
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,560
and visit my mother.

411
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,620
(Gao's Mansion)

412
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:45,580
(Half-hidden)

413
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,720
Slow down.

414
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,000
No one will grab your food.

415
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,200
By the way, how is
the Hat Demon case going?

416
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,120
Nothing new.

417
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,640
But don't worry.

418
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,400
Chief Gu said

419
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,320
the Hat Demon was a human

420
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,400
and he wasn't a real demon at all.

421
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,480
I'm glad to hear that.

422
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,680
You...

423
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,400
How do you have the nerve
to come in front of me?

424
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,280
What are you talking about?

425
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,080
I don't understand.

426
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,360
You!

427
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,160
Why do you deny what happened that day?

428
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,640
Which day do you mean?

429
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,840
What happened that day?

430
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,760
Tell me about it.

431
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,040
Why are you holding the cover?

432
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,680
What are you doing?

433
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,200
Are you pretending I'm not here?

434
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,280
Come over.

435
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,680
Come!

436
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,320
I know you got an issue with him.

437
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,840
Pan'er told me about it.

438
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,880
Somehow or other,

439
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,760
you shouldn't have fought
in the teahouse.

440
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:55,840
If...

441
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,920
If you break anything,

442
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,680
who will pay for that?

443
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,120
Without Chen Lian,

444
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,000
we wouldn't have opened this teahouse.

445
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,240
He helped us and he's an official.

446
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,520
Show some respect to him, you know?

447
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,120
All right.

448
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,920
Get to your business.

449
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,440
What a girl!

450
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,840
Sanniang, you're the nicest to me.

451
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,000
If you really think so,

452
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,960
do me a favor.

453
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,800
Here. Take the pastries to the academy.

454
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,840
Who shall I give them to?

455
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,760
Du Changfeng.

456
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,000
Him?

457
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,560
So many pastries for him alone?

458
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,760
How much do you owe him?

459
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,860
Shh.

460
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,200
I'm giving him so many pastries

461
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,640
just because I don't want to owe him.

462
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,960
I ask you to deliver them

463
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,520
because I don't like to see him

464
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,680
behave hypocritically.

465
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,960
This is why I ask you for help.

466
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,080
All right, then.

467
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,480
I'll deliver them right away.

468
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,800
Don't take a bite.

469
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840
I'll give all the pastries to him.

470
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,200
Stop.

471
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,920
You just went out. Take a rest.

472
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,640
Leave this to me.

473
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,440
What? Are you angry?

474
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,200
Because I defended him instead of you?

475
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,480
You're one of us.

476
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,960
But he's a guest.

477
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,800
You're different.

478
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,800
When you waited up customers

479
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,000
and quarreled with them,

480
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,240
I always defended you.

481
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,880
Right?

482
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,200
Chen Lian...

483
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,360
He's a little bit naughty

484
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,520
and numb.

485
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,000
Sometimes, he talks harshly.

486
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,480
But he's a good man.

487
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,040
He's far better than my ex-husband.

488
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,160
Come on.

489
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,440
Take a seat and listen to me.

490
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,640
The house we're living in

491
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,320
was borrowed from him.

492
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,880
He also

493
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,960
arranged the new furniture and quits

494
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,560
in your room

495
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,960
without telling you.

496
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,640
He even did this

497
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
after you splashed the water
all over him.

498
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,640
Now that he helped you,

499
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,600
could you stop being mean to him

500
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,600
every time you see him?

501
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,480
What's more,

502
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,640
he's Gu Qianfan's subordinate.

503
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,880
If you always fight him,

504
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,920
how can Pan'er get along
with Gu Qianfan?

505
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:43,960
Right?

506
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,280
Fine.

507
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,400
Every time I see him,

508
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,680
I'll pretend I see a jinx.

509
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,920
I'll respect him and stay away.

510
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,920
All right?

511
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,120
Come on, girl.

512
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,680
Why are you so unworldly?

513
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,160
Sanniang, you're not unworldly.

514
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,200
But your son
still doesn't recognize you.

515
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,160
Sorry, Sanniang.

516
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,200
I shouldn't have said that.

517
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,200
I didn't mean that.

518
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,120
Never mind.

519
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,120
Who told you about my problem?

520
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,000
Yinzhang.

521
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,880
Fine.

522
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,760
Let me tell you something.

523
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,000
In the past,

524
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,640
I was unworldly, too.

525
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,440
I didn't get to know how to behave

526
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,880
until I suffered a lot
and got heartbroken.

527
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,360
Zhaodi,

528
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,440
you're capable and clever enough.

529
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,160
But you're quite young.

530
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,360
I don't want you
to make the same mistakes

531
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,000
as we made before.

532
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,360
Sometimes, when you bear something,

533
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,840
and treat people and things differently,

534
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,360
it'll be better for you
and everyone else.

535
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,200
Do you get it?

536
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
Thank you, Sanniang.

537
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,440
No one has taught me this before.

538
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,000
Don't bother to pay me today.

539
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,240
Take it as my gratitude

540
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,360
for your instruction.

541
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,080
I'll get back to business.

542
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,160
A thank-you gift?

543
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,520
From Sun Sanniang?

544
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,360
Will I suffer from diarrhea
after eating them?

545
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,800
How ungrateful you are!

546
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,640
Believe it or not, I'll punish you.

547
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,280
An official like you wants to punish me?

548
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,200
I'm a Presented Scholar of this year.

549
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,560
Since when can a military officer

550
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,880
punish a civil official?

551
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,520
Don't listen to him.

552
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,080
He isn't a civil official.

553
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,680
Yeah. Punish him if necessary.

554
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,520
Give them back to me!

555
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,240
Never mind.

556
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,280
Come on. What's wrong with them?

557
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,640
They always bully me

558
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,920
because I can't recognize them
with poor eyesight.

559
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,160
You can't let them do this.

560
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,040
You're their teacher, after all.

561
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,640
You have to restrain them.

562
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,200
Who can? You?

563
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,600
I can't, anyway.

564
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,080
Tell Sun Sanniang

565
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,640
that I've received her gift

566
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,800
and I'm grateful for that.

567
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,560
Now that the Gao Family

568
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,040
no longer asks them for trouble,

569
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,240
we should live our own lives

570
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,880
and stop embarrassing each other.

571
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,480
Thank you. Thank you.

572
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,840
I'm all right. I'm all right.

573
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,080
I have something to ask you.

574
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,480
Answer me honestly. Got it?

575
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,160
Yes. Yes.

576
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,760
Yinzhang,

577
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,000
do you think it's beautiful?

578
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,440
Yes.

579
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,400
But I have to go home.

580
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,720
Or Pan'er will find out.

581
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,080
They're only your good friends,

582
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,360
not your parents.

583
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,400
Why must you obey them?

584
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,720
I find this hairpin

585
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,080
too plain.

586
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,640
Come on.

587
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,160
Check other hairpins in there.

588
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,080
I have to go home.

589
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,640
Come in, please.

590
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,080
You threw a stone at my window.

591
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,400
I thought you had
something important to tell me.

592
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,200
But you only took me here.

593
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,360
Your hairpin is old-styled.

594
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,960
I just want to buy a new one for you.

595
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,760
When I finally have a day off,

596
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,360
I rushed to see you
early in the morning.

597
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,560
Because you work so hard
on pipa every day,

598
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,560
I took you here to have a look.

599
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,400
But look at you.

600
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,040
You remain poker-faced.

601
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,600
Forget it.

602
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,640
Don't say that.

603
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,880
I'm not going back home.

604
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,360
Are you sure?

605
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,960
That's more like it.

606
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,680
This one looks good.

607
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,360
Shopkeeper.

608
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,480
Sir.

609
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,240
Pack it up.

610
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,240
All right. Ten strings, please.

611
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,800
Sir,

612
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,600
it's way too expensive. I don't want it.

613
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,840
Yinzhang,

614
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,880
it's just a hairpin worth ten strings.

615
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,400
You're the lady I adore.

616
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,200
You even deserve hairpins

617
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,800
worth hundreds or thousands of strings.

618
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,320
Let's go to Caiming Restaurant
and try the new fish dish.

619
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,800
Recently,

620
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,560
the Hat Demon panics people.

621
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
If we don't go now,

622
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,280
it will be closed soon.

623
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,760
But...

624
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,840
Don't always think about playing pipa.

625
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,760
You're so skilled.

626
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,880
No matter what you play in the banquet,

627
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,280
you'll astound everyone.

628
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,720
I mustn't be perfunctory.

629
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,440
I cooperate with Zhang Haohao this time.

630
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,560
When we practiced last time,

631
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
she sang better than I played pipa.

632
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,000
I also want to perform
in front of His Majesty

633
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,560
just like she does.

634
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,400
Zhang Haohao is no match for you.

635
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,040
However skilled the performers are,

636
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,320
they just strive for a living.

637
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,640
She's together with Young Master Chi

638
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,240
who is merely a businessman.

639
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,600
But my family...

640
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,960
With my connections
with the Music Administrator,

641
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,800
it's easy for me to help you

642
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,200
drop the performer status,

643
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,000
let alone offer you a chance
to perform for His Majesty.

644
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,600
Let's go, then.

645
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,000
All right. Come with me.

646
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,480
Oh, they're really in a relationship.

647
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,120
When Sanniang told me about it,
I could hardly believe that.

648
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,160
When I was kidnapped by Yu Zhongquan,

649
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,840
I didn't know this Mr. Shen yet.

650
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,800
But for the sake of Yinzhang,

651
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,800
he still went to rescue me.

652
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,480
So, he's an upright gentleman.

653
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,400
I don't like to hear you
speak highly of another man.

654
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,320
You also think he's nice, don't you?

655
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,520
If he and Yinzhang can be a couple,

656
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,440
that'd be great.

657
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,440
Maybe

658
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,150
Song Yinzhang likes him

659
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,150
just because he saved you.

660
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,080
Don't talk nonsense.

661
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,710
You saved Yinzhang, too.

662
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,190
Why doesn't she like you?

663
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,920
By the way,

664
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,920
Yinzhang admires you a lot.

665
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,440
She keeps talking about you.

666
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,520
Since you gave her the score,

667
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,840
she has nearly consecrated you.

668
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,960
I don't deserve that kind of girl.

669
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,560
I prefer a grumpier lady.

670
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,000
Stop teasing me, or I won't talk to you.

671
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,920
Knowing we're going to see your mother,

672
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,400
Sanniang taught me to make
some pastries of Suzhou flavor.

673
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,200
Look. Pretty?

674
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,360
You're pretty.

675
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,720
I know that.

676
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,160
Mother, I've brought Pan'er to you.

677
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,260
(Tomb of Ms. Gu, the daughter
of Vice Director of the Ministry of Rites)

678
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,160
She's nice to me.

679
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,840
She's clever and capable.

680
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,320
Rest assured.

681
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,760
I won't be lonely anymore.

682
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,080
Don't worry, ma'am.

683
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,760
I'll take good care of Qianfan.

684
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,960
However hard life can be,

685
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,880
I will be perfectly happy.

686
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,840
As my wife,

687
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,320
you mustn't live a hard life.

688
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,480
I just want you to live a happy life.

689
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,400
A happy and carefree life.

690
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,120
Mother,

691
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,480
Pan'er and I

692
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,520
have suffered too much already.

693
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,320
In the future,

694
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,040
I don't expect wealth or glory.

695
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,360
All we want is to support each other

696
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,640
and live an interesting life together.

697
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,520
Be ambitious, will you?

698
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,560
When you're promoted to the Fifth Rank,

699
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,400
you can make your mother mandated.

700
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
It'll be the glory.

701
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,240
Fine, then.

702
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,840
I'll leave the job
of making a lot of money

703
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,080
to you, Ms. Zhao.

704
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,920
I've got some confusion.

705
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,960
Du Changfeng is at least
a Presented Scholar.

706
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,040
Why does he only teach in the academy?

707
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,760
Tell me about it.

708
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,480
What is the Official Selection?

709
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,360
Why can't a man be a real official

710
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,000
until he passes the Selection?

711
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,960
Well, it's a long story.

712
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,920
Sanniang, I'm a little bit thirsty.

713
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,640
May I have some tea?

714
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,400
Sure.

715
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:55,960
Wait.

716
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,760
Can it be poisonous?

717
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,040
Just rest assured.

718
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,360
Zhaodi has changed.

719
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,000
From this day on,

720
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,480
she will be friendly to you.

721
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,000
Right, Zhaodi?

722
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,280
Tell me. What is the Official Selection?

723
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,880
Well,

724
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,880
this is a very simple thing.

725
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,200
Being an official is

726
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,880
just like growing radishes.

727
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,000
A hole for a radish.

728
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,360
The official is a radish
and the position is the hole.

729
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,000
Without wars,

730
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,160
no military exploit can be made.

731
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,920
The Imperial Examination is held
every three years.

732
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,880
There aren't enough holes for radishes.

733
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,520
Radishes have to be grown in turn.

734
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,320
Good-looking radishes

735
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,360
have priority to pick holes first.

736
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,440
Such officials have positions.

737
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,960
But bad-looking radishes

738
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,080
have to wait aside.

739
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,840
When the Ministry of Personnel
selects radishes,

740
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,400
it's known as the Official Selection.

741
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,760
I get it.

742
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,920
Du Changfeng is a bad-looking radish.

743
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,760
Exactly. He's just a bad-looking radish.

744
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,800
Actually,

745
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,480
a Present Scholar

746
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,560
usually has a position
in his first year.

747
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,040
But Du Changfeng is

748
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,320
an Associate Graduate

749
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,920
who ranked last.

750
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,160
And when he presented himself
with His Majesty,

751
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,520
he disgraced himself.

752
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,680
So, he didn't get anything.

753
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,080
How did he disgrace himself?

754
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,240
Let me imitate him, Sanniang.

755
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,560
First, he squinted at His Majesty.

756
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,640
And suddenly...

757
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,280
He...

758
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,000
He indeed...

759
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,960
He indeed disgraced himself.

760
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,000
Anyway,

761
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,360
Du Changfeng made a fool of himself.

762
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,360
So, he didn't become an official.

763
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,800
Then, he had to return to the academy

764
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,200
and serve as a teacher.

765
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,760
Those boys who always bully him

766
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,720
are from official families

767
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,800
and they will not respect him at all.

768
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,240
With your explanation,

769
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,760
I think Du Changfeng

770
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,600
can be very poor and unlucky.

771
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,120
He's a Presented Scholar, after all.

772
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,560
But he's bullied by so many boys.

773
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,440
God is fair, you know?

774
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,840
Du Changfeng must have been born

775
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,880
with very poor eyesight,

776
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,120
because God knew
he would collude with Ouyang Xu.

777
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,400
He wasn't born with poor eyesight.

778
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,280
Those boys told me

779
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,800
that he used to have normal eyesight.

780
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
But it has grown worse and worse,

781
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,080
especially when it's dark.

782
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,200
When I delivered the pastries to him,

783
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,120
I saw him

784
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,760
bumping into a pillar.

785
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,480
When it's dark?

786
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,920
What's wrong, Sanniang?

787
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,400
Nothing.

788
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,080
Don't touch it. It's too hot.

789
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,800
You told me

790
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,400
you wanted sweetened bean cakes.

791
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,680
I made some for you.

792
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,880
They're already packed.

793
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,360
Take them back

794
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,760
and share them
with your mother and sister.

795
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,320
I will. Thank you, Sanniang.

796
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,520
Well, thank you.

797
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,280
You're an official while I'm a civilian.

798
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,960
You don't need to thank me.

799
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,400
Wait.

800
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,480
That day...

801
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,000
I...

802
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,960
I didn't mean to hurt you, anyway.

803
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,160
Now that you didn't mean that,

804
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,640
forget it.

805
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,120
Pretend it never happened.

806
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,080
All right. I'll forget it.

807
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,920
I won't bring it up ever again.

808
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,600
By the way, this is for you.

809
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,960
Sweetened bean cakes.

810
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,000
They taste the same as flaky muffins.

811
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,280
Take them all.

812
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,960
If you give all of them to me,

813
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,120
what will your mother or sister have?

814
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,680
I...

815
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,360
Sanniang made the cakes.

816
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,840
She'll certainly share some with me.

817
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,720
You're right.

818
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,360
Aren't you a waitress?

819
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,240
Why do you even wash clothes for them?

820
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,040
When I was a waitress,

821
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,320
I could only live in the kitchen.

822
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,240
Now I live in such a good room

823
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,440
and wear such beautiful clothes.

824
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,720
What's the problem
with washing their clothes?

825
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,360
You also bought flaky muffins
for Deputy Commissioner Gu, didn't you?

826
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,440
You're quite grateful.

827
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,560
Then that day,

828
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,000
why were you so rude
to your mother at the wharf?

829
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,840
Let me say it one more time.

830
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,440
All my family members died.

831
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,720
I'm all alone!

832
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,080
But...

833
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,600
I... I just...

834
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,120
If you dare to talk nonsense again,

835
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,600
believe it or not, I'll still beat you.

836
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,200
Believe it or not?

837
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,840
Don't. Don't.

838
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,720
I won't bring it up ever again.

839
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,440
I just won't.

840
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,600
I'll take my leave.

841
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,960
What a coward! How can he work
for the Capital Security Office?

842
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,960
I worshiped your mother.

843
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,160
When will you propose a marriage?

844
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,880
Sanniang and Yinzhang

845
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,800
want so much to be our go-between.

846
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,200
Three Letters and Six Etiquettes.
[*Wedding process in ancient times]

847
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,800
I must complete everything.

848
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,320
I took you to see my mother.

849
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,760
But I haven't visited your parents yet.

850
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,760
I remember you told me

851
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,240
that they were buried
in Qiantang County.

852
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,440
I should at least
hold a sacrifice ritual

853
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,120
on a good day.

854
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,760
Then before their tablets,

855
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,080
I can officially ask them
to marry you to me.

856
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,760
Speaking of the go-between,

857
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,200
I suddenly think of someone.

858
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,600
Among upright officials,

859
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,800
the Vice Censor-in-chief Qi Mu
can be the most famous.

860
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,440
A long time ago, he promised me

861
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,120
that he would be my go-between.

862
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,240
What?

863
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,320
I'm just too happy.

864
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,320
Pan'er,

865
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,040
you're very clever.

866
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,160
You must have figured it out.

867
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,360
I took you to see my mother,

868
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,560
but about my father...

869
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,800
I've never said even a single word.

870
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,520
There must be a reason for that.

871
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,400
But you've never asked me about it.

872
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,440
Actually,

873
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,480
I've got some secrets.

874
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,560
But they're so complicated

875
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,600
that I can't tell you all the stuff now.
