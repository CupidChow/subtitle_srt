=A Dream of Splendor=

16
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,700
=Episode 9=

17
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,920
Look at the heap of case files.

18
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,080
I suspect

19
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,080
that most Jiangnan officials

20
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,320
took Zheng Qingtian's bribery.

21
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,200
Well, apart from me,

22
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
and Minister Xiao.

23
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,400
The Capital Security Office
only makes investigations.

24
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,400
After checking all the case files
and oral confessions,

25
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,560
the case will be handed over
to local offices.

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,680
When these are all sorted out,

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,920
we'll be able to return
to the capital city soon.

28
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,720
Really?

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,080
I can finally see my mom

30
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,160
and my two sisters.

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,320
Oh, Commander,

32
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,840
I made a contribution, didn't I?

33
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,440
What position do you think
I will receive?

34
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,160
Second Lieutenant or Captain?

35
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,000
Should I order a fancy uniform?

36
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,920
I'm told that the dressmakers

37
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,960
in Suzhou are excellent.

38
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,320
Whether the cutting
or the embroidering, they…

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,880
I just want to look smart

40
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,480
in front of my mom
when I'm back in the capital city.

41
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,200
It's fine, though, if you disagree.

42
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,120
Have you figured out
how to use the carrier pigeon

43
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,200
given by the officer
of the security office in Suzhou?

44
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,800
Yes, I have.

45
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,880
Also, the compendium you mentioned.

46
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,400
It has been written
and delivered to the capital city.

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,600
Oh, right.

48
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,880
Any message from the Eastern Capital?

49
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,960
Nothing special.

50
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,240
All I know is, Commissioner Lei

51
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,720
praised you in a meeting.

52
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,440
It's Ms. Zhao who concerns you, right?

53
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
Sadly, the scouts

54
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,600
didn't give me anything about her.

55
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,600
I never asked about her.

56
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,280
Off you go.

57
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,160
How come
I can't hear anything from you?

58
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,600
You're the type of girl

59
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,440
who would turn the Eastern Capital
upside down.

60
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,680
I hope you're okay.

61
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
Darn it! Darn it!

62
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,760
Master One Less Than 13?

63
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,240
Less than what?

64
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,120
Tell me, less than what?

65
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,360
Less than nothing.

66
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,160
Yes, you're right.
I'm less than nothing.

67
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,360
I'm so rich.

68
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,040
You can have the golden toad.

69
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,120
Du Changfeng!

70
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,760
How dare he!

71
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,920
Can't believe I have to put up with him.

72
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,080
I…

73
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,920
I could walk sideways
in the Eastern Capital if I like.

74
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,480
Why can't I be an official?

75
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,000
Tell me why?

76
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,120
Sir, only this kind of animal

77
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,600
walks sideways.

78
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,080
Are you calling me a crab?

79
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,440
No, no, no.

80
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,680
You cannot be a crab.

81
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,920
Even if you were,

82
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,040
you'd be a king crab.

83
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,360
There are only two ways for one

84
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,440
to become an official.

85
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,000
Join the army, or study hard.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,520
You have to get up early
every day either way,

87
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,280
can you do that?

88
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,200
Get up early?

89
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,680
When you become an official,

90
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,000
you need to get up before 5 AM
for the morning assembly.

91
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,280
Sir, please don't.

92
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,640
That sounds difficult.

93
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,800
Yes.

94
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,640
Plus, you can't go to any brothels,

95
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,800
nor can you live
in such a nice mansion anymore.

96
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,360
And

97
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,120
m-most importantly,

98
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,400
you can't do… do that thing

99
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,880
with official performers like Haohao.

100
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,120
If you got caught,

101
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,840
your family property would
be confiscated, and you'd be banished.

102
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,800
I wouldn't have any fun, would I?

103
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,480
Oh, right. Speaking of Haohao,

104
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,840
where is she?

105
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,600
She's on duty today.

106
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,080
She's got work to do
at the Music Division.

107
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,720
It's the Eighth Prince's
birthday ceremony.

108
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,880
They are ordered to perform
at Yanan House.

109
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,880
All right, all right.

110
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,120
You take 50 men there.

111
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,360
When she's on stage,

112
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,760
you cheer for her,

113
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,520
and clap for her in the audience.

114
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,240
When she's finished,

115
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,160
you throw a basket of bills at her.

116
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,960
Sir, could you please send someone else?

117
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,400
I've got work to do.

118
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,280
Look, we're expecting several wagons
of new leather.

119
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,560
I need to receive the goods.

120
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,160
New leather?

121
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,880
He Si is in charge of leathers.

122
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,080
Where is He Si?

123
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,800
He…

124
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Where the heck is He Si?

125
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,400
He…

126
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,640
He what? Tell me.

127
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,320
Sir.

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,240
He Si is dead?

129
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,480
When did he die?

130
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,960
No, no.

131
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,840
Do you remember the woman

132
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,240
who once humiliated you?

133
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
He Si got bullied by her as well.

134
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,320
What?

135
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,440
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

136
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,040
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

137
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,680
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

138
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,480
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,200
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

140
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,320
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

141
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,800
Is this your so-called arrangement?

142
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,200
I didn't expect Zhao Pan'er

143
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,600
to gather that big group of people here.

144
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,280
They must have kicked away

145
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,960
the scoundrels I hired.

146
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,760
You...

147
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,800
If it continues,

148
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,480
the Gao family will know,

149
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,880
and we'll be over.

150
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,200
No.

151
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,920
You can't appear in public now.

152
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,800
Get out of my way.

153
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,160
Sorry for my incompetence.

154
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,200
Please punish me.

155
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,480
"Sorry for my incompetence."

156
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,400
This is all you can say?

157
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,360
So you think

158
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,520
by saying this,

159
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,800
you'll have my forgiveness?

160
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,960
Uncle De.

161
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,480
How many times…

162
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,080
How many times did you
act on your own initiative?

163
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,600
I told you to inform Pan'er in Qiantang

164
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,840
that our marriage would
be arranged by my uncles separately

165
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,360
after I got a place
in the Imperial Exam.

166
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,480
You had to show off
the betrothal with the Gao family,

167
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,120
so she's here
in the Eastern Capital for it.

168
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,960
Then I asked you to gift my teacher.

169
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,560
You took the liberty

170
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,880
to add The Night Revels,

171
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,080
so I couldn't say yes to Pan'er,

172
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,240
and was put in a dilemma.

173
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,360
And now, look.

174
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,240
You joined hands with scoundrels?

175
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,400
You…

176
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,320
You call yourself the loyal servant
of the Ouyang family?

177
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,880
You seem more like the master
of our family!

178
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,840
Sorry for my mistake.

179
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,960
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

180
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,120
Pay…

181
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,880
Sorry for my mistake...

182
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,720
Sir, listen.

183
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,150
They stopped.

184
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,550
They stopped.

185
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,360
What are you doing?

186
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,720
Can't you see? I'm a watchdog.

187
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,480
She asked you to be a watchdog,

188
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,520
and you just obeyed?

189
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,240
Or what?

190
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,200
Will you eat trash if it's her order?

191
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,840
Yes.

192
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,000
You did?

193
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,480
Not really.

194
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,800
Don't embarrass yourselves here.

195
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,440
Get lost.

196
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,040
I can't, or I won't have babies.

197
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,280
You have a wife now?

198
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,480
Not yet.

199
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,600
She hit my childbirth acupoint.

200
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,960
Is he mocking me?

201
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

202
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,840
You listened to too many
fictional stories, huh?

203
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,680
She's no martial artist.

204
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,840
She knows nothing about acupoints.

205
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,240
Anyway, look at you.

206
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,160
Who would be attracted to you?

207
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,240
Who would make a baby with you?

208
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,920
You never know.

209
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,000
Plus,

210
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,240
it's the Presented Scholar
living in there.

211
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,440
She's a girl who acts
against the Presented Scholar.

212
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,200
Imagine that.

213
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,640
And still,

214
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,280
you never won her in the ball games.

215
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,840
I dare you say that again.

216
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,080
You never won her in the ball games.

217
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,320
How dare you?

218
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,080
Take this!

219
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,560
You're talky, huh?

220
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,400
Make a baby?

221
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,680
Who will you make a baby with? Huh?

222
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,160
I don't even have a baby yet.

223
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,440
Sir, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

224
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,880
- I need to think about myself, don't I?
- Take this!

225
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,120
(Breeze Brings Integrity)

226
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,240
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

227
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,880
You deserve infertility.

228
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,640
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

229
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,680
Pay what you owe,

230
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,120
Heaven is watching!

231
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,120
Unbelievable!

232
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,800
I can't do anything
about Du Changfeng,

233
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,320
but I can sort that woman out.

234
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,560
Within an incense stick of time,

235
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,960
I need to know where she lives.

236
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,520
Go find it out.
Why are you standing still?

237
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,800
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

238
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,000
- We must put an end to the clamor.
- Pay what you owe,

239
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,640
Heaven is watching!

240
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,280
You make me do this.

241
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,760
Uncle De, I'll write a letter,

242
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,480
and you'll help me mail it.

243
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,240
They're blocking the main entrance.

244
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,680
You'll have to sneak out of the dog hole
at the back of the house.

245
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,960
No problem.

246
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,040
I promise I'll get the job done.

247
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,950
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

248
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,560
Zhao Pan'er!

249
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,760
Zhao Pan'er!

250
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,440
Shush.

251
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,080
Beat him.

252
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,840
Zhao Pan'er.

253
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,800
It sounds terrible, doesn't it?

254
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,440
The sun is bright, and the day is nice.

255
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,360
Any other music

256
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,120
is better than this depressing garbage.

257
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,680
Owner!

258
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,840
Who is the owner of this place?

259
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,400
Is there a girl named

260
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,000
Zhao Pan'er here?

261
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,080
Sorry, but I don't know.

262
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,520
Are you the owner?

263
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,360
Thanks.

264
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,400
Look at this Jiangnan beauty.

265
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,960
Be careful, Miss.

266
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,640
Watch your step, Miss.

267
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,560
I just saved you.

268
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,720
I don't think it's good

269
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
that you turn against me.

270
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,000
Thank you for helping me.

271
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,400
You're welcome, Miss.

272
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,080
Don't leave, beautiful.

273
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,920
I'm here

274
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,240
to see Zhao Pan'er.

275
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,560
She's my sister.

276
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,320
What do you see her for?

277
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,480
Your sister?

278
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,160
Well, your sister irritated me twice.

279
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,440
Why do you think I want to see her?

280
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,480
I have no idea,

281
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,720
but we just arrived
in the Eastern Capital.

282
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,800
So sorry for our lack of manner.

283
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,160
Maybe we offended you,

284
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,000
but please be lenient,

285
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,120
and forgive us.

286
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,720
Well, you're more polite than her.

287
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,400
No problem.

288
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,200
You know what?

289
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,480
No discord, no concord.

290
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,240
If you kindly

291
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
go somewhere quiet with me,

292
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,240
I can let it all slide.

293
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,560
Don't go.

294
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,800
I am a good man.

295
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,160
Get your hand off my pipa!

296
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,080
I didn't touch you.

297
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,360
Keep it down, will you?

298
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,960
So what if I touched it?

299
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,440
I'll even play it. Look.

300
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,040
So what?

301
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,520
I played it. What?

302
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,760
My tongue!

303
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,760
Sir. Sir.

304
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,960
Don't stand around me.

305
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,000
Go after her.

306
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,680
Go.

307
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,800
C-Catch that girl.

308
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,920
Sanniang, bad men are behind me.

309
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,560
Who are you?

310
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,320
Move. Move.

311
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,680
It's me.

312
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,360
She hit my tongue again!

313
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,680
She hit my tongue again!

314
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,760
She spilled hot water on my tongue!

315
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,720
What's happening?

316
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,040
Are you…

317
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,520
Zhao Pan'er, it's you again.

318
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,080
Yes, it's me again.

319
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,320
We'll settle the scores right here.

320
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,280
Fine.

321
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,360
Everybody is watching.

322
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,640
You can be our eyewitnesses.

323
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,960
We've only met three times.

324
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,240
The first time was a one-on-one game.

325
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,840
You bumped into me, and the ball landed.
You said it was my problem,

326
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,880
but I was better than you,

327
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,960
so you have held a grudge since.

328
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,360
The second time, your men were paid

329
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,560
to harass us on the street,

330
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,280
we kicked their butt

331
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,960
and made them work as watchdogs.

332
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,320
Now, the third time,
if I'm not mistaken,

333
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,920
you came here

334
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,480
to avenge your men,

335
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,280
but since you didn't find me,

336
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,360
you took it out on my sister.

337
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,760
Am I right?

338
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,480
Idiot.

339
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,080
My men?

340
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,120
Bah!

341
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,080
I'm Chi Pan, the Palace Guard,

342
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,640
and the chairman of over ten industries,

343
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,320
including silk, medicine,
leather, grain, river transportation,

344
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,040
and so on.

345
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
I command

346
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,040
at least two hundred men,

347
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,200
if I'm being conservative.

348
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,320
Many impostors

349
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,640
claim that they work for me.

350
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,040
I have no idea what you said.

351
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
I'll only get one thing settled.

352
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,560
Your sister injured my tongue,

353
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,080
she hit me,

354
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,360
and you spilled hot water on me.

355
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,760
There has to be a term of settlement.

356
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,640
You molested me.

357
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,960
You tried to take my pipa,
and that's why you got injured.

358
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,080
Nonsense.

359
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,920
I may have gently touched you

360
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,320
when you were about to fall,

361
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,480
other than that,
my hands were always off you.

362
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,640
I molested you?

363
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,960
You can ask anybody here.

364
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,560
Although

365
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,920
I'm a play-man...

366
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,000
Playboy, you mean?

367
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,200
That's the word I prefer.

368
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,160
I never had a girl by force.

369
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,600
I always treat

370
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,000
those birds like a gentleman.

371
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,040
That's true.

372
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,120
Mr. Chi wouldn't do that.

373
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,720
If money can solve the problem,

374
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,800
he'll never use violence.

375
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,600
I'm not a bird.

376
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,000
No one knows brothels better
than I do.

377
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,110
I know what you are

378
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,200
with only one glance.

379
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,000
A man who used the word wrong

380
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,590
is trying to win a debate here?

381
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,800
Enough of this nonsense.

382
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,280
It's a fact that you injured me.

383
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,830
You can't simply get away with it.

384
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,640
Here's the deal.

385
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,000
I don't want money.

386
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,110
What do you want?

387
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,040
Let's have a peace-making meal
at Changqing House,

388
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,120
and your sister will
play three pieces of music for me,

389
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,280
then you'll be pardoned.

390
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,840
Otherwise,

391
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,720
the three of you

392
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,360
will never live one day in peace
here in this city.

393
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,440
Try me.

394
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,520
Miss, just take the offer.

395
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,640
Because Mr. Chi is a man of his word.

396
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,720
Have you heard me?

397
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,920
A peace-making meal is easy.

398
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,480
But my sister playing music for you?

399
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,960
That's not so easy.

400
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,040
My sister is the No. 1 pipa player
in Jiangnan Region.

401
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,040
Those who wish to listen to her music

402
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,600
will have to pass three
cultural or martial tests.

403
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,560
So will you.

404
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,880
Keep bragging.

405
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,040
Look at her.

406
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,720
The No. 1 pipa player
in Jiangnan Region?

407
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,520
I won't buy it.

408
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,560
You guys

409
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,840
listened to Miss Song's music,
didn't you?

410
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,600
Yes, yes.

411
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,520
She deserves the title, doesn't she?

412
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,880
- Yes.
- Yes, yes.

413
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,160
Yes, my sister is a mere musician.

414
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,840
But starting from the last dynasty,

415
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,120
her family has been giving
performances to the royal family.

416
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,560
The pipa named Moon in her hand

417
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,960
is also bestowed
by the former emperor.

418
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,080
Not only is she an honorable guest
of Princess Qian,

419
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,560
but she has also been invited
to the capital by Prefect Xu.

420
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,240
Her excellence in pipa-playing

421
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,760
is not for the uncultured.

422
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,280
Listen, I'm cultured.

423
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,160
I don't buy your word.

424
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,000
And who knows

425
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
what tricky tests you have got for me.

426
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,360
Are you daunted?

427
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,320
Daunted?

428
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,000
Three tests, huh?

429
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,480
I can do ten tests!

430
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,240
But here are my stipulations.

431
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,040
No ball game.

432
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,440
No strength match.

433
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,040
No problem.

434
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,640
Let's make the palm-slapping pledge.

435
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,600
Three wins

436
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,920
or two out of three?

437
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,160
Two out of three, then you win.

438
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,800
All right. Let's go.

439
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,160
She broke my bone, I think.

440
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Tell me, what is the first test?

441
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,680
My sister will give the first question.

442
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,960
It's a couplet question.

443
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,880
You're to give the latter half
within an incense stick of time.

444
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,280
Please listen.

445
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,040
The first half is,
smoke locks the willows by the pond.

446
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,280
It's an impossible one.

447
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,480
The first half includes
the five elements.

448
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,800
Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.

449
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,680
You can give up
if it's too difficult for you.

450
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,960
How do you know
it's too difficult for me?

451
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,040
Let me think.

452
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,360
Listen up.

453
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,040
Rotten.

454
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,760
Peach.

455
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,680
Rolls into.

456
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,680
The wrong.

457
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,240
Pile.

458
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,680
Rotten peach rolls into the wrong pile.

459
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,560
It includes the five elements, too.

460
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,280
- Bravo.
- Nice one.

461
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,840
Impossible?

462
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,680
Do you think I spent the time
in the brothels for nothing?

463
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,520
I've heard couplets like this
too many times.

464
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,600
Bravo. Bravo.

465
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,880
I haven't finished.

466
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,000
Smoke locks the willows by the pond,

467
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,360
the sound of pipa
repels the evil spirits.

468
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,320
I play the pipa.

469
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,080
It won't stump me.

470
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,000
Rotten peach rolls into the wrong pile,

471
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,240
the size of your breasts
charms the good men.

472
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,640
I transport the grains.

473
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,280
The sound of pipa
repels the evil spirits.

474
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,800
Only care for the lush grass.

475
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,640
Rotten peach rolls into the wrong pile,

476
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,360
the size of your breasts
charms the good men.

477
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,520
Only…

478
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,160
Only…

479
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,040
Only…

480
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,760
Only fond of the spheric glass.

481
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,320
I've got it!

482
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,480
I actually made it!

483
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,320
Brilliant, sir.

484
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,120
Pan'er, what do we do now?

485
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,040
We underestimated him.

486
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,880
It's fine. I'll be up for Round Two.

487
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,920
I win the first round.

488
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,120
What's the second test?

489
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,320
It'll be a martial match.

490
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,720
Knife skills, to be exact.

491
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,240
Knife skills?

492
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,920
I have had twenty years
of knife training.

493
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,360
You really have the gut
for picking this.

494
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,360
Five fingers. Won't lose one.

495
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,000
Watch.

496
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,280
All five remain.

497
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,800
All five remain.

498
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,000
All five remain!

499
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,720
- I made it.
- Bravo.

500
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,760
Thank you.

501
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,040
Thank you.

502
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,480
You think you'll beat me?

503
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,480
Kitchen knife?

504
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
Is it not a knife?

505
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,120
It sure is.

506
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,600
Miss Sun,

507
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,280
show us your skills.

508
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,600
Follow me.

509
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,080
What is this?

510
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,880
Are you going to cook?

511
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,200
Who are you fooling with?

512
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,360
Amazing.

513
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,400
Wonderful.

514
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,330
It's a flower.

515
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,120
Guys, who won this round?

516
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,040
Sun Sanniang won.

517
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,960
One win for each.

518
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,360
We'll have the final winner
in Round Three.

519
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,040
Zhao Pan'er.

520
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,640
It's between you and me.

521
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,320
You should be up for Round Three.

522
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,400
In addition,

523
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,120
to be fair,

524
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,680
it should be me
who sets the third question.

525
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,080
Is this a joke?

526
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,240
How is that fair?

527
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,360
Challengers don't

528
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,040
get to set the question.

529
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,680
You said

530
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,640
it was one couplet, right?

531
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,680
She threw out three.

532
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,400
What about that?

533
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,560
- Yeah.
- Right.

534
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,320
What game do you wish to play?

535
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,480
Let's play a game that's both
cultural and martial.

536
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,720
Dice.

537
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,440
A dice game with Mr. Chi?

538
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,080
The winner is obvious.

539
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,200
Let me warn you.

540
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,640
Mr. Chi is an adept dicer.

541
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,840
What's the rule?

542
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,200
The good old "highest wins".

543
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,560
Who gets the highest number

544
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,600
is the winner.

545
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,000
OK.

546
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,360
But I'll raise the stakes.

547
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,600
If you win,

548
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,360
other than the peace-making meal
and the three pieces of pipa music,

549
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,720
we'll add ten extra strings of coins.

550
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,840
But if we win,

551
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,000
your men will continue to work for me.

552
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,800
Deal.

553
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,680
Who's first?

554
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,560
Here's another rule.

555
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,480
If we get the same number,
the first opener wins.

556
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,240
Fine.

557
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,040
Well, now that we're
on the same page.

558
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,880
One, two, three,

559
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,200
four, five, six.

560
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,360
Six sixes.

561
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,840
Six times six, 36.

562
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,840
Mr. Chi wins. Mr. Chi wins.

563
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,680
Mr. Chi wins.

564
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,240
He wins!

565
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,800
One, two, three,

566
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,720
four, five, six.

567
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,560
Seven…

568
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,080
And a one?

569
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,440
3-37?

570
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,720
Six sixes, and a one.

571
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,680
That's 37.

572
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,600
Mr. Chi loses.

573
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,960
Even the master dicers

574
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,120
can lose to Pan'er,

575
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,560
let alone an adept dicer.

576
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,160
Oops.

577
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,920
Let me see your ring.

578
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,800
A diamond ring?

579
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
I am a man of my word.

580
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,960
He Si and the others
are yours to command.

581
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,760
Thank you for letting us win.

582
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,280
I'm sure you're so big-hearted

583
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,280
that you won't mind such a loss.

584
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,680
How modest of you, Miss Zhao.

585
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,880
I acknowledge your talents.

586
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,400
I wish you do well
in the Eastern Capital!

587
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
It's the weather's fault.

588
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,040
If it wasn't so hot,

589
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,440
Mr. Chi wouldn't lose.

590
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,600
Mr. Chi lost?

591
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,000
He never loses.

592
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,360
He's capable of anything.

593
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,920
Now, now, Mr. Chi.

594
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,440
God of Earth,

595
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,320
this isn't fair.

596
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,600
The Eastern Capital is my turf.

597
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,440
Those three women embarrassed me here.

598
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,720
I'll be a laughingstock.

599
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,000
S-S-Stop fanning.

600
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,840
Pray with me.

601
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,400
Dear God of Earth,

602
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,000
please bless me,

603
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,400
and kick those three out
of the city as soon as possible.

604
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,720
Cheers.

605
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,120
It's the first time I ever try the booze
here in the Eastern Capital.

606
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,680
The drink in the central plains

607
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,280
is surely different
from the ones in Jiangnan Region.

608
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,560
It feels great

609
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,640
that we beat Mr. Chi.

610
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,080
Here.

611
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,640
We won Mr. Chi,

612
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,480
but we don't know

613
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,000
what Ouyang Xu is up to.

614
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,880
We'd better move in a house near his

615
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,720
to watch him closely.

616
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,440
It'll save us the effort.

617
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,440
It's been a tiring day for us.

618
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,720
Let's talk about the move tomorrow.

619
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,320
Nice booze.

620
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,120
It tastes good.

621
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,640
I'd like more.

622
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,600
Fill the cups.

623
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,840
Here.

624
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,560
(When you're in the Eastern Capital,)

625
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,160
(how do I find you?)

626
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,920
(Near the southern end
of the Zhou Bridge,)

627
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,200
(there's a smithy called the Wang's.)

628
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,720
(If you see a red flag
at the entrance,)

629
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,960
(go inside to find the owner)

630
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,320
(and ask to buy ten silver needles.)

631
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,480
(Then he'll take you to me.)

632
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,400
(If you see no red flag,)

633
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,240
(you won't need to pay back the money.)

634
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,760
It's pretty hard.

635
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,120
Pan'er,

636
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,400
go get some rest.
I bet you're exhausted.

637
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,600
Here.

638
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,400
In order for me to be removed
from the registered musicians,

639
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,670
Pan'er went to see Ouyang Xu?

640
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:23,920
I mean…

641
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,040
That's not okay.

642
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,150
She loves Ouyang Xu so much.

643
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,400
I'm sure she feels terrible right now.

644
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,480
You know what? I need to…

645
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,840
I need to talk to her.

646
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,480
No, no.

647
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,760
She needs some time alone.

648
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,710
Sit down.

649
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,710
Here, keep drinking.

650
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,800
Look what he's doing now,

651
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,190
they probably won't
get back together anymore.

652
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,520
Ouyang Xu treats Pan'er wrongly,

653
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,960
and paid scoundrels like He Si

654
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,000
to bully us.

655
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,280
I mean, he's a Presented Scholar.

656
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,560
I can't believe he's so nasty.

657
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,160
Yinzhang,

658
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,840
I'm telling you this

659
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,640
just so you know

660
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,840
that Ouyang Xu isn't the man
he used to be.

661
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,000
If he sends men to pester you

662
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,680
when you're on your own,

663
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,560
you must stay alert.

664
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,720
Get away from them.

665
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,200
Also,

666
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,760
I suggest you not
ask Pan'er too many questions.

667
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,960
If you have questions,

668
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,440
just come to me.

669
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,840
She seems

670
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,360
troubled and sad at the same time.

671
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,680
But it's about you,

672
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,160
so she has no choice.

673
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,560
Or else,

674
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,640
she wouldn't even

675
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,640
speak to Ouyang Xu anymore.

676
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,160
She's my sister.

677
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,600
If it wasn't about me,

678
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,920
she wouldn't see Ouyang Xu again.

679
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,960
Listen, it's not your fault.

680
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,840
Cheer up a little.

681
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,220
(Wang's Smithy)

682
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,460
(Wang's Smithy)

683
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,200
A blue flag.

684
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,240
He's still not back.

685
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,540
(Wang's Smithy)

686
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,400
(You're right.)

687
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,440
(It's tough to live
in the big city here.)

688
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,160
(It may look like I'm doing well,)

689
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,720
(but the fact is, I feel so insecure.)

690
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,520
(I'm only keeping up the appearances.)

691
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,280
(Gu Qianfan.)

692
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,600
(If only you were here.)

693
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,800
(Because you'd say something harsh)

694
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,320
(but helpful to me.)

695
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,900
(Zhao's Teahouse)

696
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,360
It was Ms. Zhao's business?

697
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,440
Good for her.

698
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,280
Now that you hate
the Capital Security Office,

699
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,000
you must know our jobs.

700
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,440
If you're honest,

701
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,920
I'll let you go for now.

702
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,600
But if you lie

703
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,680
or hide anything,

704
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,720
I assure you,

705
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,880
in less than three days,

706
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,360
everyone in Qiantang County
will be familiar

707
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,480
with whatever you have done.

708
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,480
By my calculation,

709
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,360
she's in the Eastern Capital now.

710
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,360
You think of her
every now and then, don't you?

711
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,360
I think she's already married
to the Presented Scholar by now.

712
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,960
Why would I think of her?

713
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,920
I'm aware

714
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,520
of why you would.

715
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,760
I'm afraid you aren't aware yourself.

716
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,680
Did you make any friends
in Qiantang Army

717
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,200
when you were
a military officer in Xiuzhou?

718
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,480
Yes.

719
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,040
Find two trustworthy men.

720
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,040
Watch this place and her old house.

721
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,080
And…

722
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,860
(Tea Available Closed)

723
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,080
Find out where
Sun Sanniang's ex-husband

724
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,680
and her son are.

725
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,480
Trust me.

726
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,560
I promise

727
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,800
I will get it done

728
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,600
despite all difficulties.

729
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,040
However, isn't it easier

730
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,440
that Minister Xiao's butler
gives the order?

731
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,800
I don't trust the Xiao family.

732
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,160
Note this,

733
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
Minister Xiao and I

734
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,080
will never be on the same side.

735
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,080
I asked for his help

736
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,240
because I had no other choice.

737
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,880
And that's so much for our relationship.

738
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,680
If you wish to connect
to the Xiao family

739
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,160
through me,

740
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,440
I suggest you forget about it.

741
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,720
Why?

742
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,120
You don't want me to leave?

743
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,920
How about this?

744
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,160
I'll recommend you to them.

745
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,320
No, no. Please.

746
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,160
I'm not going anywhere.

747
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,200
I'll serve you as ever.

748
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,800
I'm not a fool.

749
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,880
I'm sure you don't side

750
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,320
with him for a good reason.

751
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,560
And I heard about Minister Xiao's

752
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,840
bad reputation a long ago.

753
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,320
He makes up good news,
and tricks His Majesty into

754
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,400
spending money
on major construction projects.

755
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,360
Besides,

756
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,480
he fawns on the Empress,

757
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,880
and uses misinformation
to rule out those who oppose him.

758
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,760
He also joins hands
with the Empress's adherents

759
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,960
against Minister Ke.

760
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,160
Why would I follow
a treacherous man like him?

761
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,640
You think you're smart, don't you?

762
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,600
But

763
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,960
what's his relationship
with Commissioner Lei?

764
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,080
He conflicted with Commissioner Lei

765
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,760
for backing you up, right?

766
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,560
Commissioner Lei

767
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,920
grew up with His Majesty since little.

768
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,720
A treacherous minister
against a cunning eunuch?

769
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,440
Who would win?

770
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,120
Commander Gu.

771
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,920
I'm a bit thirsty.

772
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,200
I'll go get some water.

773
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,360
(Commander Gu,)

774
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,520
(I wish you were
in the Eastern Capital.)

775
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,880
(You can solve so many problems.)

776
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,400
(I'm sure you wouldn't)

777
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,720
(watch Pan'er being bullied.)

778
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,440
(Also, you're a major official.)

779
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,120
(Maybe a word of yours)

780
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,480
(can help remove my name
from the registered musicians.)

781
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,480
(If that can be done,)

782
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,040
(I'm willing to do anything you ask.)
