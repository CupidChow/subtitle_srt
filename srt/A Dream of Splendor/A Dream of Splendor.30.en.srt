17
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,320
The contract just fixed

18
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,320
the date you pay me,

19
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,840
not the date I refund your money.

20
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,120
If you don't agree,

21
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,120
sue me in the government.

22
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,040
Since Gu Qianfan dumped you,

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,440
why don't you

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,160
be my lover?

25
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,080
So what if the middleman is an official?

26
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,040
I tell you what,

27
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,400
women are chicken-hearted.

28
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,480
I nearly scared that Zhao girl

29
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,480
into tears.

30
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,000
She broke the deal.

31
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,320
So what if I don't give her money back?

32
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,480
Boss, boss. Ms. Zhao is here.

34
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,560
Ms. Zhao.

35
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,000
You're here with the money for me?

36
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,400
How come I don't see the carriers?

37
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,440
I'm expecting the 600 strings

38
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,440
so that I can congratulate you
on your new business.

39
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,640
You're right.

40
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,600
I am here with the money for you.

41
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,880
The pawn ticket
of Great Xiangguo Temple.

42
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,880
Do you want it?

43
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,160
Of course, I do.

44
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,440
You're really resourceful.

45
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,000
You managed to raise a fund so quickly.

46
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,160
It's fake?

47
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,160
What are you doing?

48
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,560
M-Ms. Zhao.

49
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,320
W-What's the meaning of this?

50
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,360
Keep quiet if you want him
to stay alive.

51
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,080
The deal is broken.

52
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,480
You either give the 300 strings
back to me

53
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,120
or we die together.

54
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,160
Wait, wait, wait.

55
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,680
Ms. Zhao, we can talk, right?

56
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,960
You think I won't take any measures
because I'm a woman?

57
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,680
The 600 strings of coins

58
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,880
are everything we three girls

59
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,120
have earned over the past decade.

60
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,160
If I lost everything,

61
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,560
why would I still be alive?

62
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,080
I'll count to ten.

63
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,320
One.

64
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,520
Two.

65
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,480
Ms. Zhao, let's talk, alright?

66
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,000
Three.

67
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,560
I will give you the money. I will.

68
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,760
Go get the money!

69
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,440
Ms. Zhao,

70
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,920
please have mercy.

71
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,240
Please have mercy.

72
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,520
He just gave you the money?

73
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,600
How did you get out
of Wangyue Restaurant in the end?

74
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,960
I made him swallow a pill
before I left.

75
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,280
I said it was a special-made poison.

76
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,760
If he behaves in the following month,

77
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,080
I'll give him the antidote.

78
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,280
You learned it from Gu…

79
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,600
You lied to him on purpose, didn't you?

80
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,520
A nice trick.

81
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,000
He deserves it.

82
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,440
Why didn't you take us with you?

83
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,560
What if it had gone south?

84
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,160
I made the trouble.

85
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,880
I should be responsible for it.

86
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,120
Though we've got the 300 strings back,

87
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,760
the deed of our teahouse
is still in the pawnshop.

88
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,120
I'm thinking about

89
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,240
selling all those jewelry and artworks,

90
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,480
and borrowing some money from Mr. Du

91
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,080
so that we can

92
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,240
have the deed redeemed.

93
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,520
Will Du Changfeng lend us money?

94
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,760
He offered it.

95
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,480
Sanniang, I think as long as
we still have the teahouse,

96
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,520
we can make a living from it.

97
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,840
But…

98
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,480
Are you willing to start over with me?

99
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,040
Sure.

100
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,240
The artworks aren't important,

101
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,520
but do you have the heart

102
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,040
to sell your red coral hairpin?

103
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,120
Now in my eyes,

104
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,960
it's just a piece of jewelry
that can turn into cash.

105
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,640
Pan'er.

106
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,440
I don't really feel like selling it.

107
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,640
It can at least

108
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,240
serve as a reminder for me

109
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,280
of how stupid I am

110
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,120
to believe another liar

111
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,520
after the first one.

112
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,400
Not only did I refuse
to listen to your suggestions,

113
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,240
but I also tried
to find excuses for him.

114
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,520
Zhaodi, you mustn't learn from me.

115
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,790
I ask you to be self-independent,

116
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,480
but at the end of the day,
I still put my trust in men.

117
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,600
I'll trust no one

118
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,520
except for you and Sanniang.

119
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't know all the other stuff.

120
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,080
All I know

121
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,520
is follow your lead.

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,720
Exactly.

123
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,120
If the teahouse fails,

124
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,720
we'll convert it into
a restaurant or an inn.

125
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,480
We can still sell food and wine.

126
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,840
With your way of doing business,

127
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,200
my cooking skill,

128
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,400
and Zhaodi's hard work,

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,960
we'll rise again.

130
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,360
Are you really going to sell it?

131
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,800
Isn't it the purpose of us going there?

132
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,320
But I think Pan'er will regret it.

133
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,040
Me too.

134
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,520
Sanniang,

135
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,960
will we actually make money

136
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,920
if we convert the teahouse into an inn?

137
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,160
I cannot be sure.

138
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,600
But that's the only way

139
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,680
I could think of to comfort Pan'er.

140
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,480
She's a proud girl.

141
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,760
It's the second time a man
jilted her without notice

142
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
before wedding.

143
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,880
If I were her, I'd kill myself
for the second time.

144
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,120
But she made others jump off a building.

145
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,840
She won't shed a single tear before us.

146
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,640
Her business

147
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,160
is the only thing that she values.

148
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,960
We need to support her,

149
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,800
or she'll lose all hope.

150
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,840
Yes.

151
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,000
After that,

152
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,680
she has remained the same as before,

153
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,120
but there's no light
in her eyes anymore.

154
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,600
Will we sell the hairpin or not?

155
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,800
It is a hairpin that I…

156
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,640
I suggest not.

157
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,400
It isn't worth much.

158
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,360
Since it bears the memory,

159
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,800
you'd better keep it for them.

160
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,400
I'll fill the gap.

161
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,520
You heard everything
that we talked about?

162
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,360
O-Only a small part.

163
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,920
I don't have good eyesight,

164
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,680
so my hearing

165
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,040
is slightly better than others.

166
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,120
I don't think

167
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,360
you showed up here
coincidentally, right?

168
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Actually, it is a coincidence.

169
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,160
I came here to sell stuff, too.

170
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,000
I didn't get it from someone else.

171
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,400
It's an heirloom.

172
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,720
It's useless for me,

173
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,480
so I figured that…

174
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,200
You wanted to sell it

175
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,320
so that we can have the money, right?

176
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,560
I…

177
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,520
Du Changfeng,

178
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,360
we don't want your sympathy.

179
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,840
No, it's not like that.

180
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,320
I'm the middleman,

181
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,160
and I didn't read the deed thoroughly.

182
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,000
It's all my fault.

183
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,560
I'll do anything to make it up to you.

184
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,360
This is nothing.

185
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,160
Just take it. Take it.

186
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,080
No, we won't.

187
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,640
Seriously, it's not valuable.

188
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,600
Just take it.

189
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,960
Pan'er wouldn't allow us to take it.

190
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,840
She won't know if you don't tell her.

191
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,680
It's not happening. I…

192
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,080
Just stop.

193
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,840
I'll sell the jewelry.

194
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,480
Have you been sleeping well?

195
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,080
Not really.

196
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,480
Me, either.

197
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,960
It's all my fault.

198
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,440
Did things go well

199
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
when Zhao Pan'er went to see Mr. Chi?

200
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,360
She went to see Mr. Chi?

201
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,760
She…

202
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,000
What did you see?

203
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,440
Sanniang is with Du Changfeng?

204
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,680
That's good, isn't it?

205
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,840
Du Changfeng, too, is an official.

206
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,440
You and your sisters

207
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,360
will all be the wives of officials.

208
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,520
But why is he holding the hairpin?

209
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,360
Did the purchase
of the restaurant go wrong?

210
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,640
Wait, I need to find out what happened.

211
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,480
Yinzhang.

212
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,280
Sit down and listen to me.

213
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,360
I know that you're worried about them.

214
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,360
My men will keep an eye out.

215
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,840
But we cannot be late

216
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,640
for the banquet in Lin's Mansion.

217
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,200
Mr. Lin is in charge
of public revenue and spending.

218
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,680
He's the Minister of Finance.

219
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,080
So you will

220
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,280
bring out your best before him.

221
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,480
If you win his compliments

222
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,800
like you did with Minister Ke,

223
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,960
I guarantee that your status
will be dropped in no time.

224
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,760
I'll give my best shot.

225
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,040
Don't be so serious.

226
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,280
Mr. Lin is a casual man.

227
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
You'll need to smile more

228
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,520
so that he'll be fond of you.

229
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,880
What's wrong?

230
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:04,920
Nothing.

231
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Ms. Song, be careful.

232
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,250
It looks better with a bit
of decoration, right?

233
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,040
You're here.

234
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,760
Mr. Shen.

235
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,400
Mr. Shen.

236
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,040
Hi. Hello.

237
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,640
- Mr. Shen.
- Mr. Shen.

238
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,280
Hi.

239
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,200
Ms. Song, please wait here.

240
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,920
I'll go greet Minister Lin.

241
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,680
I'll be right back.

242
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,760
Greetings, ladies.

243
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,760
Mr. Shen.

244
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,480
Hi. Hi.

245
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,200
Thank you. Thank you.

246
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,040
Please. Please.

247
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,360
A small gift for you. Please take it.

248
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,600
Ms. Song is here.

249
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,360
A minute, please, sir.
I'll go fetch her.

250
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,440
Yinzhang, what are you doing here?

251
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,080
Mr. Lin asks to see you. Come on.

252
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,320
Oh, when you're in the room,

253
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
show enough respect for him.

254
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,640
Address him as Minister Lin.

255
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,760
Say something that he wants to hear.

256
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,240
Let's go.

257
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,840
I don't know how.

258
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,040
I only played pipa
for the real Prime Minister,

259
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,960
let alone an unreal one.

260
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,750
Shush.

261
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,240
Watch your language.

262
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,520
Yinzhang, you know

263
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
that I wouldn't trade your dignity

264
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,640
for the world.

265
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,520
Just get it over with

266
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,800
for our future.

267
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
It's a one-off thing, okay?

268
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,760
Come on.

269
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,600
Thank you. Thank you.

270
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,400
Please. Please.

271
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,640
Sir, this is Ms. Song.

272
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,760
Hail, Minister Lin.

273
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,840
Arise, please.

274
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,240
Your name has been long heard.

275
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,600
And it's true

276
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,520
that you're gifted and pretty.

277
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,480
Thank you, Minister Lin.

278
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,640
I'm a common girl.

279
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,960
I can't compete
with all the other beauties here.

280
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,960
I just express my feelings

281
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,760
through my pipa.

282
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,520
This is the pipa on which Minister Ke

283
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,960
left an inscription?

284
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,600
Let me.

285
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,200
Yes.

286
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,960
Very fine calligraphy.

287
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,320
I wonder if I'll have the privilege

288
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,800
to listen to your music, Ms. Song?

289
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,040
It'll be my honor.

290
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,040
Please.

291
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,350
I'll play the Tweeting
of Spring Warbler.

292
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,480
Please enjoy.

293
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,680
The sound of Heaven.

294
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
Very enjoyable.

295
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,600
Your approval

296
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,160
shall bring Ms. Song's reputation

297
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,760
to the next level.

298
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,880
My pipa somehow has dirt on it.

299
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,280
Can I rinse it

300
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,600
with running water?

301
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,520
Please.

302
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,600
Minister Lin,

303
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,800
I personally prepared the flowers
for you.

304
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,760
Yinzhang,

305
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,520
your hands are clean, aren't they?

306
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yinzhang, don't be mad.

307
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,240
Here, wipe your hands.

308
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,160
Mr. Lin won't let the banquet begin
before we return to him.

309
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,320
You played so well.

310
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,880
You charmed him right off.

311
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,080
You think I played well?

312
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,680
Sure you did.

313
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,200
But I didn't play carefully.

314
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,800
I even made some mistakes.

315
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
Mr. Lin

316
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,720
is not a music lover

317
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,000
as you described.

318
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,480
He's a shallow…

319
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,100
Shush.

320
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,400
Let me go.

321
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,240
Yinzhang,

322
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,480
you shouldn't have spoken it out loud.

323
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,400
What if someone hears you?

324
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,520
Trouble will follow.

325
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,920
You think I'm willing to please them?

326
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,000
I do this

327
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,280
so that you can be free sooner.

328
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,040
Yinzhang, as long as we can

329
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,400
be legally married,

330
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,640
it doesn't matter

331
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,160
if we are to swallow our pride, does it?

332
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,520
Let's say it's not about you,

333
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,880
please think about me

334
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,560
and all that I have done.

335
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,120
Please, let's

336
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,600
set our ego aside for now.

337
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,320
It's not about my ego.

338
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,920
I need to change my clothes

339
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,080
for the banquet, don't I?

340
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,600
Your clothes.

341
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,840
I asked Lian to put them in the room.

342
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,760
Don't do this.

343
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,240
Go.

344
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,800
Haohao.

345
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,680
You came too, Yinzhang.

346
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,640
It's been a long time.

347
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,040
A long time, indeed.

348
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,680
Haohao,

349
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,440
I haven't seen you
at the Music Division often.

350
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,840
I have no time.

351
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,200
Also, everybody in the Eastern Capital
knows about you,

352
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,200
will you play with me again?

353
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,840
Sure I will.

354
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,160
We won't stop studying and practicing

355
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,480
just because His Majesty and the Prime Minister
gave me some compliments.

356
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,840
You do have a passion for music.

357
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,480
But sadly,

358
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,040
I won't have time for you anymore.

359
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,680
A bachelor got me out
of the Music Division.

360
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,800
I'm going to Qingzhou
to live as a nominal wife.

361
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,400
So…

362
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,440
Won't you miss all this?

363
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,360
Miss what?

364
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,240
The outfit?

365
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,280
Or the bravos?

366
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,000
After I broke up with Chi Pan,

367
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,200
I realized

368
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,720
that fame is but vanity.

369
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,440
Nothing beats freedom,
and the ordinary life.

370
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,760
Also, he promised that he wouldn't
have a legal wife,

371
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,520
and that I'd be
in charge of family affairs,

372
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,120
so why would I have any concerns?

373
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,080
You, however,

374
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,680
need to smarten up.

375
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,920
Shen Ruzhuo is a crook.

376
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,560
He's not.

377
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,920
Once I leave the Music Division,

378
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,440
we'll be married at once.

379
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:41,860
(The Decency of Pine Tree)

380
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,520
Try this.

381
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,600
It's fine. Don't worry. I'm here.

382
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,200
There are summer hurricanes
and downpours

383
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,640
in the Eastern Capital

384
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,840
every three or five years.

385
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,240
The same in Qiantang.

386
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,520
I forgot

387
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,960
that you're from the seaside.

388
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,080
Come on,
have a drink to calm your nerves.

389
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,000
Ruzhuo,

390
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,120
I feel a bit dizzy.

391
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,080
You may be a bit tipsy.

392
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,280
It's quite strong.

393
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,120
How about you get some rest?

394
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,600
I want to go home.

395
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,920
But…

396
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,640
But the banquet just got started.

397
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,560
If we left early,

398
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,200
Mr. Lin wouldn't be happy.

399
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,440
Please take Ms. Song to a room
to get some rest.

400
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,360
Aye.

401
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,520
Ms. Song, this way, please.

402
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,600
Is it done?

403
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,120
I don't know.

404
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,200
How about I stay here?

405
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,440
You go inform Mr. Shen.

406
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,660
(Smithing)

407
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,920
Yinzhang.

408
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,840
Yinzhang.

409
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,960
How come the aphrodisiac incense
isn't on?

410
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,440
Yinzhang.

411
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,800
I'm still awake.

412
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,520
You're disappointed, aren't you?

413
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,120
Wait.

414
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,720
Yinzhang, listen to me.

415
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,840
I…

416
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,200
Shen Ruzhuo said he'd
help you drop the pariah status?

417
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:37,960
Yes.

418
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,960
I have lived in his house
for a few days.

419
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,120
He's the one

420
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,600
who took you to Lin's Mansion?

421
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,080
What's wrong?

422
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,720
Chi Pan didn't allow me to say it,

423
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,200
but now that I'm leaving here,

424
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,600
I don't care anymore.

425
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,480
Yinzhang,

426
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,280
Shen Ruzhuo

427
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,160
isn't necessarily sincere.

428
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,600
You need to stay on guard against him.

429
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,720
People out there

430
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,520
describe Shen Ruzhuo as a gentleman.

431
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,560
Only the seasoned musicians like me

432
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,720
know who he really is.

433
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,600
Before he

434
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,840
obtains a girl,

435
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,560
he's super sincere.

436
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,800
But after he gets what he wants,

437
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,720
he'll get bored in several days.

438
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,840
Yes, the Shen Family is
a renowned family,

439
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,200
but this generation

440
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,160
is degenerate.

441
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,680
He got his cushy job in the government

442
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,360
through bribery.

443
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Two girls I knew

444
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,760
were in deep love with him,

445
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,640
but he offered them to Minister Lin.

446
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,560
No way.

447
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,600
He won't lie to me.

448
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,720
Those girls, too,

449
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,560
thought he was a good man.

450
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,200
But it was their own fault.

451
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,760
They got drunk,

452
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,600
and slept with that dirty old man.

453
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,640
They even thought

454
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,960
they cheated on their good old Ruzhuo.

455
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,320
For so long, you have been lying to me.

456
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,360
You think

457
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,240
I'm a frail, simple girl, don't you?

458
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,080
I have a temper and I play pipa,

459
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,920
and I'll do anything
that you ask me to do.

460
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,720
But remember?

461
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,960
I'm not a little girl
who just gets into the business.

462
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,680
My family has worked at the
Music Division for three generations.

463
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,960
I have attended so many banquets.

464
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,160
I can even

465
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,800
tell poison by the smell of it,

466
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,080
let alone the aphrodisiac drug.

467
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,800
Also,

468
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,280
after years of playing pipa,

469
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,280
I'm very aware

470
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,880
how tough a fine string can be.

471
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,760
Would you like to try it?

472
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,680
Are you frightened now?

473
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,320
Have you forgotten

474
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,200
that I was once married?

475
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,440
My ex-husband was banished
to Yazhou,

476
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,960
though I don't know
if he's dead or alive by now.

477
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,920
Yinzhang, I'm sorry.

478
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,440
You acknowledge it? Good man.

479
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,280
I have prepared a statement for you.

480
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Come on, stamp your fingerprint on it.

481
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,300
(Statement)

482
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,840
Don't worry.

483
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,280
Since we were once in deep love,

484
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,600
if you disappear in my life,

485
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,200
I'll leave you be as well.

486
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,640
Mr. Lin is coming, right?

487
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,440
No more delays.

488
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,960
The rain is too heavy!

489
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,760
Never mind this place.

490
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,600
Follow me to the wharf.

491
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,640
Go. To the wharf.

492
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,320
Quickly.

493
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:12,880
Go.

494
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,600
Mr. Lin will be pleased

495
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,920
to see this, won't he?

496
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,460
(Qing Garden)

497
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,700
(Half-hidden)

498
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:47,060
(Half-hidden)

499
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,780
(Half-hidden)

500
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,840
I don't even have any tears.

501
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,760
It's fine.

502
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,760
The building is destroyed.
But we've still got the land.

503
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,680
We'll just start over.

504
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,400
Sanniang.

505
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,200
I feel tired.

506
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,840
I don't think I can.

507
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,680
I know what's on your mind.

508
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,600
Let me say it for you.

509
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,680
How about…

510
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,360
How about we don't redeem the deed?

511
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,120
So I won't need to borrow money
from Du Changfeng.

512
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,440
We'll divide the 300 strings of coins.

513
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,440
Yinzhang, Zhaodi.

514
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,560
They will have their shares.

515
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,200
We'll go back to Qiantang
to open a small business.

516
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,760
At least, we have a house to live there.

517
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,840
Is that okay?

518
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:15,840
Okay.

519
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,600
Let's scavenge the place.

520
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,200
They'll be worth something.

521
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:37,960
(God.)

522
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
(Before, I'd always say
"I won't regret it".)

523
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,520
(But this time,)

524
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,800
(I…)

525
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,680
(I shouldn't have come)

526
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,240
(to the Eastern Capital.)

527
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,280
You eat the most but do the least.

528
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,120
Carry more!

529
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:09,960
Keep working!

530
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,240
Who's in charge here?

531
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,000
Hail, Mr. Ren.
I'm Chi Pan, the man in charge.

532
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,840
You're Chi Pan?

533
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,560
(Ren Jiang)

534
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,160
(Superintendent of Kaifeng Prefecture)
Is this how you run the wharf?

535
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,880
I kept telling you
to consolidate the wharf,

536
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,600
but you never listened.

537
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,120
Now, look.

538
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,160
It's completely ruined
by this small rain.

539
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,520
What am I going to say
to the higher office?

540
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,000
Sir, allow me to explain.

541
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,720
It wasn't small rain last night.

542
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,480
Talking back to me?

543
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,880
What are you going to do?

544
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,920
What? Trying to rebel against me?

545
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,240
Remember.

546
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,200
I represent the authority.
You are a citizen.

547
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,440
Kneel down.

548
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,080
Kneel.

549
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,800
Kneel.

550
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,520
He's the superintendent.

551
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,040
He didn't get enough bribery,

552
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,040
so he's here to look for trouble.

553
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,440
Karma is doing its work.

554
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,640
He deserves it.

555
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,480
Scholar, farmer, worker, businessman.

556
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,680
Businessmen are at the bottom.

557
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,960
You're full of tricks.

558
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,680
None of you is good.

559
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,960
I'll take my men to repair the wharf.

560
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,360
Who do you think you are?

561
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,200
How dare you talk back to me?

562
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,680
If it isn't repaired before nightfall,

563
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,040
I swear you'll be decapitated.

564
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,320
Even if you kill me now,

565
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,600
I can't repair it
in such a short notice.

566
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,720
I'll take your life right now.

567
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,640
Show mercy, sir.

568
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,520
- Superintendent Ren!
- Superintendent Ren! Sir!

569
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,160
Have mercy on Mr. Chi.

570
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,560
- Superintendent Ren, have mercy.
- Superintendent Ren, have mercy.

571
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,720
Have mercy on Mr. Chi.

572
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,880
Have mercy on Mr. Chi, please.

573
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,160
Have mercy on Mr. Chi.

574
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,560
Have mercy, Superintendent Ren.

575
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,600
You.

576
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,400
Lick my boots clean.

577
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,080
Then I'll have mercy on you.

578
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,400
Chi Pan.

579
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,200
You wuss.

580
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,320
Just put your neck against his blade.

581
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,480
Three days later,

582
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,360
I bet

583
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,560
you'll see him in hell.

584
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,160
Who the heck are you?

585
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,240
Talking nonsense here.

586
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,600
Nonsense?

587
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,360
Answer me this. Does a superintendent
in charge of river affairs

588
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,000
have the right to kill a citizen
in public

589
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,880
without a trial?

590
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,520
Do you have any respect for the law?

591
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,720
He didn't manage the wharf well.

592
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,440
So I have the right to convict him.

593
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,280
The head of the wharf

594
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,640
is just the leader of dockers.

595
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,960
The reparation of the wharf

596
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,640
and the river channel

597
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,800
are your job, right?

598
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,160
Why does a citizen need to do anything?

599
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,040
Mr. Chi is willing to help

600
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,080
because he's grateful
for His Majesty's benevolence

601
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,240
and wants to pay him back.

602
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,280
While you're

603
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,680
being judgmental here.

604
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,280
What's the meaning of this?

605
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,240
Well said!

606
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,040
Well said!

607
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,200
- Well said!
- Yeah! Yeah!

608
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,840
How dare you!

609
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,120
So what?

610
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,160
I've run out of my luck anyway.

611
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,960
So I'll just spit it out.

612
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,400
You said businessmen are at the bottom.

613
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,080
How about you don't drink
the wine that businessmen make,

614
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,680
don't wear the clothes
that businessmen sell,

615
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,600
and don't eat the grains
that businessmen transport?

616
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,200
There are no farmlands
in the Eastern Capital.

617
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,840
Other than the scholars,

618
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,200
most people here in the city
do business.

619
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,760
When they fought
to maintain the channel,

620
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,600
where were you?

621
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,720
When they worked to rebuild
the Eastern Capital,

622
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,800
what were you doing?

623
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,200
I think

624
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,920
it's you snobs

625
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,760
that are the worst.

626
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,680
Yeah!

627
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,320
Right!

628
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,000
Well said!

629
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,040
Well said!

630
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,440
Yes! Yes!

631
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,960
Arrest them.

632
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,520
Yes, sir.

633
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,240
