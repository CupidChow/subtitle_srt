=Episode 10=

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,960
(Commander Gu,)

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,120
(I wish you were
in the Eastern Capital.)

19
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,480
(Capable as you are,)

20
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,000
(you won't)

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,320
(leave Pan'er to be bullied.)

22
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,040
(Yes, you're the officer
of the Capital Security Office.)

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,720
(Perhaps you have the right to)

24
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,080
(get me out of registry.)

25
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,080
(If so,)

26
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,640
(I would do anything you ask.)

27
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,280
I didn't mean that.

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,720
Don't make it wrong.

29
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,640
I'm almost drooling.

30
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,920
So delicate.

31
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,720
What are these?

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,880
These are flower dumplings,

33
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,720
the familiar dessert in South.

34
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,560
You borrowed the kitchen

35
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,680
to cook for Mr. Chi's subordinates,
right?

36
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,760
Exactly.

37
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,360
We really offended

38
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,240
Mr. Chi this time.

39
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,640
We should make it up.

40
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,120
Pan'er let me buy some

41
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,080
four-color desserts.

42
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,680
I figured out
that these were exactly cakes.

43
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,040
I can make them.

44
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,240
No need to buy them.

45
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,240
Last time,

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,360
that Mr. Du said

47
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,480
he brought the best cakes
in the Eastern Capital.

48
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,720
I find nothing special about them.

49
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,880
You are so thoughtful.

50
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,080
Who?

51
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,000
Are you Sun Sanniang?

52
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,080
Yes.

53
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,920
I'm the landlady.

54
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,800
Did you make the flower dumplings?

55
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,680
Yes. So what?

56
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,440
What are you doing?

57
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,600
I eventually find you.

58
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,240
Could you please
make another plate of dumplings?

59
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,360
They are

60
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,520
so delicious.

61
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,920
No, you can't eat that.

62
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,040
OK.

63
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,760
Sister,

64
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,120
you are skillful with your hands.

65
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,520
Why are you so dexterous

66
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,480
to make so tasteful,

67
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,960
so beautiful,

68
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,640
so…

69
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,160
so delicious flower dumplings?

70
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,360
Please, make another plate for me.

71
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,240
I'm so pleased that

72
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,680
you like them.

73
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,080
But unfortunately,

74
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,720
we're going to move away.

75
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,760
Move away?

76
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,720
To where?

77
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,000
Don't move away.

78
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,720
Just live here.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,440
As long as you can make
flower dumplings for me,

80
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,200
I don't charge you.

81
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,760
No, it's not about money, we…

82
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,240
Sanniang, how about this?

83
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,280
You make another plate of

84
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,600
cakes for ma'am.

85
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,840
I'll go to Ouyang Xu by myself.

86
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,120
No way.

87
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,880
Ma'am, thanks a lot.

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
But we do have to move away tonight.

89
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,560
Or, we can come back
to visit you and the manager

90
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,760
after we finish the business.

91
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,960
You're Ms. Zhao, right?

92
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,840
I've heard about you and Mr. Chi.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,880
I like your straight personality.

94
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,720
Well, I won't disturb you

95
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,920
as long as

96
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,480
I can have a bite of flower dumplings.

97
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,800
You can't eat them.

98
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,360
If you leave them alone,

99
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,600
I'll make you a box of cakes.

100
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,160
Really?

101
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,000
Let's go.

102
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,240
Wait.

103
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,840
The smaller you cut them,

104
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,240
the easier the juice
can be squeezed out.

105
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,240
Exactly.

106
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,200
See, how beautiful.

107
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,120
Yes.

108
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,680
Yinzhang, what are you doing here?

109
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,600
I…

110
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,400
Pan'er said

111
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,560
there's too dangerous.

112
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,520
She asked me to be here with you.

113
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,360
Don't be in the kitchen then.

114
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,400
It's so hot.

115
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,480
Yes.

116
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,160
There are

117
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,360
all kitchen wares here.

118
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,680
It's crowded with stuff and people.

119
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,480
Don't get you tainted.

120
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,480
It's OK, I can help.

121
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,160
You can do nothing here.

122
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,760
Just get out and have some fresh air.

123
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,680
Just go.

124
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,920
Chop more, smaller.

125
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,800
- OK.
- Right.

126
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,760
Chop more. Chop more.

127
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,560
What smart hands!

128
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,120
Take a look at the pretty good medicine.

129
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,520
Choose some.

130
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,160
Sir, these are to nourish your vitality.

131
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,560
These are to enrich the blood.

132
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,000
They are good for your wife.

133
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,320
Unsurpassed beauty is coming.
Unsurpassed beauty is coming.

134
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,800
Come and look.

135
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,600
- Hurry up or you'll miss it.
- Unsurpassed beauty.

136
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,840
Hurry up. Come and look.

137
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,040
This is Zhang Haohao,

138
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,280
the top beauty.

139
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,200
She is the most famous

140
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,800
unsurpassed beauty
in the Eastern Capital.

141
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,000
Everybody knows her.

142
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,040
Her songs are like
the music from heaven.

143
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,040
We ordinary people have to spend
1,000 copper coins

144
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,360
and wait for half a month
to listen to her singing.

145
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,920
Today is the birthday
of the Eighth Imperial Prince.

146
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,360
The Music Division has to perform
on imperial orders.

147
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Ms. Zhang sang "Wild Geese's Cries".

148
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,560
His Majesty awarded her colorful dress

149
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,400
and allowed her
to cruise the imperial street.

150
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,520
- See, how beautiful.
- A glimpse of her is so precious.

151
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,320
Look at her hairpin.

152
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,920
It's an award
from the Eighth Imperial Prince.

153
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,840
You can't buy it even with
millions of copper coins.

154
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,800
Music Division.

155
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,680
She's a registered musician?

156
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,040
So beautiful.

157
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,920
You despise her?

158
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,120
See who is leading the horse for her?

159
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,600
Mr. Liu.

160
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,760
The greatest lyricist.

161
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,800
Yes.

162
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,720
He's leading the horse for Zhang Haohao?

163
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,200
Exactly.

164
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,960
How could she be so beautiful?

165
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,760
Come on. Come on.

166
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,320
So tiring.

167
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,000
Miss, congrats on
being awarded by His Highness.

168
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,200
OK, OK, thank you.

169
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,600
Ask the accountants for the bonus.

170
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,600
Am I pretty?

171
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,960
It's needless to ask.
I'm almost stunned by your beauty.

172
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,560
Why are you the only one to greet me?

173
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,880
Where's the palace guard?

174
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,600
Well, he has

175
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,520
some emergency

176
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,800
and was not able to come.

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,480
So he asked me to greet you.

178
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,320
But rest assured,

179
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,080
when he comes back,

180
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,600
he must have some good presents for you.

181
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,160
What emergency?

182
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,360
He Si.

183
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,240
He Si was bullied.

184
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,640
The palace guard

185
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,800
always cherishes his friends.

186
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
He went to back him up.

187
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,840
Now,

188
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,440
they might be crying
in the Land God Temple

189
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,240
and ask the god for help.

190
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,000
The Land God Temple?

191
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,240
When did he start to be so pious?

192
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,080
He…

193
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,280
Miss Song playing pipa?

194
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,440
He bit his tongue?

195
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,200
No, he didn't get hurt.

196
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
I mean he didn't bite his tongue.

197
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,800
Haohao, he didn't bite his tongue.

198
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,360
Yinzhang, hurry up.

199
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,280
Sanniang.

200
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,720
Guess who I just saw.

201
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
Zhang Haohao.

202
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,120
Mr. Liu led the horse for her.

203
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,960
Who is she?

204
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,760
She…

205
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,360
Sanniang, don't run away.

206
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,520
How about 5,000 copper coins per month?

207
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,480
It was my fault.

208
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,400
They praised me a lot,

209
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,680
- so I made more cakes.
- Sanniang.

210
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,960
They not only robbed them away,

211
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,080
but also forced me
to stay here and be a cook.

212
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,720
Sanniang.

213
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,360
There she is! Get her!

214
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,760
Sanniang, don't run away.

215
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,600
I didn't take my pipa.

216
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I can't wait for you.

217
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,440
Let's meet under the willow tree
in the east.

218
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,480
Sanniang, don't run away.

219
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,200
Stop.

220
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,800
Little flower, don't run away.

221
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,480
Sanniang.

222
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,200
Miss, it's Sanyuan Inn ahead.

223
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,560
I have to know
what Song Yinzhang looks like.

224
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,840
You're Zhang Haohao.

225
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,480
You're Song Yinzhang.

226
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,600
Even I cannot help loving you
upon seeing you,

227
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,440
let alone the men.

228
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,160
Ma'am, I can't.

229
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,560
I really can't.

230
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
Listen,

231
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,760
I will come back

232
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,240
after I finish my business

233
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,160
and teach your cooks
to make these desserts.

234
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,880
I swear! I swear to God.

235
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,600
Well,

236
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
it's a deal.

237
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,880
It's a deal.

238
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,240
I'm so glad

239
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,600
that you like my cooking.

240
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,560
You promise?

241
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,440
I promise.

242
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,480
Come back soon
after you finish your business.

243
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,200
I reserve Room No.1 for you.

244
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,720
Really?

245
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,720
Thanks a lot.

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,800

I've always been arrogant,

257
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,760
thinking that I'm the best singer
in the world.

258
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,400
But I'm incomparable

259
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,800
to your pipa.

260
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,520
I'm just a rural girl from the South.

261
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,760
I'm so far behind you.

262
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,720
I saw you last time
on the imperial street.

263
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,920
Your style and disposition

264
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,520
make you look like a goddess.

265
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,080
Well, hardly.

266
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,720
You're talented and pretty.

267
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,720
You're the exotic beauty.

268
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,840
If a rural girl could

269
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,480
knock Mr. Chi down,

270
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,120
a lady in the Eastern Capital like me

271
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,480
should be a pickle woman.

272
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,600
I didn't mean that.

273
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,960
You know Mr. Chi, too?

274
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,640
He's really a bad guy.

275
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,720
He lost to Pan'er when playing soccer

276
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
and came to look for us.

277
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,680
Of course I know him.

278
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,640
Tell me

279
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,920
how he bullied you.

280
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,920
Maybe I can back you up.

281
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,920
He robbed my pipa.

282
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,120
He said

283
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,880
I'm a registered musician,

284
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,800
not a lady.

285
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,000
What?

286
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,640
We're indeed registered musicians.

287
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,680
He shouldn't say that in front of

288
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,520
so many people.

289
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,360
He was humiliating me.

290
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,480
You misunderstood him.

291
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,160
He goes to the theaters every day

292
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,800
and always tries to please me.

293
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,760
Even his mother was once

294
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,480
a registered musician.

295
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,920
How could he humiliate you
in this way?

296
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,800
Really?

297
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,680
Yinzhang,

298
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,520
I felt you're so self-abased

299
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,840
when talking about the musicians.

300
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,480
We earn our living by ourselves.

301
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,440
Just be confident

302
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,080
and straight yourself up.

303
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,240
But registered musicians
are lower class after all.

304
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,800
So what?

305
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,800
We don't have to worry about our lives.

306
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,800
The poets try hard to please us.

307
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,400
The officers appreciate us.

308
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,400
You don't have to

309
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,880
sell yourself

310
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,160
like a performer

311
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,480
nor restrain yourself like a lady.

312
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,680
You can dress yourself up
and be served by servants.

313
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,760
What's the disadvantage
comparing with ordinary people?

314
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,600
Some people work as an officer

315
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,640
but never meet His Majesty.

316
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,800
But for me,

317
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,400
I'm only 23,

318
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,240
and have been praised twice
by His Majesty and Her Highness.

319
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
Twice.

320
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,920
Yes.

321
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,320
In terms of identity,

322
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,240
we're not noble people.

323
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,880
But what's the inferiority about us?

324
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,160
Let me ask you,

325
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,920
have you ever sold yourself?

326
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,800
Have you ever pleased a man for money?

327
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,440
Do you stay up late and get up early

328
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,360
to practice pipa?

329
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,000
Were you practicing pipa

330
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,600
when other friends were having fun?

331
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,280
You view your pipa
more important than your life?

332
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,320
That's it. So am I.

333
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,800
Remember,

334
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,000
to serve people
with their beauty is inferior.

335
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,480
We live on ourselves,

336
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,480
We're frank

337
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,640
and righteous.

338
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,280
I didn't expect that

339
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,280
they do like my cooking.

340
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,560
See,

341
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,080
the landlady gave me this.

342
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,480
When I was in Qiantang,

343
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,560
sometimes people praise my cooking,

344
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,800
but they were not heartfelt
as people here are.

345
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,520
What's wrong with you?

346
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,800
You looked depressed

347
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,800
after coming back
from Zhang Haohao's place.

348
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,480
I'm not depressed.

349
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,760
Instead, I'm revitalized.

350
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,720
It's my first time being informed that

351
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,320
being a registered musician

352
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,440
in the Eastern Capital

353
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,680
is nothing humiliating.

354
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,480
As long as I live on myself,

355
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,280
I'll be respected by noble people.

356
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,760
The Eastern Capital
is really a nice place.

357
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,240
Sanniang,

358
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,640
I like here.

359
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,590
So do I.

360
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,160
The landlady just told me

361
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,830
that people in the Eastern Capital are
generous about money.

362
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,960
There's no curfew here.

363
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,880
There're hundreds of thousands

364
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,960
of stores

365
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,350
in various professions.

366
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,560
As long as you're hard-working,

367
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,800
you can live a good life

368
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,280
even if being a waitress.

369
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,520
It fits me.

370
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,360
So beautiful.

371
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,360
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

372
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,160
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

373
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,160
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

374
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,920
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

375
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,960
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

376
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,840
Take a rest.

377
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,480
Have some water. Thank you, guys.

378
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,240
It's OK.

379
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,680
- We'll still need your support.
- Have some water.

380
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,040
Thank you, Miss.

381
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,400
Thank you.

382
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,120
Thank you, Miss.

383
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,160
Get out.

384
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,840
Thank you, Miss.

385
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,680
Get out.

386
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,840
It's a gift

387
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,800
for your master.

388
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,000
Sorry to offend you.

389
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,040
It's a humble gift.

390
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,400
All for our master?

391
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,080
It's too many for him.

392
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,000
How about giving one to me?

393
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,240
Is it time?

394
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,320
Let's continue.

395
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,280
Miss.

396
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,480
We've been shouting for hours.

397
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,080
But nothing happens.

398
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,600
How about making something stronger?

399
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,320
Let's get some wailers.

400
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,720
Let's start.

401
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,600
Oh my God!

402
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,080
Oh my God!

403
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,040
Stop, stop, stop.

404
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,120
Not now.

405
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,280
If it happens again tomorrow,
let's try it.

406
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,000
You take a rest.

407
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,280
Let me do it. Let me do it.

408
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,080
Ouyang Xu.

409
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,520
Don't hide

410
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,280
if you call yourself a man.

411
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,920
Get out.

412
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,880
Let me do it.

413
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,360
Ouyang Xu.

414
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,280
Get out.

415
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,680
Are you not feeling guilty

416
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,160
when you hide up?

417
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,560
Leave it to us.

418
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,160
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

419
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,960
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

420
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,960
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

421
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,920
(Ouyang's Mansion)
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

422
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,240
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

423
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,760
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

424
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,080
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

425
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,640
Get away.

426
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,160
- Get away. Get away.
- Get away. Get away.

427
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,040
Pay what you owe, Heaven is watching!

428
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
Pay what you owe…

429
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:13,840
Get away.

430
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,640
Get away.

431
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,000
That woman is the chief criminal.

432
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,200
It's her.

433
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,240
Catch them.

434
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,240
Yes.

435
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,960
What are you doing?

436
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,120
Come here.

437
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,880
What are you doing?

438
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,360
Where do you govern?

439
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,080
We just ask for payment.

440
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,440
Which rule did we violate?

441
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,800
I'm the chief officer
of the eastern region.

442
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,160
It's my job to

443
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,880
manage the stealing, robbery

444
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,600
and registration evasion here.

445
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,040
You said Mr. Ouyang owes your debt.

446
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,920
Do you have a receipt?

447
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,200
Yes.

448
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,280
But I didn't take it with me.

449
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,400
I have witnesses.

450
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,000
We're the witnesses.

451
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,320
You have no evidence

452
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,720
but words.

453
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,800
I say you owe me
100,000 copper coins,

454
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,200
and he's the witness.

455
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,320
I see, you asked for the rescuers.

456
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
Ouyang Xu, don't you feel ashamed?

457
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,360
Get out.

458
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,200
Stop shouting!

459
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,400
Where are you from?

460
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,400
Qiantang.

461
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,880
The foreigners.

462
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,280
How long have you been here?

463
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,720
Do you have the certificates
issued by Qiantang County?

464
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,720
Without certificates,
you're the exiled people.

465
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,080
Do you know

466
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,800
it's a crime to get into
the Eastern Capital secretly.

467
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,560
They're just some women
in the whorehouse

468
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,760
who came here to bluff people.

469
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,880
You're still so dirty.

470
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,680
Get away.

471
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,360
- Pan'er.
- Pan'er.

472
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,560
Being dishonest?

473
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,920
Rip their clothes off.

474
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,480
How dare you!

475
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,080
Stop.

476
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,000
Stop.

477
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,620
Stop.

478
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,060
(Ouyang's Mansion)

479
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,800
Sir.

480
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,080
You really should

481
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,160
humiliate these shrews.

482
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,360
When they lost their face,

483
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,720
they'll know the rules.

484
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,040
If you give them a hard time,

485
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,320
it's not good for my reputation.

486
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
Save their face.

487
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,080
Just drive them out of the city.

488
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,680
OK, as you wish.

489
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,960
Zhao, do you know your mistake?

490
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,160
I want to tell you,

491
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,080
don't be greedy

492
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,400
for what does not belong to you.

493
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,360
Just leave the city.

494
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,840
Otherwise,

495
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,360
it will be the consequence.

496
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,200
How dare

497
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,120
you slander an officer.

498
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,440
Get them out and parade them in public.

499
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,600
Drive them out of the city.

500
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,880
- Go.
- Get up.

501
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,360
Wait.

502
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,720
Take the gold collars.

503
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,640
That's all I can give you.

504
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,160
Pan'er.

505
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,720
It's for your good
to leave the Eastern Capital.

506
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,200
Sorry.

507
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,920
Disaster, they finally go.

508
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,640
Shut up.

509
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,640
Be sure to give her the money.

510
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,880
Parading the suspects in public.

511
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,080
Give way.

512
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,520
Parading the suspects in public.

513
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,600
Give way.

514
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,480
Look, look.

515
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,840
They're shrewd women bluffing people.

516
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,680
I know you're scared.

517
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,280
Magistrate Jiang's deeds

518
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,760
are out of your expectations.

519
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,960
You're smart

520
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,880
and competent.

521
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,040
You're capable

522
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,800
in normal life.

523
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,840
The smart businessman

524
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,280
like Zhou She was fooled by you.

525
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,080
But,

526
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,320
in face of officers,

527
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,160
you'll lose.

528
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,520
Hurry up, hurry up.

529
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,320
Go.

530
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,520
Stop.

531
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,280
Commander Gu.

532
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,280
You're back?

533
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,680
What's the matter with you?

534
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,240
Nothing, just got some minor injuries.

535
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,120
How about Zheng Qingtian's case?

536
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,880
Don't pretend to be fine

537
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,320
in front of me.

538
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,800
What happened?

539
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,160
You're waiting for me
to take a pratfall.

540
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,640
OK, I'll tell you.

541
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,760
You were right.

542
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,600
Ouyang Xu drove us out
of the Eastern Capital

543
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,640
with the help of his father-in-law.

544
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,640
And?

545
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,320
Are you going to go back to Qiantang?

546
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,160
Do we have other choices?

547
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,680
Well, Yinzhang.

548
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,440
Can you lend me

549
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,640
the Fei-qian borrowed from Prefect Xu?

550
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,520
OK.

551
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,640
This money is enough for you

552
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,240
to ransom your father's sword.

553
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,400
I should have gone by myself.

554
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,280
But you're alright now.

555
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,960
Your subordinates are more efficient
and capable than me.

556
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,520
No worries.

557
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840
Zhao Pan'er, where's your spirit?

558
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,400
Let me tell you.

559
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,880
If Ouyang Xu can drive you
out of the Eastern Capital,

560
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,800
I can get you back.

561
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,760
Don't get involved.

562
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,120
You said it before.

563
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,560
There're so many noble people
in the Eastern Capital.

564
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,160
If something happens,

565
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,520
even you can't protect me.

566
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,360
I was really arrogant

567
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,920
and ignored them.

568
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,240
Your uniform looks good

569
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,320
and powerful.

570
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,440
Be always like this.

571
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,640
Don't be so unlucky as in Qiantang.

572
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,520
Thank you for sending me here.

573
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,640
Farewell.

574
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,280
Yinzhang, Sanniang, let's go.

575
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,560
Are you willing?

576
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,320
Being driven out of

577
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,200
the Eastern Capital.

578
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,960
Are you willing?

579
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720
You always said

580
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,360
that you'll never

581
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,320
regret your decisions.

582
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,480
You always said that

583
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,080
you'll never stop
until you fulfill your goal.

584
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,840
Watch yourself now.

585
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,080
You're so depressed
after suffering some little setbacks.

586
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,000
I thought highly of you.

587
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,800
Gu Qianfan, don't stimulate me.

588
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,320
I'm not that boring.

589
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,400
Do you think paying back will be enough?

590
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,920
Remember, you've promised me

591
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,760
to find the painting for me.

592
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,320
If you can't

593
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,280
fulfill your promise,

594
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,680
you're just like Ouyang Xu.

595
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,800
I've broken off relationship with him.

596
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,840
Broken off relationship?

597
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,400
Do you know what you look like now?

598
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,360
Just a piece of worn-out duster cloth

599
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,040
thrown away by people.

600
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,960
Gu Qianfan.

601
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,800
Let me ask you for the last time.

602
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,440
Are you willing?

603
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,920
And you.

604
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,960
You come here with her

605
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,320
travelling a long distance.

606
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,080
You've got nothing

607
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,680
and go back miserably.

608
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,000
Are you willing to?

609
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,040
No.

610
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
I want to stay in the Eastern Capital

611
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,840
and be successful

612
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,680
like Zhang Haohao.

613
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,800
Mr. Liu would write to me.

614
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,040
The civilians would wait downstairs

615
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,520
to listen to my music.

616
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,240
Me neither.

617
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
I got divorced.

618
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,880
What can I do back in Qiantang?

619
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,400
Watching the couple

620
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,000
show affection?

621
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,480
Since these officers
just tried to frighten us,

622
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,760
we should stay

623
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,800
and try to deal with Ouyang Xu.

624
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,400
I'm not willing to.

625
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,180
(Jingxing Hospital)

626
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,100
(Jingxing Hospital)

627
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,280
It may hurt healing by wine.

628
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,480
Be patient.

629
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,800
Be patient.

630
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,400
Be patient.

631
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,880
Let me do it.

632
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,480
Be patient.

633
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,440
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

634
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,960
It's too stuffy here, you just get out.

635
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,360
Get out.

636
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,720
What's wrong?

637
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,400
The wine stinks.

638
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,920
Should I punish you

639
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,200
or you just confess?

640
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,440
Who are you?

641
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,000
How dare you drown me?

642
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,080
Living Devil.

643
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,240
Commander Gu.

644
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,240
You make up rules
and bully the civilians.

645
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,760
How dare you?

646
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,000
Please forgive me.

647
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,640
It was my fault.

648
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,640
Just answer us.

649
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,840
OK, OK.

650
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,960
It's Ouyang Xu, the new Third Graduate.

651
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,200
When he just moved to the eastern town,

652
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,280
he sent me some presents.

653
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,880
This time, he sent 50,000 copper coins.

654
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,240
Did Inspector Gao ask you
to deal with them?

655
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,160
No, no.

656
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,360
Other officers?

657
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,800
No, no.

658
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,280
Keep him in prison for ten days.

659
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:11,920
Yes.

660
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,760
Wait.

661
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,630
Don't get in.

662
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,040
I'll let you go

663
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,120
if you write down

664
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,920
what Ouyang Xu did.

665
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,280
Don't you hear her?

666
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,760
I'll write. I'll write.

667
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,670
I'll write. I'll write.

668
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,710
I'll write. I'll write.

669
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,840
I'll write.

670
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,600
You denied my order
in front of my subordinates.

671
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,800
How powerful you were.

672
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,560
I don't want you
to offend people for me.

673
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,150
You just arrived in the Capital

674
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,150
and haven't finished your job,

675
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,190
but caused so big trouble.

676
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,920
If the Gao Family knows it

677
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,880
and gets you involved,

678
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,480
I will be guilty.

679
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,160
Do you think a confession

680
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,880
can beat Ouyang Xu?

681
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,000
You're right.

682
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,800
He's afraid of me being here

683
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,440
and being known by the Gao Family.

684
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,880
Ms. Zhao, look at this.

685
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,620
(Confession)

686
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,000
Send me to Ouyang Xu.

687
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,640
No way.

688
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,320
What's wrong?

689
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,880
I'll go by myself then.

690
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,560
Look at your injuries.

691
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,280
Even if you can bear it,

692
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,280
how about your friends?

693
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
I forgot them.

694
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,280
Well, let's go to the inn first.

695
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,320
Forget that.

696
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,280
If we bunch of troops send you here,

697
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,240
how dare the manager run his business?

698
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,880
What should I do then?

699
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,160
I have an idea.

700
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,160
I'm a resident in the Eastern Capital.

701
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,920
My family built a small house

702
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,320
in Guangde Lane.

703
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,520
It was lying idle.

704
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,640
I was planning to

705
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,080
stay here after coming back.

706
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,440
But I thought it twice.

707
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,280
I have to cook for myself.

708
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,080
It's so boring.

709
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,400
It's OK now.

710
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,640
You just stay here for me

711
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,280
and guard the yard.

712
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,600
In this way,

713
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,160
I can go back to my mansion

714
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,360
and be with my mother.

715
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,680
It's a deal.

716
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,680
Is it suitable?

717
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,920
Let me show you.

718
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,680
OK.

719
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,240
The yard is really good.

720
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,600
Come in, please.

721
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,240
You call it a small house?

722
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,520
It's just a little heritage.

723
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,080
Mind your steps.

724
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,520
This yard is too big.

725
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,080
Well, Ms. Zhao.

726
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,560
Tell me

727
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,280
if you find something missing.

728
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,400
I'll get them ready.

729
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,520
It's OK.

730
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,280
Captain Chen, just go home.

731
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,760
It has been a big trouble for you.

732
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,040
We can tidy them by ourselves.

733
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,760
Not at all.

734
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,920
Call me Chen Lian.

735
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,120
I won't regard you as outsiders.

736
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,320
I'll call you Pan'er.

737
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,520
Sanniang.

738
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,640
Yinzhang.

739
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,880
Well, sisters,
I have to deal with some businesses.

740
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,880
I'll go first.

741
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,680
Thank you.

742
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,480
People in the Capital Security Office
are so scary.

743
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,880
But he's fine.

744
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,400
We're back in the city.

745
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,240
Good.

746
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,960
I want this room.

747
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,440
Look at this one.

748
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,920
Yinzhang, look.

749
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,760
Do you like it?

750
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,200
Yes.

751
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,920
Good?

752
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,440
This yard is beautiful.

753
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,440
We're back finally.

754
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,200
So good.

755
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,160
I'll practice pipa there.

756
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,000
I'll make some cakes.

757
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,200
We can put some tea

758
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,480
and chat here.

759
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,920
Commander Gu is so nice.

760
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,160
Well, if I asked him,

761
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,920
would he

762
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,880
write off my registration?

763
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,200
What?

764
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,800
What's wrong?

765
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,120
Yinzhang.

766
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,440
It's lucky for us to

767
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,840
get Commander Gu's help.

768
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,560
But in the future,

769
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,720
we shouldn't ask for his help again.

770
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,720
Why?

771
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,680
Isn't he a friend of Pan'er's?

772
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,920
Yes.

773
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,720
But Commander Gu helped us because

774
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,600
Pan'er has helped him

775
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,200
when he was in trouble.

776
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,480
He has helped us a lot

777
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
out of politeness.

778
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,520
We should be aware.

779
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,440
Sanniang is right.

780
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,840
We should be independent.

781
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,640
If we rely on Commander Gu all the time,

782
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,960
there's nothing different to servants.

783
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,200
If we can't stay

784
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,360
in the Eastern Capital by ourselves,

785
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,960
we'd rather go back.

786
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,440
I didn't mean to rely on others
for everything.

787
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,520
But now, it's impossible to

788
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,600
ask Ouyang Xu to help me
get out of the registry.

789
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,120
Something that is impossible for me

790
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,560
is so easy for

791
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,120
Commander Gu.

792
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,040
If it's so easy to get out
of registry,

793
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,520
Prefect Xu would have done it

794
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,800
in Xiuzhou.

795
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,520
Commander Gu is exactly the officer
in the Capital Security Office.

796
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,560
You only see his success today,

797
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,480
but haven't seen his misery

798
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,280
when being chased after by people.

799
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,120
For the Capital Security Office
where people do dirty things,

800
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,160
if his enemies know that he helps you
get out of the registry,

801
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,720
they would come to you.

802
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,360
My wound on the shoulder

803
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,840
was gotten when I was with him.

804
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,680
I listen to you.

805
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,680
I won't rely on anyone anymore.

806
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:42,840
Well,

807
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,960
I met a nice

808
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,160
head musician today.

809
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,120
She told me

810
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,800
that I can win people's respect

811
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,280
in the Eastern Capital by my hard work.

812
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,680
I think she's right.

813
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,240
As long as I work hard,

814
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,160
I may get good luck

815
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,480
like her

816
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,400
and solve

817
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,120
all the problems easily.

818
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,560
Pan'er,

819
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,720
this is your room.

820
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,920
You take it, Sanniang.

821
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,640
I want that one.

822
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,520
That's small.

823
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,800
It's small, but close to the kitchen.

824
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,440
It's a deal.

825
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,720
Come, Yinzhang, let's clean the room.

826
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,280
Have you heard everything?

827
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,080
If you're so afraid of me
involving you into trouble,

828
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,760
I won't come anymore.

829
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,680
How old are you?

830
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,600
Still got angry
about the meaningless issue.

831
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,040
Yinzhang is young and naive.

832
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,240
She only focuses on her pipa,

833
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,200
having no idea about the price of rice.

834
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,920
I exaggerated the things deliberately

835
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,120
to alarm her.

836
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,240
What's the point of being angry?

837
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,160
If I were a kid

838
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,440
and said that there're monsters
killing people,

839
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,800
were you going to

840
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,960
arrest me for spreading rumors?

841
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,680
You're quite energetic now.

842
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
- Commander Gu.
- Are you mad?

843
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,440
Come and sit.

844
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,320
Let me check your wound.

845
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:31,960
What are you doing?

846
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,360
I have to check your wound by myself.

847
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,800
No need.

848
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,080
I'm alright now.

849
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,880
That's it.

850
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,760
I did that.

851
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,920
I know how it was.

852
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,400
You're alright now.

853
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,680
Why make a fuss?

854
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,320
How can you be so confident?

855
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,040
Don't forget that

856
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,720
you took off my clothes on the boat.

857
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,240
That's different.

858
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,640
You were passed out then.

859
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,920
Let me stun you now.

860
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,360
I don't have so many rules like you.

861
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,640
Let me tell you,

862
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,680
when I torture the prisoners,

863
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,760
I rip their clothes off,

864
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,120
both men and women.

865
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,160
Well, your explanations are
so meaningless.

866
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,640
Why are there so many people?

867
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,240
Chen Lian, you come back again.

868
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,560
Boss.

869
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,680
Commander Gu, why are you here?
