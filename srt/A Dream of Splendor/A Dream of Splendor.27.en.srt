17

(Prudent in Business)
It's already this late.

18
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,120
(Prudent in Business)
Why hasn't Commissioner come yet?

19
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,760
Yeah.

20
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,040
We've been standing here
for nearly two hours.

21
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,040
When will he arrive?

22
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
So, you know we're waiting
for Commissioner Gu?

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,080
What?

24
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,800
After standing for such a short while,

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,680
have your legs started trembling?

26
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,440
If people know that,
you'll disgrace our office.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,200
But I have criminals to interrogate.

28
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,880
Yeah. I've got documents to review.

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,240
I have to handle
a lot of official business.

30
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,520
How about this?

31
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,560
Get back to your business now.

32
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,240
I'll let you know when Chief arrives.

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,560
All right.

34
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,190
Go, go, go.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,200
See? We've been waiting for hours.

36
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,400
But we were stood up.

37
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,240
Let's just go.

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,160
Come on.

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,720
I know, a new broom sweeps clean.

40
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,400
But Chief, you shouldn't have
kept us waiting

41
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,840
on your first day of taking office.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,680
Chief.

43
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,360
It's great.

44
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,000
The boys

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,920
(Prudent in Business)
are expecting the instructions from you,

46
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,560
the new Commissioner
of Capital Security Office.

47
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,960
You had your uniform ironed?

48
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,240
You stayed at Pan'er's place last night?

49
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,160
Hail, Commissioner.

50
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,100

One officer, one rule.

54
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't take brides.

55
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,800
Don't lie.

56
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,200
Don't be perfunctory.

57
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,760
Don't be afraid of death.

58
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,960
(Capital Security Office)
Such are my rules for the South Section.

59
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,280
They'll be rules for you, too.

60
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,160
We're aware of your orders,
Commissioner.

61
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,680
Being aware isn't enough.

62
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,320
You have to abide by such rules.

63
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,480
Everybody,

64
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,240
I'm not Commissioner Lei.

65
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,040
I'm Living Devil.

66
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,440
Get back to your business.

67
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,200
Chief, may I ask you a favor?

68
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,920
Speak.

69
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,320
Now you're in charge
of the Capital Security Office.

70
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,800
Could you have our lunch improved?

71
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,480
The chefs here are relatives
of Commissioner Lei.

72
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,800
What they cook tastes so bad.

73
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,320
What? Can't we have new chefs?

74
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,240
I thought you wanted to get promoted.

75
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,720
Am I that unreasonable?

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,760
Even if I've been following you,

77
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,680
without making contributions,

78
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,840
I can't ask you to promote me.

79
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,920
Get lost.

80
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,720
Why did you ask me to replace the chefs?

81
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,880
Just go and have them replaced yourself.

82
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,880
Thank you, Commissioner. I'm on it.

83
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,000
What's this?

84
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,920
A document
from the Ministry of Personnel.

85
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,040
They want our assistance.

86
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,640
Please review it when you have time.

87
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,080
What I want is a scintillating essay.

88
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,640
How dare you fool me
with such simple poems!

89
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,520
Are you really

90
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,440
the Third Graduate?

91
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,760
I don't think so.

92
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,600
Even I can write such poems.

93
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,560
Did you hear her?

94
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,960
Young Master, I did this for your good.

95
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,600
Think about it.

96
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,480
You have to write poems personally

97
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,720
at the summer banquet, right?

98
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,440
The longer the poem is,

99
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,480
the more trouble
you'll have reciting it.

100
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,840
That makes sense.

101
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,680
Then write some couplets for me.

102
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,640
I want excellent ones

103
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,680
with which I can impress everyone

104
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,360
in the literature world.

105
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,920
All right, then.

106
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,120
Ghostwrite for me attentively.

107
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,720
As long as I make a hit
at the summer banquet,

108
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,440
you will meet my uncle, Taoist Baoyi.

109
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,840
Aye.

110
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,000
Go.

111
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,920
I'm on it.

generals of Ningbian Army disobeyed orders.)

were exiled.)

117
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,880
Tell me.

118
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,720
How did you know

119
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,520
whether there was poison on the sword?

120
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,360
When I was little, I learned it
from military surgeons.

121
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,360
My father was Chief Military Inspector
of Ningbian Army.

122
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,800
Every time he was back
from a war with his soldiers,

123
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,400
my mother and I
helped the military surgeons.

Chen Lian!

127
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,240
Here, Chief.

128
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,200
Get me a horse.
I'm going to the Ministry of Personnel.

129
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,960
Aye.

130
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,260
(Xu's Mansion)

131
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,000
Why are you standing so far away?

132
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,280
Do you want me to get wetter?

133
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,900
(Xu's Mansion)

134
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,600
An elder official is waiting for you.

135
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,880
Minister Ke?

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,790
Wait here for me.

137
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,740
(Xu's Mansion)

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,670
Master.

139
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,360
Don't call me that!

140
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,120
I don't deserve it.

141
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,680
I was ordered to leave the capital
for another city.

142
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,280
When passing by this place,

143
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,480
I was told you're working
as an official here,

144
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,000
so I came to pay you a visit.

145
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,160
But I didn't expect

146
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,920
that the entire Western Capital knew

147
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,640
that in order to please the evil Taoist,

148
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,440
you chose
to be his nephew's entertainer.

149
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,320
I must have been blind

150
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,880
that among all the good men,

151
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,120
I made you, the pen of a businessman,

152
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,440
the Third Graduate.

153
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,520
Master, please let me explain.

154
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,080
I had no other choice.

155
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,480
I've been studying since little.

156
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,720
I never support the supernatural.

157
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,840
But now, I'm ordered by His Majesty

158
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,320
to find Taoist Baoyi.

159
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,000
If I fail to complete this mission,

160
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,800
I'll let His Majesty down.

161
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,040
You asked for this mission, didn't you?

162
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,680
I didn't!

163
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,240
Empress Liu framed me up.

164
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,400
I was engaged to Consort Gao's niece.

165
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,640
Empress Liu never gets on well
with Consort Gao.

166
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,040
She then had someone disguised
as Consort Gao's follower

167
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,040
and summoned me when I was waiting

168
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,760
to see His Majesty.

169
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,040
They even asked me to praise Taoism

170
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,320
in front of His Majesty.

171
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,760
I was so ignorant that I was deceived.

172
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,880
Then I mistakenly became
the Taoist Temple Administrator.

173
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,640
Later, the Gao Family found me
a disgrace

174
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,080
and forced me to annul the engagement.

175
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
Just because I hesitated for a second,

176
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,960
they kept humiliating me.

177
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,120
After I came to the Western Capital,

178
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,280
local officials gave me
a chilly reception

179
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,760
and made things difficult for me

180
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,800
for fear of the powerful Gao Family.

181
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,440
Consequently, I was so down-and-out

182
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,320
that I had to live
in a dilapidated temple.

183
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,480
In the end, after I was badly beaten up,

184
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,520
I annulled the engagement.

185
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,360
The more they humiliate me,

186
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,560
the less I want to give in.

187
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,560
Stop.

188
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,360
You're just trying to tell me

189
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,880
that you have no choice but to do this.

190
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,360
But Ouyang Xu,

191
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,480
do you remember what I told you

192
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,480
at Luming Banquet?

193
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,640
The gentry can die,

194
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,560
but they can't be humiliated.

195
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,800
You must always have self-esteem!

196
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,360
This is the foundation
to behave yourself!

197
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,760
Now, you can flatter a civilian

198
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,000
just to return
to the Eastern Capital early.

199
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,600
Then will you be another Xiao Qinyan

200
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,960
just to get promoted?

201
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,920
When white paper is stained with ink,

202
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,800
it can no longer be clean.

203
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,240
Don't you understand this?

204
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,680
I certainly understand.

205
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,000
I always remember to have self-esteem.

206
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,040
But Master...

207
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,880
Stop. Say no more.

208
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,680
I'm banished, too.

209
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,240
I'm in no position to criticize you.

210
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,240
You just complained about your poverty.

211
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,720
I'll then return to you

212
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,880
what you used to give me.

213
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,240
This will put an end
to our relationship.

214
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,760
From this day on,

215
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,040
do not tell anyone

216
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,560
that you're my student.

217
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:44,960
Master.

218
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,960
Master!

219
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,760
(Chief Military Inspector
of Ningbian Army)

220
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,840
(was from Dengzhou.)

221
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,560
(In the first year of Jingde reign,
he garrisoned Dongguang County.)

222
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,680
(During the peace negotiations
between two nations,)

223
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,960
(generals of both sides were ordered
to stay in town with the gates closed.)

224
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,800
(Zhao Qian disobeyed the order
and was impeached by censors.)

225
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,800
(He explained that Northern soldiers
robbed villagers outside the county.)

226
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,360
(He couldn't bear it
and open the door to get out.)

227
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,720
(Later, he was flogged 15 times
and exiled 1,500 kilometers away.)

228
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,880
(His wife Ms. Cao and his daughter)

229
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,280
(became official maid-servants.)

230
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,280
So, in your teahouse that day,

231
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,800
when I said I was
from the Capital Security Office,

232
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,320
you suddenly changed
your attitude towards me.

233
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,800
Just because people of your department

234
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,840
arrested my father,

235
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,760
I then became a pariah singing performer

236
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,560
that everybody looked down on.

237
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,040
Before I became
an official maid-servant,

238
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,320
I once stayed in prison.

239
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,240
I applied medicine to many prisoners.

240
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,680
Later as a singing performer
in the Music Bureau,

241
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,760
I often took a beating and got hurt.

242
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,640
Commandant Chen.

243
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,040
You're no longer a child.

244
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,240
Why are you still so naughty?

245
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,520
How childish!

246
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,280
You... You can see me?

247
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,760
You're not a ghost.

248
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,760
And I'm not blind.

249
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,840
Why can't I see you?

250
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,960
But...

251
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,080
But you can't recognize anyone

252
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,840
a little bit away from you.

253
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,800
I did.

254
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,840
But I got a folk prescription

255
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,640
and I've recovered.

256
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,200
Sun's Cloth Shop, right?

257
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,880
What a magic prescription!

258
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,120
But what are you doing here?

259
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,680
Don't you know
the teahouse is closed this afternoon?

260
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,240
I do.

261
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,440
I came to do Ms. Sun a little favor.

262
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,840
Excuse me.

263
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,360
Ms. Sun?

264
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,520
Ms. Zhao.

265
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,560
Mr. Du.

266
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,840
Welcome.

267
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,160
This way, please.

268
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,760
What's this?

269
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,080
Commandant Chen gave it to me.

270
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,640
I don't want it. Too pedantic.

271
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,720
Enjoy some pastries.

272
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,960
Thank you. Thank you.

273
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,480
Have some tea.

274
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,120
Thank you.

275
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,840
Thank you.

276
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,880
This is the deed.

277
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,560
All right.

278
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,600
Let me check.

279
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,560
You can read deeds?

280
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,360
Yes.

281
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,880
I also teach the course of law
in our academy.

282
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,920
I'm very familiar

283
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,880
with laws and deeds.

284
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,800
Mr. Zhu told me

285
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,600
that you wanted a house agent

286
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,280
to check the deed for you.

287
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,360
They can't be as professional as me.

288
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,520
Wait.

289
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,120
Deed?

290
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,160
Pan'er, Sanniang,

291
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,760
have you found a new restaurant to buy?

292
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,440
Not a new one,

293
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,640
but Wangyue Restaurant.

294
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,080
Its owner is in urgent need of money

295
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,360
and promised to sell half of it to me.

296
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,040
Then the original west building

297
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,760
will still serve for wine-making.

298
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,880
And the east building with private rooms

299
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,880
will be sold to us as an inn.

300
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,240
I've thought about it.

301
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,800
In this way, we won't be restrained
by the restaurant guild

302
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,480
and can save a lot of money.

303
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,200
Thus I agreed to buy it.

304
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,000
But the deed is
a little bit complicated.

305
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,310
So, I wanted someone to check it.

306
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,720
You made the right decision.

307
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,830
Can you really check it?

308
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,720
I'm at least the Presented Scholar.

309
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,560
Review the deed very carefully

310
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,200
and don't let anything go wrong.

311
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,880
All right.

312
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,590
It's dark here.

313
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,760
Go review it somewhere brighter.

314
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,800
No, no. Don't bother.

315
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,440
Since I ate your pork liver,

316
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,040
my eyesight has been improving.

317
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,760
What are you talking about?

318
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,040
My pork liver?

319
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,960
Sorry, just a slip of the tongue.

320
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,320
How do you like the honeydew melon?

321
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,400
Just so-so.

322
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,320
A relative of mine gave it to me.

323
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,880
Since you're from the South,

324
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,160
I'm sure you'll like it.

325
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,880
Stop this.

326
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,360
Say no more about the melon.

327
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,200
Just get to the business.

328
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,520
All right, all right.

329
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,400
Umm...

330
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,760
First, the paper is not right.

331
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,160
In the Eastern Capital,
official paper is needed

332
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,000
for homestead deeds.

333
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,640
Or it won't be approved
by the government.

334
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,680
This is merely the draft.

335
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,160
If you find any mistake,

336
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,600
you can modify it directly.

337
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,720
All right.

338
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,680
Pan'er is right.

339
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,840
You can just modify it.

340
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,400
Sure.

341
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,960
I'm... I'm totally clueless.

342
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,720
I just have one question.

343
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,560
Is this "Irrevocable Book"?

344
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,200
"Irrevocable Sale", actually.

345
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,320
Check it out, then.

346
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,280
Would you like some tea first?

347
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,320
Take your time. Here.

348
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,040
Thank you. Thank you.

349
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Today, it's too hot out there.

350
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,520
Pan'er made the tea.

351
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,120
Tea in your teahouse tastes the best.

352
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,160
I made some new pastries.

353
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,120
Which one do you think looks the best?

354
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,880
This one.

355
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,520
You made this?

356
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,160
Peach Blossom Cake.

357
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,760
You made all the pastries?

358
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,960
It's my favorite, too.

359
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,440
I have something to tell Pan'er.

360
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,040
Go ahead.

361
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,720
Review the deed first.
Enjoy the pastries later.

362
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,040
It's sometimes sunny
and sometimes rainy.

363
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,840
It's sometimes cool and sometimes hot.

364
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,920
I didn't expect

365
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,600
the local weather to be so unpleasant.

366
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,800
It'll be hot for at least four months.

367
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,080
How's Gu Qianfan doing lately?

368
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,040
I haven't heard from him for days.

369
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,360
Please take this Healing Drink to him.

370
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,480
All right.

371
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,840
Lately,

372
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,440
Chief has been as busy as a bee.

373
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,520
He just took office, after all.

374
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,360
Lei Jing's henchmen

375
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,520
will trouble him for quite a while.

376
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,960
And the Ministry of Personnel, the Court
of Judicial Review, and Kaifeng Prefecture...

377
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,840
A lot of cases.

378
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,400
He's been visiting Six Ministries

379
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,960
and hasn't even been home for two days.

380
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,200
But Pan'er, don't worry.

381
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,680
Chief is

382
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,360
very energetic.

383
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
When he criticizes someone,

384
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,840
he gets louder and louder.

385
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,520
I'm glad to hear that.

386
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,760
I planned to tell him something.

387
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,320
But now that he's so busy,

388
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,760
I wonder when I can meet him.

389
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,840
Tell him what?

390
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,520
If it's just some legwork,

391
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,560
I can do it for you,

392
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,880
as the best subordinate
of Commissioner Gu.

393
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,800
But if you want to say honeyed words,

394
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,680
sorry, but I'm too young to help you.

395
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,200
You...

396
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,520
Tell him I want to open a restaurant

397
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,040
and I don't have enough money.
Ask him to lend me some.

398
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,720
All right.

399
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,720
Rest assured. When you give an order,

400
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,000
Commissioner Gu will follow it.

401
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,600
Off you go.

402
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,120
Pan'er.

403
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,800
According to Changfeng,

404
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,840
there's something improper

405
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,680
with the deed.

406
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,880
Wait. I'll be right there.

407
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,760
Sanniang, I should go.

408
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,040
Pan'er.

409
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,960
Here, here, and here.

410
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,560
Mr. Du, please enlighten us.

411
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,800
Ms. Zhao, here's the thing.

412
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,320
Half of Wangyue Restaurant
will be sold for 1,200 strings.

413
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,240
It's a pretty good deal.

414
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,400
But the down payment is 50%

415
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,120
and the rest will be paid
within five days.

416
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,320
It's a little bit risky.

417
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,120
It's not a small sum of money,
after all.

418
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,360
You'd better play safe.

419
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,800
According to guild regulations,

420
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,320
the down payment is 30%

421
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,520
and the rest will be paid
within a month.

422
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,840
I negotiated with the owner
of Wangyue Restaurant,

423
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,840
but he wouldn't concede at all.

424
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,760
So, this is the final bargain.

425
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,880
But you know, if he wants to trick me,

426
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,920
I'm not scared, anyway.

427
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,560
Yeah.

428
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,040
If he dares to deceive us,

429
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,080
no matter how far he runs away,

430
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,560
he'll be arrested by guards
of the Capital Security Office.

431
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,600
Fine, fine.

432
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,160
Nothing else is wrong with this deed.

433
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,400
I've modified some improper items.

434
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,120
Thank you.

435
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,800
No offense,

436
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,640
but this isn't a small sum of money.

437
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
You've just managed the teahouse

438
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,120
in the Eastern Capital for a few months.

439
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,800
Can you afford so much money?

440
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,560
Who do you think we are?
The Goddesses of Wealth?

441
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,680
The money we have

442
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,200
including the value of this teahouse

443
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,240
can only be 700 strings at most.

444
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,680
Pan'er's future husband

445
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,720
will pay the rest of the money.

446
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,920
Future husband?

447
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,840
Congratulations, Ms. Zhao.

448
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,080
Don't say that.

449
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,760
Thanks to you, after all.

450
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,560
If you hadn't

451
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,720
come to the inn where we lived

452
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,200
and forced Pan'er
to be Ouyang Xu's concubine,

453
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,600
she wouldn't have been a mandated lady.

454
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,120
A mandated lady?

455
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,640
Is your husband...?

456
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,040
An official of the fifth rank.

457
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,680
Higher than Ouyang Xu's eighth rank.

458
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,080
Right.

459
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,840
You must be jealous.

460
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,200
What?

461
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,720
Why do you give this look?

462
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,360
I compared him to Ouyang Xu,

463
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,440
not you.

464
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,360
Ouyang Xu is your friend.

465
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,240
Pan'er is my friend.

466
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,360
After she becomes a mandated lady,

467
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,560
will I feel embarrassed

468
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,080
when people praise her in front of me?

469
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:45,840
You won't. You won't.

470
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,120
You always think too much.

471
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,280
That's why

472
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,680
you made a fool of yourself
in front of His Majesty.

473
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,600
Look.

474
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,840
Your poor eyesight has been cured.

475
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,920
Why are you still slouching?

476
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,760
Look at your robe.

477
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,760
It's old and it creases.

478
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,040
You don't look like an official at all.

479
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,240
What's your ranking?

480
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,920
No... No ranking.

481
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,600
No ranking?

482
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,840
Forget it. It's all right.

483
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,040
You will have it.

484
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,440
I believe in the future,

485
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,960
you will be a real official.

486
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,680
I hope so.

487
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,280
I'll take my leave. See you.

488
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,080
Wait a second.

489
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,320
Pan'er kept some pastries for you.

490
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,000
I made them.

491
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,720
You... You're being too polite.

492
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,720
Wait.

493
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,640
Take the umbrella.

494
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,400
These days, the weather changes quickly.

495
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,120
Take the umbrella
for either sunlight or rain.

496
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,520
Thanks.

497
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,960
San... Ms. Sun.

498
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,160
What?

499
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,600
I did you a little favor, right?

500
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,160
What?

501
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,680
Pan'er gave you the pastries.

502
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,520
Aren't they enough?

503
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,080
Yes, they are.

504
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,000
Quite enough.

505
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,040
I mean...

506
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
Could you do me a favor, too?

507
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,680
Didn't you just say

508
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,520
that my robe was old and it creased?

509
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,080
I couldn't do anything about it.

510
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,680
My mother died when I was little.

511
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,600
And I don't have a wife.

512
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,120
So, I buy clothes, hats, and shoes

513
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,080
very casually.

514
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,640
I'm... I'm thinking...

515
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,520
What you said quite enlightened me.

516
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,840
I do need some new clothes

517
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,320
to make myself look fresh.

518
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,800
But I...

519
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,600
I know nothing
about fabrics or tailoring.

520
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,880
Are you asking me

521
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,520
to make a new robe for you?

522
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,160
No, no. I didn't mean that.

523
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,840
I mean...

524
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,760
Could you go
to the clothing store with me

525
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,920
to pick some ready-made clothes for me?

526
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,040
I have poor eyesight, you know.

527
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,760
I have to raise my glasses.

528
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,440
It's not very convenient.

529
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,280
Don't you fool me!

530
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,000
You're at least a Presented Scholar.

531
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,400
Even if you don't have a wife,

532
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,240
you...

533
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,200
You should at least have maids
or women servants.

534
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,960
They can prepare clothes for you.

535
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,160
I only have male servants.

536
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,800
Not to mention female servants,

537
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,720
I don't even have a hen.

538
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,200
It looks that you are not busy today.

539
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,520
Shall we go right now?

540
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,080
How about tomorrow?

541
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,640
I'll help with the money thing later.

542
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,880
Fine. It's a deal then.
We'll go tomorrow.

543
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,000
See you tomorrow.

544
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,680
The same place. Be there...

545
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,640
Don't stand me up.

546
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,880
He used to be half-blind.

547
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,840
Now, he's dumb.

548
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,880
I've brought Pan'er's message to you.

549
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,200
I'll give you the Healing Drink.

550
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,680
And you give me the money.

551
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,160
Chief.

552
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,480
What's wrong, Chief?

553
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,240
You have serious dark circles.

554
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,320
Did you not sleep well last night?

555
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,920
Don't let Pan'er

556
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,880
see you like this.

557
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,200
Or she'll feel sorry for you.

558
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,320
How much money does she need?

559
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,040
She didn't say that.

560
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,200
You decide.

561
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,840
I'm sure she's too shy

562
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,920
to tell you an exact number.

563
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,280
But the half of Wangyue Restaurant

564
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,680
can be worth at least 1,500 strings.

565
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,400
I only have 200 strings with me.

566
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,640
Here. Take my official seal

567
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,560
and withdraw the money
from the storehouse back there.

568
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,800
I'll take care of the rest.

569
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,120
All right. I'll get it done after work.

570
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,600
By the way, Chief,

571
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,680
Pan'er didn't say this.

572
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,640
But I want to ask on behalf of her.

573
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,280
When will you be free?

574
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,240
Go visit her.

575
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,280
She really misses you.

576
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,400
You can't make her...

577
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,080
I mean, you can't make your wife

578
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,240
prepare the wedding alone.

579
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,600
She's immersed in the restaurant thing.

580
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,160
I don't think she has time
for the wedding.

581
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,880
That makes sense.

582
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,840
Pan'er is born

583
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,320
to be a capable businesswoman.

584
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,600
Maybe after your wedding,

585
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,520
she'll be even busier than you.

586
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,640
Commissioner.

587
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,520
His Majesty asked to see you.

588
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,160
Get me a horse.

589
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,680
Aye.

590
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,440
Northern envoys are coming
to the Eastern Capital.

591
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,280
Yelyu Zongsheng, Commandery Prince
of Changshan takes the lead.

592
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,120
The Northern Emperor doesn't have a son.

593
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,120
His brothers died young, too.

594
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,400
Zongsheng is the Emperor's nephew,

595
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,680
but he's the closest to the throne.

596
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,800
I heard he's rather shrewd.

597
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,880
So, Lei Jing, I want to make you
the Courier-envoy

598
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,360
of the Diplomacy Office temporarily.

599
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,720
Aye, Your Majesty.

600
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,040
Gu Qianfan, you assist him.

601
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,240
Aye, Your Majesty.

602
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,960
Zongsheng is a master of pen and sword.

603
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,960
Qianfan, you'll get along with him.

604
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,000
When you receive him,

605
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,200
don't give yourself away.

606
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,840
Let him go anywhere he wants,

607
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,960
except confidential places.

608
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,320
Most importantly,

609
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,040
observe his character and hobbies.

610
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,320
I won't let you down, Your Majesty.

611
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:13,840
Good.

612
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,960
What's wrong, Qianfan?

613
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,400
You look unhappy.

614
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,440
I didn't recommend you to His Majesty.

615
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,320
Her Majesty heard

616
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
that you saved Minister Xiao

617
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,520
and remembered how you helped her

618
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,240
in the painting case.

619
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,800
She then asked His Majesty

620
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,680
to send you on this mission.

621
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,200
Hope you'll understand.

622
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,240
I'm grateful to His and Her Majesties.

623
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,840
I'm not unhappy.

624
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,840
Instead, I feel relieved
now that I can stay away

625
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,200
from the trouble in the capital.

626
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,000
Qianfan,

627
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,800
are you avoiding someone lately?

628
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,480
No.

629
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,320
I've got business to do. I should go.

630
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,720
Tomorrow, I'll come to assist you.

631
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,160
Commissioner.

632
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,920
Tell your master
that I completed the mission.

633
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,640
Aye.

634
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,520
Only 200 strings?

635
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,560
Yeah.

636
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,120
Chief doesn't have
so much cash for the moment.

637
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,360
But he said he'd take care of it later.

638
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,200
Pan'er, don't worry.

639
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,440
Lately, Chief has to accompany
the Northern Envoys.

640
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,480
It's a national mission

641
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,600
so he isn't free to move.

642
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,400
But when he has time, he'll visit you.

643
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,440
All right. Thank you.

644
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,760
My pleasure.

645
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,880
I'll take my leave, then.

646
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,600
See you.

647
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,760
Pan'er, why didn't I see Zhaodi?

648
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,800
She's out for...

649
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,160
She went to the Zheng's Store
to buy some lamp oil.

650
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,000
Why do you ask?

651
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,880
Nothing. Nothing.

652
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,600
I should go.

653
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,440
Nothing?

654
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,160
Nothing.

655
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,480
Then why are you leaving so fast?

656
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,920
Watch your steps.

657
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,040
I've kept pastries
for you in the kitchen.

658
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,840
No, thanks, Sanniang.

659
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,640
Be careful.

660
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,800
I was freaked out.

661
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,000
I thought Gu Qianfan would only
give us 200 strings.

662
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,000
How is that possible?

663
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,280
He knew

664
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,720
we only made 300 strings
in the past few months

665
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,760
and 30% of the profits
belonged to Yinzhang.

666
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,240
If Gu Qianfan hadn't asked me

667
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,840
to open a big restaurant

668
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,880
and not to worry about money,

669
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,640
I wouldn't have dared to buy
Wangyue Restaurant.

670
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,200
Look at you.

671
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,960
On your face,
I can nearly see several words.

672
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,640
"My husband is so great."

673
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,080
He said he would
solve the money problem later.

674
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,720
We don't know when exactly he will.

675
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,280
I can't help worrying about it.

676
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,400
Don't worry.

677
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,160
The deed for Wangyue Restaurant
is still being drawn up.

678
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,320
Qianfan will give us the money in time.

679
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,400
Hope so.

680
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,640
Don't blame me
for worrying about the money.

681
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,000
It's not that I don't trust your man.

682
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,400
But 1, 200 strings, come on.

683
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,080
I haven't seen so much money before.

684
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,840
I used to daydream

685
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,760
that if my son succeeded some day

686
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,880
and gave me 500 strings,

687
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,800
I would die without any regret.

688
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,160
Unexpectedly, in merely half a year,

689
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,280
we can buy a restaurant
in the Eastern Capital

690
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,920
that is worth over a thousand strings.

691
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,800
If our restaurant is worth
ten thousand strings someday,

692
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,240
will you be overjoyed?

693
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,200
I will, of course.

694
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,440
Put the money away.

695
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,280
It's a good bargain.

696
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,280
For two robes,

697
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,560
the shopkeeper charged 1, 400 coins.

698
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,440
I then picked two scarves
and two pairs of shoes

699
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,320
for a rounded value.

700
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,480
1,400... Oh, 1,500 coins.

701
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,760
The shopkeeper nearly cried.

702
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,880
You paid for this,
but I still had to be economical.

703
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,080
You're quite thrifty.

704
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,000
There are brochures for clothes.

705
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,600
You no longer need to come here later.

706
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,840
Before a new season,
send your servant there to order.

707
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,320
Everything will be prepared

708
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,720
and sent to your house.

709
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,480
It can save you a lot of trouble.

710
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,480
It's no trouble.

711
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,640
I'm reassured
when you pick clothes for me.

712
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,120
After the restaurant is open
for business,

713
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,640
I'm afraid I'll be way too busy.

714
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,120
I won't have time for you, then.

715
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,520
I'll wait for you.

716
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,360
As long as you want to hang out with me,

717
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,120
I'll always be waiting.

718
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,760
Don't talk nonsense.

719
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,720
Or people will misunderstand you.

720
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,120
This isn't nonsense.

721
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,240
I really mean that.

722
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,960
He just likes you.

723
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,680
Why do you feel anxious and guilty?

724
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,320
A bowl of water, please.

725
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,880
I... I'd like a bowl of water, too.

726
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,520
All right.

727
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,720
(Litchi Drink, Iced Bean Soup)
Litchi Drink for her.

728
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,960
Iced Bean Soup for me.

729
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,640
All right.

730
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,920
Last time, you said

731
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,960
you love litchis.

732
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,640
Were you really not married before?

733
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,360
Then why are you so familiar

734
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,800
with these romantic tricks?

735
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,760
Did you deceive me?

736
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,840
No, no, no. I didn't.

737
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,710
I didn't deceive you.

738
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,560
I don't know if I was literally married.

739
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,760
Look, I'm already in my thirties.

740
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,800
And I don't look very ugly.

741
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,320
If I told you no one ever
proposed marriage to me,

742
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,320
you would not believe that.

743
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,520
Actually, I had a betrothal.

744
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,150
It was finalized.

745
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,710
But half a month before the wedding,

746
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,320
that girl suddenly fell sick and died.

747
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,120
People say I'm a jinx to my wife.

748
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,880
So I've been living alone until now.

749
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,560
In life, there's always trouble.

750
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,710
I was divorced, too.

751
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,760
You have trouble and so do I.

752
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,040
Everyone has trouble.

753
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,760
That's right. Everyone has trouble.

754
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,400
So, we make a good couple.

755
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,520
I mean we're alike.

756
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,680
Don't talk nonsense.

757
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,960
Drink slowly. Be careful.

758
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,000
Actually, I secretly asked Zhaodi

759
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,400
about what happened to you.

760
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,360
You...

761
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:23,840
You...

762
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,240
We're not inexperienced youth in love.

763
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,680
I believe

764
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,760
you know my feelings for you.

765
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,200
But don't worry.

766
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,960
I'm patient.

767
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,200
When the restaurant thing

768
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,480
is settled,

769
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,600
we can then discuss our relationship.

770
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,280
Keep on dreaming.

771
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,080
I won't discuss it with you.

772
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,520
Sir, money for the drink.

773
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,800
No, no, no.

774
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,480
I don't want your money.

775
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,360
Wait, hold on.

776
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,200
It's just a cup of beverage.

777
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,000
Here's the money.

778
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,880
Sanniang.

779
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,560
Sanniang, wait for me.

780
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,400
I just wanted to buy you a beverage.

781
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,720
Don't run so fast.

782
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,080
Take the money.

783
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,040
I don't want it.

784
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,640
I don't need you to pay for me.

785
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,720
You, you...

786
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,960
Excuse me, is this the Osmanthus Lane?

787
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,600
Yes.

788
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,520
Sir, who lives in these two houses?

789
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,240
Zhaodi,

790
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,640
you said you love clay sculptures.

791
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,360
I bought one.

792
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,760
Yuan Yuchang made it.
[*A famous sculptor]

793
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,760
Do you like it?

794
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,640
It took me a lot of trouble.

795
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,560
I finally got you.

796
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,680
I'll see if you dare to run away again.

797
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,680
Let go of me!

798
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,400
You lied to me.

799
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,360
How dare you do that!

800
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,440
How dare you dodge!

801
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,440
Let go of me!

802
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,000
Stop!

803
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,800
- How dare you lie to me!
- Let go of me!

804
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,760
How dare you lie to me!

805
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,840
- Let go of me!
- Stop.

806
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,280
Who are you? Why do you beat her?

807
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:54,960
I'm her mother.

808
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,000
Thank you for showing me the way.

809
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,760
But mind your own business!

810
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,240
You... Keep running.

811
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,400
- I'll see how far you can run.
- What do you want?

812
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,360
It's Zhaodi's mother.

813
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,600
I'll go have a look.

814
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,200
How dare you lie to me!

815
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,240
After I inquired everywhere,

816
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,640
I found out where you lived.

817
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,480
- Let go of me!
- Stop.

818
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,720
Chen Lian,

819
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,200
you directed her to me?

820
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,400
I didn't.

821
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,000
She's your mother.

822
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,160
Just make everything clear.

823
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,680
Mother and daughter aren't enemies.

824
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,160
How many times have I told you

825
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,760
that all my family members are dead?

826
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,040
Don't you interfere with my business!

827
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,000
What are you talking about?

828
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,160
How dare you curse me?

829
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,240
I'll kill you.

830
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,120
- Stop there!
- Stop.

831
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,200
Zhaodi.

832
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,280
Are you all right?

833
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,240
Be reasonable.

834
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,280
She's your mother, after all.

835
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,560
Why should I be reasonable?

836
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,600
Who allowed you to interfere?

837
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,720
Get lost!

838
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,120
Why did you smash the clay sculpture?

839
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,920
I visited three markets to buy this.

840
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,200
Why must I like

841
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,120
whatever you bought?

842
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,280
Why can you interfere

843
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,160
with anything you think is right?

844
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Who do you think you are?

845
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,240
All right.

846
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,920
I swear if I say one more word with you,

847
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,360
I'm no human being!

848
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,960
No one can help you now, right?

849
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,760
Let go of me!

850
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,480
Go with me.

851
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,600
How... How dare you kick me!

852
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,400
Are you out of your mind?

853
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,120
How ungrateful you are!

854
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,280
What are you doing? Let go of me!

855
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,040
I got you.

856
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,160
How dare you! Get up.

857
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,600
Trying to run away after smashing
Ma'am's jade sculpture?

858
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,480
What jade sculpture?

859
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,960
Still playing innocent?

860
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,000
Who are you?

861
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,760
What are you doing?

862
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,160
I'm her mother.

863
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:24,920
Her mother?

864
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,840
Good. Come. Compensate together.

865
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,480
Go!

866
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,720
What... What are you doing?

867
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,360
Go!

868
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,880
I got them.

869
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,200
Take them to the backyard

870
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,760
and flog them twenty times.

871
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,720
All right.

872
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,800
Stay here.

873
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,440
Go. You'll be flogged.

874
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,160
Go.

875
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,160
You're her mother?

876
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,920
Then you pay the compensation.

877
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,680
As long as I get the money,

878
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,000
I don't have to kill her.

879
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,000
Stop!

880
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,000
The jade sculpture is a gift
from Young Master Gu.

881
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,320
It's priceless.

882
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,280
If you...

883
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,680
You don't look like a rich woman.

884
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,240
Pay 50 strings, then.

885
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,760
50 strings?

886
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,760
I don't have them. Don't rip me off.

887
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,040
I rip you off?

888
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,440
Calm down, Ma'am.

889
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,360
Don't let her get to you.

890
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,480
If she dares to cheat,

891
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,040
I'll throw her into the well
of our backyard

892
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,120
and leave her there the whole night

893
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,360
before putting her in prison
tomorrow morning.

894
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,600
Where do you think you are?

895
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,480
How dare you yell harshly!

896
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,200
The head of this place

897
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,680
is Ms. Song of the Music Division.

898
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,840
Even ministers show respect to her.

899
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,040
Who do you think you are?

900
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,080
I'm not good at talking.

901
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,800
Please spare my life, Ma'am.

902
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:45,920
When her father

903
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,120
married her to Qi Daxian
in the neighboring village,

904
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,280
the bride-price was only ten strings.

905
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,040
Even if you sell my whole family,

906
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,960
we can't afford 50 strings.

907
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,640
What a bad daughter!

908
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,320
She refused to get married

909
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,440
and even ran away from home.

910
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,080
I came here just to get her back.

911
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,520
Now she even made such big trouble.

912
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,520
I don't care. I just want the money.

913
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,280
Sanniang.

914
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,320
Go. Enjoy the cool in the well water.

915
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,480
Don't. Don't.

916
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,160
Shall I sell my daughter to you?

917
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,360
You don't need to pay.
Just write a maid contract.

918
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,400
Make her your maid.

919
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,880
She's young,

920
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,360
but she's pretty.

921
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,840
After she receives guests for years,

922
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,840
you'll make

923
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,440
more than 50 strings out of her.

924
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,360
What kind of mother you are!

925
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,040
I don't want her.

926
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,760
Keep her with you.

927
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,840
I don't want her at all.

928
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,800
Let's go write the indenture.

929
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,320
Go.

930
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,200
Go!

931
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,620
(Indenture)

932
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,120
I don't need money for selling her.

933
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,800
But I spent a lot of money
on the journey.

934
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,320
May I have some money, Ma'am?

935
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,320
Or if her husband comes to make trouble,

936
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,920
you'll be annoyed, too, right?

937
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,160
How much money do you want?

938
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,360
Five strings.

939
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,160
Deal. Five strings.

940
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,120
Get the money and you will
have nothing to do with your daughter.

941
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,160
But we don't have coins here.

942
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,480
Sanniang, take her to Young Master Chi.

943
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,080
Chi what?

944
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,400
Our master.

945
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,600
Young Master Chi,
Head of 12 Guilds in the Eastern Capital.

946
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,360
Fine. Let me take you to him.

947
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,280
Go.

948
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,560
She's sick?

949
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,120
Then ask her to see a doctor.

950
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,080
I can do nothing about it.

951
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,360
Young Master,

952
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,240
Haohao is already conceding.

953
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,280
Just make it up with her.

954
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,400
A man's dignity matters most.

955
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,240
Don't you understand?

956
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,360
She deserves it. She threw away my bird!

957
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,240
If she didn't come to beg me

958
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,200
and cry to admit her mistake,

959
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,600
I would never talk to her again!

960
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,320
All right.

961
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,480
See, this is Young Master Chi's mansion.

962
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,320
Get in there with this letter

963
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,280
and he'll give you
the rest of the money.

964
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,600
Maybe he will even give you a tip.

965
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,160
