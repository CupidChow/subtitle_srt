I'm not dreaming, am I?

Sure.

(Zhao Pan'er Ge Zhaodi
Song Yinzhang Sun Sanniang)

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,440
Mr. Du, please.

25
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,000
OK.

26
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,630
Well, the contract is in duplicate.

27
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,880
Keep the copies safe respectively.

28
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,760
The receipt of the first
600 strings of coins...

29
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,360
Yeah, it's here.

30
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,360
Well, the receipt of the 600 strings,

31
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,640
you should keep it safe, too.

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,920
The remaining 600 strings

33
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,320
shall be paid when the deal is settled

34
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,200
after seven days.

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,560
Then the owner of
the restaurant will officially change.

36
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,720
- Thanks, Mr. Du.
- Thanks, Mr. Du.

37
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,800
Thanks, Mr. Du.

38
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,000
You're welcome.

39
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,520
What's wrong with you?

40
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,360
Brother,

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,000
I finally get a chance to talk with you.

42
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,160
Don't call me brother.

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,120
Did you drown your worries in drinks
because you suffered a setback

44
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,760
in marrying Zhao Pan'er?

45
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,840
As the commissioner
of the Capital Security Office,

46
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,440
you violated the regulations
and got drunk.

47
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,520
Aren't you afraid of being punished?

48
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,240
How did you know
something happened between us?

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,760
Of course I know.

50
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,720
I was the one who found out

51
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,200
her family history.

52
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,400
She's really a poor thing.

53
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,760
As the daughter of an official,

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,040
how come she reduced to

55
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,120
an official performer?

56
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,920
It was because of her father,

57
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,280
the Chief Military Inspector
of Ningbian Army, Zhao Qian,

58
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,600
dispatched troops to save people
without authorization

59
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,160
while the imperial court was
negotiating peace over a decade ago.

60
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,400
He then was impeached
and sentenced to a felony.

61
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,960
His wife and daughter were implicated.

62
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,960
But who was the speech official
that impeached him?

63
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,480
Our father,

64
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,360
the Secretary in the Council
at that time.

65
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,480
Loving the people and being adept
with both the pen and the sword,

66
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,640
Zhao Qian was a good official.

67
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,640
It was really unjust
that he died in exile.

68
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,160
But you can't blame
Minister Duke Xiao.

69
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,830
After all, Zhao Qian resisted
the imperial edict first,

70
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,080
which almost ruined the peace plan.

71
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,720
Our father impeached him
according to the law.

72
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,320
He did his job.

73
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,920
Only it's too bad for my big brother.

74
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,880
Your future father-in-law
was killed by your own father.

75
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,400
With such a blood feud,

76
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,240
how can you still get married?

77
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,800
You want to hit me?

78
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,720
Let go of me.

79
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,880
I'll tell you something interesting.

80
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,840
Do you know who had
Zhao Qian's personnel file

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,680
put on your table?

82
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,440
It wasn't me.

83
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,160
It was our father.

84
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,720
Have you checked her?

85
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,080
As a father, it's normal that
I rush about hundreds of miles

86
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,560
for my son.

87
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,480
But if my son does the same thing
for a woman,

88
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,560
I must check her out.

89
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,320
Otherwise,

90
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,240
I must be a fool.

91
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,000
She saved my life.

92
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,000
Take your father's advice.

93
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,480
Though the woman

94
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,960
has dropped her pariah status,

95
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,320
she isn't a good match for you.

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,800
Commissioner Gu,

97
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,440
do you know how miserable
you are now?

98
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,440
How could you be so stupid?

99
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,640
You think he will let you
marry Zhao Pan'er?

100
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,120
He never did

101
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,560
and never shall.

102
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,360
According to him,

103
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,880
no matter you, me

104
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,640
or his relatives,

105
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,000
we are all his tools used to
fight for power.

106
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,040
How could he allow you
to marry a businesswoman,

107
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,440
a former official performer
who has a blood feud with him?

108
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,840
Don't ever speak of her in that way.

109
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,280
Fine. Forget about her.

110
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,480
Let's talk about our father.

111
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,520
I just told him what I found out.

112
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,200
If he really wanted to help you,

113
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,400
he would have erased the traces

114
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,680
of the matter for good.

115
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,000
He wouldn't have let you know

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,280
or made things difficult for you.

117
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,880
But, no.

118
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,320
He just pretended that
nothing had happened.

119
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,920
Maintaining his composure,

120
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,040
he had the file put in front of you.

121
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,520
As a prig,

122
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,160
how can you face Zhao Pan'er
after knowing that?

123
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,640
I'm getting married soon.

124
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
I'm going to marry

125
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,440
Zhao Pan'er, the woman who

126
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,200
came to the Eastern Capital
from Qiantang with me.

127
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,160
No way.

128
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,080
I remember
she was a singing performer.

129
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,400
How could she deserve you?

130
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,240
She surely deserves me.

131
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,040
The son of a treacherous official
and a former singing performer

132
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,120
make a good match.

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Qianfan.

134
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,960
It isn't just a fling.

135
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,200
Maybe you think

136
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,600
she is just a lowly businesswoman.

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,080
But deep down in my heart,

138
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,840
she is a unique treasure.

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,120
In the dark life I've been living
for over ten years,

140
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,840
she is my only hope

141
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,760
and only light.

142
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,640
So,

143
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,320
please show mercy.

144
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,080
Don't use your covert tricks

145
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,360
to separate us.

146
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,120
Fine. Fine.

147
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,480
Make your decision.

148
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,360
Make your own decision, all right?

149
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,000
So you'll definitely leave her

150
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,400
and sink into sadness.

151
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,520
When you're weak and sad,

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,200
as a loving father,

153
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,800
he'll show up every now and then,

154
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
and comfort you a little.

155
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,240
Like a drowning man

156
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,640
holds on to a plank of drift wood,

157
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,040
you won't do without him.

158
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,800
You'll become his most capable son.

159
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,440
You won't resist him again.

160
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,000
You'll help him to
consolidate his position

161
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,360
as the Grand Secretary.

162
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,640
That's our father,

163
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,080
who is circumspect
and plans very carefully.

164
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,480
Why did you tell me these?

165
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,960
Because I'm jealous of you.

166
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,000
I hate you.

167
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,280
My surname is Xiao.

168
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,040
I'm the eldest son of his wife.

169
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,000
But in his opinion,

170
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,640
only you deserve to be his son.

171
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,200
I tried to sow discord between you.

172
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,080
So what?

173
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,520
You think he has feelings?

174
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,120
No,

175
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,040
he uses everything he's got

176
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,440
and manipulates everyone.

177
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,120
(Your future father-in-law
was killed by your own father.)

178
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,560
(With such a blood feud,)

179
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,440
(how can you still get married?)

180
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,240
(How could you be so stupid?)

181
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,240
(You think he will let you
marry Zhao Pan'er?)

182
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,480
(He never did)

183
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,080
(and never shall.)

184
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,560
(You think he has feelings?)

185
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,000
(No, he uses everything he's got)

186
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,440
(and manipulates everyone.)

187
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,760
(I had a nightmare again.)

188
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,960
(Are you in danger?)

189
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,760
(You must turn ill luck into good.)

190
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,160
(I need to discuss with you)

191
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,680
(about the name of my new restaurant.)

192
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,520
(Buddha bless you.)

193
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,680
(The Three Manifestations bless you.)

194
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,040
(The God of Earth bless you.)

195
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,600
(Father, Mother,)

196
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,040
(I wish your spirit)

197
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,400
(bless his safe return.)

198
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,160
How is he?

199
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,840
Not good.

200
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,520
How is he?

201
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,720
I don't know. Be patient.

202
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,040
How is he?

203
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,800
Don't worry.

204
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,040
The physician said

205
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,240
his unhealed old wound
has caused an uneven pulse.

206
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,560
He won't wake up till the blood stasis

207
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,640
is dissipated through acupuncture.

208
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
What about the official business?

209
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,760
- Yes.
- Right. What shall we do?

210
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,440
Be quiet.

211
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,000
Mr. Lei used to be
away from the Office a lot,

212
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,720
and we attended to our own duties well.

213
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,200
Everyone,

214
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,560
we are all promoted by Mr. Lei.

215
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,280
One flourishes, and the others flourish.

216
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,440
One loses, and the others lose.

217
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,880
I'm sure you all know.

218
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,120
Mr. Lei still enjoys imperial favor.

219
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,720
His condition isn't life-threatening.

220
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,160
He'll wake up several days later.

221
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,880
Let's keep the secret

222
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,680
as we were asked to,

223
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,560
and do our job well as usual.

224
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,320
Do you really want to

225
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,080
live in the shadow of the Living Devil?

226
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,360
- Aye.
- Aye.

227
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,760
Dismiss.

228
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,440
Sir, please wake up soon.

229
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,840
Xiaochang, what's wrong with you?

230
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,640
How did you injure Ma'am's hand?

231
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,440
Be careful next time.

232
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,720
The physician has come.

233
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,280
Does it still hurt?

234
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,080
The wires hurt my hand.

235
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,480
It happens.

236
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,960
Why did you make such a fuss

237
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,040
and send for a physician?

238
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,280
I couldn't take care of you before.

239
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,080
Now you're with me,

240
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,800
I must cherish you.

241
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,720
Come.

242
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,040
Sit down.

243
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,440
The physician is coming.

244
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,040
Come here, please.

245
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,840
- Take a look at her hand.
- Please.

246
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,200
Her hand mustn't be hurt.

247
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,800
Thank you.

248
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,160
Here's the honorarium.

249
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,440
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

250
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,520
See you.

251
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,960
How is it? Does it still hurt?

252
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,440
Don't be so careless again.

253
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,720
You've been absent-minded today.

254
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,560
Is it because Zhao Pan'er

255
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,320
sent someone to see you?

256
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,040
She is a businesswoman

257
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,680
and is used to playing tricks.

258
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,280
Now that you've broken up with her,

259
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,480
you should stay away from her.

260
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,280
She is a businesswoman, so what?

261
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,120
I ran a teahouse with her.

262
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,240
Do you think I'm used to
playing tricks, too?

263
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,880
Why do you still speak for her?

264
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,680
You're really loving sisters.

265
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,360
Even if I hate her,

266
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,280
it's between me and her.

267
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,440
Others don't get to speak ill of her.

268
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,080
Am I one of others?

269
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,280
If you're not,

270
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,160
what do you mean by

271
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,040
"now you're with me"?

272
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,960
Ruzhuo,

273
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,680
you've been kind to me these days.

274
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,760
Beautiful dresses and nice food,
you gave me everything.

275
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,720
But I want to know,

276
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,400
in your mind,

277
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,640
am I just one of the pretty women
you've pursued

278
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,840
or your future wife?

279
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,600
Of course the latter.

280
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,000
Why do you doubt it?

281
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,160
Doesn't everyone in the mansion

282
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,480
call you Ma'am?

283
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,080
Then when do we get married?

284
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,840
I was going to talk about it with you.

285
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,640
Before we get married,

286
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,720
I'd better help you to drop the status.

287
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,400
Why?

288
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,800
Didn't you say

289
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,600
you're close to the Music Administrator

290
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,200
and it's a piece of cake?

291
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,040
Are there any difficulties?

292
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,760
There are not.

293
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,280
But it's not that easy

294
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,280
to get the thing done.

295
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,280
Don't be upset.

296
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,440
Let me explain.

297
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,160
If an official performer wants to
drop her status,

298
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,600
she must have a fair reason.

299
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,040
She may get married, grow old,

300
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,080
or be rewarded
by the imperial court.

301
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,360
If I want you to be my concubine,

302
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,520
I would simply
ask the Music Administrator

303
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,280
to do me a favor.

304
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,600
But if I want you to be my legal wife,

305
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,760
I can't do that.

306
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,920
Otherwise, the speech officials
won't spare me.

307
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,320
And you

308
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,680
will feel humiliated
in front of other ladies

309
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,640
for the rest of your life.

310
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,720
So, the best way

311
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,520
is to find you another reason
to drop the status.

312
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,280
After that, we'll find a good family

313
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,840
to adopt you.

314
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,960
Do you think it's reasonable?

315
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,560
There we go.

316
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,040
Let's think of a better way.

317
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,360
For our future happiness,

318
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,280
I'll try my best, and you should too.

319
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,760
What can I do?

320
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,120
Nothing difficult.

321
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,840
Just go out with me and socialize.

322
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,840
You've got Minister Ke's autograph.

323
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,080
If you win praise
from some important officials

324
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,320
at poetry and music gatherings,

325
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,840
we can naturally ask them

326
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,800
to speak for you

327
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,400
in front of the Music Administrator

328
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,320
and help you to drop the status.

329
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,960
You want me to please those officials?

330
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,080
How could I?

331
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,440
I just want you
to talk with them occasionally.

332
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,800
When you have time,

333
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,640
play one or two tunes for them.

334
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,920
Now you're famous
in the Eastern Capital.

335
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,520
Who dares to disrespect you?

336
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,640
Yinzhang,

337
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,760
I know you're of noble nature.

338
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,920
You don't want to please people.

339
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,720
So,

340
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,640
I didn't bring it up till now.

341
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,350
For our future happiness,

342
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,880
would you compromise a little?

343
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,640
Really?

344
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,320
Of course.

345
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,480
In the future,

346
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,240
I must live a prouder
and happier life than others.

347
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
To realize that,

348
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,800
I'll endure any hardship.

349
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,560
Sweetheart.

350
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,120
How dare you lie to me!

351
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,760
Do you think I couldn't tell

352
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,080
it's Censor Qi
who is playing the zither?

353
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,400
If the business is delayed,

354
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,840
you're a dead man.

355
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
Report to him again.

356
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,640
Just say the painting I have

357
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,640
is related to Gu Qianfan
of the Capital Security Office.

358
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,200
Please ask Censor Qi to see me.

359
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,400
Thank you.

360
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,920
The Night Revels?

361
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,760
Let him in.

362
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,480
Aye.

363
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,800
Hasn't Chen Lian come back yet?

364
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,600
His mother and his two sisters

365
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,920
were polite to me,

366
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,360
but they didn't know

367
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,360
when he would return home.

368
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,840
What shall we do?

369
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,000
We must pay the 600 strings tomorrow.

370
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,520
We can't find Mr. Gu anywhere.

371
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,440
If we don't get enough money,

372
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,760
we'll not only lose Wangyue Restaurant,

373
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,760
but also lose the teahouse.

374
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,760
I know it clearly.

375
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,120
Now, we can only count on Pan'er.

376
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,200
For what it's worth,

377
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,000
when you see her later,

378
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,320
don't blame her.

379
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,600
As for the title deed,

380
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,360
the three of us
made the decision together.

381
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,880
We shouldn't blame it on her.

382
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,360
The dozens of strings you lose,

383
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,200
I'll find a way to pay you back.

384
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,640
Sanniang, what kind of person
do you think I am?

385
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,960
I read few books,

386
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,040
but I know

387
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,960
friends should share weal

388
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,720
and woe.

389
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,480
Pan'er.

390
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,560
How is it going?

391
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,680
I went everywhere I could.

392
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,840
I asked the people
of the Capital Security Office.

393
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,720
They said he wasn't there

394
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,040
and they didn't know
when he would return.

395
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,040
Sanniang, Zhaodi,

396
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,440
I'm sorry to implicate you.

397
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,320
But I'll believe Qianfan

398
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,480
this time.

399
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,480
I don't think he's a man of that sort.

400
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,280
I believe him, too.

401
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,440
He is the Commissioner
of the Capital Security Office.

402
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,360
His Majesty must have given him

403
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,560
some important missions.

404
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,920
Don't think you implicated us.

405
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,880
When I jumped into the river,

406
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,080
I didn't have a coin.

407
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,120
All I had were the clothes on me.

408
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,600
But we've opened a teahouse
and earned money

409
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,640
through hard work.

410
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,320
We can make money

411
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,120
or lose money.

412
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,440
If we lose everything,

413
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,120
we can always start from scratch.

414
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,600
Exactly.

415
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,640
I don't care about the money.

416
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,120
Pan'er, why do you care about it?

417
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,040
Thanks.

418
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,320
I'll ask the owner
of Wangyue Restaurant

419
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,160
to give us a few more days.

420
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,000
I'll make you some food.

421
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,800
Let me help you.

422
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,520
Come.

423
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,400
I'm honored to see you, Censor Qi.

424
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,400
This is The Night Revels.

425
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,480
I heard the maiden name
of a prestigious lady in the palace

426
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,400
is Liu Wan.

427
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,520
If she was a concubine of Xue Que,

428
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,000
the Transport Commissioner
of Xichuan Region,

429
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,800
before she joined the imperial harem,

430
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,480
she must be convicted of
deceiving the monarch

431
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,520
and stealing the Empress's position.

432
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,640
I've checked it carefully.

433
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,120
The painting is authentic.

434
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,920
If there's no secret in it,

435
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,440
why would the Capital Security Office
search it all over the country

436
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,680
and force me all the way
to the Western Capital?

437
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,800
Nonsense!

438
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,560
Framing the Empress,

439
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,160
as a lowly official,

440
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,440
what punishment do you deserve?

441
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,800
I've reached the end of the rope.

442
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,640
Why would I be afraid of
the great calamity?

443
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,200
But you are

444
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,800
the leader of the scholar ministers,

445
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,160
how can you easily admit defeat

446
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
to Xiao Qinyan, the treacherous official
of the Empress Party?

447
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,960
I'd like to give you the painting

448
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,920
and my life.

449
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
I'll serve you faithfully.

450
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,480
Before I keep a dog,

451
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,080
I must think about
what meat it eats in the future.

452
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,520
Not to mention the dog

453
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,280
once offended the Gao Family.

454
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,360
Because I once offended
the Gao Family,

455
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,640
I'll be loyal to you forever.

456
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,960
If you help me to get rid of the title
of Taoist Temple Administrator,

457
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,520
let me join your party

458
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,360
and return to the Eastern Capital,

459
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,800
not to mention meat,

460
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,840
even if you ask me to eat dirt,

461
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,640
I won't hesitate.

462
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,040
You want to eat dirt?

463
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,120
I've changed
the dirt of the bonsai today.

464
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,480
Why don't you try it?

465
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,160
Someone.

466
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,040
Give my words to Baoyi Na.

467
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,120
Tell him,

468
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,800
His Majesty hasn't seen him

469
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,320
and doesn't know what he looks like.

470
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,320
If he doesn't
appreciate the favor tomorrow

471
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,000
and accept the title Deputy Commissioner
Ouyang is about to confer on him,

472
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,440
I don't mind changing a more
obedient Baoyi.

473
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,840
Aye.

474
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,800
How does it taste?

475
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,440
Like meat.

476
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,800
If you can really help me defeat
Empress Liu and Xiao Qinyan,

477
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,400
the meat will be

478
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,080
more and more delicious.

479
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,520
Master,

480
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,800
your mouth...

481
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,200
Woof.

482
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,000
Master, are you all right?

483
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,960
One of my bones
was removed just now.

484
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,200
It hurts a bit.

485
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,640
We can go back to the Eastern Capital.

486
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,440
What's the big deal with a bone?

487
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,800
Woof.

488
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,480
Woof.

489
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,320
Woof.

490
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,000
Extend the deadline?

491
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,960
You know we came from Qiantang.

492
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,280
It isn't that easy
to deliver money from there.

493
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,440
So it takes a few more days.

494
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,240
What about this,

495
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,960
the remaining 600 strings,

496
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,680
give us seven more days to pay off.

497
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,600
I'll pay you three percent interest
each day.

498
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,080
Ms. Zhao,

499
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,040
you're in the Eastern Capital,
not Qiantang.

500
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,360
We do business

501
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,840
according to the contract.

502
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,200
Black characters on white paper.

503
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,880
Every term must be abided.

504
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,240
If you fail to pay me
the remaining money tomorrow,

505
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,600
I'm sorry,

506
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,160
the deal is canceled.

507
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,400
According to the contract,

508
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,760
the deposit we paid,

509
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,880
you must return half of it.

510
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,960
Sure.

511
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,840
But I'm a little short of money.

512
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,080
If I have to return the money to you,

513
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,680
I shall do it gradually.

514
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,320
It will take a year.

515
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,880
You bully us to the extreme!

516
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,040
So what?

517
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,600
Did I repudiate your money?

518
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,160
The contract just fixed

519
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,240
the date you pay me,

520
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,920
not the date I refund your money.

521
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,080
If you don't agree,

522
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,000
sue me in the government.

523
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,680
I'm sorry.

524
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,920
Even if we go to the government,

525
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,360
our odds are not good.

526
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,980
It was my fault that
I didn't find the loophole.

527
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,900
(Middleman Scrivener Du Changfeng)

528
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,240
Don't worry.

529
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,200
I'm the middleman.

530
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,480
I have responsibilities, too.

531
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,680
I have some spare money

532
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,520
and title deeds.

533
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,640
I'll withdraw the money.

534
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,200
By borrowing some more
and pawning the deeds,

535
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,720
it won't be hard to scrape 300 strings.

536
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,640
I appreciate your kindness.

537
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,080
But I have to pay 600 strings tomorrow.

538
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,200
That's too much.

539
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,960
I can't even keep the teahouse now.

540
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,000
If I borrow your money,

541
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,240
I don't know

542
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,800
when I can pay you back.

543
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,280
It's no big deal.

544
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,880
But if you don't scrape the money,

545
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,040
you'll lose the teahouse

546
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,040
and Wangyue Restaurant as well.

547
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,840
All your efforts

548
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,280
in the Eastern Capital will be in vain,
isn't it?

549
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,560
It is.

550
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,240
All in vain.

551
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,720
What about this,

552
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,960
could you go beg the pawnshop

553
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,840
to lend you 300 strings more,

554
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,040
or ask them

555
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,360
to allow you to run the teahouse

556
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,200
in order to pay them back?

557
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,920
What? Zhao Pan'er comes to beg me?

558
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,480
Put me down.

559
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,080
Get off.

560
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,400
Where is she?

561
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,240
At the door.

562
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,680
Good. Good. Good!

563
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,320
Let her in.

564
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,320
Zhao Pan'er comes to beg me.

565
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,800
Thank goodness.

566
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,880
She finally has to beg me.

567
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,160
Sir,

568
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,920
shall we hurry up to freshen up

569
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,760
and get changed?

570
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,640
Does an arrogant man like me

571
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,600
need to get changed just for her?

572
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,440
Sir.

573
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,160
Ms. Zhao, Mr. Chi is like a child.

574
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,160
He is immature.

575
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,360
He holds grudges against you.

576
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,120
He'll probably give you a hard time.

577
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,600
Just put up with it.

578
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,080
The thing may take a favorable turn.

579
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,240
Thanks.

580
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,320
I'm under his roof now, I know.

581
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,600
Ms. Zhao,

582
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,400
your coral hairpin is beautiful.

583
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,520
This way.

584
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,960
I'm sorry I offended you before.

585
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,160
But better to get rid of an enmity
than keep it alive.

586
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,560
For old times' sake,

587
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,320
please give us a little more time.

588
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,360
Old times?

589
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,040
What old times do we share?

590
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,520
The times when you grabbed my ball

591
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,440
or when you won me in gambling?

592
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,000
Don't you have Gu Qianfan?

593
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,120
Doesn't he have money?

594
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,280
Doesn't he have helpers?

595
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,080
Why do you come to beg me?

596
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,760
I get it.

597
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,320
You're alone now,

598
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,560
just like them.

599
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,080
He dumped you.

600
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,080
What? You don't agree?

601
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,400
Are you still chirping?

602
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,630
Are you trying to

603
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,280
find more excuses for him?

604
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,400
All men

605
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,400
are the same.

606
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:54,480
They can love you very much.

607
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,400
But once they get bored,

608
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,480
or get into trouble,

609
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,640
just like the birds,

610
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,240
whoosh, they fly away.

611
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,440
Qianfan isn't a man of that sort.

612
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
Aren't you smart usually?

613
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,800
How could you be so foolish now?

614
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,520
Gu Qianfan is my dead enemy.

615
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,720
If he still harbors
a little affection for you,

616
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,520
would he let you beg me?

617
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,280
Look at you.

618
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,920
You look exactly the same

619
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,000
as the suckers outside the theaters
who don't believe the performers

620
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,600
would deny them.

621
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,920
Because I'm reduced to a sucker,

622
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,080
would you lend me another 300 strings?

623
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,040
OK.

624
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,760
Kneel down and kowtow for three times.
Beg me.

625
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,680
Mr. Chi, please help me.

626
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,920
It was perfunctory.

627
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,240
It wasn't sincere.

628
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,240
What else do you want me to do?

629
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,760
I heard you were
a singing performer before.

630
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,240
Why don't you sing
the Resentful Wife for me?

631
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,840
I'll lend you the money
as long as you sing it to me.

632
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,960
The Resentful Wife?

633
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,840
What? Are you reluctant?

634
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,880
Then forget about the money.

635
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,160
You can leave now.

636
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,280
You just want to see

637
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,640
how I miss my man, don't you?

638
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,120
I don't know how to sing the song.

639
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,240
What about a dance?

640
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,560
A dance?

641
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,840
Fine, a dance

642
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,440
will do.

643
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,880
Get him a chair.

644
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,960
Hurry.

645
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I can tell

646
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,920
it's a lonely wife missing her husband
who is on the battlefield.

647
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,600
Mr. Chi, are you satisfied?

648
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,600
Satisfied.

649
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,360
Not at all!

650
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,720
Since you're satisfied,

651
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,160
could you give me the money?

652
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,320
I didn't say I was satisfied.

653
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,520
I said "not at all".

654
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,640
I just heard "satisfied".

655
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,720
Mr. Chi,

656
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,520
I danced for you and kowtowed to you.

657
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,080
If you go back on your word,

658
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,440
can you still call yourself a man?

659
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:01,880
Go to the treasury

660
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,000
and bring her the deposit receipt.

661
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,280
Who lets you move the chair?

662
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,400
Hold on.

663
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,320
The money isn't a small amount.

664
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,560
You ask to use it for over six months.

665
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,760
I can't loan it without a pledge.

666
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,320
I still have two paintings.

667
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,080
Forget about the worthless paintings.

668
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,480
Come here.

669
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,880
I want this.

670
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,840
Did Gu Qianfan give it to you?

671
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,840
I want it.

672
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,280
Why? Are you reluctant?

673
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,600
Then forget about the money.

674
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,560
Since Gu Qianfan dumped you,

675
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,840
why don't you

676
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,560
be my lover?

677
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,600
Not to mention 300 strings...

678
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,320
Chi Pan,

679
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,560
you're ugly,

680
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,920
yet you dare crave for a beauty.

681
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,080
I'll wipe out the disgrace

682
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,320
you bestowed upon me one day.

683
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,240
Am I ugly? Nonsense!

684
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,440
Go get her!

685
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,120
Sir, calm down.

686
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,280
What did I do to her?

687
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,360
She slapped me

688
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,840
and said I'm ugly!

689
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,560
My mother has never slapped me!

690
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,800
Many young ladies out there

691
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,600
want to be my lovers!

692
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,640
She gave me a loud slap.

693
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,440
I'm so upset.

694
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,800
Don't be upset.

695
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,160
Let me blow it.

696
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,120
My face is still burning.

697
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,760
Let me blow it.
