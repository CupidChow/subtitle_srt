=Episode 26=

17
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,760
You're a treasure.

18
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,270
You're not supposed
to fall into the mire.

19
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,040
Let me take care of you

20
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,830
and protect you,

21
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,230
will you?

22
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,400
I'm like a trailing vine.

23
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,950
You're like a big tree.

24
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,510
Now I entrust myself to you.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,080
May you treat me with tenderness.

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,110
I won't fail your deep affection.

27
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,390
Zhaodi.

28
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,080
Zhaodi!

29
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,600
Did you get any ice?

30
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,960
I didn't get any ice.

31
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,600
I met an old acquaintance
who asked me for money.

32
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,080
But I bought lotus root.

33
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,390
It's okay. Once only.

34
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,320
Lotus root is also good.

35
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,910
I'll make some lotus root soup.

36
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,110
It can also relieve the heat.

37
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,470
I have money in my room.

38
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,440
I'll get it for you now.

39
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,720
No need. Come back.

40
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,270
Did you see Yinzhang
on your way back from the alley?

41
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,830
No.

42
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:10,750
That's not good.

43
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,880
I sensed something wrong

44
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,750
after I got her on the boat.

45
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,550
I was muddled.

46
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
What happened?

47
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,750
Who's that?

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,030
Who's that?

49
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,470
What can I do for you?

50
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,320
Is this Ms. Song's house?

51
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,550
Yes.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,160
I'm Shen Ruzhuo's steward.

53
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,750
This is a letter from Ms. Song.

54
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,030
I'm here to pick up her pipa.

55
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,670
Thank you.

56
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,500
(Give Moon to the person who comes.
Written by Song Yinzhang)

57
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,510
What did Yinzhang mean?

58
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,670
Is she going to stay
at Shen's Mansion and not come back

59
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,000
just because you had a spat yesterday?

60
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,830
I slipped yesterday.

61
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,510
You slipped?

62
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,880
Don't you think

63
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,070
Yinzhang has different feelings
for Gu Qianfan

64
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,350
the whole time?

65
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,670
I do.

66
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,830
Every time I mentioned
Deputy Commissioner Gu,

67
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,000
she would keep talking

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,480
like a guest in our teahouse

69
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,670
who just finished
listening to the music.

70
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,600
Do you mean Yinzhang also
fell for Deputy Commissioner Gu...

71
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,200
Why else would she suddenly get mad

72
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,600
at Pan'er yesterday

73
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,950
and move to Shen's Mansion now?

74
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,790
Has she been unaware

75
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,200
of what's going between Pan'er
and Deputy Commissioner Gu?

76
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,110
I guess so.

77
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,550
Today I told her

78
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,270
that Pan'er and Gu Qianfan 
were going to be engaged.

79
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,040
It was my fault.

80
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,350
Don't tell Pan'er

81
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,830
that you just met Yinzhang.

82
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,880
I noticed

83
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,070
that Pan'er hasn't been herself today.

84
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,270
What's more, the people
of the Capital Security Office

85
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,110
are patrolling the street.

86
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,000
I suspect

87
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,230
something might have gone wrong
with Deputy Commissioner Gu.

88
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,440
No way.

89
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,000
How could you come here
when you are hurt like this?

90
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,920
I can't rest assured until I see you.

91
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,350
What's more,

92
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,320
it's not the first time

93
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,480
you've seen me hurt.

94
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,350
That was before.

95
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,600
It's different now.

96
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,160
Let me ask you,

97
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,950
how did you know

98
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,390
whether the sword was poisonous or not?

99
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,160
I learned it from a military doctor
when I was a child.

100
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,200
My father was the Ningbian Army's
Chief Military Inspector.

101
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,670
Every time he came back from war
with the army,

102
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,230
my mother and I helped treat them.

103
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,480
You learned well.

104
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,760
You know what,

105
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,880
the doctor told me

106
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,160
if it wasn't for your timely treatment,

107
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,350
I might have died.

108
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,720
Of course I would try my best.

109
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,090
It tastes salty.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,370
Don't cry again, okay?

111
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,760
Your eyes are puffy from crying.

112
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,560
You won't look pretty.

113
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,530
Now the Hat Demon case has been solved.

114
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,810
I promise you

115
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,600
I'll stay safe

116
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,690
and not make you worry that much.

117
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:53,650
Also,

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I found some restaurants

119
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,090
to be resold and made a list.

120
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,560
I'll ask Chen Lian
to send it to you next time.

121
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,250
You can visit them one by one.

122
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:04,810
And also,

123
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,210
I really can't wait.

124
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,130
I don't care about Lei Jing.

125
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,530
I want to marry you

126
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,720
as soon as I get better.

127
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,440
I want to...

128
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,170
Chief...

129
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:30,730
Hush.

130
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,560
He is sleeping.

131
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,560
When he wakes up,

132
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,880
I have to take him back
to the Capital Security Office.

133
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,880
Can I go with you?

134
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:37,850
No.

135
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,970
There are too many things
involved in the Hat Demon case.

136
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,360
In case of accidents,

137
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,090
Commissioner Lei won't even
let Chief go back to his mansion.

138
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,120
He had to set up a quiet room
at the South Section

139
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,530
of the Capital Security Office
for Chief to rest.

140
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,760
But Pan'er,

141
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,240
you can take care of Chief

142
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,530
for the rest of your life.

143
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,120
I'll leave him to you.

144
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,090
Rest assured.

145
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,360
What's the matter?

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,680
Nothing.

147
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,680
I'll put a few secret guards here

148
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,760
and in the yard these days.

149
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,170
If the business is not doing well,

150
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,360
just take a few more days off.

151
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,290
Okay.

152
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,210
Mr. Gu is safe now.

153
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,360
You should be happy.

154
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,850
I did this to him.

155
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,800
I just wanted to give him a push

156
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,530
and let him see

157
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,360
the true colors of Qi Mu.

158
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,800
But I didn't expect...

159
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,560
Young Master Qianfan risked his life

160
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,530
to save you and Young Master Wei.

161
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,290
He is so filial.

162
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,920
It means he has been

163
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,490
caring about the Xiao Family.

164
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,680
He is just as stubborn

165
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:47,760
as his mother.

166
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,290
Although I'm the Grand Secretary now,

167
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,320
I don't have

168
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,320
many capable confidants in the court

169
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,800
who I can trust.

170
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,000
I wouldn't have put him

171
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,360
in such a dangerous situation

172
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,490
if none of his brothers

173
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,090
were up to the task.

174
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,610
That Zhao

175
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,290
acted in a calm

176
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,800
and decisive manner.

177
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,000
Looks like she will be a good housewife.

178
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,560
It's a pity

179
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,850
that her status is way too lowly.

180
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,320
Master.

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,530
Are you really going
to let Mr. Gu marry Zhao?

182
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,120
Is there anything else
I can do right now?

183
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,000
After all, Zhao saved his life.

184
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,050
Look at the way when they are together,

185
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,290
there is no way to break them up.

186
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,320
No one makes it easy for me.

187
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,320
Xiao Wei actually wants to marry
District Princess Rongyang.

188
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,730
He can't even

189
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:02,170
get a proper place
in the Imperial Examination,

190
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,290
if he marries the daughter
of an idle family,

191
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,530
I think he is going

192
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,880
to live on air forever.

193
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,650
Father.

194
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,730
Last time you sent me
to Shaanxi Road to look into something.

195
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,410
There is a lead now.

196
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,730
Yinzhang went to Shen's Mansion?

197
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,000
No way.

198
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,240
Don't go there right now.

199
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,680
It's not appropriate
to show up there suddenly.

200
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,410
Besides, I don't think

201
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,680
Yinzhang wants to see us now.

202
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,240
Where is her letter?

203
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,120
Here.

204
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,760
There is only one line in the letter

205
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,170
and nothing else.

206
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,850
She left all her clothes
and luggage here.

207
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,290
The servant of the Shen Family said

208
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,440
Shen Ruzhuo sees her as a treasure.

209
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,440
Everything

210
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,170
is brand new.

211
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,680
There are even four maids
waiting on her.

212
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,970
She left without telling us.

213
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,000
Let her go.

214
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,440
Last night,

215
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
I was worried about Qianfan,

216
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,000
but she came to me and said

217
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,120
she wanted to invite Qianfan
to a feast to return the favor.

218
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,970
I couldn't help

219
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,000
saying something harsh.

220
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,050
I see.

221
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,170
I thought it was just a spat.

222
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,360
I wasn't expecting this.

223
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,490
Never mind.

224
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,050
There is always an end to everything.

225
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,760
Now she has chosen her own path,

226
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,440
she can walk it on her own.

227
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,920
Yinzhang is famous in the capital.

228
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,610
Shen Ruzhuo is also a court official.

229
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,970
I think he will treat her well.

230
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,730
By the way,

231
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,920
what happened to Gu Qianfan?

232
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,880
Can you tell me about it?

233
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,730
He was badly hurt,

234
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,090
but the good thing is

235
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,320
his life is not in danger.

236
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,050
I'm sorry.

237
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,090
The teahouse may need
to be closed for a few more days.

238
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,560
There is no need to apologize.

239
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,560
The Hat Demon thing is no joke.

240
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,800
We should be careful.

241
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,970
Gu Qianfan helped us a lot

242
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,490
to open a teahouse
in the Eastern Capital.

243
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,410
Since we enjoyed the benefits,

244
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,440
we also have to take the downside.

245
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,730
But we don't have to close the teahouse.

246
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,090
We can't get ice these days anyway,

247
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,490
and Yinzhang won't play pipa there.

248
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,760
Let's just open it

249
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,360
in the morning.

250
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,880
It's cool in the morning,

251
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,120
and we should at least do this
for our regulars.

252
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,090
Okay.

253
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,210
I can also

254
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,000
go to check other restaurants.

255
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,120
By the way, I want to ask you seriously,

256
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,920
are you really willing
to sell the teahouse

257
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,410
and open a restaurant?

258
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,050
Yes.

259
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,970
Let's give it a try then.

260
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,210
We can carve out a new area

261
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,800
and try something new.

262
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:06,730
Okay!

263
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,170
Okay.

264
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,610
Ms. Zhao!

265
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,730
Just half a day?

266
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,800
Ms. Song is not here, either.

267
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:20,800
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,170
She can't come.

269
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,240
That's why the pastries

270
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,050
and drinks here

271
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,120
are half price.

272
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,920
It's not the money that we care about.

273
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,210
All right, just be content.

274
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,360
Ms. Song is expensive now.

275
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,920
She even turned down
a one-million-coin offer.

276
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,090
You've heard it several times for free.

277
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,240
What else do you want?

278
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,490
You're right.

279
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,170
All right.

280
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,850
You're here for pipa,

281
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,680
but I like their tea
and delicious pastries.

282
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,560
Ms. Zhao, I want
a cup of red fruit drink.

283
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,560
Just a second.

284
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,360
What are you waiting for?

285
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,920
Come here and sit down.

286
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,560
Come on.

287
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,120
The fan is ready for you.

288
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,090
Sit down.

289
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,290
Let me cool off first.

290
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,880
There she is.

291
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,050
Give him one.

292
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,760
He'll pay for it himself.

293
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,120
Please enjoy.

294
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,530
It's actually cold.

295
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,170
Did you find ice?

296
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,440
It has been soaked in well water.

297
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,240
Great. Great.

298
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,560
It's cool.

299
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
But,

300
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,410
it's going to be a problem

301
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,650
if you can't find ice all the time.

302
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,410
Yeah.

303
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,090
Pan'er!

304
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,530
We got ice!

305
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,170
Really?

306
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,320
Is it from Wang's Ice Shop or Chen Lian?

307
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,290
Neither of them.

308
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,800
That guy was weird.

309
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,240
He said it's a thank-you gift
for some pork liver.

310
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,610
He also sent some honeydew melons.

311
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,410
Pork liver?

312
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,410
He said they were newly sent
from the south.

313
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
It's the perfect time to eat them now.

314
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,440
What pork liver?

315
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,170
I know who this is from.

316
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,210
It's Du Changfeng.

317
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,760
He can't see clearly at night.

318
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,560
So I asked him to eat more pork liver.

319
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,360
I see.

320
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,730
Don't be weird about it.

321
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,240
You know how much I don't like him.

322
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,650
If we weren't in urgent need of ice,

323
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,880
I wouldn't take it.

324
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,410
This blind guy knows
how to return a favor.

325
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,120
Let's go.

326
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,050
I'll carry this bucket.

327
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,800
There's always one way out.

328
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,210
I was so worried earlier.

329
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,240
But when I saw
the shy smile on Sanniang's face,

330
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,530
I thought

331
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,490
I can tolerate anything in the world.

332
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,850
But Song Yinzhang
still hurt your feelings.

333
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,120
A little bit.

334
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,120
But it's nothing
compared with your wound.

335
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,850
Don't worry about my feelings.

336
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,890
Although Yinzhang calls me
her elder sister all the time,

337
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,280
she is not a child anymore.

338
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,490
We should have respected her opinions.

339
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:20,920
You're the one I'm worried about.

340
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,090
You were badly hurt.

341
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,730
You don't have to come over to see me.

342
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,320
I'm not used

343
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:33,920
to your sudden tenderness.

344
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,610
Well, do you get used to it now?

345
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,680
It's okay.

346
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,250
When are you going to move out
of the Capital Security Office?

347
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,250
We always meet outside.

348
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,160
It's too tiring for you.

349
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,610
Maybe in a day or two.

350
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,920
The Hat Demon this time

351
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,640
was the Commander of the Office
of Imperial Guards in disguise.

352
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,520
The person he wanted to kill
is Minister Duke Xiao.

353
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,040
One is His Majesty's trusted official.

354
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,370
The other is the Grand Secretary.

355
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,490
There has been a bloody storm

356
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,920
in the court these days.

357
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,730
It's safer for us to meet here.

358
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,010
Censor Qi.

359
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,680
I heard from a guest at the teahouse

360
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,520
that the Hat Demon
also went to his mansion

361
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,730
and frightened him.

362
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,730
He is fine.

363
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,890
The best way

364
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,490
for a person

365
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,090
to distance himself

366
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,010
from a case

367
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,490
is pretend to be the victim.

368
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,520
The person behind
the Hat Demon case is...

369
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,370
He used to be the man
I respected the most,

370
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,210
but not anymore.

371
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:25,920
Let's change the subject.

372
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,160
Well,

373
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,800
you should have told me about the ice.

374
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,610
Chi Pan must be tired of living.

375
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,010
He dared mess with you.

376
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:37,890
Just wait and see.

377
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,610
After I get better,

378
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,680
I'll take my time
to teach him some lessons.

379
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,610
It's nothing.

380
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,440
Doing business is just like this.

381
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,920
There are ups and downs.

382
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,280
Besides, we have ice now.

383
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,970
How long is he gonna support you

384
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,320
with the little money he has?

385
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,490
The Capital Security Office
is in charge of the ice well

386
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,400
which supplies ice
only to the inner court.

387
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,320
I won't use my power for personal gain,

388
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,730
but at least I can buy some ice

389
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,490
from them for you.

390
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,210
Really?

391
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:06,770
Chief!

392
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,490
Chief!

393
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,680
The Emperor summoned you.

394
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,160
Go ahead.

395
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,490
I need to go
to the Wangyue Restaurant, too.

396
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,920
How many restaurants have you seen?

397
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,280
This is the third one.

398
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,040
I heard you were badly injured

399
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,890
when you were solving
the Hat Demon case.

400
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,920
Have you recovered?

401
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,400
Thank you for your concern.

402
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:54,890
I'm fine now.

403
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:01,010
You are a young hero indeed,

404
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,490
but you should also
take good care of yourself.

405
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,800
Yes.

406
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,440
Qianfan.

407
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,610
Are you blaming me

408
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,850
for not visiting you?

409
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,850
Let me see where the wound is.

410
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,730
I'm too inferior to trouble you.

411
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,920
I heard you were startled
by the Hat Demon.

412
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,680
His Majesty summoned you to the palace

413
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,090
and permitted you to leave the court
to recuperate.

414
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,040
May you take care of yourself.

415
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,800
I should leave.

416
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,770
Come on, this way, please.

417
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,850
Come on.

418
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,850
The private rooms are in the west wing.

419
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:50,890
The lobby is in the east wing.

420
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,730
There are five Tea Sages,

421
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,010
six Wine Sages,

422
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,520
seven brewmasters,

423
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,640
four cooks,

424
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,890
and more than twenty servers.

425
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,040
This way.

426
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,280
The price is two thousand
strings of coins.

427
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,920
It's the best price we can offer.

428
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,130
If I wasn't in a hurry
to go back to my hometown,

429
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,040
I wouldn't offer such a low price.

430
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,040
The location is ordinary.

431
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,010
It's almost evening,

432
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,370
and there aren't that many customers.

433
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:18,970
I'll give you 1,700 strings at most.

434
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:19,680
Yeah.

435
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,890
There are many customers.

436
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,850
See, there are few empty seats.

437
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,320
1,900 strings. I won't take less.

438
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,090
1,800 strings. It sounds lucky.

439
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,920
Since you're in a hurry
to sell the restaurant,

440
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,130
you should at least
give us a better price.

441
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:32,890
Yes.

442
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,970
The way you bargain

443
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,440
is like buying vegetables at a market.

444
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,920
All right. It's a deal.

445
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,040
Inside, please.

446
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,160
It's a deal.

447
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:43,920
Come on.

448
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,160
Serve tea!

449
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,560
Sit down, please.

450
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,370
Thank you.

451
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,370
Please enjoy.

452
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:03,160
When are we gonna draw up the deed?

453
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,040
Whenever your husband has time.

454
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,680
I'm free all the time.

455
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,040
My husband?

456
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,610
Ms. Zhao is not married yet.

457
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,730
I misspoke.

458
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:22,520
You can ask your father or your brother

459
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,210
to sign the deed.

460
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,040
Ms. Zhao, are you going

461
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,210
to run Wangyue Restaurant yourself?

462
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,770
- Is there any problem?
- Is there any problem?

463
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,040
Of course there is.

464
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,640
I don't think we can close the deal.

465
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,160
Don't go!

466
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
Why can't we close the deal?

467
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,250
Why can't we close the deal?

468
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:50,970
Don't pull me!

469
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,250
- Make it clear.
- No, no.

470
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,370
Tell us why we can't close the deal.

471
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,520
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

472
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,850
I won't touch you. Say it.

473
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,770
It's my fault
that I didn't ask about that.

474
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:03,730
I guess you two

475
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,160
don't know the rules
of the restaurant business.

476
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,040
There is not a woman
in the Eastern Capital

477
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,440
who can run a restaurant.

478
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,320
But we ran a teahouse well

479
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,850
on Mahang Street.

480
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,800
Yeah.

481
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,440
You're not fooling us, are you?

482
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,130
If you put it that way,

483
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,250
what about the Hupo Mutton Shop

484
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,040
across the street?

485
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,320
Isn't it run by a woman?

486
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,850
Lady, don't touch me.

487
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,680
Sit down.

488
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,280
Sit down.

489
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,010
A teahouse is a teahouse.

490
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,770
A small shop is a small shop.

491
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,400
How can you compare them

492
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,640
with respectable registered restaurants
like Wangyue Restaurant?

493
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,250
Registered restaurants?

494
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:50,730
I guess you two don't know it.

495
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,520
The court doesn't allow people
to make wine without permission.

496
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,920
In a city as big as the Eastern Capital,

497
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,800
there are only 72 registered restaurants

498
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:03,280
that have the imperial court's
permission to make wine.

499
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:07,560
Other shops are just
insignificant shops.

500
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,610
Since ancient times,

501
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,010
making wine requires
the yang spirit of men.

502
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,440
Women are of yin spirits.

503
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,370
If you touch the distiller's yeast,

504
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,970
the wine will become sour.

505
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,610
Therefore,

506
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,970
the guild laid down the rules long ago.

507
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,370
Women

508
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,130
can own a registered restaurant,

509
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,010
but the person who runs it

510
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,890
must be a man.

511
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,210
These rules don't make any sense.

512
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,210
But that's how the rules
have always been.

513
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,090
The head of the guild

514
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,400
is the owner
of Xinyue Restaurant, Landlord Ren.

515
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,730
He's a semi-official registered
at the Ministry of Revenue.

516
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,970
If you annoy him,

517
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,560
no one will supply vegetables
and meat to you.

518
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,010
Even the cook

519
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,610
won't work for you anymore.

520
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,560
I want to close the deal

521
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,370
more than you do,

522
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,610
but not selling it to you

523
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,610
is also for your good.

524
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,210
Well, I'm rather busy here.

525
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,130
Why don't you...

526
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,560
Thank you for your time.

527
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,770
I won't see you out.

528
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,560
Teahouses, ice shops, and restaurants

529
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,800
have to listen to the guild.

530
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,370
Why do they
stretch their arms that long?

531
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,970
We finally found a restaurant

532
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,130
we like.

533
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,800
They're in this business,

534
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,320
so they want to set the bar high

535
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,010
to keep everyone else
from getting a piece of the pie.

536
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,680
There is no such thing as that women
can't touch the distiller's yeast.

537
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,280
Exactly.

538
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,490
I read it in a book
that female official

539
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,920
who made wine for King Wen of Zhou
was called Wine Lady.

540
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,160
Let's go and reason with Landlord Ren.

541
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:56,280
Never mind.

542
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,010
The owner had a point.

543
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,280
It's not in our interest

544
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,250
to offend the guild.

545
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,250
Besides, we know nothing
about making wine.

546
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,010
Why do we have to hold on to
these prideful registered restaurants?

547
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,730
There are many restaurants
in the Eastern Capital.

548
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,210
Let's try another one.

549
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,320
One day,

550
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,490
we're gonna change
this unreasonable rule

551
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,440
that looks down on women.

552
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:17,680
Can we do it?

553
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,040
We can do it as long as
we have the courage to think about it.

554
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,210
I hope Yinzhang can also play
such joyful music

555
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,770
at Shen's Mansion.

556
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,610
I haven't seen Yinzhang for a while.

557
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,440
I miss her.

558
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:51,270
(Wangyue Restaurant)

559
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:55,750
(Self-esteem by Ke Zheng)

560
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,470
(Self-esteem by Ke Zheng)

561
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,890
Great. Great.

562
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,010
You used to praise me with quotes.

563
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,920
Now you just said one word.

564
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,970
Being simple is better.

565
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,640
Give it to me.

566
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,130
Yinzhang.

567
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,370
What's wrong?

568
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,090
You look dispirited.

569
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,610
Did you not sleep well last night?

570
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,800
Or did you not like the breakfast?

571
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,250
No.

572
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,730
I know why you're upset.

573
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,850
I have a secret cure.

574
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:13,730
Lean over.

575
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:21,730
A beauty

576
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,610
should be cherished

577
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,680
by being held in the arms.

578
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:28,490
We're gonna be together

579
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,010
for a long time.

580
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,400
Don't be shy.

581
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,800
Put me down.

582
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,800
What are you doing
in the middle of the day?

583
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,010
Can we do it in the evening?

584
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:45,610
I won't talk to you.

585
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,250
Yinzhang, you're the best. I was wrong.

586
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,730
Don't be angry.

587
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,040
Just forgive me this time

588
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,400
for the sake of this.

589
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,970
This is the Hepu pearl, a tribute.

590
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,130
It's hard to get.

591
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,280
I don't like pearls.

592
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:21,890
What about this?

593
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,250
This is the superior fire coral.

594
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,560
I only like fire coral.

595
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:57,490
Easy.

596
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:02,440
Ping.

597
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,130
Find all the fire corals in the mansion

598
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,400
and bring them to Ms. Song.

599
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,250
Yes, Master.

600
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,250
Let's go. There will be
a lot of fire corals.

601
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,560
Put it on for me.

602
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,010
Okay.

603
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,010
You're beautiful.

604
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,680
Even if you want the moon in the sky,

605
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,850
I'll take it off for you.

606
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:18,630
(United and Harmonious)

607
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,250
Long live Your Majesty.

608
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,680
You may rise.

609
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,800
Official Gu deserves a lot of credit

610
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,370
for Minister Xiao's safe return.

611
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,250
Your Majesty, you're overpraising me.

612
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,850
I don't deserve this.

613
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,970
It's my duty.

614
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,610
Gu Qianfan

615
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,490
is royal, brave, and decisive.

616
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,490
I promote him to Director of Receptions,
and Capital Security Office Commissioner.

617
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:55,610
Lei Jing has been in charge of
the Capital Security Office for years.

618
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,890
He made contributions.

619
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:59,040
I also promote him
to Inspector of Puzhou,

620
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,920
and Deputy Director
of Palace Domestic Service.

621
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,010
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

622
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:11,570
I'm overwhelmed with trepidation
because of the promotion.

623
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:18,010
But there is one thing I wish
Your Majesty can show your grace on.

624
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,330
My mother died when I was young.

625
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,290
I was lucky to have my aunt
take care of me.

626
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,080
To confer a posthumous title
on your aunt?

627
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:39,490
Is there any precedent?

628
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,600
Yes.

629
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:46,290
The sister-in-law of Ma Ce,
Defense Commander of the Tang dynasty,

630
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:49,810
was made Commandery Mistress
for her rearing.

631
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,640
Rearing a child takes more efforts
than giving birth to one.

632
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,400
In this case,

633
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:05,160
I'll confer the title
of District Mistress on Gu

634
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,360
so that Official Gu
can fulfill his filial piety.

635
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,290
Commissioner Gu must be
overwhelmed with joyousness.

636
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,440
Thank His Majesty now.

637
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,530
Thank Your Majesty for your grace.

638
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,360
I finally got you what you wanted.

639
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,570
I feel relieved now.

640
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,400
Minister Duke Xiao,
you made a nice move.

641
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,330
You used the bitter meat strategy

642
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,360
to get rid of Qi Mu

643
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,600
and take control
of the Capital Security Office.

644
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,920
You've lived up to your reputation
as a thorough planner.

645
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,330
When did I say I would intervene
in the Capital Security Office?

646
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,770
Qianfan.

647
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,160
Do you still think

648
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,050
I'm using you?

649
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,490
I know you as much as you know me.

650
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,770
If there is something you want,

651
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,360
you won't openly try to get it,

652
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,210
but you will fan the fire in the dark,

653
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:09,490
just like the way you treat prey.

654
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:11,080
You have to corner them

655
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,490
and leave them nowhere to escape.

656
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,600
You are not my prey.

657
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,080
You are my biological son.

658
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,250
No matter what happens,

659
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,640
father and son always fight together.

660
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,770
I need you

661
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,440
to sit tight in the court.

662
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,330
Unfortunately, that's not my ambition.

663
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,010
After my mother's new grave is finished,

664
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,490
I will marry Pan'er

665
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,490
and get a sinecure.

666
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,490
As for the Capital Security Office,

667
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,640
you can give it to whoever you like.

668
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,570
I don't care.

669
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,920
You're only 30 years old.

670
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,530
Isn't it too early for you

671
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,360
to live an easy and comfortable life?

672
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,970
Do you think

673
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,840
you can really give up your ambition?

674
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,770
I'm not like you. Why can't I?

675
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,730
I hope so.

676
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:53,680
It is a pity

677
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,080
that Qi Mu also thinks

678
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,840
you are just like me when I was young.

679
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,970
All right, you haven't recovered yet.

680
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,360
I'm not gonna push you.

681
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,680
There will be plenty of time for us

682
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,290
to discuss it.

683
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,970
Build your mother's grave first.

684
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:11,080
You must inform me in advance

685
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,880
when the date of the relocation is set.

686
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,680
After all, I'm her husband.

687
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,970
Minister Duke Xiao, this way.

688
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:36,230
(Tomb of Ms. Gu, the daughter of
Vice Director of the Ministry of Rites)

689
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,210
Mother, I'm unfilial.

690
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,770
It took me so long to see you.

691
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,880
But I got a promotion.

692
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,210
Now I have been promoted

693
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,770
to the Fifth Rank.

694
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,490
I asked His Majesty

695
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,640
to confer a posthumous title on you.

696
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,210
You will be honored by the court

697
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,970
and no longer drift
outside of the Gu Family.

698
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:23,770
I'll give you what he can't.

699
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,670
(Tomb of Ms. Gu, the daughter of
Vice Director of the Ministry of Rites)

700
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,330
Mother, I remember you used to say

701
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:42,120
that you loved to see me in red
when I was a kid.

702
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,270
Well, do I look spirited?

703
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:51,510
(Tomb of Ms. Gu, the daughter of
Vice Director of the Ministry of Rites)

704
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,010
Qianfan.

705
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,810
Don't light the lamp.

706
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,600
His Majesty promoted me

707
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,120
and conferred a posthumous title
on my mother.

708
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,290
I'm a fifth-rank official now.

709
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,600
It's great.

710
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:01,010
Actually, I kind of knew

711
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,290
that His Majesty would
reward me handsomely this time.

712
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,160
A thirty-year-old fifth-rank official.

713
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,640
Isn't that something to be proud of?

714
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:12,050
Yeah.

715
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,400
You got what you've always wanted.

716
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,330
You should be happy.

717
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,160
I just went to visit my mother's grave.

718
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,640
I was going

719
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,160
to have a good cry at her grave

720
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:30,770
and tell her

721
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,920
she can finally

722
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,880
rest in peace.

723
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,010
I made it.

724
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,400
But I didn't do that.

725
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:45,640
I...

726
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,160
I couldn't say it.

727
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,730
I couldn't cry

728
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,810
or laugh.

729
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,920
I don't know if I should be happy

730
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,730
or sad.

731
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,640
Well, when I think about it,

732
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,770
this is what I want.

733
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,730
Do you understand?

734
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,440
I do.

735
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:17,920
I understand.

736
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:20,880
I don't even know
what I'm talking about.

737
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,050
Does it really matter?

738
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,010
Isn't half of your life

739
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,810
worth a fifth-rank post?

740
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,440
Just because you got what you wanted

741
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,490
not in the way you like,

742
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,080
the decades you spent
at the Capital Security Office

743
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,530
means nothing?

744
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,640
Don't think about the past.

745
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,210
Look forward.

746
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:50,250
All I know is my future husband
got a promotion.

747
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:54,160
My mother-in-law
will be honored by the court.

748
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,530
I can finally have a home.

749
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,160
It's a good thing.

750
00:41:59,050 --> 00:41:59,970
I'm happy.

751
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,400
Do you remember you told me
I'm not allowed to cry?

752
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:09,010
But I don't want to see you
smile like this, either.

753
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,730
Now that we're together,

754
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,730
I'll share

755
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,970
half of your joys and sorrows.

756
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:21,810
Tell me,

757
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,920
will it hurt you

758
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,600
if you see me so upset?

759
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:39,530
It will hurt me.
