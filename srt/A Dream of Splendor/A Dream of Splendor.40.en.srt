17
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,080
Neither I nor Pan'er
will drop the lawsuit.

18
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,800
Why?

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,680
We're determined
to bring Ouyang Xu to justice,

20
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,480
and to clear Pan'er's name

21
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,840
through the case.

22
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
Ridiculous.

23
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,040
Well then.

24
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,640
Don't blame me for not helping you.

25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,240
That's how you show your loyalty?

26
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,030
To save my wife,

27
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,440
I didn't hesitate
to give Your Majesty my life.

28
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,440
But I won't bargain with you

29
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,680
for the deal.

30
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,280
Your Majesty, you're well-read.

31
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,200
You should know,

32
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,600
the Emperor can kill millions in anger,

33
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,120
while an ordinary man

34
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,800
can kill the one in front of him.

35
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,800
I'm not asking Your Majesty to

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,200
meddle in the affairs of
the Public Petitioners Drum Office.

37
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,120
I just wish

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,160
you would place yourself
in another woman's position

39
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,160
and guarantee her a fair trial.

40
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,880
After that, whether we win or lose,

41
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,640
Pan'er and I won't complain.

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,440
Deal.

43
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,000
Your Majesty, you may not know,

44
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,000
The Night Revels is authentic.

45
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,560
Zhao Pan'er managed to convince
His Majesty

46
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,880
that it was a counterfeit

47
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,840
and saved you from
a devastating disaster.

48
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,360
What?

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,920
Zhao Pan'er?

50
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,000
I once asked her,

51
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,760
"you don't even know Her Majesty,

52
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,440
why do you take the great risk
to help her?"

53
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,320
She gave me an answer.

54
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,120
She said,

55
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,880
she was once reduced to pariah, too.

56
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,320
She knew how helpless it felt.

57
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,160
She also knew,

58
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,000
it wasn't Your Majesty's fault.

59
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,320
The reason why you insist that

60
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,240
the Court of Judicial Review
must trial Qi Mu with severity

61
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,270
is because you want to warn
the other ministers

62
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,480
not to look down upon you

63
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,200
and slander you again.

64
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,080
The reason why Pan'er insists on
suing Ouyang Xu

65
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,000
is the same.

66
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,520
Do you still think she's ridiculous?

67
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,800
The acupuncture didn't wake her up.

68
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,280
What shall we do?

69
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,880
Don't worry.

70
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,520
She's going to be fine.

71
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,320
Sanniang,

72
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,960
the Gao Family sent us medicine.

73
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,960
This is the healing remedy

74
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,880
given by Emperor Taizong
to the ancestors of the Gao Family.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,880
It's very effective for
invigorating the circulation of blood.

76
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,080
Thanks.

77
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,080
Was it your master

78
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,320
or Miss Gao who sent you?

79
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,360
It was my master.

80
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,760
He said he had no other intentions.

81
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,880
He just admired Ms. Zhao's courage.

82
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,440
She was courageous before,

83
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,480
and she still is now.

84
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,080
Thank Inspector Gao for me.

85
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,360
Yes.

86
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,800
Pan'er,

87
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,000
you must wake up.

88
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,480
Don't let me down.

89
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,080
Don't let everyone down.

90
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,320
Pan'er.

91
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,480
Pan'er.

92
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,200
Pan'er is awake.

93
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,120
(I treat you with sincerity)

94
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,440
(while you respond to me with lies.)

95
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,200
(She was once reduced to pariah, too.)

96
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,720
(She knew how helpless it felt.)

97
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,560
(She also knew,)

98
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,360
(it wasn't Your Majesty's fault.)

99
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,360
Go to report.

100
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,680
I want to see His Majesty now.

101
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,560
Hurry.

102
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,520
Aye.

103
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,760
The trial starts.

104
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,080
Silence!

105
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,640
Move.

106
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,840
Step aside.

107
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,520
Please move.

108
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,720
I heard the case
got really big last time.

109
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,960
To ensure justice,

110
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,600
the imperial court changed the judge,

111
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,600
and made the trial open to the public.

112
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,400
Really?

113
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:58,920
Yes.

114
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,760
That's more like it.

115
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,000
Zhao Pan'er, do you still decide
to sue Ouyang Xu?

116
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Yes, I do.

117
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
Could she stand the floggings?

118
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,480
(Will she be flogged again?)

119
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,800
(She looks so pale.)

120
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,560
(Yes.)

121
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,920
(She's just a weak woman.)

122
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,560
(She'll be dead
before the second trial starts.)

123
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,320
(Could she survive it?)

124
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,440
(The floggings will kill her.)

125
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,400
(She is thin and weak.)

126
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,960
(Why didn't they pull their punches?)

127
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,760
(Yeah.)

128
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,280
(Seriously.)

129
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,440
(She can barely stand.)

130
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,280
Let the floggings commence..

131
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,120
First one.

132
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,440
Imperial edict!

133
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,520
What's going on?

134
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,200
Someone came.

135
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,360
Who is it?

136
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,360
I have no idea.

137
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,120
Verbal instructions of His Majesty.

138
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,440
To celebrate
the Empress's birthday,

139
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,720
from now on,

140
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,120
women can be exempted from floggings
by paying a fine.

141
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,920
By the Emperor.

142
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,240
Edict received.

143
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,400
Long live His Majesty!

144
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,640
Long live Her Majesty!

145
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,840
Long live His Majesty!

146
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,480
Long live Her Majesty!

147
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,080
I don't get it.

148
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,840
Does it mean
Pan'er won't be flogged?

149
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,760
No, she won't.

150
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,320
Thank you, Your Majesties.

151
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,360
Thank you, Your Majesty.

152
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,600
Silence!

153
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,560
Zhao Pan'er, do you have
30 strings of coins?

154
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,240
- Yes, we do.
- Yes.

155
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,400
We have money.

156
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,920
Zhaodi!

157
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,640
Zhaodi!

158
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,240
Get the money.

159
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,560
30 strings.

160
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,560
Chen Lian, 30 strings.

161
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,520
Yes.

162
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,480
Money...

163
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,120
I didn't take money. What shall we do?

164
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,720
I have some.

165
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,120
Who has money? Give me.

166
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,520
We didn't take money.

167
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,560
People of the Chi Family,
pool your money.

168
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,160
Pool your money, Sun Li.

169
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,000
That's not enough. We need 30 strings.

170
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,120
Hold on.

171
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,400
My friends and I pooled our money.

172
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,440
We want to help Ms. Zhao, too.

173
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,800
Like her,

174
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,280
we want the unfaithful man
to be punished.

175
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,000
Who else has money? Hurry up.

176
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,480
Me too. This is my pocket money.

177
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,360
Here you are.

178
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,520
We got the money!

179
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,400
I want to help, too.

180
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,320
I appreciate that

181
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,800
Ms. Zhao treated us for tea before.

182
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,280
Thanks.

183
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,320
Apologize to Ms. Zhao for me.

184
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,200
I shouldn't have
slandered her in public.

185
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,320
She isn't lowly at all.

186
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,680
On the contrary, she is a heroine.

187
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,360
Yeah, we shouldn't have
spoken evil of her.

188
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,800
Do apologize to her for us.

189
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,830
Hurry.

190
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,240
Mine too.

191
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,320
Thanks.

192
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,680
- This is mine. Take it.
- Thanks.

193
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,280
And mine.

194
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,840
Thanks, everyone.

195
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,440
Here you are.

196
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,760
Thanks.

197
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
Hurry!

198
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,920
Hurry!

199
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,880
Thanks, everyone.

200
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,320
Thanks, everyone.

201
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,400
Thanks, everyone.

202
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,000
Let me in.

203
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,560
All right.

204
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,240
Send the money to the court for me.

205
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,840
Thanks.

206
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,480
The money is ready.

207
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,120
Here it is.

208
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,200
The money is ready.

209
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,120
Here it is.

210
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,080
In that case,

211
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,160
I permit you to pay 30 strings
to get exemption from 14 floggings.

212
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,040
Bring forth the Controller-general
of Xinzhou, Ouyang Xu.

213
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,040
Go.

214
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,840
Pan'er.

215
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,240
Pan'er, you won't be beaten.

216
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,240
You won't be beaten.

217
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,720
Silence!

218
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,480
Her Majesty has made arrangements.

219
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,560
She wouldn't let Zhao Pan'er
have her way, right?

220
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,520
Ouyang Xu,

221
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,680
have you read Zhao Pan'er's plaint?

222
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,120
Your Honor,

223
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,280
the words on her plaint are all lies.

224
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,840
Zhao Pan'er was an official performer.

225
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,360
Though she has dropped pariah status,

226
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,480
she is close to another
official performer,

227
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,360
which makes her no different from
the performers in the theaters.

228
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,440
You...

229
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,920
As a scholar,

230
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,760
I just met her by chance.

231
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,920
I couldn't have been engaged to her.

232
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,200
Zhao Pan'er,

233
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,880
you said you were engaged to
Ouyang Xu.

234
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,080
Do you have evidence?

235
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,120
My neighbors, Ms. Sun
and Ms. Song can testify for me.

236
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,040
Both of them are
Zhao Pan'er's business partners.

237
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,080
They have a common interest.

238
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,960
How could they tell the truth?

239
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,680
As the Presented Scholar,
I can testify for her.

240
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,600
Ouyang Xu once asked me
to persuade Ms. Zhao

241
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,960
to break their engagement and
be his concubine.

242
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,960
You're now Sun Sanniang's lover.

243
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,520
Of course you'll speak for her.

244
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,360
Your Honor,

245
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,600
it requires a matchmaker, a contract
and betrothal gifts to get engaged.

246
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,600
Zhao Pan'er has none of those.

247
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,000
By colluding with several
men and women,

248
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,080
she tries to frame me up.

249
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,200
She is extremely vicious!

250
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,280
Zhao Pan'er, do you have
the marriage contract and betrothal gifts?

251
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,960
The contract was destroyed
by Ouyang Xu.

252
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,280
But I have another piece of evidence.

253
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,880
Present it.

254
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,040
It lists the native places of Ouyang Xu,
his parents and grandparents

255
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,080
(Native Places of Ouyang Family)
and his birth date.

256
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,240
Your Honor,

257
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,440
if he wasn't engaged to me,

258
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,360
how would I know

259
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,160
his native place and birth date?

260
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,760
The secret information

261
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,680
can be easily checked out

262
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,600
in his personal files.

263
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,360
Ouyang Xu,

264
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,440
you said repeatedly that
you didn't know me well.

265
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,320
Are you such a frivolous man

266
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,520
that you would tell
your mother's maiden name

267
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,240
to a random woman?

268
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,720
Ouyang Xu,

269
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,520
how do you defend yourself?

270
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,360
I might...

271
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,440
I might have been drunk

272
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,280
and joked about marrying her.

273
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,320
It was my fault.
I deserve to be punished.

274
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,400
But according to the law,

275
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,080
a man who repents himself isn't guilty.

276
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,590
Ms. Zhao, please forgive me.

277
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,520
I won't accept

278
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,720
your perfunctory apology.

279
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,240
Please see my plaint clearly.

280
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,070
I sue you not only
for breaking our engagement,

281
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,590
but also for slander and fraud.

282
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,200
She's right.

283
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,830
To congratulate Ms. Zhao
on her engagement,

284
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,160
I gave her an inkstone that was
handed down from my ancestors.

285
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,600
There are characters saying
"Kept by Princes and Nobles".

286
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,520
My family name, Sun,
is inscribed on its back.

287
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,360
After Ouyang Xu broke
their engagement,

288
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,760
he took it away
and refused to return it.

289
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,240
When we went to him to get it back,

290
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,480
he hired some thugs,

291
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,960
trying to drive us
out of the Eastern Capital.

292
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm the head of the hired thugs.

293
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,720
Lies. They're all lies.

294
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,240
Before Ouyang Xu left the city,

295
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,800
he asked his servants to pawn
his family properties.

296
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,240
The inkstone was one of them.

297
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
Here's the pawn ticket and the inkstone.

298
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,080
Present them.

299
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,660
(Sun)

300
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,320
An inkstone of the Tang Dynasty
is received.

301
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,760
The inscription reads
"Kept by Princes and Nobles".

302
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,400
The inscription on the back is "Sun".

303
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,800
Pawn for six strings of coins.

304
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,040
Owner, Ouyang Xu.

305
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,120
Your Honor,

306
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,040
Ouyang Xu was first engaged to me,
then gained my property by cheating.

307
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,040
I asked for it several times.

308
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,480
But he refused to return it.

309
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,480
According to the law,

310
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,760
fraud is equal to theft.

311
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,200
One who steals things worth of
over five strings should be decapitated.

312
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,000
Decapitate him.

313
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,560
Decapitate!

314
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,680
Silence!

315
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,640
Kill him.

316
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,000
Your Majesty,
I made a huge mistake that day.

317
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,440
We're an old married couple.

318
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,600
You needn't apologize.

319
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,960
It isn't that bad, though.

320
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,760
It isn't late.

321
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,680
But still, I don't want Qi Mu
to get away with it.

322
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,120
In the first place,

323
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,320
I fell for you

324
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,200
and chose you to be the Empress
in spite of the ministers' opposition,

325
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,400
not because you were obedient,

326
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,880
but because you were capable

327
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,840
and ambitious.

328
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,240
You know,

329
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,840
I'm not an emperor with great talent
or bold vision.

330
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,920
I admire

331
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,480
the qualities of you

332
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,520
that I don't possess.

333
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,760
As long as you can

334
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,080
stand up to people's scrutiny,

335
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,200
you can take whatever means necessary.

336
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,320
You should know,

337
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,440
Great Song is not only my family,

338
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,800
but also your family.

339
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,280
Gaining the gift by cheating
and refusing to return it

340
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,560
are definitely fraud.

341
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,400
Ouyang Xu,

342
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,640
how do you defend yourself?

343
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,480
No.

344
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,800
I didn't refuse to return it.

345
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,000
They were lying!

346
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,120
It's worthy of only six strings.

347
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,520
I'm the Third Graduate.

348
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,680
Why would I be greedy
for such worthless stuff?

349
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,040
I just forgot it.

350
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,640
It was Zhao Pan'er.

351
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,000
She set all the traps.

352
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,080
She wants to retaliate against me.

353
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,320
She wants me to die!

354
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,120
How could you be so cruel?

355
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,720
How did you come up
with such a vicious scheme?

356
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,720
I should thank you
for mocking me that day.

357
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,680
Ouyang,

358
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,960
are you such a coward

359
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,280
that you dare not answer my charges?

360
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,840
Zhao Pan'er, you think
you know the law well.

361
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,160
But you don't know...

362
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,920
To practice law
is different from the law.

363
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,080
You reminded me.

364
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,960
To sue you for breaking the engagement

365
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,720
may not bring you to justice.

366
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,280
But to sue you for cheating me
out of money

367
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,720
will make a solid case.

368
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,560
Ouyang Xu, I want you to die,

369
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,200
like you grabbed me by the neck,

370
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,600
trying to kill me

371
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,480
in your house that day.

372
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,600
I didn't!

373
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,640
I didn't try to kill you.

374
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,800
I didn't!

375
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,880
Someone!

376
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,960
Help me!

377
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,720
Zhao Pan'er,

378
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,280
you accuse Ouyang Xu
of trying to murder you.

379
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,080
Do you have any evidence?

380
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,440
No!

381
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,400
She ran away that day.

382
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,560
How could she have evidence?

383
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,720
Who told you so?

384
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,680
Here is the evidence.

385
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,800
Yinzhang, where have you been?

386
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,600
I found the evidence.

387
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,600
Your Honor, I heard that

388
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,360
two of Ouyang Xu's servants
were killed by bandits.

389
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,840
I went to the public morgue
where their bodies were kept.

390
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,680
I found a music score

391
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,920
from the boy servant's body.

392
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,560
Present it.

393
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,560
Buxu Tune?

394
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,920
The tune is played

395
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,360
while Taoist priests practice rituals.

396
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,000
The boy servant

397
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,880
was a Taoist in the Western Capital.

398
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,760
I work in the Music Division
and know well of music and tunes.

399
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,920
I thought something wasn't right
when I read it.

400
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,600
The lyrics

401
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,320
don't match with

402
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,360
the musical notation at all.

403
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,800
Then I read the faulty

404
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,640
music score carefully.

405
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,800
I found that connecting
the first characters,

406
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,280
(Ouyang Xu killed me)
you'll read, Ouyang Xu killed me.

407
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,640
The music score has "Ziyang Temple"
on its back.

408
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,320
I found

409
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,960
there is only one Ziyang Temple
in the city,

410
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,280
which happens to be
around Ouyang Xu's house.

411
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,520
I went to the temple

412
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,960
and found the Taoist boy's note
under a cattail hassock.

413
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,920
I didn't.

414
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,560
The boy saw Ouyang Xu
accidentally killed Uncle De.

415
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,200
He also knew he tried to buy killers

416
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,720
to retaliate against Ms. Zhao.

417
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,520
He was afraid

418
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,720
he would also be killed someday.

419
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,440
So he wrote the codes

420
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
on the music score

421
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,560
in hope of it being found
by some careful person one day.

422
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,240
Though Ouyang Xu is well-read,

423
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,320
he doesn't know about music and tunes.

424
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,080
So he didn't find the secret.

425
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,040
I didn't. I didn't.

426
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,920
Your Honor.

427
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,560
Well done!

428
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,560
If Ms. Song told the truth,

429
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,640
the Taoist boy

430
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,400
was probably killed by Ouyang Xu.

431
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,040
Please carry postmortem on the boy

432
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,320
and the other servant.

433
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,600
I didn't kill anyone.

434
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,240
I didn't.

435
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,720
They try to entrap me.

436
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,560
They all want me to die.

437
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,760
I wasn't wrong.

438
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
I didn't kill anyone!

439
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,400
Chi Pan, Gu Qianfan and I

440
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,600
were almost killed that day.

441
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,760
Ouyang Xu must have plotted it.

442
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,360
Your Honor, any Taoist priest

443
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,920
can check out my words easily.

444
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,560
Your Honor, I can testify, too.

445
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,760
He almost killed me.

446
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,480
Lies!

447
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,080
All lies!

448
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:00,920
Your Honor, please look into it.

449
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,840
- Your Honor, you can't!
- He must have killed them.

450
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,120
I didn't!

451
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,720
Ouyang Xu, how dare you!

452
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,400
Guards, take him down!

453
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,560
Take him down!

454
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,120
Take him!

455
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,280
Take him!

456
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,840
Take him!

457
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,400
Take him quickly!

458
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,440
Guards!

459
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,920
I can't be excused to disturb
Your Majesties.

460
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,480
Long live Your Majesties.

461
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,640
Rise.

462
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,280
All rise.

463
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,880
I've never killed a gentry before.

464
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,840
But you rat!

465
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,720
You don't deserve to be gentry.

466
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,120
Give my orders.

467
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,760
Remove Ouyang Xu from his position.

468
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,560
Send him to the palace jail.

469
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,840
No.

470
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,320
To the Capital Security Office.

471
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,560
Gu Qianfan.

472
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,720
Make a thorough investigation.

473
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

474
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,040
Your Majesties.

475
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,760
Your Majesty.

476
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,360
Good!

477
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,000
She won.

478
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,920
Pan'er won.

479
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,200
Pan'er won.

480
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:51,960
Great!

481
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,050
Great!

482
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,160
Really!

483
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,360
What a fraud.

484
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,680
Shame on you!

485
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,800
Get lost!

486
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,400
Immoral man!

487
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,160
Villain!

488
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,320
Go to die! Hit him!

489
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,960
Hit him.

490
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,480
Unfaithful man!

491
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,240
Ms. Zhao, Ms. Sun and Ms. Song,

492
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,240
you solved a murder today.

493
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,600
You've made great contributions.

494
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,640
I'll grant each of you a wish.

495
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,880
Feel free to tell me.

496
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,280
Who shall tell first?

497
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,080
Ms. Sun, you first.

498
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,880
Me?

499
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,320
No, I... I...

500
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,040
don't have special wishes.

501
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,240
I just hope Your Majesty

502
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,840
to come to Yong'an Restaurant often

503
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,200
and try my new recipes.

504
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,680
Nevertheless,

505
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,400
if Your Majesty

506
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,560
would grant me with
a chaplet and an official robe,

507
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,120
and let me marry in style,

508
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,000
there's nothing I'd like better.

509
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,520
Granted.

510
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,560
Thank you, Your Majesty.

511
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

512
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:38,920
Rise.

513
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,000
Ms. Song, what about you?

514
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,840
Your Majesty,

515
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,840
I wish the Drum Office will keep open.

516
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,000
I wish there are fewer floggings
and more opportunities for airing views.

517
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,960
Breaking the ranks to file suits

518
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,920
shouldn't be the reason that
innocent people must risk their lives

519
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,600
to right their injustices
just like Pan'er.

520
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,000
Good.

521
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,680
You're really worthy of
Minister Ke's praise.

522
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,000
Granted.

523
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

524
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,040
Rise.

525
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,840
Your Majesty,

526
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,400
what about the lady of our Zhao clan?

527
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,200
Don't worry.

528
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
I won't forget her.

529
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,360
Ms. Zhao,

530
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,040
what's your wish?

531
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,760
Well...

532
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,240
My wish is about state affairs.

533
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,400
May Your Majesty forgive my boldness.

534
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,840
Because of my father's guilt,

535
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,960
I was implicated and
reduced to an official performer.

536
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,320
But my father died of saving the people.

537
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,080
Ms. Song came from a family
of music performers,

538
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,120
but she's never fallen into bad habits.

539
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,520
She is only engrossed in music skills.

540
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,160
Me and Ouyang Xu,

541
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,000
who is the lowly one
and who is the noble one?

542
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,400
The reason why I must sue Ouyang Xu

543
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
is because I want to prove

544
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,640
pariahs aren't necessarily lowly.

545
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,360
People say don't judge a man
by his background.

546
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,240
But no matter men or women,

547
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,480
once they're reduced to pariahs,

548
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,760
they can hardly rise again.

549
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,040
They can't decide on their marriages.

550
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,120
They always feel inferior.

551
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,960
Your Majesty, I'm begging you

552
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,240
to exempt all music performers,
craftsmen,

553
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,680
private and official servants

554
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,680
from the sufferings of being pariahs.

555
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,480
Your Majesty, show mercy.

556
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,200
Your Majesty, please show mercy.

557
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,200
I also beg Your Majesty to show mercy.

558
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,120
Darling, get up.

559
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,440
Your Majesty, please show mercy.

560
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
Enough, all rise.

561
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

562
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,040
The status system has originated
from the Qin and Han Dynasties.

563
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,040
Though I've long intended
to change it,

564
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
I'm afraid

565
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,400
I can't succeed at one stroke.

566
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,000
It takes several emperors' efforts.

567
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,280
You know what,

568
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,720
I'll grant you one thing.

569
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,080
From now on, the best
of the music performers and craftsmen

570
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,120
can enter the Palace Domestic Service
and the National Academy

571
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,600
and be granted as Palace Servitor.

572
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,080
Once become officials,

573
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,320
they won't be pariahs again.

574
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,120
Official and private servants

575
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,720
who have made contributions
and done good deeds for a long term

576
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,960
can apply to the civil authorities.

577
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,120
The court will decide
on the merits of each case.

578
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,120
Palace Servitor Song,

579
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,630
what do you think?

580
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,360
Thank you, Your Majesty.

581
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

582
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,120
All right. Get up.

583
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,960
According to the Palace Women,

584
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,160
though Commissioner Gu
is the Living Devil,

585
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,240
he's still a good husband.

586
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,280
If Gu Qianfan bullies you in the future,

587
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,120
I'll support you.

588
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,560
I won't

589
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,200
give Your Majesty the chance.

590
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,560
Forget it.

591
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,880
Let's mind our own business.

592
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,560
Great!
