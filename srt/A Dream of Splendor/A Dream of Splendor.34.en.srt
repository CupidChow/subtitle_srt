16
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,700
=Episode 34=

17
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,520
It's a painting

18
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,080
depicting the night banquet held by Xue Que,
Transport Commissioner of Xichuan Region.

19
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,160
The man in the seat is Xue Que.

20
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,480
The others are his music performers.

21
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,200
Your Majesty, please look carefully.

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,360
Doesn't the female drummer

23
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,280
look familiar to you?

24
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,080
She just

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,960
looks like my empress.

26
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,600
Is this your so-called evidence?

27
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,080
Do you know

28
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,760
slandering the Empress is
an unforgivable capital offense?

29
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,640
Your Majesty, you promoted me.

30
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,800
So I'm not scared of death.

31
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,280
Your Majesty,

32
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,280
Wang Ai likes to hide clues
in his paintings.

33
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,480
Look, Your Majesty.

34
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,880
In this painting, the pattern
on every performer's dress

35
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,280
hides her name.

36
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,640
The other day, I came to the Palace

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,000
and ran into Her Majesty.

38
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,480
I felt like I saw her somewhere before.

39
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,880
Later, I saw the name "Liu Wan"
on the drummer's dress

40
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
and I felt suspicious.

41
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,400
After verification of all sides,

42
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,840
I finally dared to tell you about this

43
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,560
even if I knew this was inappropriate.

44
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,280
Your Majesty,

45
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,240
when the late emperor
made Her Majesty your concubine,

46
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,880
she was from a decent family,
according to the imperial edict.

47
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,880
But if she was Xue Que's
music performer,

48
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,560
she turned out to be a pariah.

49
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,480
If she served customers with her body,

50
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,000
she was in no way chaste.

51
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,920
If she deceived Your Majesty,

52
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,960
she was in no way loyal.

53
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,760
Shut up!

54
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,120
This is a load of codswallop!

55
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,800
My empress is

56
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,520
chaste and loyal.

57
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,040
She has a very good reputation

58
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,600
in the imperial harem!

59
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,240
How dare a minor official like you

60
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,280
humiliate her without evidence!

61
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,280
Your Majesty, the Empress is dissolute.

62
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,560
She deceived the late emperor
and then you.

63
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,680
Her offence is inexcusable.

64
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,480
Get lost. Get lost!

65
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,680
Somebody!

66
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,360
Throw him out!

67
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,000
Aye.

68
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,280
Stay away!

69
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,360
Your Majesty, I always know

70
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,320
that you and Her Majesty get along well
and love each other.

71
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,800
But I work for you, Your Majesty.

72
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,200
I was first the Third Graduate
and then a censor.

73
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,400
I have to impeach Her Majesty
even if this may offend you.

74
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,320
But I'm doing this to rectify virtues!

75
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,160
I don't want you to keep being deceived

76
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,000
by such a humble lady

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,280
and let her do harm to our nation!

78
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,120
Your Majesty,

79
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,960
I have no supporters in the court.

80
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,280
It's been only a few days

81
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,680
since I resumed my post
in the Eastern Capital.

82
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,200
If you think

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,640
I'm deliberately slandering the Empress,

84
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,920
I will apologize with my life.

85
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,640
He... He's bleeding so much.

86
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,720
Your Majesty,

87
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,320
honest advice is always hard to take.

88
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,520
But ancient wise emperors

89
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,925
were always generous enough to take it.

90
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:08,680
Pan'er,

91
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,600
I have some confusion.

92
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,160
You didn't do big business before.

93
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,960
But why are you so familiar

94
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,360
with opening a restaurant

95
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,320
in such a different way?

96
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,280
I'm not very familiar, actually.

97
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,240
I used to work in the Music Bureau.

98
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,520
I went to many restaurants.

99
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,480
As I've seen a lot of them,

100
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,080
I manage to have different ideas.

101
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,880
Take ordinary restaurants for example.

102
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,560
They want everything to be perfect.

103
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,400
I can do different kinds of things,

104
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,040
but can't do any of them perfectly.

105
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,040
So, I have to make things special.

106
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,320
Speaking of dishes,

107
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,920
chefs at Pan House

108
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,880
make better dishes than Sanniang.

109
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,000
But our feature

110
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,880
lies in the favor of Jiangnan Region.

111
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,200
The food is fresh and exquisite.

112
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,320
It's not limited, either.

113
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,880
When customers grow tired,

114
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,120
we'll change it into the flavor
of the northwest in three months.

115
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
Speaking of wine,

116
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,280
we can't make wine, anyway.

117
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,400
We have to use the medium-quality wine
bought from Li Qing's tavern.

118
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,080
But as we put expensive spice in it,

119
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,600
the wine tastes very special.

120
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,880
Yinzhang's pipa and games in Wazi

121
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,120
can be seen in all restaurants,

122
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,600
but not all of them
and not quality ones.

123
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,400
I just present them

124
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,960
in a new way.

125
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,640
Good point.

126
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,760
This is how I usually instruct He Si
and other subordinates.

127
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
I tell them that the coach of the ball

128
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,560
is not always the best player.

129
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,560
However,

130
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,840
he must be very experienced.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,080
He knows how to arrange players

132
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,320
and how to attack or defend.

133
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,800
This makes him the backbone of the team.

134
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,920
Sounds interesting.

135
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,720
Pan'er,

136
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,760
you're good at doing business.

137
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,400
I'm the head of 12 Guilds.

138
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,920
We both play the ball.

139
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,440
We play dice, too.

140
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,880
Why don't you be my girlfriend?

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,160
Anyway, Gu Qianfan...

142
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,720
All right. All right.

143
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,480
Fine. I'll stop.

144
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,480
Don't hit me.

145
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,000
I don't mean to flirt with you.

146
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,160
Never mind. Forget it.

147
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,400
Wait.

148
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,040
Instead of thinking about this,

149
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,600
why don't you find a quiet place
and think about

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,120
how to get more business opportunities
for Yong'an Restaurant?

151
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,080
I'm too stupid
to find business opportunities.

152
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,760
If I could have good ideas,

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,080
what would I need you for?

154
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,840
He Si, are you loafing round?

155
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,200
See how I'll punish you!

156
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,440
Officer Ouyang broke his skull.

157
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,720
There's extravasated blood in his head.

158
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,880
Luckily, his life is not in danger.

159
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,919
He's kind of straightforward.

160
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,960
I won't punish him, then.

161
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,760
Have the Imperial Physician
send him back to his house

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,920
where he can recuperate.

163
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,800
Ask him to speak less and stay indoors.

164
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,880
Give him a hundred gold coins.

165
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,920
Aye.

166
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,920
Your Majesty, are you
having a headache again?

167
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,475
Mm.

168
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:54,675
Do you want some pills?

169
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,280
Go. Go get the Imperial Physician.

170
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,480
Aye.

171
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,640
Your Majesty, please wait.

172
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,680
The Imperial Physician is coming soon.

173
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,280
I can't wait.

174
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,840
Bring him here now.

175
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,320
My head is to explode.

176
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,400
What are you waiting for?

177
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,680
Get him here!

178
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,440
- Take care, Your Majesty.
- Take care, Your Majesty.

179
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,840
Your Majesty, I have something

180
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,480
that may relieve your pain.

181
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,280
Wine?

182
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,240
Hurry.

183
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,320
Come on.

184
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,760
Don't do stupid things.

185
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,360
Minister...

186
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,960
Your Majesty, please drink some.

187
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,960
What's this? I...

188
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,400
I haven't tested it yet.

189
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,920
Come on. Give it to me.

190
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,520
Your Majesty, this...

191
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,320
You!

192
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,560
Minister Lin, what's this?

193
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,680
Wine. Styrax Curcuma Wine.

194
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,000
Styrax and Curcuma are
special spices from Nanyang.

195
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,160
The wine activates blood circulation,
and relieves pain and depression.

196
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,440
It's said that drinking this wine

197
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,880
will make you feel as great as God.

198
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,650
It worked.

199
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,000
It indeed worked.

200
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,240
- Take care, Your Majesty. We'll take our leave.
- Take care, Your Majesty. We'll take our leave.

201
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,610
(I've been trying my best
to cover for my empress.)

202
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,080
(Why can't the officials
just let her go?)

203
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,400
Your Majesty,

204
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,320
Her Majesty heard you didn't feel well

205
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,480
and she's waiting out there...

206
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,120
I won't see her.

207
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,200
I don't want to worry her.

208
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,400
Aye.

209
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,240
Your Majesty, would you like some soup?

210
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,800
No.

211
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,400
You...

212
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,040
Ask Lin Pin to get me

213
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,320
more of this wine.

214
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,920
This wine

215
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,680
has a strong aroma and is mellow.

216
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,640
It heals my headache, too.

217
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,000
I wonder if he kept this wine personally

218
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,360
or bought it somewhere.

219
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Your Majesty,

220
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,600
it's Styrax Curcuma Wine
of Yong'an Restaurant.

221
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,840
Where the Flower and Moon Banquet
is held?

222
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,600
Yes.

223
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,640
What did he just say?

224
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,680
Feel as great as what?

225
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,360
Drinking this wine
will make you feel as great as God.

226
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:12,200
Sounds interesting.

227
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,000
Very well. You do it.

228
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,120
Buy some wine for me.

229
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,000
Ah?

230
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,960
What?

231
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,280
Am I asking for too much?

232
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,000
No.

233
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,600
I asked Minister Lin about the wine.

234
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,600
It's the secret wine in Yiyuan Pavilion
of Yong'an Restaurant.

235
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,440
It's only sold to customers
who have meals there.

236
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,200
Minister Lin went there
for the second time

237
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,920
so he was given a little pot of it.

238
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,040
I heard Chamberlain Chen
also wanted to buy the wine.

239
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,560
But the owner Ms. Zhao rejected him

240
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,920
because it was against their rule.

241
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,600
Even Chamberlain Chen was rejected?

242
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,480
The owner of Yong'an Restaurant

243
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,040
seems to be dauntless.

244
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,760
Yeah.

245
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,640
Ms. Song is another owner
of Yong'an Restaurant.

246
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,400
She's the coach at the Pipa Branch
of the Music Division.

247
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,600
At Minister Xiao's birthday banquet,

248
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,080
Minister Ke wrote
"strength of character"

249
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,080
on her pipa.

250
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,200
Ke Zheng seldom
writes anything for people.

251
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,200
But he wrote something
for a music performer?

252
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,320
Yeah.

253
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,920
Your Majesty, when you feel better,

254
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,280
you can summon her to perform.

255
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,480
I don't want to wait.

256
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,920
I'm going right now.

257
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,360
Let's enjoy the pipa and wine.

258
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,080
We can also experience

259
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,440
how great it feels.

260
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,400
Ah?

261
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,880
Come on.

262
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,680
Does it sound surprising?

263
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,840
No, not at all.

264
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,480
Is this the register
of people going in and out?

265
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,160
Yes.

266
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,700
(Register of People Going in
and out of the Imperial Palace)

267
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,988
(With the pass, Matron Cui left
with four palace maids...)

268
00:14:06,988 --> 00:14:08,988
(With the pass granted by the Empress,
Matron Li left in a carriage...)

269
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,440
Keep a close eye.

270
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,800
Don't let anything go wrong.

271
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,560
Aye.

272
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,880
Is your foot all right?

273
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,120
I'm good.

274
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,480
By the way, Kong Wu,

275
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,160
are you married?

276
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,800
My child is already three years old.

277
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,080
When you quarrel with your wife

278
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,040
and she doesn't let you explain,

279
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,440
how do you usually make her happy?

280
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,200
Chief, did you...?

281
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,240
There is no good way.

282
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,920
Just remember one thing,
keep pestering her.

283
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,160
Besides,

284
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,040
you have to make her
always worry about you.

285
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,480
As long as she cares about you,

286
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,640
torturing yourself will always work.

287
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,080
Young Master, I have a question.

288
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,520
You used to

289
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,240
hate Ms. Zhao, right?

290
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,160
Why do you take orders from her now?

291
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,800
I count on her
to make Yong'an Restaurant prosper.

292
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,760
Even so, she can't keep ordering us
to do odd jobs all the time.

293
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,440
Zhao Haohao often lost her temper, too.

294
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,880
You were never as docile as you are now.

295
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,040
They're totally different.

296
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,160
Zhao Haohao ordered me about

297
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,520
just because she was a drama queen.

298
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,880
She didn't think
I pampered her or loved her

299
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,160
unless I yielded to her.

300
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,440
But Pan'er is different.

301
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,680
She orders me about

302
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,120
for the good of Yong'an Restaurant.

303
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,360
Got it?

304
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,125
Oh.

305
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,880
Hey!

306
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,000
Sir,

307
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,400
are you coming to Yong'an Restaurant?

308
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,520
Yes.

309
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,240
Do you have a reservation?

310
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,760
No.

311
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,360
But we have
Finance Minister Lin's name card.

312
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,200
Please kindly let us in.

313
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,160
His name card doesn't work!

314
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,080
Without a reservation, we can't...

315
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,680
We can't give you

316
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,200
the private room in the east
with the best view!

317
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,880
But you can have one in the west!

318
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,600
Anchor the boat, please.

319
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,000
This is against the rule.

320
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,840
Thank you.

321
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,120
Don't be silly.

322
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,920
Why would we reject profits?

323
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,880
Go. Get the private room ready.

324
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:20,826
Oh.

325
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,520
This way, please, sir.

326
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,720
All right.

327
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,840
Pan'er, we've got an honored customer.

328
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
This way, please.

329
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,760
All right.

330
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,200
Watch out for the wet floor.

331
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,790
It's all right.

332
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:10,800
Go.

333
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,839
Rain Room. Come in, please.

334
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,040
Rain Room.

335
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,880
It's a good name.

336
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,000
Bring them all the best dishes
Sanniang makes.

337
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,200
Who is that old man?

338
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,320
Why could he come in
with a mere name card?

339
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,160
What old man?

340
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,760
Didn't you notice the husky voice

341
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,920
of his valet?

342
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,320
Throughout the Eastern Capital,

343
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,920
what kind of men
needs to speak like that?

344
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,440
I'm sure

345
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,480
this man is richer than me.

346
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,760
Let's make a lot of money from him!

347
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,120
Thank you.

348
00:17:56,925 --> 00:18:00,240
(Upright and Ambitious)

349
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,560
(Renewing of Mind, Talented and Virtuous)
Sir, what would you like to order?

350
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
We have...

351
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,600
We don't need to see the samples.

352
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
We don't need the menu, either.

353
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,960
Just make three or four specialties

354
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,400
of the Flower and Moon Banquet.

355
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,600
And the amazing Styrax Curcuma Wine...

356
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,560
A pot of that, please.

357
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,600
You turn out to be gourmets.

358
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,400
What tea would you like, sir?

359
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,000
Dragon and Phoenix Ball Tea.

360
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,160
What about you?

361
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,480
Me?

362
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,480
People's tastes vary.

363
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,200
Don't bother about me.

364
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,840
How about this?

365
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,880
Your voice sounds a little bit husky.

366
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,960
Have some Licorice Drink
to moisten your throat.

367
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,160
Please wait a moment.

368
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,200
Look. This room is elegantly decorated.

369
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,800
It gives a feeling of human touch.

370
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,280
These calligraphy and paintings
look offbeat, too.

371
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,960
I quite agree.

372
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,680
This seems to be

373
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,920
a very good restaurant.

374
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,320
But Your Ma...

375
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,120
By riverside are cooing...

376
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,200
A pair of turtledoves.

377
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,480
Great.

378
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,480
You flatter me.

379
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,960
You've made progress.

380
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,400
I asked Sanniang to cook the dishes

381
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,440
for their meal herself.

382
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,040
But Pan'er,

383
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,280
who is that man?

384
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,600
Why must we treat him so respectfully?

385
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,680
I don't know who he is.

386
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,240
But I smelt the ambergris

387
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,240
from his robe.

388
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,320
I only smelt it from the pomander

389
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,240
Princess Qian gave Yinzhang.

390
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,320
He just looks like a big shot.

391
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,000
We must entertain him more warmly.

392
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,680
If the imperial clansman thinks highly
of our restaurant,

393
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,560
maybe His Majesty will come tomorrow.

394
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,200
Right?

395
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,400
Styrax Curcuma Wine.

396
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,000
Moonlit Night over the Bridges.

397
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,240
It's made from fresh lotus root paste.

398
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,000
Where Can Seafarers Find Fairy Isles.

399
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,120
Tastes great. Great.

400
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,280
Isn't it just abalone in tofu?

401
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,360
I hear each piece costs 50 strings

402
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,200
in your restaurant.

403
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,520
You just gave it

404
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,760
an elegant name.

405
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,880
Isn't it way too expensive?

406
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,120
Poems in the Book of Poetry

407
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,320
eulogize the same people and things.

408
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,880
Court Hymns

409
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,360
are for kings and nations.

410
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,960
Ballads, however,

411
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,600
are only for common people.

412
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,120
This is great.

413
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,120
You've read the Book of Poetry?

414
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,600
A little bit.

415
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,800
The dishes are good.

416
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,840
Interesting.

417
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,560
But these are not dishes

418
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,440
for the Flower and Moon Banquet, right?

419
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,080
Besides,

420
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,840
why isn't Ms. Song playing pipa

421
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,560
in this room?

422
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,000
Oh, you noticed that.

423
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,080
When you came in,

424
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,120
I saw you putting your hand
on your forehead.

425
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,240
And you ordered

426
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,800
Styrax Curcuma Wine.

427
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,920
I guess

428
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,120
you don't feel very well.

429
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,280
So, without your permission,

430
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,920
I asked our chef
to make a few more signature dishes.

431
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,440
Moonlit Night over the Bridges.

432
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,120
It's made of lotus leaves and mints.

433
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,320
Where Can Seafarers Find Fairy Isles.

434
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,920
It's made of abalones.

435
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,400
They both work perfectly
to relieve internal heat.

436
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,240
And Styrax Curcuma Wine is strong.

437
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,760
All together they make up
a perfect meal.

438
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,960
It's so scrupulous of you.

439
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,000
Thank you for not blaming me.

440
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,560
As for pipa...

441
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's not that Ms. Song is loafing.

442
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,680
Actually, I think you're a quiet man.

443
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,520
So, I asked her to play the pipa
outside the room

444
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,440
to harmonize with the night scenes.

445
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,800
Why do you think I'm a quiet man?

446
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,280
Because when I have a headache,

447
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,240
I don't want Ms. Song
to practice pipa in my room, either.

448
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,000
Even if she's the coach
at the Pipa Branch.

449
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,760
I'll just kick her out.

450
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,920
That's interesting.

451
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,160
Be seated and let's chat.

452
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,680
Ma'am,

453
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,160
what shall I call you?

454
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,320
Zhao is my family name.

455
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,160
The first name
among Hundred Family Surnames.

456
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,160
What a coincidence!

457
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,640
We share

458
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,880
the same family name.

459
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,840
I'm honored.

460
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,680
You appear to be
a long-lived and lucky man.

461
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,840
I'm a mere civilian.

462
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,160
All I can do is fill your cup here.

463
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,440
Where are you from?

464
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,080
I'm from Dengzhou.

465
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,200
I grew up in Qiantang County.

466
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,360
I've been in the Eastern Capital
for less than half a year.

467
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,040
Qiantang County?

468
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,640
There's a Transport Assistant
of Liangzhe Region,

469
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,600
Yang Zhiyuan.

470
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,920
He lived in Qiantang County, too.

471
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,920
Do you know him?

472
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,640
Chief.

473
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,680
Chief, something is fishy.

474
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,280
At sunset,

475
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,040
a carriage went out
through Gongchen Gate.

476
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,640
Duty Officer Chen in the carriage
held the token from His Majesty.

477
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,880
Guards at Gongchen Chen
didn't dare to check the carriage, then.

478
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,880
But just now in the Imperial Garden,

479
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,160
two palace maids said

480
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:21,845
that His Majesty seemed
to have left in disguise.

481
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,040
Did His Majesty ask for dinner tonight?

482
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,880
No.

483
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,240
It's the duty of the Imperial Guards
to protect His Majesty.

484
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,400
But if His Majesty gets in trouble
out of the Palace,

485
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,200
we can't get away, either.

486
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,360
Well, let's go separately.

487
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,360
I'm going to ask
the Imperial Guards on duty.

488
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,640
And you...

489
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,440
Gather all the spies in the Eastern Palace
to track down that carriage.

490
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,680
The bit of the imperial horse
has double rings.

491
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,600
It's easy to tell.

492
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,760
Mr. Yang Zhiyuan is a good man.

493
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,120
Unfortunately, he died young.

494
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,480
Do you know him, too?

495
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,320
I often visited him before.

496
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,250
You often visited him?

497
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,200
I had a teahouse in Qiantang County.

498
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,640
It was a graceful place, too.

499
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,320
So, sometimes I served as a middleman

500
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,200
to identify paintings at his house.

501
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,320
He was a good customer.

502
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,000
He bought many masterpieces from me,

503
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,520
including Jing Hao's Snow Cottage,

504
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,000
Wang Ai's the Night Revels,

505
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,075
and Huai Su's Copybook of Chess.

506
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,120
Unfortunately,

507
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,680
a big fire burned all the works.

508
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,880
Burned...?

509
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,240
You sold the Night Revels to him?

510
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,600
The Night Revels was owned by a Mr. Xue.

511
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,000
He had a gambling debt
in Qiantang County

512
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,720
and mortgaged the painting
in my teahouse.

513
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,280
Wang Ai

514
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,160
drew a lot of paintings
about night revels.

515
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,080
Even I have viewed quite a few.

516
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,080
I wonder

517
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,000
which one you sold to him.

518
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,760
You must be setting me up.

519
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,480
In Wang Ai's life,

520
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,400
he only painted one piece
of the Night Revels.

521
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,640
Because after he painted it,

522
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,400
someone said that he copied

523
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,240
Gu Hongzhong's Night Revels
of Han Xizai.

524
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,160
In a fit of anger,

525
00:26:26,175 --> 00:26:27,560
Wang Ai said he would never
draw anything like that again.

526
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,560
You think I just made that up, right?

527
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,240
I'll draw one.

528
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,560
Tea Art?

529
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,720
Yes.

530
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,850
But I prefer to call it Tea Painting.

531
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,550
The painting is as long as five chi.
[*Five chi equals 1.6 meters.]

532
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,040
The host sits in the middle

533
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,880
with guests on his sides.

534
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,720
Here are some dancers.

535
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,120
And here's a bright moon.

536
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,680
Is this the painting you viewed?

537
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,480
It's a pity
that the Tea Painting is too rough

538
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,720
to present the girls' Whirling Dance.

539
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,160
How long have you practiced the Tea Art?

540
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,320
Not a very long time.

541
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,240
For seven or eight years.

542
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,280
Sir,

543
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,080
when did you view the Night Revels?

544
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,760
I don't remember.

545
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,200
What a pity!

546
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,960
That big fire

547
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,725
burned so many famous paintings.

548
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,160
Don't laugh at me for feeling sorry.

549
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,240
When I asked the old artisan
to remount the Night Revels,

550
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,880
It cost me a big sum.

551
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,720
Simply the green brocade

552
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,040
and the red sandalwood scrolls

553
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,080
cost me a string of coins.

554
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,920
Good. Very good.

555
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,200
I have other customers to entertain.

556
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,280
Please enjoy your meal.

557
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,760
All right.

558
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,325
He's indeed from the nobility.

559
00:30:17,325 --> 00:30:18,640
He didn't speak loudly,

560
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,440
but he sounded rather powerful.

561
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,280
By his side, I felt...

562
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,400
Get out immediately.

563
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,680
You must find Chen Lian right now,

564
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,080
at whatever cost,

565
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,120
and ask him where Gu Qianfan is.

566
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,520
I've got

567
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,600
an utmost emergency

568
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,080
to tell Gu Qianfan to his face.

569
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,725
I'll go find Chen Lian now.

570
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,200
Give my order to Lei Jing.

571
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,560
Ask him to cooperate with you

572
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,960
and verify

573
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,480
whether Ms. Zhao just said

574
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,640
is true.

575
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,280
One more thing.

576
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,040
Don't get
the Capital Security Office involved.

577
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,200
Aye.

578
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,000
Everything is tough.

579
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,680
I know very well

580
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,360
about the Empress's past.

581
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,120
But officials keep
making an issue of it.

582
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,600
I feel so bad.

583
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,160
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

584
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,880
Anyway,

585
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,680
if Ms. Zhao can prove
that the painting is fake,

586
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:34,280
she'll make a great contribution

587
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,640
and Scholar Ministers will
have nothing to argue, right?

588
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,520
Just because she made you tea,

589
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,950
you're already putting
in a good word for her?

590
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,480
I don't dare.

591
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,280
Think about it, Your Majesty.

592
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,960
Ouyang Xu was well prepared to see you.

593
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,040
But you came to Yong'an Restaurant

594
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,320
on a last-minute plan.

595
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,240
If you hadn't mentioned
Mr. Yang Zhiyuan,

596
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,160
I'm afraid Ms. Zhao

597
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,960
wouldn't have said the following words.

598
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,160
Your Majesty, you heard
about this painting before.

599
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,920
But it's understandable

600
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,400
that you got angry
when seeing it personally.

601
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,880
When Censor Qi returned
to the Eastern Capital,

602
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,000
he voluntarily offered
the auspicious thing.

603
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,800
Your Majesty, there must be
something fishy.

604
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,875
In the past decades,

605
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,720
you've learned something from me.

606
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,680
No offense,

607
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,400
but Her Majesty adopted Prince Sheng

608
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,760
under your secret command.

609
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,640
Now, you're in poor health.

610
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,400
If Her Majesty falls from power
because of this,

611
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,600
a young prince and powerful officials...

612
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,400
I don't even dare to think about it.

613
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,760
Go.

614
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,760
Aye.

615
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,640
Sir, why are you already leaving?

616
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,960
Do you not like the dishes?

617
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,960
Don't get me wrong.
The dishes are great.

618
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,680
But the headache

619
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,600
just hit me again.

620
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,960
Chi, go get a pot
of Styrax Curcuma Wine.

621
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,480
Take it as a treat, sir.

622
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,520
Please frequent here for the wine.

623
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,600
I will.

624
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,600
You're indeed a wise businesswoman.

625
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,440
Go. Go get the wine.

626
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,600
Commissioner,

627
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,480
Commandant Chen found that carriage

628
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,440
near Yong'an Restaurant

629
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,040
and some Armed Imperial Guards.

630
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,000
When my father was tired,

631
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,920
he often had a headache, too.

632
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,080
Why don't you try the hot compress

633
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,080
with a handkerchief
soaked in boiled ginger soup?

634
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,360
Maybe it'll work.

635
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,679
Sure. I'll try it when I'm back home.

636
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,040
Your restaurant

637
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,760
looks very good.

638
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,159
Could you tell me

639
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,120
why a girl like you

640
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,400
wanted to open a restaurant?

641
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,120
One of our waitresses is named Zhaodi.

642
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,800
My name is Pan'er.

643
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,600
The two names have the same meaning,

644
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,560
"Expecting a son."

645
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,120
Because only men can have a career.

646
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,960
But women like us aren't
inferior to men.

647
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,560
Why must we be born to be humble?

648
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,800
According to the restaurant guild,

649
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,719
women can't be
the owner of a restaurant.

650
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,440
But I insist on being one.

651
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,920
And I'll do better than male owners.

652
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,760
You remind me of a lady.

653
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,720
Your tone is

654
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,280
just like hers.

655
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,200
You're my empress.

656
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,920
We're a unity.

657
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,400
Who dares to convict you?

658
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,160
Ke Zheng did.

659
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,480
Qi Mu does now.

660
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,560
All these Scholar Ministers

661
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,600
think I'm usurping your power.

662
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,760
They can't wait to kill me.

663
00:35:28,075 --> 00:35:29,400
Did this lady

664
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,760
have any career later?

665
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,200
She's helping me

666
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,000
manage a large family

667
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,800
and she's doing great.

668
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,880
So, she's your wife?

669
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,920
Then you should protect her more.

670
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,080
It's hard for a woman
to manage a family.

671
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,240
Besides, whoever manages a family

672
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,160
easily offends others.

673
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,720
Is anyone protecting you now?

674
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,200
Someone did.

675
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,640
But no one does it now.

676
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,280
He must be a bad man, then.

677
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,120
Perhaps.

678
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,520
But he was nice to me once.

679
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,160
At least, he didn't mind
that I was a pariah

680
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,160
and he truly wanted to marry me.

681
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,160
So,

682
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,760
I don't want to hate him.

683
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,520
You used to be a pariah, too?

684
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,520
Yes.

685
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,880
You can't see that, huh?

686
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,840
So, I always wish

687
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,760
His Majesty health and happiness.

688
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,760
If he hadn't granted an amnesty,

689
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,840
I wouldn't have been able to come here

690
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,320
and experience the prosperity here,

691
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,640
not to mention this big restaurant.

692
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,560
Oh, yeah.

693
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,480
Sir!

694
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,640
Sir!

695
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,680
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

696
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,880
It's Styrax Curcuma Wine,
the specialty of our restaurant.

697
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,680
Here's your wine.

698
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,640
All right.

699
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,880
Thank you.

700
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,960
Miss, don't bother to walk us out.

701
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:14,960
We should go.

702
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,360
Money, money.

703
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,280
I'm sure we made money from this meal.

704
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,360
That man has good taste.

705
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,480
He ordered a table of dishes.

706
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,800
It's all right
to give him the extra wine.

707
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,120
Pan'er.

708
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,700
Yes.

709
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,600
Zhaodi asked me to tell you something.

710
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,680
Chen Lian told her

711
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,840
that the customer was His Majesty.

712
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,680
His Majesty?

713
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,560
What about Gu Qianfan?

714
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,360
Did Chen Lian say where he is?

715
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,240
According to Chen Lian,
His Majesty left the Palace secretly.

716
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,800
Commissioner Gu must have been informed

717
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,400
and he's coming this way.

718
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,160
If not the Capital Security Office,
the guys around His Majesty,

719
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,280
must be from the Office
of Imperial Guards.

720
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,640
Maybe they're still nearby.

721
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,440
Ask Zhaodi to find Chen Lian

722
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,720
and tell him to withdraw his men.

723
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,600
They mustn't let His Majesty know

724
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,120
that his whereabouts have been exposed
to the Capital Security Office.

725
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,760
All right.

726
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,840
Lend me your carriage.

727
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,520
We must stop Gu Qianfan
before he arrives here.

728
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,680
We can't let him come here.

729
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,960
All right. I'll go with you.

730
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,000
Few people will be involved, then.

731
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,520
I'll go get the carriage.
Wait for me at the alley door.

732
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,600
I don't mean to boast,

733
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,480
but in the Eastern Capital,
few people drive better than I do.

734
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,000
Could you be faster?

735
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,240
You're in the carriage.
Safety comes first.

736
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,360
Why are you holding a hamper?

737
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,720
My carriage is way too ostentatious.

738
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,840
Many people can recognize it.

739
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,240
In case people suspect anything,

740
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,400
I came up with a good idea.

741
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,350
(Yong'an Restaurant)
With a lantern hanging there

742
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,520
and a hamper in hand,

743
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,600
people will only think

744
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,920
that I'm doing food delivery.

745
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,760
It's quite thoughtful of you.

746
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,160
By the way, when you see Gu Qianfan,

747
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,560
just get straight to the point.

748
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,360
Don't get soft-hearted.

749
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,880
Don't give him any chances, either.

750
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,480
Or you would be heartbroken again.

751
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,440
Yong'an Restaurant

752
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,720
uses such a luxurious carriage
for food delivery.

753
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,840
It must be the one and only
in the Eastern Capital.

754
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,000
Yeah.

755
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,550
(Yong'an Restaurant)

756
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,720
(Wang Feng, owner of Wang's Restaurant)
Go purchase some good carriages.

757
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,480
The best ones.

758
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Hang our lanterns on them, too.

759
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,240
Tomorrow, we'll also
do food delivery like this.

760
00:40:21,725 --> 00:40:22,440
Come with me.

761
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,960
Make way, please.

762
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,480
Pan'er!

763
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,480
Pan'er?

764
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,040
Get out of my way.
I'm looking for someone.

765
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,880
Get out of my way.

766
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Where has she gone?

767
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,040
What happened?

768
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,760
Are you all right?

769
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,680
I'm all right.

770
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,400
The Night Revels appeared again.

771
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,920
When that man mentioned
Mr. Yang Zhiyuan,

772
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,480
I knew he must be the Emperor.

773
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,000
Later, I thought about it.

774
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,560
Ouyang Xu suddenly returned
to the Eastern Capital,

775
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,080
probably because he found

776
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,320
the Night Revels
that he thought he didn't have.

777
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,360
It's very likely

778
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,840
that His Majesty
knew everything from him.

779
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,625
The painting...

780
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,520
The painting Ouyang Xu holds
is authentic?

781
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,320
Then how dare you

782
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,920
lie to His Majesty?

783
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,240
I didn't have a choice.

784
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,800
That was an emergency.

785
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,400
I told Ouyang Xu

786
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,760
the Capital Security Office
was looking for this painting.

787
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,520
And he's probably aware
of our relationship.

788
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,680
What if he wants to take revenge

789
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,040
and tells His Majesty

790
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,040
that you work for the Empress Party

791
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,960
and try to exonerate Her Majesty?

792
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,960
Like you said,

793
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,320
the Capital Security Office
must be loyal to His Majesty alone

794
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,360
and can't be involved
in any political struggles.

795
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,040
So, I had to lie about the color
of the front mounting.

796
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,640
We must convince His Majesty

797
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,560
that Ouyang Xu faked the painting.

798
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,600
Yang Zhiyuan and his family
have been burned, anyway.

799
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,400
Dead men tell no tales.

800
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,200
Anyway, His Majesty doesn't know

801
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,200
I recognized him.

802
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,600
Two pieces of evidence.

803
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,200
One is from

804
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,360
his consort's nephew-in-law
who impeached his empress.

805
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,640
The other is from

806
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,880
a stranger he ran across.

807
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,520
If you were His Majesty,
who would you trust?

808
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:07,320
Nevertheless,

809
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,400
this is way too risky.

810
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,000
There are many flaws.

811
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,120
This risk is worth taking.

812
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,800
I'm telling you this

813
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,560
because only you can mend the flaws.

814
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,760
I'll leave the rest to you.

815
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:21,800
All in all,

816
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,480
you mustn't let His Majesty know

817
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,960
that you know his secret visit
to Yong'an Restaurant tonight.

818
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,000
You already got yourself involved.

819
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,800
You know?

820
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,560
As such an insider,

821
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,800
don't you fear

822
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,200
that His Majesty may kill you?

823
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,680
Why did you do such a stupid thing?

824
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,960
Because once the Empress is convicted,

825
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,925
she'll be executed.

826
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,760
I used to be a music performer, too.

827
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,920
I understand she didn't have a choice.

828
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,280
Another reason...

829
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,480
I hate you,

830
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,440
but I don't want you to die.

831
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,360
Pan'er.

832
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:56,713
