00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,359
the food is cooked on an iron plate.

173
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,200
It's kind of like frying,

174
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,799
but it's only better.

175
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,599
That's new.

176
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:46,520
Really?

177
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,039
So many questions.

178
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:52,440
Sir, just try it.

179
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:54,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I will.

180
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,919
Come on.

181
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,880
So?

182
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
It's just…

183
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,799
Is it difficult to swallow

184
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,599
or hard to describe?

185
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,320
It's unbelievable

186
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,119
that such a unique delicacy
exists in this world.

187
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,000
It's flavorful,
but with a creamy texture.

188
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:19,960
I'd like to try one as well.

189
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,875
So?

190
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,359
It's beyond words.

191
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,960
Beyond words.

192
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
What did I say again?

193
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,119
I told you to try it.

194
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,919
Even I give it a high rating.

195
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,919
So it mustn't be bad.

196
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:36,159
Even the dishes for the hall diners
are fabulous.

197
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:39,400
I wonder what the food
for the private rooms tastes like…

198
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,520
The private rooms are
in Yiyuan Pavilion,

199
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,200
and I promise the food is only better.

200
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:44,119
Then we must try it.

201
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:45,159
We're going now.

202
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,159
Sorry, Yiyuan Pavilion is not
open today.

203
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,719
Why?

204
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:53,840
The first batch of guests
that Yiyuan Pavilion will serve

205
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,599
are 12 most renowned scholars

206
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:58,599
in the Eastern Capital.

207
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,200
By then, we will use
the best ingredients

208
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,679
for the Flower and Moon Banquet.

209
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,359
and Ms. Song will play at the banquet.

210
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,320
I wonder

211
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:11,400
which 12 scholars
may have the privilege?

212
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,159
Me, too.

213
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,840
Who will be so lucky?

214
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,359
Tomorrow, we will send out
12 pieces of invitations.

215
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:23,000
I wonder who will receive them.

216
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,275
Uh…

217
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,080
Please enjoy.

218
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:28,559
All right. All right.

219
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,559
The invitations, huh?

220
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,080
Mr. Yuan, I'm sure you will receive one.

221
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,119
No, no.

222
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:43,320
You will receive one.

223
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,559
Well, of course, I will.

224
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,350
(Wang's Smithing)

225
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,050
(Smithing)

226
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,775
I'd like to open up a restaurant.

227
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,159
Don't act like it's a tricky problem.

228
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:31,760
There are compromises
between a couple.

229
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,239
That's the way it is.

230
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:38,719
Since I ask to borrow money from you,

231
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:40,200
I owe you a favor.

232
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:42,239
I know you're willing

233
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,799
to help us one or two times.

234
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,400
But what would happen
at the tenth time?

235
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,119
No matter how many times,
I'll always help you.

236
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,800
You made the choice.

237
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,525
Are you sure about it?

238
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,799
If you stay faithful,

239
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,599
so will I.

240
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:07,679
Do you remember? You didn't
allow me to cry.

241
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:09,719
And I didn't allow you
to smile like this.

242
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,119
Now that we're together,

243
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:15,159
I'll share

244
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,359
half of the weal and woe with you.

245
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:29,200
Pan'er,

246
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,440
I'll remember everything

247
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,640
that you have done for me lately.

248
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:34,799
In the future,

249
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,479
I'll repay you double.

250
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:48,852
Nice. Brilliant.

251
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,875
Our dear guests.

252
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,000
Yong'an Restaurant shall hold
a Flower and Moon Banquet tonight.

253
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,960
We expect to see 12…

254
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,048
(We expect to see 12 gastronomes)
12 what?

255
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:08,159
(at 7:00 PM sharp.)
12 what?

256
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,760
I don't know this word.

257
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,520
Only you can work it out.

258
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,679
If I was to do the job,

259
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,200
I would never use the word.

260
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,880
Yong'an Restaurant

261
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,159
will become a hit.

262
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:20,280
(Price: 50 strings of copper coins)

263
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,400
Success isn't easy for a new business.

264
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
The Flower and Moon Banquet

265
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,400
will decide.

266
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:30,799
Pan'er, the price is too high.

267
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,400
In the Eastern Capital,
50 strings of coins

268
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,880
can pay for half-year rent.

269
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,039
Pan'er, don't you think
we're pricing it too high?

270
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,719
It's always difficult for a new business
to attract guests.

271
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:45,520
But we can't continue the low-price
strategy that we used for the teahouse.

272
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:47,359
A high price

273
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:49,719
is the best hype.

274
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,280
But what dishes should I cook

275
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:54,719
to be worth that price?

276
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,840
No one can make the food
worth that much.

277
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,640
I want them to feel

278
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,880
that the banquet is worthwhile.

279
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,400
50 strings of copper coins?
Will they find it worthwhile?

280
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,119
Can we do that?

281
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:10,719
That's why I said

282
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,400
Yiyuan Pavilion wasn't
ready for guests tonight.

283
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,320
We need time

284
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,880
for the entire Eastern Capital

285
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,159
to start talking about us.

286
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:20,400
And because

287
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,239
we've got everybody hyped,

288
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,840
the banquet tomorrow

289
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,640
must reach the level of perfection.

290
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:27,799
Don't worry.

291
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,599
My men

292
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:31,599
will guard the restaurant well.

293
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:32,919
If anyone looks for trouble,

294
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,280
they will be thrown into the river.

295
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,599
Very good.

296
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Have you got the invitation?

297
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,520
I'm afraid only a master scholar
like Mr. Liu Jiu

298
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,159
has the privilege
to receive the invitation.

299
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,359
Master, here's the invitation
from Yong'an Restaurant.

300
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,516
What?

301
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,559
Look.

302
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,919
The invitation from Yong'an Restaurant?

303
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:06,520
Yes.

304
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:08,719
(Our dear guests)

305
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,280
Our dear guests.

306
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:14,119
They use the Xuetao Envelope.

307
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,440
Yong'an Restaurant shall hold
a Flower and Moon Banquet tonight.

308
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:20,440
We expect to see 12 gastronomes

309
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,679
at 7:00 PM sharp.

310
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,440
Nice drawing.

311
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,719
Nice calligraphy. Nice verses.

312
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,479
Yes.

313
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,400
It takes decades of practice

314
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:31,320
to achieve

315
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,880
the technique of Darting White.

316
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,825
(Price: 50 strings of copper coins)

317
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:36,825
Price, 50 strings of copper coins?

318
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,239
Mr. Zhuoshi,

319
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,159
can I take a look?

320
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,239
Here.

321
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,880
It doesn't have a name on it.

322
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,559
What if you don't give it back to me

323
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,679
after you take a look?

324
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,880
I'm off.

325
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,479
I've got the invitation.

326
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,200
I'm going home.

327
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,440
I've got it.

328
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,960
Cheap.

329
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,119
Sir.

330
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:12,856
(Yong'an Restaurant)

331
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:15,175
(Our dear guests)

332
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,560
Stop playing the music
and stop dancing.

333
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,880
I've got it. I've got it.

334
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,479
- Congratulations, Mr. Liu Jiu.
- Congratulations, Mr. Liu Jiu.

00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,575
How come no one ushers us?

340
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,439
It says the banquet is
in Yiyuan Pavilion.

341
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,319
Um…

342
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:03,880
Are we at the wrong place?

343
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,880
No way.

344
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,040
I mean…

345
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,000
It's just…

346
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,079
What's going on?

347
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,680
W-What's the meaning of this?

348
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,520
Right.

349
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,680
Anybody?

350
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,160
Open the door.

351
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,359
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

352
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,000
Open the door!

353
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,719
Anyone? Open the door.

354
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:26,040
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

355
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:09,239
That's interesting.

356
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:09,920
Easy.

357
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:12,000
Put it here. Just leave it here.

358
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,025
Look at that old man. That one.

359
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,700
Smoke.

360
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,425
More.

361
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:19,119
Amazing.

362
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:31,800
That's He Si.

363
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,000
That chubby fellow

364
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,160
is He Si who works for Chi Pan.

365
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:36,439
It's…

366
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:51,550
Preparing Newly Woven Silk.

367
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,520
The masterpiece of Zhang Xuan
from the Tang dynasty.

368
00:21:09,575 --> 00:21:12,200
T-T-The Court Ladies Wearing Hairpins.

369
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:14,160
A work of Zhou Fang.

370
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,560
Yes, and no.

371
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:21,400
Real and unreal.

372
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:34,700
Yong'an Restaurant brings the content
of the paintings to life.

373
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:39,880
Wonderful. Amazing.

374
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,719
Bravo. Bravo.

375
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,719
- Bravo. Bravo.
- Bravo.

376
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,160
Bravo. Bravo.

377
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:49,175
The performance is worth
every penny we spent.

378
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:50,102
It's excellent.

379
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,560
It's so worthwhile.

380
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,199
Just amazing.

381
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:54,800
I'd like to watch it again

382
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:57,160
even if it'll cost me
another 100 strings.

383
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,479
Yes.

384
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,550
Bravo.

385
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,119
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

386
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,280
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

387
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:25,560
Bravo

388
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:02,479
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

389
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,040
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

390
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,079
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

391
00:23:17,475 --> 00:23:19,025
(Yong'an Restaurant)

392
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,000
He's gone to the imperial court.

393
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:10,280
Tonight, I wish to get drunk
with you gentlemen.

394
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:14,959
Fairy lady, what is this drink?

395
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,359
If the host gets me drunk,

396
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:26,680
I don't care where I am.

397
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:33,400
It's the storax and tulip wine

398
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,040
in the after-rain green porcelain bowl.

399
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:45,560
Storax and tulip wine,

400
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,199
amber glitter inside the jade bowl.

401
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,640
Fabulous.

402
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,839
It's the wine

403
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:56,839
that celestials drink.

404
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,439
First up, chrysanthemum drink.

405
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,760
Fragrant crunchy plum.

406
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:24,239
Carved preserved fruit.

407
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,280
Crystal cold cake.

408
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,680
The instrument plays the lament,

409
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,520
the twig competes with the spring.

410
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:53,479
Second round. Xi Shi clams.

411
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:55,199
Dried scallop soup.

412
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,920
Steamed bass.

413
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,359
Lotus bun.

414
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:01,400
Morning moths on the fan,

415
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:04,119
red tulips bloom in spring.

416
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,920
Emotions bring out tears.

417
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:20,079
The performance is amazing.
The food is quite tasty.

418
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,640
Finally, white kidney.

419
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,880
Boiled green plum dough.

420
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,160
Crab meat in orange.

421
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,599
Almond and mutton.

422
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,680
Please.

423
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:12,800
This is bliss.

424
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:17,400
The banquet is worth every penny.

425
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:20,479
Yes, indeed.

426
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:21,760
Too early for the comment.

427
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,000
Please look out the window.

428
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:26,950
Ah?

429
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:35,000
It's so nice.

430
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:39,119
Excellent.

431
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,680
Look over that.

432
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,760
- Nice.
- Bravo.

433
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,119
Good.

434
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,000
Look. Look.

435
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:13,800
Good.

436
00:28:20,475 --> 00:28:21,552
- Nice.
- Very good.

437
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,439
I would like

438
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,680
to receive the invitation someday.

439
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:47,599
You have good taste.

440
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:51,680
Ms. Zhao is indeed a fine performer.

441
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:55,079
She manages to make the
opening ceremony of a restaurant

442
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:58,959
as lively as a festival celebration.

443
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,239
So? Your injury is almost healed, right?

444
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,359
When will you get married?

445
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:15,920
I haven't seen her for a long time.

446
00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:19,400
Did you have a fight?

447
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,880
It's common for a young couple.

448
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:29,479
Just listen to your dad.

449
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:32,479
No matter what the misunderstanding
is between you,

450
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,640
you need to clear the air face to face.

451
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,640
Sometimes, waiting and guess

452
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,839
are more hurtful than wrangle.

453
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,040
It happened between your mom and me.

454
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,479
Never mind.

455
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,680
Don't worry.

456
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,599
I won't interfere with your choice.

457
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,199
Of course, you won't.

458
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:59,319
Because you only arrange

459
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:03,280
girls from noble families for me.

460
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:07,079
Why don't I have the courage
to see her?

461
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,119
I believe you know why.

462
00:30:12,199 --> 00:30:13,800
Why would a girl

463
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,199
marry the son of the man
who plotted her father's death?

464
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:20,760
Stop trying to talk me around.

465
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:22,239
You think

466
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,199
you won't raise my suspicion
by doing this,

467
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,280
or is everybody

468
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:27,719
an exploitable chess piece

469
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:30,000
in your eyes?

470
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:32,520
What are you talking about?

471
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,640
I'm not that kind of a person.

472
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:36,680
I'm the Commissioner

473
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,160
of the Capital Security Office,

474
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,119
I don't make groundless accusations.

475
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:45,319
In the Hat Demon case,

476
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,160
you used me

477
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:51,199
to hit Qi Mu hard.

478
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,000
That was the last time.
I won't help you ever again.

479
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,640
Minister Duke Xiao.

480
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,319
I won't marry the noble girls
you arranged for me.

481
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:04,640
I disown the Xiao Family.

482
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,680
Nor will I allow myself
and the Capital Security Office

483
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:10,479
to serve as your tool
in your power struggle.

484
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,800
Why?

485
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:19,280
Did I not help with your promotion

486
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:21,680
so that your wish of transferring

487
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,560
your mother's grave is fulfilled?

488
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:28,560
Isn't it my blood running in your veins?

489
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,199
Can't you just use your power

490
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,400
to give your old man a hand?

491
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:37,839
Can't you?

492
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:38,920
I can't.

493
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,880
The Capital Security Office

494
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,800
serves the people,

495
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:50,760
not you ministers

496
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:52,680
or your political conflicts.

497
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,719
As to your blood.

498
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,000
I'll give it right back to you.

499
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:07,760
What are you doing?

500
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,680
This is sheer idiocy.

501
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,000
Don't worry.

502
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,599
I'm not going to kill myself.

503
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,680
I'm told

504
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:21,280
that human body has ten cups of blood.

505
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,359
I lost two cups

506
00:32:25,439 --> 00:32:26,599
when I saved you in the boat,

507
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,520
I puked another two cups

508
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,760
after I learned that you plotted
the death of Pan'er's father.

509
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,280
Now I'll return another cup to you.

510
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:40,599
Our father-son relationship

511
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,319
ends right here.

512
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:45,800
Qian-Qianfan.

513
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:48,160
Don't worry about me.

514
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,680
Worry about yourself.

515
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:53,400
I know why you asked me to come here.

516
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:55,400
You're worried

517
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:58,319
that Qi Mu is after something

518
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,560
as he returned to the Eastern Capital

519
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,520
at the cost of his integrity.

520
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:06,479
All right, one last warning.

521
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:09,599
Ouyang Xu,
Qi Mu's new confidential follower,

522
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,560
will soon become Gao Hu's
son-in-law for the second time.

523
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,119
This is all I'm going to tell you.

524
00:34:27,475 --> 00:34:29,475
Pan'er, why did you
put a mouse trap here?

525
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,320
Because there're mice running around.

526
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:33,959
Pan'er.

527
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,919
Mr. Gu?

528
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,120
Gu Qianfan,

529
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,919
what are you doing here?

530
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,320
I'd like to talk to Pan'er.

531
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,879
You want an invitation card

532
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,479
because we know you, huh?

533
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,320
I tell you what, it's not happening.

534
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,679
Pan'er.

535
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:55,719
Pan'er,

536
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,919
I have something important to tell you.

537
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,679
Take your stuff away.

538
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,399
Pan'er.

539
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:03,439
Zhaodi, send him away.

540
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:05,560
Pan'er.

541
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,679
Pan'er.

542
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:08,399
Mr. Gu, please.

543
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,760
Sorry that I got your clothes wet.

544
00:35:24,879 --> 00:35:26,199
But I really took you
for a thief for a moment.

545
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:28,560
I learned the trick from Chen Lian.

546
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:29,919
He said the water trace

547
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,439
could lead us to the thief.

548
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:37,399
Pan'er looks pale.

549
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,600
Has she been working too hard

550
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:40,360
managing Yong'an Restaurant?

551
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,360
Mr. Gu,

552
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,199
do you think you still have the right

553
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:45,120
to be concerned about her?

554
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,760
Zhaodi, that's enough.

555
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,280
You need to leave now.

556
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,560
Harder. I don't feel anything.

557
00:37:07,479 --> 00:37:09,120
You'll get a scratch if I go harder.

558
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,520
Damaging your body is a serious crime.

559
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,600
You're the Empress.

560
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,360
You and I are one.

561
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:16,959
No one will convict you of that.

562
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,040
(Liu Wan, the Empress)
Ke Zheng

563
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:22,399
and Qi Mu,

564
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,399
and all the other upright officials

565
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:26,560
think I'm stealing the power.

566
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:28,719
They all wish me to disappear.

567
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:37,600
That's what speech officials do.

568
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:42,199
When Ke Zheng presented
himself before me,

569
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,600
I nearly got his spit on my face.

570
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,280
Just bear with them.

571
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,159
They know

572
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:54,600
I give you the authority
to review the memorials

573
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:57,919
because my migraine is back again.

574
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,719
Just look at it this way,
they're criticizing me.

575
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,159
You're my husband.

576
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,280
I still feel bad.

577
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,840
The pomegranate blossom
is red as fire.

578
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,840
Do you know there's a dish

579
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,120
called Peach Blossom in Snow
at Yong'an Restaurant?

580
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,600
It's pomegranate seeds
in sour cream cake.

581
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,959
Red dots in white.

582
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:18,360
The maids are gossiping again.

583
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,199
(Did you try it?)

584
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,040
(No.)

585
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,000
It's fine.

586
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,399
(They told me, it looks pretty
and tastes delicious.)

587
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:26,320
Look at them.

588
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,199
They are only

589
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,959
about five years older than Shouyi.

590
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:31,399
Why must you regulate them?

591
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,600
When I see them,

592
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:38,040
it reminds me of years ago

593
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:40,760
- when I just met you.
- (What else?)

594
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,520
Tell me more.

595
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,000
Also, there's Wazi

596
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,800
in Wanshui Pavilion.

597
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,959
I've heard there's even
a female wrestling game.

598
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,600
When I'm on my days off,

599
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,600
I have to check that out.

600
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,840
The cross talk is over.

601
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,080
Is this Yong'an Restaurant

602
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,439
that nice?

603
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:05,919
How about this?

604
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,840
When I get better,

605
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:11,520
I'll take you out.

606
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,600
We'll try something new as well.

607
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
Thank you in advance, Your Majesty.

608
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,120
You're coughing again.

609
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,360
It's fine. It's fine.

610
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,639
Maybe it's just the summer heat.

611
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:26,280
I've summoned Taoist Baoyi here
to give me a lecture.

612
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,239
It may calm me down.

613
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,120
I'll make you some pear soup.

614
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,679
Thanks.

615
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,120
26.

616
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,399
27.

617
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,360
28.

618
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,399
29.

619
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:48,439
30.

620
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:49,159
What are you counting?

621
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:51,000
Money.

622
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,919
I did a little calculation last night.

623
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:56,080
This is how much we make
from one person.

624
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,679
I'm surprised that Mr. Chi

625
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:01,120
cares about the small money.

626
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,879
The money you make
from Yong'an Restaurant

627
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
doesn't even cover 10 percent
of your investment.

628
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,199
And you normally spend more
in a gambling club a day

629
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:08,199
than this.

630
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,479
41.

631
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,560
That's less fun than this.

632
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:14,080
If I know nothing else
other than having fun,

633
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,320
I can't be the Head
of 12 Guilds in the Eastern Capital.

634
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,199
Now, the entire city knows

635
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,840
how wonderful

636
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,800
our Flower and Moon Banquet

637
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,719
and the recreation of paintings are.

638
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,840
No one thinks that the 50-string
entry ticket is expensive.

639
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,320
In my opinion,

640
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,120
we should hold the banquet every day

641
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,800
instead of once in every ten days.

642
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:32,159
Look at all those who have made
the reservations down there.

643
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,080
No.

644
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,679
It wouldn't interest them.

645
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,479
Do you know the value of scarcity?

646
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:39,719
The value of scarcity?

647
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:40,919
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

648
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,040
Oh, right.

649
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,639
I asked He Si

650
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:47,199
to pry for intelligence
at the Wang's and the Pan's.

651
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,439
Guess what they said?

652
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,800
The entire restaurant guild
hates our gut.

653
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:55,719
That's normal.

654
00:40:55,879 --> 00:40:57,879
If they don't,
then we should do better.

655
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,399
Your Majesty,

656
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:05,760
Ouyang Xu, the Collator, is waiting
to see you outside

657
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,760
with Baoyi's panegyric
for Heaven in hand.

658
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,639
Baoyi wrote more panegyrics?

659
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:12,399
Why did he send Ouyang Xu

660
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,959
instead of coming to see me in person?

661
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:17,639
Summon him.

662
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,000
Yes.

663
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:27,679
Hail, Your Majesty.

664
00:41:27,925 --> 00:41:28,625
Yeah.

665
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,479
Present it to me.

666
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:31,800
Arise.

667
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,479
Your Majesty, I'm guilty.

668
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,760
I wangled my way into the imperial palace
using Mr. Baoyi as a pretext.

669
00:41:39,919 --> 00:41:41,679
But I have to report
something important to you.

670
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:44,040
It's a matter of urgency
that concerns the whole nation.

671
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,600
So I took my chances.

672
00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:47,520
Please pardon me.

673
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,800
What is this thing
that concerns the whole nation?

674
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,800
Could we please have some privacy?

675
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:11,199
