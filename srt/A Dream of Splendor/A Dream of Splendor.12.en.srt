=Episode 12=

17
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,440
Commander,

18
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
no, Deputy Commissioner.

19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,920
When do you think I can put this on?

20
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,720
Military leader doesn't
have an official rank.

21
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,280
If you don't risk your life

22
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,520
and work step by step,

23
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,120
it will take about 30 or 40 years.

24
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,240
I'd better not risk my life.

25
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
Working for you,

26
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
I won't suffer any loss.

27
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,520
Those who worked for me all died.

28
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,400
Well...

29
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,560
For the first time, Boss,

30
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,720
you scared someone on purpose.

31
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,560
It looks like you're in a good mood
after being promoted.

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,480
Just because I'm
permitted to wear scarlet,

33
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,480
it doesn't mean
I've ascended to the Fifth Rank.

34
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,280
I've been walking on the way

35
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,600
for over ten years.

36
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,440
I still have a long way to go.

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,560
So you've been
working yourself to death,

38
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,720
because you want to
ascend to the Fifth Rank.

39
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
Why is it?

40
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,160
Can a Fifth Rank go to court,

41
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
become Adjunct,

42
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,160
or can his wife be named Mandated Ma'am?

43
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,280
I get it.

44
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,000
Is it because of Pan'er?

45
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,560
Shut up.

46
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,840
By the way,

47
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,440
did you settle them down yesterday?

48
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,240
Did anything happen?

49
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,200
Everything was fine. Nothing happened.

50
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,600
I've read her medical record.

51
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,680
It wasn't serious.

52
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,920
She just had some minor injuries
and was frightened.

53
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,880
She needs to rest peacefully.

54
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,200
Well then,

55
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,040
you go and withdraw all my salaries

56
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,480
and bonuses of the last two months.

57
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,080
From now on,

58
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,800
I'll pay the rent

59
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,200
for their house

60
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,960
and their expenses.

61
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,800
But Pan'er forced me to

62
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,120
take the money yesterday.

63
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
You know she isn't even afraid of you.

64
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,560
How dare I say no?

65
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,880
She doesn't want to owe me any favor.

66
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,360
No wonder she is a businesswoman.

67
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,760
Anyway,

68
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,920
withdraw the money first.

69
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,720
Life won't be easy

70
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,480
for three women.

71
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,280
They may need it in case of emergency.

72
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,080
Yes.

73
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,640
Report!

74
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,240
Adjutant Hu Yuan of Kaifeng Prefecture
asks to see you.

75
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,280
Invite him in.

76
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,360
Yes.

77
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,560
I'll be busy recently

78
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,760
and have no time to visit them.

79
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,870
Keep an eye on Chazi.
[*Chazi: Ancient government spy]

80
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,720
Make sure he's investigating Ouyang Xu.

81
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,680
Yes.

82
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,100
(Breeze Brings Integrity)

83
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,400
You did the right thing.

84
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,160
As long as Miss Gao doesn't forget you,

85
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,200
there is still hope for your marriage,

86
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,520
and you can return to the capital early.

87
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,920
I must leave a way open for the future.

88
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,480
After I leave,

89
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,400
remember to
wander outside Gao's Mansion

90
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,400
and make sure Gao Hui sees you.

91
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,920
You should say,

92
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,840
I just want to check if you're fine
on behalf of my master.

93
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,840
Master, rest assured.

94
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,880
I'll do my best.

95
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,080
What about Zhao Pan'er?

96
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,560
She did this to you.

97
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,840
I gave a hint just now.

98
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,360
Those who are smart enough
will keep it in mind.

99
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,440
It's like a hole is burnt in our pocket.

100
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,760
It's already taken dozens of strings

101
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,040
before the business is opened.

102
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,560
Speaking of that,

103
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,480
wasn't the gold Ouyang Xu gave you

104
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,440
hidden under the bed

105
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,960
in your old house in Qiantang?

106
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,560
Was it stolen?

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,560
No.

108
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,840
My boss has already sent his men there.

109
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,120
The teahouse,

110
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
the houses of Pan'er's and Yinzhang's

111
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,720
are all well-guarded.

112
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,800
Not a coin shall be stolen.

113
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,680
Really?

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,720
Great.

115
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,920
Well then,

116
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,280
I'd like you to do me another favor.

117
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,480
Except for the gold under the bed,

118
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,000
I also dug a hole at the foot
of the southern wall of the kitchen,

119
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,320
in which there are two boxes.

120
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,080
Bring the big one out.

121
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,120
Inside are some title deeds,

122
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,160
gold bullion and silver ingots,

123
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,560
which I've saved over the years.

124
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,600
Would you exchange them

125
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
for Fei-qian

126
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
and take it here
with my collection of paintings?

127
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,440
By doing that, we can not only
pay off Gu Qianfan's money,

128
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,400
but also have more capitals

129
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
for our teahouse.

130
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,920
What about the small box?

131
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,080
It belongs to Yinzhang.

132
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,440
Your money

133
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,920
is safe with me.

134
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,880
The reason why I didn't give you before

135
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,040
was because I was afraid
you and Zhou She...

136
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,000
I know.

137
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,160
I was too naive back then.

138
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,120
It's all in the past now.

139
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,720
If you want to

140
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,600
keep it yourself,

141
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,160
we can ask Chen Lian's friends

142
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,040
to bring it here, too.

143
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,480
Exchange it.

144
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,640
Every coin counts to us now.

145
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,600
So you're not going to
leave any money in Qiantang

146
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,440
in case you need a way out?

147
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,120
Are you sure?

148
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,560
Not a coin left?

149
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,240
No regrets?

150
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,440
No regrets.

151
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,360
You place your bet and never regret it.

152
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,520
Wherever I am,

153
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,400
behind my back is my way out.

154
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,840
- Well said.
- Well said.

155
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,920
No, no.

156
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,720
I can't charge you
for doing you the favor.

157
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,520
Pan'er, if you insist on it,

158
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,600
you're regarding me as an outsider.

159
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,280
Besides, now,

160
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
my bros in Qiantang

161
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,560
all know I'm working for Mr. Gu.

162
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,920
Mr. Gu just got promoted.

163
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,880
They all try to suck up to me.

164
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
What's his official title now?

165
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,520
Deputy Commissioner of
Western Upper Memorial Reception Staff.

166
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,040
In the Capital Security Office,

167
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,320
he is now the second in command

168
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,400
below Commissioner Lei.

169
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,080
He now can wear scarlet

170
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,040
and the silver fish pocket.

171
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,360
Being permitted to wear scarlet
and bestowed with silver fish pocket.

172
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,800
It seems that His Majesty
thinks very highly of your boss.

173
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,080
Mr. Gu is under 30,

174
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,200
yet he is hopefully
to rise to the Fifth Rank.

175
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,840
You've surely chosen the right boss.

176
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,200
Of course. I have a good eye.

177
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,360
With all due respect,

178
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,480
I have a better eye than you do.

179
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,800
You're right.

180
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,400
I hope I'll be luckier in the future.

181
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,520
No, not in the future.

182
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,400
There is a right man in front of you.

183
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,960
You?

184
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,720
You're too young.

185
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,160
Don't be oily-tongued like other guys.

186
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,640
Not me, I mean...

187
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,360
All right.

188
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,280
You can leave now.

189
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,670
Please lose no time to do us the favor.

190
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,280
As for the teahouse,

191
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,400
don't tell your boss for now.

192
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,520
Why?

193
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,880
Because I think he'll probably disagree.

194
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,960
Tell him we're all good.

195
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,280
After everything is done,

196
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,440
he can't oppose it.

197
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,280
OK, then.

198
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,560
I'm off. Bye.

199
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,240
(The officialdom has its
ups and downs like the sea.)

200
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
(He got promoted.)

201
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,680
(Ouyang,)

202
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,040
(are you satisfied
with your official position?)

203
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,280
(Though I don't know what has)

204
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,680
(made you such a complete stranger,)

205
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,080
(I will)

206
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,200
(beg the Buddha to bless you)

207
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,480
(with bad luck in officialdom
and a hard life)

208
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,640
(until you return what you owe me.)

209
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,920
Uncle Qi.

210
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,430
(Qi Mu)
I heard you were back,

211
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,360
(Qi Mu) so I come to see you
at night when all is still.

212
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,720
I'm sorry to bother you.

213
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,600
I'm supposed to visit you

214
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,760
on the scheduled date.

215
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,320
You're like a son to me.

216
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,080
Knowing that you've been badly hurt,

217
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,920
I'm so worried.

218
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,560
How can I wait for another three days?

219
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,040
Where did you hurt?

220
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,200
How are the injuries?

221
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,720
Don't worry.

222
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,320
I've had it inquired.

223
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,840
Now in the government,

224
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,320
you're the only one
who is still working.

225
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,560
Why are you working so late?

226
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,960
Is it because of the handover
of Zheng Qingtian's case

227
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,480
to the Court of Judicial Review?

228
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,120
Work is endless.

229
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,360
Your health matters most.

230
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,000
Take good care of yourself.

231
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,120
If your health is damaged,

232
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,760
how could I explain it

233
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,520
to your late father?

234
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,120
Yes, I'll keep it in my mind.

235
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,520
I haven't congratulated you on Fufei.
[*Fufei: Wear a scarlet robe]

236
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,920
[*Only the officials of the Fourth
and Fifth Ranks can wear scarlet.]

237
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,440
Now you have your own office.

238
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,240
Come on, show me around.

239
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,680
OK. This way, please.

240
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,400
Please.

241
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,320
Evidences of Lei Jing colluding with

242
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,480
the officials of Jiangnan
are all inside.

243
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,200
With those,

244
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,080
you'll definitely topple Lei Jing.

245
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,160
Well done.

246
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,880
The court is lucky
to have such an official as you.

247
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,760
I'm lucky to have a nephew like you.

248
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,280
But now,

249
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,680
it isn't a good time
to launch the attack.

250
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,920
Lei Jing has served His Majesty
for over 30 years.

251
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,360
He still enjoys
the imperial graciousness

252
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,920
and is liked by His Majesty.

253
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,800
His Majesty has punished many people

254
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,960
who were involved in
Zheng Qingtian's case.

255
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,200
He may not want it to escalate.

256
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,160
If we expose Lei Jing at this time,

257
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,480
we may not knock him down
with one blow.

258
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,200
So,

259
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,240
let's wait for the right time.

260
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,920
OK, I'll listen to you.

261
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,600
Don't be upset.

262
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,400
I told you in the first place,

263
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,160
to disguise your true colors,

264
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,040
you must get used to loneliness.

265
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,000
You're young and talented.

266
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,400
I feel guilt to you that I arranged you

267
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,920
to work in the Capital Security Office

268
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,360
as a military official.

269
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,960
But if I'm going to
deal with Xiao Qinyan and Zhu Peiruo

270
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,400
who deceive their superiors
and suppress their subordinates,

271
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,720
I have to place a nail

272
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,160
in the detective department.

273
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,360
Over the years,

274
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,160
you've never disappointed me.

275
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,440
Lei Jing wouldn't have expected
in his dreams

276
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,600
that the Living Devil who works for him

277
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,680
is one of my undercover men.

278
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,840
Living Devil

279
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,400
isn't a nice name.

280
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,240
But comparing to the court

281
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,000
and Great Song,

282
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,520
personal reputation is nothing.

283
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,720
Actually, I've never regretted it.

284
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,040
Xiao Qinyan will soon
return to the capital as Prime Minister.

285
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,360
Lei Jing tries very hard to fawn on him.

286
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,440
As the head of hired thugs

287
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,400
and the leader of the traitor ministers,

288
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,040
they'll be a bane

289
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,560
to the country and the people
if they are in collusion.

290
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,000
So, you must investigate them carefully.

291
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,240
Yes.

292
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,760
He has risen to the Fifth Rank
at such a young age.

293
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,120
(It's him.)

294
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,680
(One day,)

295
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,520
(I must return loaded with honors)

296
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,560
(just as he does.)

297
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,640
(I must.)

298
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,760
Let's move the large ones first.

299
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,600
Come here. I have candies for you.

300
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,440
Take it easy.
I have enough for everyone.

301
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,440
We made the candies ourselves.

302
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,200
Please tell people

303
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,760
our teahouse opens tomorrow.

304
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,640
Customers will get a 40% discount
in the first two days.

305
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,920
Next time,
when you come with the candy wrapper,

306
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,280
you'll get candies again

307
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,680
and enjoy another 10% discount.

308
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,480
- You can enjoy the best
- I want more.

309
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,560
- Jiangnan pastries with a 50% discount.
- I want more.

310
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,440
Please have a try.

311
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,120
Would you like to go inside?

312
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,920
OK. Let's go inside and have a look.

313
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,560
Let's go.

314
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,360
I didn't expect that

315
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,760
- supervising work is so tiring.
- Give it to me.

316
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,600
When you volunteered to
prepare and serve tea,

317
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
I didn't agree with you.

318
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,840
Two plates plus four bowls

319
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,240
already weigh two catties.

320
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,600
If I can hold a pipa,

321
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,720
I can push the screen.

322
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,680
Pan'er,

323
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,240
the teahouse needs a plaque.

324
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,520
What shall we inscribe it?

325
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,400
You'll inscribe it.

326
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,840
Me?

327
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,560
No.

328
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,720
I can't even read 100 characters.

329
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,520
Our teahouse is

330
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,760
treading a path of rustic charm.

331
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,880
A plaque that is likely
inscribed by a child

332
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,040
will cater to
those men of literature and writing.

333
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,080
Do it. Have a try.

334
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,520
I'm going to do it.

335
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,000
You must use it.

336
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,120
I've written it.

337
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,720
What have you written?

338
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,800
I'm waiting to show you.

339
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,360
Look.

Zhao's Teahouse.

342
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,520
Right.

343
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,120
Zhao's Teahouse.

344
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,000
Right.

(Zhao's Teahouse)

346
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,920
Is it straight?

347
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,560
It's OK.

348
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,840
Get down. Take care.

349
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,520
It's really nice.

When did you beauties

366
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,400
come to the capital?

367
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,840
Why didn't you come when I was young?

368
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,600
Come in and have a cup of tea.

369
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,880
I can't afford it.

370
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,640
You're too pretty to be honest.

You...

374
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,860
(No charge if it's tasteless.)

375
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,120
There's a new teahouse.

376
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,600
I've never seen it.

377
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,400
Does your food taste good?

378
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,640
No charge if it's tasteless.

379
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,320
Really? No charge if it's tasteless?

380
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,840
What if it is tasty?

381

You'll enjoy a 50% discount.

382

Really?

383
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,960
50% discount?
Is there such a good thing?

384
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,000
We'll be fools
if we don't take advantage of it.

385
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,640
Let's not be fools.

386
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,480
Let's eat them right into the ground.

387

Do you see that?

394

It's really nice.

Nice.

Please sit down.

407

It's on the house. Please enjoy.

Enjoy yourselves.

411

Perilla Drink.

415
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,600
Coming right up.

416
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,960
It's tasty.

417

Ma'am, bring us another plate.

418
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:57,920
OK.

Behold.

422
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,800
Well done.

423
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,800
Great.

424
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,880
Jiangnan does have special tea ceremony.

425
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,120

- Yes.
- Yes.

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,520
Will you come, everyone?

434
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,840
Yes.

435
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,440
Definitely.

436
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,400
You shouldn't come alone.

437
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,920
You should take your parents,

438
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
uncles, aunts, brothers
and sister-in-laws.

439

- Yes.
- No problem.

440
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,120
Have some more.

(South Gate)

442
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,000
Boss, shall we knock off?

443
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,920
Rub the ink stick.

444
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,920
Well...

445
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,640
Stop.

446
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,240
You look spaced-out.

447
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,560
No.

448
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,480
I'm always like this.

449
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,280
I'm too busy
to attend to anything else recently.

450
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,040
I asked you
to investigate Ouyang Xu's case.

451
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,960
How was it going?

452
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,600
I wrote a memorandum.

453
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,600
Here it is.

454
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,280
Palace, observe, official?

455
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,680
I reminded you.

456
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,240
You were too busy to read it.

457
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,600
You did not elaborate

458
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,520
and stalled deliberately
on showing it to me.

459
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,760
What did Zhao Pan'er do

460
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,280
that scared Ouyang out of his wits

461
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,320
and made him
give up his promising career

462
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,800
in order to leave the capital?

463
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,640
Well...

464
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,160
Well...

465
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,240
Knock off.

466
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,360
Knock off.

467
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,560
Thanks, Boss.

(Prudent In Business)

469
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,720
Chen Lian,

470
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,920
the matter you asked me to deal with
is almost done.

471
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,200
Within three days,

472
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,360
Fei-qian will be sent to
the Eastern Capital.

473
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,040
Moreover,

474
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,680
the teahouse you introduced

475
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,080
is really nice.

476
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,200
The shopkeeper, Ms. Zhao,

477
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,800
is really a peerless beauty.

478
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,720
Standing behind the counter,

479
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,800
she looks exactly like
the legendary woman, Zhuo Wen...

480
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,000
Zhuo Wenjun.

481
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,440
Mr. Gu.

Teahouse?

484
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,080
Boss,

485
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,200
you told me to meet
all demands of Pan'er.

486
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,960
I dare not tell you
without her permission.

487
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,740
(Zhao's Teahouse)

488
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,160
Thanks.

489
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,120
I'm really sorry to bother you guys.

490
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,800
Next time when you come,

491
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,400
we'll offer you a 90% discount.

492
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,080
Really?

493
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,520
That's good.

494
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,160
Thanks.

495
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,000
Thanks for your entertainment. See you.

496
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,480
OK, take care.

497
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,760
Ms. Zhao, your business seems good.

498
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,760
It looks like you have to open at night.

499
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,600
Not today.

500
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,880
Today is the first day.

501
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,360
I didn't expect
there would be so many guests.

502
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,440
All food and drinks are sold out.

503
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,440
You look proud.

504
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,400
Of course.

505
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,720
Don't you think
our teahouse is tasteful?

506
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,400
It only takes us three days

507
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,240
to open the teahouse

508
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,320
since we decided to do the business.

509
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,200
I've even begun to admire myself.

510
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,960
Speaking of that, I should thank you

511
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,240
for convincing us to stay
in the Eastern Capital.

512
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,680
We've got much more guests here
than we did in Qiantang.

513
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,160
Cut the euphemisms.

514
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,120
You know what I'm trying to say.

515
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,320
After all the trouble you took
to drive Ouyang Xu

516
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,320
out of the Eastern Capital,

517
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,360
you appear in public
in such a high profile.

518
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,040
Aren't you afraid of

519
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,320
what the Gao Family would do to you

520
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,200
if they know about your existence?

521
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,280
Do you suggest I should hide forever?

522
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,080
Ouyang Xu tried to
drive me out of the Eastern Capital.

523
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,480
I won't let him get what he wants.

524
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,680
I know whatever I say,

525
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,080
you have more to reply to me.

526
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,560
I didn't ask you to stay

527
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,200
to run a business.

528
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,480
I know you would say that.

529
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,320
That's why I asked Chen Lian
not to tell you.

530
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,240
If I don't run a business,

531
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,960
how could the three of us make a living?

532
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,920
How do we pay the rent?

533
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,320
Shall we eat ourselves
out of house and home?

534
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,720
Would I sit by and watch that happen?

535
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,600
When we were in Jiangnan,

536
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,520
you said you needed hundreds of strings,

537
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
and I lent you without hesitation.

538
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,600
If I live in the house rented by you

539
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,120
and spend your money,

540
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,640
what would people think of us?

541
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,240
Who would they think I am?

542
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,000
Your concubine?

543
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,680
Nonsense.

544
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,560
Who dares to say that?

545
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,280
I'm going to tear his mouth.

546
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,000
You're really generous.

547
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,400
But, borrowing from you

548
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,840
makes me feel inferior.

549
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,960
You may lend us

550
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,440
once or twice.

551
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,040
What about 10 times, 100 times?

552
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,720
I would do it thousands,
millions, billions of times.

553
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,320
Are they fighting?

554
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,320
Why do I feel they're flirting?

555
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,960
Chen Lian, here you are.

556
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,600
Sanniang.

557
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,920
The pastries I left specially for you.

558
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,280
Take care.

559
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,120
Don't choke yourself.

560
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,440
My Zifang loves it too.

561
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,640
He was as greedy as you when he ate it.

562
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,920
Zifang?

563
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,120
Your son?

564
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,680
Where is he?

565
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,240
Don't choke again.

566
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,720
Mr. Gu.

567
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,720
Did he come, too?

568
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,080
Don't interrupt.

569
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,280
They're having a fight.

570
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,040
Why are they fighting for nothing?

571
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,440
My boss

572
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,720
isn't happy with you
running business here.

573
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,120
Why?

574
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,200
No reason.

575
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,960
Anyway, Yinzhang, don't mind them.

576
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,400
What are you looking at?

577
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,960
Stop looking.

578
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,560
Have a piece of pastry.

579
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,280
It's delicious.

580
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,000
The reason why I open the teahouse

581
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,920
is to wait for Ouyang Xu.

582
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,240
When he returns,

583
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,000
I'll get The Night Revels back.

584
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,800
Retrieving the painting
is sort of an official business.

585
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,800
It doesn't matter
if you can't get it back.

586
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,760
I'm worried about you.

587
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,640
I'm getting busier and busier.

588
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,560
What if I get negligent
and can't protect you well?

589
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,680
I can stand on my own feet

590
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,800
without other's protection.

591
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,760
Am I an outsider?

592
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,320
I didn't mean you're an outsider.

593
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,160
Ouyang Xu,
who hasn't got an official job,

594
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,560
had already given you a hard time.

595
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,640
Your business is good.

596
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,480
What if people get jealous?

597
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,400
The Gao Family
needn't do it themselves.

598
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,320
By hiring some local ruffians,

599
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,280
they would make you miserable.

600
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,040
Before I knew you,

601
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,160
I had been running business
in Qiantang for years.

602
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,880
I know the rules.

603
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,120
I've paid the head of guilds.

604
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,440
I've also bribed the Village Head.

605
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,120
Before you came back,

606
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,400
we had dealt with some local ruffians.

607
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,440
We defeated them.

608
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,560
Don't forget, if Sanniang gets wild,

609
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,400
she could batter you unconscious.

610
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,760
Anyway, you always have your reasons.

611
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,240
I'm not being stubborn.

612
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,120
I really want to open the teahouse.

613
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,840
I decided to stay in the Eastern Capital

614
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,600
partly because of your prodding.

615
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,800
Then that day I was preparing
for the opening of the teahouse,

616
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,320
when I picked up the teapot

617
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,640
and the abacus,

618
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,000
my grievances and anger
suddenly dissipated.

619
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,600
The Eastern Capital is so big, so nice.

620
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
If you can stay here,

621
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,760
we can make a living here, too.

622
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,200
I have a hunch.

623
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,560
We'll make the teahouse

624
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,960
even better than we did

625
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,720
in Qiantang.

626
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,400
I passed by Jinghua Academy
on my way here.

627
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,200
I heard the students reading,

628
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,640
oranges change with their environment.

629
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,800
Right. You did a good job in Qiantang.

630
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,080
But it doesn't necessarily mean

631
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,560
you can do it as well here.

632
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,720
Really?

633
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,440
Don't you think the guests

634
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,800
are the best proof?

635
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,680
Would you wager me?

636
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,920
The wager shall be limited to one month.

637
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
After one month,

638
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,080
if your teahouse

639
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,240
is still profitable,

640
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,920
I'll let go of it.

641
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,920
If it suffers a deficit...

642
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,080
OK.

643
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,320
In that case, I'll do whatever you ask.

644
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,360
Or maybe you should ask an accountant
to check the accounts.

645
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,560
Enough.

646
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,360
Invite me in and serve me a cup of tea.

647
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,320
Let's see if you've made progress

648
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,840
or lagged behind comparing
with a month ago.

649
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,320
I've always been making progress
on tea ceremony.

650
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,160
I just wish

651
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,960
you wouldn't pull a knife against me.

652
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,360
If I remember correctly,

653
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,560
last time, you put some

654
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,280
suspicious ingredients in my tea first.

655
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,720
You deserved it.
You were really annoying.

656
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,120
You were no better.

657
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,480
You capitalized on my difficulties
and were audacious in the extreme.

658
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,960
You also distorted the right

659
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,920
and were opinionated.

660
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,800
Distorted the right, be opinionated?

661
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,840
You are such a...

662
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,160
Mr. Gu,

663
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,080
please don't be angry with Pan'er.

664
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,800
I didn't listen to her

665
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,920
and ran away with Zhou She,

666
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,560
which led us into such a huge trouble.

667
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,240
I tried to
drop my official registration,

668
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,360
which implicated her
in offending Ouyang Xu.

669
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,960
I insisted on opening the teahouse, too.

670
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,200
It was me

671
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,600
to be blamed on.

672
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,400
No, I didn't intend to blame Pan'er.

673
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,520
You don't have to

674
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,640
take the blame for everything.

675
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,360
Yeah, Pan'er told me

676
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,960
you are

677
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,200
in poor health.

678
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,360
If you want to build a career here,

679
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,080
you should think it over.

680
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,840
You should learn more,
work harder,

681
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,440
take good care of yourself

682
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,160
and try to be stronger.

683
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,160
Next time when something like
the case with Ouyang Xu happens again,

684
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,440
except for blaming yourself,

685
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,840
what else can you do?

686
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,680
OK, I'm going to skip the tea.

687
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,640
I have to go.

688
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,080
Have a booming business, Ms. Zhao.

689
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,800
He finally left.

690
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,880
I'm exhausted.

691
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,440
Later,

692
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,840
I'll get the drinks prepared

693
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,480
for tomorrow.

694
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,760
We can't manage all this
by ourselves.

695
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,920
We need a hand.

696
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,560
Yes.

697
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,160
I can help, too.

698
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,400
Mr. Gu,

699
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,440
I want to help, too.

700
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,120
But what can I do?

701
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,800
Next time when something like

702
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,360
the case with Ouyang Xu happens again...

703
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,640
Did you try to tell me

704
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,800
the Gao Family may
retaliate against us in the future?

705
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,120
But they can't even deal with you.

706
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,520
(I've been proud of myself.)

707
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,710
I think my voice
is peerless in the world,

708
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,520
not expecting it's greatly inferior to

709
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,040
your pipa skill.

710
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,040
(There are too many officials)

711
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,920
(who have never seen
His Majesty in their lives.)

712
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,000
What about me?

713
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,600
I'm only 23 years old,

714
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,630
yet I've been praised twice
by His Majesty and the Empress.

715
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,520
Twice.

716
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,710
His Majesty?

717
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,280
He is more powerful than the Gao Family.

718
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,040
If I'm like Zhang Haohao...

719
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,880
Excuse me,

720
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,120
I'm not feeling well.

721
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,000
I won't go to the teahouse today.

722
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,720
Have a good rest.

723
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,320
Come and have some breakfast.

724
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,960
I'm not hungry yet.

725
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,840
I'm going back to my room.

726
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,920
Let's eat fast.

727
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,360
We have to go to the teahouse
after the breakfast.

728
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:39,700
(Music Division)

729
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,800
How is your preparation?

730
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,160
It's arranged well here.

731
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,680
Excuse me, where is Mr. Yuan?

732
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,480
Over there.

733
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,240
Remember the rhythm.

734
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,760
There must be
rising and falling in cadence.

735
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,480
Do you know what rising and falling are?

736
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,600
Put your hands here.

737
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,860
(Shen Ruzhuo)

738
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,240
A high note struck by the chord is
like inverted bell echoes in a temple.

739
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,560
The high notes broke the tune
and interweave with the low.

740
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,400
What a tune of Western Liangzhou!

741
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,160
I'm Song Yinzhang
from Qiantang Music Bureau.

742
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,040
I have a letter from
State Magistrate Xu of Xiuzhou.

743
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,840
I wonder where Mr. Yuan is.

744
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,680
(Yuan Changhe, Head of Music Division)
I'm Yuan Changhe.

745
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,360
I'm honored to see you.

746
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,680
This is Mr. Xu's letter to you.

747
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,500
(Letter to Mr. Yuan)

748
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,760
Pan'er,

749
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,240
could you take me
to the Eastern Capital

750
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,600
to see Mr. Ouyang?

751
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,520
But you're a
registered musician of Qiantang.

752
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,280
It's not hard.

753
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,760
Though I can't influence
Hangzhou Music Bureau,

754
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,600
I can write a letter

755
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,040
and ask Ms. Song to deliver it

756
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,840
to the Music Division
of the Eastern Capital.

757
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,040
Then you won't have any difficulties
to go to the capital.

758
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:11,880
Really?

759
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:12,960
Great.

760
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,120
Thank you, my lord.

761
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,480
Mr. Xu is really kind.

762
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,040
They are just
two volumes of music score.

763
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,800
Why did he take the trouble
to write a letter himself?

764
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,000
I heard from the musicians
of the Qianwang's Mansion

765
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,800
that you've reached
the acme of perfection

766
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,560
and are called
the best pipa player in Jiangnan.

767
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,680
By hearing your tune today,

768
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,600
I think you're true to your name.

769
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,280
Thanks for you to deliver the letter.

770
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,040
May I ask do you have any plans

771
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,520
in the capital?

772
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,400
Since you've asked,

773
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,320
I'll make bold to speak frankly.

774
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,080
I used to belong to
Qiantang Music Bureau.

775
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,440
Because I had no match
on playing pipa,

776
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,520
I haven't made any progress
over the last few years.

777
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,840
I heard there are many master-hands
in the Eastern Capital.

778
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,720
I wonder if I could be
transferred to your division.

779
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,120
That would be great.

780
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,640
Among the 13 sections
and branches of our division,

781
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,320
only pipa branch
has been neglected for years.

782
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,600
I was thinking about how I should

783
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,600
ask you to stay just now.

784
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,480
Hurry, bring me the transfer papers.

785
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,160
Yes.

786
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,640
Thank you, sir.

787
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,120
You're welcome.

788
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,240
In his letter,

789
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,520
Mr. Xu asked me to take care of you.

790
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,680
Though you have excellent skills,

791
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,280
you're new in the capital after all.

792
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,990
Why don't you

793
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,160
take the position of pipa coach first?

794
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,160
After a few months,

795
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,320
when you get familiar with
the etiquette and rules,

796
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,920
you can go to the palace to perform.

797
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,600
With your skill,

798
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,560
you'll surely be rewarded.

799
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,120
Really?

800
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,720
I came here simply to
pay a visit to His Majesty.

801
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,160
On my way to the capital,

802
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,320
I happened to get a box of ambergris.

803
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,120
Would you like to examine it for me?

804
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:16,920
Well...

805
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,920
You're too kind.

806
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,000
All right, let me show you around.

807
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,680
Please.

808
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,560
This is Yun Shao Music Section,
Fa Music Section,

809
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,440
Fife Section and so on.

810
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,320
There are only four musicians
in your Pipa Branch.

811
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,640
The head is in vacancy.

812
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,560
You are the only coach.

813
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,760
Every 15 days,

814
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,360
you need to work for two days
in the division,

815
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,280
either performing,

816
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,400
instructing your musicians

817
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,400
or practicing music together.

818
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,880
It'll be your own choice.

819
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,920
Sir, you have a guest.

820
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,760
Excuse me.

821
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,800
Please look around.

822
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,320
Ms. Song,

823
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,320
may I have the privilege

824
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,280
of showing you around?

825
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,720
I'm Shen Ruzhuo, Editorial Director.

826
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,520
I came for business today,

827
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,320
not expecting to hear your fairy music.

828
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,360
It's a great luck.

829
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,480
I'm flattered.

830
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,320
Ms. Song, come with me.

831
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,840
I'll show you around the Division.
