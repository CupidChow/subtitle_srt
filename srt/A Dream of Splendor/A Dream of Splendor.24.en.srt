What do you want to do?

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,560
I found it.

21
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,200
You...

22
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,600
You're with the Gao Family.

23
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,600
Smart. No wonder you're
the Third Graduate.

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,600
Write the divorce letter now!

25
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,160
I won't.

26
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,030
You don't have to write.

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,160
There will be an announcement
from the Ziji Palace tomorrow

28
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,720
that Deputy Commissioner Ouyang Xu
became ill and died.

00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,480
You're too bold.

32
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,200
I'm a court official,

33
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,600
the newly selected Third Graduate!

34
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,460
(Divorce Letter)

35
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,620
(Written by Ouyang Xu
in the Western Capital)

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,200
If your lady finds out

37
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,200
what you have done to me today,

38
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,720
she will show you no mercy.

39
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,160
How unrealistic you are.

40
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,120
Do you think it's our master
who wants to break you up?

41
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,160
Listen,

42
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,640
it was our lady

43
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,960
who ordered us to get the divorce letter

44
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,240
from you.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,720
It's impossible.

46
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,320
Our lady

47
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,160
has become good friends with Ms. Zhao.

48
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,600
She knows about all the dirty things

49
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,000
you've done.

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,600
Gao Hui is ruthless.

51
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,320
How would she let Zhao Pan'er go?

52
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,600
Shut up!

53
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,080
Remember,

54
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,000
the Gao Family will have nothing
to do with you from now on.

55
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,960
If you say one word

56
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,240
about what happened tonight,

57
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,160
even if the Gao Family will let you go,

58
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,960
the Capital Security Office
will still come after you!

59
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
The Capital Security Office?

60
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,920
Does His Majesty also know about this?

61
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,280
If His Majesty knew,

62
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,760
you'd be in Yazhou in exile by now!

63
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,800
Ms. Zhao

64
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,080
will marry Gu Qianfan

65
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,880
of the Capital Security Office soon.

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,520
You can just keep dreaming.

67
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,160
Zhao Pan'er, why are you
getting married again?

68
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,160
Gu Qianfan.

69
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,800
Gu Qianfan!

70
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,320
Be careful.

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,950
It's raining heavily.
Let me take you home.

72
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,680
There is no need.
I can go back on my own.

73
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,480
It's not far away.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,640
Yinzhang.

75
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,960
The Golden House is ready.

76
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,440
Don't keep me waiting for too long.

77
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,400
(I've never seen)

78
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,320
such a delicate

79
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,280
and talented young lady like you.

80
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,400
You're a treasure.

81
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,760
You're not supposed
to fall into the mire.

82
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,440
Let me take care of you and protect you,

83
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,640
will you?

84
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,120
Deputy Commissioner Gu?

85
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,320
That's how you keep them waiting?

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,320
Look at the sweat on their foreheads.

87
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,600
I was thoughtless.

88
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,960
Go.

89
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,080
Deputy Commissioner Gu,
thank you for just now.

90
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,120
I should be thanking you
for helping me out.

91
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,680
I'll visit you in the teahouse
in a day or two.

92
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,640
(No, no.)

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,680
(How can I be so greedy?)

94
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,200
(I can't be like this.)

95
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,720
Yinzhang?

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,760
Pan'er.

97
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,440
The servant in the Xiao's Mansion said

98
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,480
you left from the side door.

99
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,920
Where have you been?

100
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,080
I...

101
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,400
I was picked up by the people
of the Music Division.

102
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,120
There were so many people there.

103
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,720
I was running

104
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,400
and disoriented
when I got in the carriage.

105
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,920
Then I realized
I got on the wrong carriage.

106
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,760
Oh, right. There are other sisters
from the Music Division in the carriage.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,160
I made the decision

108
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,560
to send them back first.

109
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,840
That's why I'm back so late.

110
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,720
It's good that you're back.

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,720
Those people were like crazy.

112
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,680
Are you okay?

113
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,800
Let me see the words Minister Ke wrote.

114
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,540
(Self-esteem by Ke Zheng)

115
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,920
His calligraphy is sturdy
but elegant indeed.

116
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,840
Let's hurry back.

117
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,480
Sanniang and Zhaodi
have a celebration party for you.

118
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,840
You have to tell me
what happened at the minister's mansion.

119
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,640
Go to the Capital Security Office tonight
and get the criminal here.

120
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,600
But last time Deputy Commissioner Gu

121
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,280
didn't even show you respect.

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,800
Don't worry. I've warned him.

123
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,280
Interrogate the criminal
as soon as he gets here.

124
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,040
Remember,

125
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,520
we must convict

126
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,680
Duke An.

127
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,600
But,

128
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,080
if we blame the whole thing on Duke An,

129
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,360
doesn't it mean Xiao Qinyan
will get away with it?

130
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,840
Why are you as short-sighted

131
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,200
as Ke Zheng's disciples?

132
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,560
I remember.

133
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,560
Your older sister
is Zheng Qingtian's wife.

134
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,680
Yes.

135
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
My mother died when I was young.

136
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,040
I was brought up by my elder sister.

137
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,040
You want to avenge your sister.

138
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,440
Ke Zheng's disciples
want to avenge their teacher.

139
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,680
But it's not as easy as you think.

140
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,000
Can a little Hat Demon you created

141
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,320
make His Majesty suspect Xiao Qinyan?

142
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,720
Don't forget

143
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,600
that Xiao Qinyan got promoted

144
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,440
for supernatural things.

145
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,240
Can you bring him down
with such a little move?

146
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,000
It was our oversight.

147
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,880
Ke Zheng always regards himself

148
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,280
as a man of integrity.

149
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,910
If he finds out his disciples

150
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,080
dealt with Xiao Qinyan

151
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,030
in such a way,

152
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,840
I'm afraid he will die of anger
on the road.

153
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,440
Besides, blaming it on Duke An

154
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,160
is killing two birds with one stone.

155
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
It can hurt Xiao Qinyan,

156
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,160
get us out of this,

157
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,920
and make His Majesty vigilant
at the same time.

158
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,200
Then he will appoint
the Crown Prince early

159
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,760
and stabilize
the foundation of the state.

160
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,200
When the Crown Prince
administers the state,

161
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,880
there will be no room
for a woman in politics.

162
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,520
When the iceberg falls,

163
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,520
Her Majesty' men like Xiao Qinyan

164
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,880
will lose their power.

165
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,760
You're insightful indeed.

166
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,120
I'm impressed.

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,080
At the end of the banquet,

168
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,320
I remember Minister Ke walked over
to Deputy Commissioner Gu

169
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,000
and said, "you're good."

170
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,040
What's more, I've never seen him

171
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,880
wield his sword
when he made raw fish slices.

172
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,360
Try my red bean smoothie.

173
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,240
Is it done?

174
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,440
It's the perfect thing to eat
on a hot day.

175
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,680
Yinzhang, come on.

176
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,160
Did you bring the fish back

177
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,400
when you made extra money

178
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,320
by digging up lotus roots?

179
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,120
Yeah.

180
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,920
All right.

181
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,040
You've been smiling all day.
What's wrong with you?

182
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,240
You know what,

183
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,000
I just found out

184
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,360
why his name is Chen Lian.

185
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,880
Why?

186
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,000
When he was a kid,

187
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,920
the Lian in his name means lotus.

188
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,000
His mother had a few daughters
before she had him.

189
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,320
She was worried
she couldn't raise a son well,

190
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,760
so she gave him
a girl's name on purpose,

191
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,240
and asked Boss Lotus

192
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,520
to be his godfather.

193
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,440
No wonder he was able to recommend you
for digging lotus roots.

194
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,400
Hurry and eat.

195
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,920
It's too cold. I'll eat it slowly.

196
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,160
Chen Lian

197
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,920
was actually raised as a girl
for so many years.

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,480
The next time I see him,

199
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,360
I'll have to...

200
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,840
All right, stop it.

201
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,840
Yinzhang hasn't finished yet.

202
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,480
Yinzhang, go on and tell me about

203
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,360
the birthday banquet
at the minister's mansion.

204
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,400
You said the bowls and plates
they used to serve food

205
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,000
are imperial porcelain, right?

206
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,840
Imperial porcelain
is only used for ordinary dishes.

207
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,360
When they served humps,

208
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,280
they used large rosewood carved bowls.

209
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,000
Deputy Commissioner Gu's raw fish slices

210
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,760
was served on an imperial disk.

211
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,720
Minister Duke Xiao
specifically ordered that.

212
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Speaking of raw fish slices,

213
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,480
can you make it, Sanniang?

214
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,960
Of course I can.

215
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,080
I'll make it tomorrow
and let you have a taste.

216
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,840
I'm sure it will be
as thin as a cicada's wings

217
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,720
and no worse than what Gu Qianfan made.

218
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,600
Why don't we take
this lucky chance of Yinzhang

219
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,600
and add raw fish slices to our menu?

220
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,200
Now summer's here.

221
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,440
Our teahouse is in the off season.

222
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,680
Making raw fish slices doesn't need fire.
It's also a fresh dish.

223
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,640
Okay.

224
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,000
(No.)

225
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,480
Teahouse is a place
to enjoy music and taste tea.

226
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,960
How can we suddenly start selling food?

227
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,400
Highbrow things and lowbrow things

228
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,760
can't be mixed together.

229
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,840
We're just chatting and making jokes.

230
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,480
Don't take it too seriously.

231
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,480
What do you mean
I'm taking it too seriously?

232
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,680
Pan'er.

233
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,440
Half-hidden is an elegant place.

234
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,400
Isn't that what you used to say?

235
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,320
You two also said

236
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,920
if one of us

237
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,280
disagrees with a way

238
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,320
to run the teahouse,

239
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,440
we won't do it in that way.

240
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,800
Have you all forgotten?

241
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,160
I didn't sleep all night.

242
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,680
I'll go back to my room.

243
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,440
What's wrong with Yinzhang?

244
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,120
Why was she so angry?

245
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,360
I guess we kept interrupting her

246
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,320
and she got upset.

247
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,680
But she had been
talking for a while about

248
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,800
how beautiful
the layout of the mansion is,

249
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,800
how rich the guests are there,

250
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,520
and how many people crowded
in front of the mansion

251
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,680
just to take a look at her.

252
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,840
I've even seen Minister Ke's words

253
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,640
on her pipa three times.

254
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,480
Today is a rare happy day for her.

255
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,920
Becoming famous in the capital

256
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,520
is something to be proud of.

257
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,920
But no matter how proud she is,

258
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,160
she shouldn't show off at home.

259
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,760
You and Pan'er
cooked a nice meal for her

260
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,680
to celebrate her success.

261
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,120
What's more,

262
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,280
why did she keep praising
Deputy Commissioner Gu

263
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,240
in front of Pan'er?

264
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,400
She made us awkward.

265
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,960
She probably doesn't know about them.

266
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,520
No way.

267
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,320
Even that dumb boy, Chen Lian, and I

268
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,280
can see that.

269
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,840
Is she dumber than Chen Lian?

270
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,400
Show some respect.

271
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,000
You also work for her.

272
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,080
I just think

273
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,120
she's been different

274
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,640
since she came back
from the minister's mansion.

275
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,720
Oh right, Sanniang.

276
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,680
Are we really
not going to sell raw fish slices?

277
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,720
But pastries

278
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,080
are also food.

279
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,240
Why do we have to
struggle with teahouse?

280
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,640
Besides, I think

281
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,240
you cook better

282
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,840
than you make pastries.

283
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,360
You've been a waitress, too.

284
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,720
You know the difference
between a restaurant and a teahouse.

285
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,320
Let's do the math.

286
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,040
For a restaurant with ten tables,

287
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,640
apart from the owner,

288
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,640
there should be two servers,
two handymen, and two cooks.

289
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,120
How many people do we have?

290
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,480
Besides, how many more stoves
will we need?

291
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,160
How many more dishes will we need?

292
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
Have you done the math?

293
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,080
We can hire more people

294
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,480
if we are understaffed.

295
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,080
The Eastern Capital is big.

296
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,920
I'm sure there are
plenty of restaurants for sale.

297
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,320
Besides, teahouses can't sell food,

298
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,480
but restaurants can sell tea.

299
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,560
(But if you marry Zhao Pan'er,)

300
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,400
(you can never be a civil official.)

301
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,840
If your wife used to be a businesswoman,

302
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,880
those imperial censors
won't let you get away with it.

303
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,600
You will bear a reputation
for breaching marriage etiquette.

304
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,760
Not to mention
being a high civil official,

305
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,480
even your mother's title will be lost.

306
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,360
What's wrong? You've been absent-minded.

307
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,680
Nothing.

308
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,000
Pan'er.

309
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,800
If I won't let

310
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,800
Censor Qi be our matchmaker,

311
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,200
will you still marry me?

312
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,360
That's what you're hung up on?

313
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
Of course I will.

314
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,840
I want to marry you.

315
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,560
It doesn't matter who the matchmaker is.

316
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,240
Thank you.

317
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,480
What's the point of just saying that?

318
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,680
I need you to promise me one more thing.

319
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,880
Go ahead. I'll promise you anything.

320
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,440
I want to open a restaurant.

321
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,800
Don't be on your guard all the time.

322
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,560
I've been in the Eastern Capital
long enough to know some facts.

323
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,520
Firstly,

324
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,560
people here don't like tea
as much as people in the south.

325
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,760
Running a restaurant
will make more money.

326
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,440
Secondly, Sanniang
used to run a restaurant.

327
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,560
She cooks better
than she makes pastries.

328
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,400
I have some money left,

329
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,760
and someone is willing
to offer a good price

330
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,840
for Half-hidden.

331
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,240
Why can't I do it?

332
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,280
Most of the customers

333
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,320
who came to your teahouse were literati.

334
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,800
But if you run a restaurant,

335
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,960
there will be

336
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,120
all kinds of people coming.

337
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,040
It's definitely easier to make money.

338
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,520
I'm just worried
it will be harder for you.

339
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,840
You should think it over.

340
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,800
But my father was also an official.

341
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,160
I know something about official circles.

342
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,640
I asked around.

343
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,440
Fengdeng Shop,
which sells imperial wine,

344
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,080
is the private property
of Militia Captain Jiang's mother.

345
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,480
Many of the families
of the empress and consorts

346
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,080
are also doing restaurant business.

347
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,520
You don't have to do this for me.

348
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,910
It's not totally for you.

349
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,880
The business is growing.

350
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,760
I want some peace and quiet,

351
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,600
and I don't want to greet guests myself.

352
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,430
What's more, Sanniang
can focus on cooking in this way

353
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,960
and doesn't have to be a server
at the same time.

354
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,280
Besides, husband and wife

355
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,430
are supposed
to be considerate of each other.

356
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,000
That's the right way to do it.

357
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,080
Thank you.

358
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
Don't say that.
Nothing has been settled.

359
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,640
Not to mention there is nothing settled
about the restaurant,

360
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,120
I'm afraid Yinzhang
is not willing to come

361
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,520
because she thinks
the restaurant is not quiet enough.

362
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,800
I've been having
some trouble with her lately.

363
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,120
Minister Ke wrote her some words.

364
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,040
The pride in her

365
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,400
is floating up again.

366
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,320
Even biological sisters

367
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,040
are not always on good terms.

368
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
If you need, I'll get Shen Ruzhuo here.

369
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,080
I'll induce and threaten him

370
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,560
to talk to Song Yinzhang.

371
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,840
Deputy Commissioner Gu is mighty indeed.

372
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,560
I'm flattered.

373
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,120
Jesus!

374
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,160
Hat Demon!

375
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,320
Hat Demon is coming!

376
00:17:59,320 --> 00:17:59,880
Go!

377
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,800
Hat Demon is coming!

378
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,680
Hat Demon is coming!

379
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,880
Hat Demon is coming!

380
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,120
Hurry!

381
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,280
Pull in to shore!

382
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:06,920
Hat Demon is coming!

383
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,520
Go!

384
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,040
Go!

385
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,640
What happened?

386
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,760
It's terrible.

387
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,120
This is brutal.

388
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,520
Hat Demon is coming!

389
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,680
Hat Demon is coming!

390
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
Hat Demon is coming!

391
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,240
Help!

392
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:30,960
Go!

393
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,920
Run!

394
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,900
(Wine)

395
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,640
Qianfan!

396
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,000
I told you not to come.

397
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,680
We've been through
danger together so many times.

398
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,560
Let's also face it together this time.

399
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,440
Didn't you say

400
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,760
you've found out about the Hat Demon?

401
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,720
The victim died
in a different way this time.

402
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,960
Looks like chaos is about
to engulf the Eastern Capital.

403
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,800
Is there anyone
who wants to commit a crime again

404
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,720
in the name of the Hat Demon?

405
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,880
Today the Hat Demon
showed up in the Tea Lane.

406
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,040
You must be careful, too.

407
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,840
It's a holiday today.

408
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,920
By tomorrow,

409
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,320
there will be more people coming
to listen to pipa.

410
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,160
I've just got some people to help me.

411
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,160
I'll be attentive.

412
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,160
There must be a catch in this.

413
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,120
The prisoner is clearly in prison.

414
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,360
How would he show up
on a busy street of the Eastern Capital?

415
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,760
And it happened to be the day

416
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,520
before the I'm going to present
the Hat Demon case to His Majesty.

417
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,800
What are you suspecting?

418
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,320
The Capital Security Office did it.

419
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,480
It's Gu Qianfan.

420
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
He didn't listen to you

421
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,040
and he was afraid
we would steal the credit.

422
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,880
Why are you still
holding on to Gu Qianfan?

423
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,640
Since he gave you the man,

424
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,000
he won't do such things.

425
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,720
Then it must be Lei Jing.

426
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,880
That guy didn't help much

427
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,120
when I went to ask for the criminal
from Gu Qianfan last time.

428
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,840
He is a two-faced man.

429
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,360
What if Duke An also bought him off

430
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,000
and created another Hat Demon

431
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,400
to exonerate himself?

432
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,560
I dare him to do that!

433
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,200
Re-prepare the statement and evidence.

434
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,400
Tell His Majesty

435
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,000
that the Capital Security Office

436
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,600
is behind the Hat Demon case.

437
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,960
I see.

438
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,680
But what if Lei Jing

439
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,720
blames everything on Gu Qianfan,

440
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,360
then...

441
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,880
Whether it's Lei Jing or Gu Qianfan,

442
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,840
they are both from
the Capital Security Office, right?

443
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,840
Whoever tries to ruin my plan to urge
His Majesty to choose the Crown Prince

444
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,480
will be met with my ruthlessness.

445
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,560
That was

446
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,840
some refreshing rain.

447
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,680
Yeah.

448
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,160
This rain

449
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,240
can cool people off.

450
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,000
You don't have to

451
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,280
talk to me about the restaurant anymore.

452
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,040
I'm 100% willing to do it.

453
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,480
I'll leave the rest to you.

454
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,640
I'll talk

455
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,440
to Yinzhang tomorrow.

456
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,920
The problem

457
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,480
is have we made enough money

458
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,160
to open a restaurant?

459
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,880
Not too much.

460
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,920
I'll get some from Qianfan,

461
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,480
and borrow some from the storehouse
and the pawn shop.

462
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,640
That should be enough.

463
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,120
We should thank Ouyang Xu.

464
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,200
We wouldn't be living such a good life

465
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,080
in the Eastern Capital

466
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,280
if he hadn't done what he did.

467
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,360
Exactly.

468
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,160
Not marrying him

469
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,200
was the luckiest thing

470
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,440
I ever did.

471
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,520
Don't squeeze!

472
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,680
Don't squeeze!

473
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,600
Please wait for a while.

474
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,320
Let us in.

475
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,200
What's the use of squeezing?

476
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,000
It has been a long time.

477
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,240
Extra shows?

478
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,440
No.

479
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,480
I know you're tired,

480
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,240
but there are all regulars today.

481
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,320
But I'm different now.

482
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,800
Minister Ke praised me in person.

483
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,520
If I put on extra shows
just for hundreds of smelly coins

484
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,720
and those priggish pedants,

485
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,640
how would I live up to

486
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,440
the characters on the pipa?

487
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,960
I was going to do one show today.

488
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,960
There's no way we can survive
in the Eastern Capital

489
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,760
without the smelly coins

490
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,680
and those priggish pedants.

491
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,160
That's not what I meant.

492
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
I'm just a little tired.

493
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,120
The so-called self-esteem

494
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,720
is in the heart, not in the form.

495
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,680
Don't squeeze!

496
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,720
Don't squeeze.

497
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,560
We don't want to squeeze.

498
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,400
Can you guarantee us regulars

499
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,440
will hear Ms. Song's pipa today?

500
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,920
Yeah, I've been waiting all morning.

501
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,440
But the teahouse is only this big.

502
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,000
The house is full now.

503
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,120
Can't you have an encore

504
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,960
in the main hall just like before?

505
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,360
(Half-hidden)
Yeah!

506
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,840
Calm down. Calm down.

507
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,040
Sanniang is outside to buy ice for you.

508
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,120
She'll be back soon to cool you off.

509
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,040
All right. All right.

510
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,480
Hurry. My feet are hurting.

511
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,360
Ms. Zhao is discussing
with Ms. Song about the encore.

512
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,440
Please wait a minute.

513
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,360
Wait a minute.

514
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,680
Hurry.

515
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,600
How long are we going to wait?

516
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,360
Move.

517
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,440
Yeah, hurry.

518
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,400
I know.

519
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,360
I'll play.

520
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,880
That's not what I meant.

521
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,920
I just...

522
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,960
Pan'er, are you finished?

523
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,360
They are getting restless again.

524
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,920
Tell them to wait for a while.

525
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,360
Okay.

526
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,680
Thank you.

527
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,800
I promise

528
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,520
I'll let you have a good rest tomorrow.

529
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,040
(Playing pipa is supposed
to be elegant.)

530
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,320
(I'm famous now.)

531
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,000
(Why do I still have to please them)

532
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,880
(like jugglers in a recreation place?)

533
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,600
(Why?)

534
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Move it back.

535
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,880
Put it there!

536
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,480
Okay.

537
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,560
This one's almost full. Pour it here.

538
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,840
Pour it here.

539
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:40,880
Madam!

540
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,560
Coming!

541
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,120
Come on, this way.

542
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,640
I think it's enough.

543
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,760
Thank you.

544
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,360
Thank you.

545
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,040
No problem.

546
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,000
Be careful.

547
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,640
Are you okay?

548
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,120
The ice is hard to get.

549
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,680
Hurry.

550
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,760
Over there, and there!

551
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,680
Okay.

552
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,960
Don't miss any.

553
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,640
Okay.

554
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,000
Slowly. There's no rush.

555
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,960
All right, slowly.

556
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,040
Put it there.

557
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,720
Okay.

558
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,040
It's you.

559
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,280
What sad things were you thinking of?

560
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,640
Your tears

561
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,920
came out.

562
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,800
Well,

563
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,960
I got the pastries
you sent me a few days ago.

564
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,240
It's delicious.

565
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,520
I don't think
you had any of the pastries.

566
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,040
Those brats split them all, right?

567
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
How do you know
if it's delicious or not?

568
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,240
How do you know that?

569
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,880
I could throw you in the river.

570
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,360
How would I not know your crappy things?

571
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,080
Eat pastries.

572
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,720
Well,

573
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,600
the Gao Family hasn't given you
any more trouble, right?

574
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,320
Don't worry about that.

575
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,080
It's okay.

576
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,920
Hold on. Hold on.

577
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,440
Here, take this.

578
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,360
Cool yourself off.

579
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,040
You're all sweaty from crying.

580
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,240
And you're a teacher.

581
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,560
It's my treat.

582
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,160
No.

583
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,920
This way!

584
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,100
(Ice)

585
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,840
Why am I thinking about

586
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,400
my wife eloped with someone else?

587
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,240
Who is playing such mournful music?

588
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,840
Bring her out

589
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
and teach her a good lesson!

590
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,960
It's the woman surnamed Song.

591
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,200
It's the pipa siren again.

592
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,320
Bah!

593
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,720
Zhang Haohao and I ended up like this

594
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,680
because of her.

595
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,560
Whoever on Zhao Pan'er's side

596
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,640
is not a good thing!

597
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,200
Young Master, don't be mad.

598
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,640
Well, Ms. Song is famous now.

599
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,000
She cut a figure

600
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,840
at the minister's mansion last time.

601
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,840
Now people who listen to her music
are officials.

602
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,600
We can't afford to mess with officials.

603
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,680
Bah!

604
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,640
Greetings to Young Master.

605
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,920
It's such a hot day.

606
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,240
Why are you here
to check the books in person?

607
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,540
(Wang's Ice Shop)

608
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,960
Have a piece of ice to cool off.

609
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,880
Let me say something to cheer you up.

610
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,480
It has been hot these days.

611
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,120
Our business is booming.

612
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,320
See, we just sent eight buckets of ice

613
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,600
to Half-hidden.

614
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,320
Half-hidden?

615
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,120
Did you sell these buckets of ice

616
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,760
to Zhao Pan'er?

617
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,640
Do you also know Ms. Zhao?

618
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,560
Not only do I know her,

619
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,960
but I have a vendetta against her!

620
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,160
Listen carefully,

621
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,840
I'm ordering you
as the head of the ice industry

622
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,960
in the Eastern Capital,

623
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,640
you will sell no ice to her from now on.

624
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,560
Otherwise,

625
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,240
you'll end up like this piece of ice!

626
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,440
It's so cold!

627
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,280
Look how crumbly that ice is.

628
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,920
Capital Security Office's
fireworks are pretty good.

629
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,480
You did it.

630
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,920
Did you guess it?

631
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,040
I chose the Tea Lane on purpose.

632
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,560
It can also cause trouble

633
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,080
for the opponents of Pan'er.

634
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,360
As her future father-in-law,

635
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,880
am I considerate?

636
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,440
Why did you do it?

637
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,680
Someone's trying to use
the Hat Demon thing against me.

638
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,920
You warned me before, didn't you?

639
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,240
Do you really think

640
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,200
the person behind all this

641
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:26,400
is Duke An who doesn't know anything?

642
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,720
Who else could it be?

643
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,640
Will you believe me if I tell you?

644
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,400
Qi Mu.

645
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,120
You don't believe me?

646
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,400
Right.

647
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,160
He is sanctimonious

648
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,320
and he has been a mentor to you.

649
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,560
Of course you don't believe me.

650
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,520
It's impossible.

651
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Many people among the high officials
want to bring you down.

652
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,760
He just wants

653
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,680
to reap the profits.

654
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,360
If His Majesty gets suspicious of me

655
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,400
because of the Hat Demon case,

656
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,200
who do you think
will be the biggest beneficiary?

657
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,000
You're in the game

658
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,560
and you can't see it clearly.

659
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,880
Don't forget

660
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,240
Qi Mu is the leader
of the high officials now

661
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,520
after Ke Zheng left.

662
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,880
Let me tell you one more thing.

663
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,400
Do you think Qi Mu approached you

664
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,880
and urged you to join
the Capital Security Office

665
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,440
for the sake of his friendship
with your grandfather?

666
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,680
Did he ever mention to you

667
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,440
he was one of the groomsmen

668
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,160
when your mother and I got married?

669
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,440
My silly son.

670
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,680
You have been cheated by Qi Mu.

671
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,960
You are...

672
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,440
He knew you are my son.

673
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,640
He talked you
into giving up your bright future

674
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,760
and joining the infamous
Capital Security Office

675
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,320
because he wanted you
to be grateful to him,

676
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,120
made you one of his henchmen,

677
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,360
and got back at me
for being his political enemy.

678
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,200
You are my son.

679
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,280
Why would I lie to you?

680
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,880
Well, I knew

681
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,640
why you've been
risking your life for Qi Mu

682
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,120
over these years.

683
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,120
You want to get promoted
to the Fifth Rank

684
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,280
so that a title will be conferred
on your mother.

685
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,760
With the imperial incense burning,

686
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,320
your mother's tomb will be rebuilt.

687
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,080
I know that.

688
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,000
That's why I've always
respected your choices.

689
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,920
Now

690
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,680
I'm the Prime Minister,

691
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,160
but Qi Mu

692
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,120
is still trying to drive a wedge
between us.

693
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,480
I've had enough!

694
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,440
Didn't you ask me

695
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,960
if I arranged the Hat Demon?

696
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,880
I can tell you right now.

697
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,760
I did it yesterday.

698
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,680
But not today.

699
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,000
I revealed the news

700
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,360
that I will go to the river incognito
to watch the moon tonight

701
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,640
with no escort.

702
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,680
Qi Mu's men hate me so much

703
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,800
that they want to eat my flesh.

704
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,200
What do you think they will do?

705
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,200
A treacherous official who has just
been made the Prime Minister

706
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,040
is punished by God
and killed by Hat Demon.

707
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,600
Can high officials like them

708
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,160
resist such a temptation?

709
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,760
Where are you going?

710
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,720
Get out of here now.

711
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,240
You only have two options now.

712
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,480
You can let the assassins kill me,

713
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,760
or you can save me

714
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,120
and take back the glory

715
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,480
that was stolen
by the Office of Imperial Guards,

716
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,400
and get promoted
for saving the Prime Minister.

717
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,800
You must remember

718
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,160
that I'm risking my life to help you.

719
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,920
You can decide

720
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,320
what to do.

721
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,880
Xiao Qinyan, you are crazy!

722
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,120
How lively!

723
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,720
(Qingyue Fang)
How beautiful!

724
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,520
How lively!

725
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,400
Look up there.

726
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,400
There are many people.

727
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:25,880
Be careful!

728
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,880
The tassel crowns the knight!

729
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,120
The sword is snow white!

730
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,080
In the silver saddle,

731
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,200
he rides like a shooting star!

732
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,800
Father!

733
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,760
What are you doing here?

734
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,960
I can't let you stay in danger.

735
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,520
Father, let's go.

736
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,000
Take this!

737
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,840
Protect Minister Xiao!

738
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,680
Father, let's go!

739
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,520
Be careful, Qianfan!

740
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,720
