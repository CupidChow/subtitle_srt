=Episode 36=

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,560
You got the nerve to negotiate with me?

18
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,560
Do you think

19
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,800
you can threaten me

20
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,840
with half of a bellyband
made with handkerchiefs

21
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,680
that can be seen everywhere?

22
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,640
I have nothing to lose anyway.

23
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,280
If you help me this time,

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,120
I'll be done with you.

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,480
But if you want

26
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,680
to stand by like your father,

27
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,040
I promise

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,800
even if you get married one day,

29
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,000
you'll still have no peace.

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,320
The Emperor
doesn't kill speech officials.

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,960
I will be exiled in the worst situation.

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,520
I won't die.

33
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,760
If one day

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,320
I tell your husband about your secret,

35
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,560
what would he think?

36
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,600
What do you want?

37
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,000
I want Consort Gao to help me
meet the Emperor

38
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,960
so that I can explain and beg for mercy.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,400
I don't believe
you'll keep your promise.

40
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,200
I can write a letter of commitment.

41
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,800
As long as I can meet the Emperor,

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,120
I will no longer bother you
and the Gao family.

43
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,120
If I break my oath,
I'll pay with my life.

44
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,080
Well?

45
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,680
A promise is a promise.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Your second wish came true
in the blink of an eye.

47
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,200
Within three days,

48
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,920
the handkerchiefs you asked for

49
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,880
will be seen in every corner
of the Eastern Capital.

50
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,880
But why do you need
so many handkerchiefs?

51
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,360
I want to help someone.

52
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,400
She helped me before.

53
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,200
How much did you spend?

54
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,160
I'll give it to you in a couple of days.

55
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,760
Do I look like I can't afford it?

56
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,040
I'm a guild head.

57
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,880
What's the big deal

58
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,720
of using a few bolts of identical silk?

59
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,800
Okay.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,120
I'll make a handsome sum
of money in a few days

61
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,080
as a thank-you gift.

62
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,840
I don't want a thank-you gift.

63
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,920
I want you to comfort me.

64
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,400
You didn't see

65
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,240
that Sanniang threw a bowl of flour

66
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,440
at my head.

67
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,800
Everyone in the restaurant was there,

68
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,120
but no one cared about me.

69
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,080
They were all talking about

70
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,680
how difficult it was for her
to meet her son.

71
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,280
Are you listening to me?

72
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,840
Can you stop reading the Court Bulletin?

73
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,080
Did Yuan Tuntian give it to you?

74
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,800
I'm looking up something. It's nothing.

75
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,360
What are you looking up?
Don't lie to me.

76
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,680
Is it about Gu Qianfan?

77
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,760
It's none of your business.

78
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,040
None of my business?

79
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,640
So it is about him?

80
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,320
I regret it.

81
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,080
I shouldn't have

82
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,320
let you meet him on that night.

83
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,720
None of my business, huh?

84
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,560
Get out. Get out.

85
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,400
Don't push me out.

86
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,680
It's Gu Qianfan again.

87
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,480
Zhao Pan'er.

88
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,840
Don't give me that look.

89
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,000
Everyone has a temper.

90
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,560
You turned your back on me
after using me.

91
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,600
You're faithless

92
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,560
and heartless!

93
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,480
I don't have time for you.

94
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,000
Do you think other restaurants

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,480
will do nothing

96
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,320
after seeing our restaurant

97
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,360
doing so well?

98
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,080
Oh, that's what you are thinking.

99
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,440
You got me worried.

100
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,600
I thought

101
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,640
that you became softhearted

102
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,600
after meeting Gu Qianfan that night.

103
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,320
Forget what I said.

104
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,840
Take your time. I'll leave you to it.

105
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,720
Pan'er is trying to make big money.

106
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,640
Be quiet.

107
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,280
Eat slowly. Don't choke yourself.

108
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,280
That's how

109
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,400
I was cheated out of all my money.

110
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,400
But I wanted to see you so much

111
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,520
that I walked for more than two months

112
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,880
to get to the Eastern Capital.

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,880
Silly boy.

114
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,960
Stay here with me.

115
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,840
I'll never let you suffer anymore.

116
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,120
Mother.

117
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,280
I was wrong before.

118
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,160
I will study hard from now on

119
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,440
and strive to make progress.

120
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,920
I won't go against you anymore.

121
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,520
Okay, mother?

122
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,280
Okay, I see.

123
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,320
You can't kick me out

124
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,720
because I'm gonna be stuck here.

125
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,320
Changfeng, you're going to suffer.

126
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,640
Try harder.

127
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,640
Don't say that.

128
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,680
I knew she has a son.

129
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,520
She told me.

130
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,160
Didn't he say he wants to make progress?

131
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,320
I happen to be a teacher.

132
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,600
A teacher for a day, a father for life.

133
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,440
I'm truly impressed.

134
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
I'm flattered.

135
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,800
I'll leave.

136
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,120
(Court Bulletin)

137
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,160
Father's disobedience happened

138
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,720
in the first year of Jingde.

139
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,560
How come there's no record of it?

140
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,280
(Court Bulletin)

141
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,440
(Military Inspector Zhao Qian disobeyed
and opened the gate of Dongguang County.)

142
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,200
(Chief Military Inspector Zhao Qian)

143
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,240
(disobeyed the imperial order,)

144
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,320
(opened the gate of Dongguang County
without permission,)

145
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,160
(and slew the northern pillagers.)

146
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,560
(Xiao Qinyan, the Left Adviser,)

147
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,000
(impeached him for disrupting
the peace-making between two states.)

148
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,080
Then why was he hiding from me

149
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,920
in the carriage that day?

150
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,000
Chief told me

151
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,920
it wasn't that he didn't
want to see you.

152
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,640
He was afraid to see you.

153
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,640
After all, Pan'er,

154
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,240
he wasn't that scared

155
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,960
even when he beheaded others.

156
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,480
Therefore,

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,920
something serious
must have happened to him.

158
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,480
He was worried
that you wouldn't forgive him.

159
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,760
That's why he chose to escape this time.

160
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,600
After all, in order to see you,

161
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,760
he even disobeyed the imperial order

162
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,080
and almost lost his life.

163
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,520
Pan'er, Zifang came here.

164
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,120
Sanniang is very thrilled.

165
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,880
But there are guests
to entertain at night.

166
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,560
She can't leave.

167
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,320
I want Zhaodi to take Zifang
back to the yard.

168
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,200
What do you think?

169
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,160
Okay.

170
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,559
Wang's Restaurant and Pan's restaurant
are also selling Orange Crab

171
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,080
at a 30% lower price.

172
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,880
Let them be.

173
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,240
What's wrong?

174
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,280
Is something bothering you?

175
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,320
I know something

176
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,080
and I'm a mess.

177
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,080
I don't know what to do.

178
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,080
Go for a walk then.

179
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,120
Don't think about it alone.

180
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,080
Will it work?

181
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,200
Yes.

182
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,640
I was exactly like you

183
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,680
when I just escaped

184
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,000
from Finance Minister Lin's place.

185
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,720
I didn't know where to go.

186
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,760
I dared not go back to you

187
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,400
or the Music Division.

188
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,240
I stayed in the temple
and kept thinking.

189
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,640
My head was going to explode,

190
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,920
but I still couldn't figure it out.

191
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,040
Then dawn came and the rain stopped.

192
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,640
I just left the temple

193
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,840
and walked around.

194
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,800
But the more I walked,
the soberer I got.

195
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,760
Then I reached the dock

196
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,760
and met you.

197
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,760
But what would have happened

198
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,720
if you hadn't met us

199
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,280
and chosen that path?

200
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,360
I would have come up
with another solution.

201
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,720
In a word, there is always a way out.

202
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,920
You'll see a different scenery
in a new place.

203
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,520
It's better than staying put anyway.

204
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,080
Could it be worse

205
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,960
that being chained to a tree
by Zhou She like a dog?

206
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,760
You're right.

207
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,560
I should go somewhere else
to think about it.

208
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,680
But where can I go?

209
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,200
The birth and death of all things

210
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,800
are determined by fate.

211
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,560
There is a predestined cause

212
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,280
for everything in the world.

213
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,720
Amitabha, benefactress.

214
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,960
I'm here to ask for your advice.

215
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,120
If I meet someone,

216
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,080
how to know if it's well-fated

217
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,320
or ill-fated?

218
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,440
You will have no fear
when you don't care.

219
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,440
Don't be hindered by worry.

220
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,800
Whether it's well-fated or ill-fated

221
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,840
depends on what you think

222
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,680
instead of fate itself.

223
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,960
Thank you for your enlightenment.

224
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,480
Sorry to bother you today.

225
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,880
How should I thank you?

226
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,760
It's easy.

227
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,200
Just give away
more vegetarian pastries next time.

228
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,360
Since you closed Half-hidden,

229
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,320
I haven't tasted

230
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,720
mushroom pastries for a long time.

231
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,840
There is indeed a predestined cause

232
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,480
for everything in the world.

233
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,040
Thank you very much.

234
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,560
Amitabha.

235
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,040
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

236
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,360
Long time no see, Ms. Zhao.

237
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,160
Do you like the food?

238
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,680
Very much.

239
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,600
Ms. Zhao is back.

240
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,120
Ms. Zhao.

241
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,280
Ms. Zhao.

242
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,680
I thought you would go somewhere else.

243
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,560
Why would we go anywhere else?

244
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,440
Other restaurants also have Orange Crab

245
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,520
and Styrax Curcuma Wine now

246
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,880
that are even cheaper.

247
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,640
How would we go somewhere else

248
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,600
after tasting the food in Half-hidden?

249
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,400
We want the authentic flavor.

250
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,840
That's right.

251
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,080
We'll follow Ms. Zhao

252
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,680
wherever she goes.

253
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,280
We trust Ms. Zhao, right?

254
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
Thank you so much.

255
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,160
Thank you.

256
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,840
I have good news for you.

257
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,640
It's done. All done.

258
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,640
I followed your instruction

259
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,400
and explained to the Emperor,

260
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,720
Minister Xiao
and Censor Qi respectively.

261
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,400
They were pleased with me

262
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,440
as you expected.

263
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,880
Not just them,

264
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,680
the Empress also feel indebted to you.

265
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,640
It's great.

266
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,040
Your idea

267
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,280
satisfied all parties.

268
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,960
I can rest assured.

269
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,600
No matter what happens in the court,

270
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,760
I'll be as stable as a mountain.

271
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,720
You will be in charge
of the Capital Security Office

272
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,360
as a trusted man of Minister Xiao.

273
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,840
I'll work my way up
in the Palace Domestic Service

274
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,680
and win the trust of the Emperor.

275
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,160
If we join hands,

276
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,400
we can achieve something great.

277
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,440
Don't worry.

278
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,240
I've got everything planned.

279
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,000
Zhao Pan'er won't be implicated

280
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,440
in this case in any way.

281
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,760
But judging from Qi Mu's look,

282
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,440
Ouyang Xu will be in trouble soon.

283
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,520
We can't imitate it?

284
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,600
As long as we put in
some time to study it,

285
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,440
we can make a rough copy of it.

286
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,160
Not everyone has a sharp palate.

287
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,160
As long as our prices are lower,

288
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,160
there are plenty of people
who loves taking petty advantages.

289
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,400
Sir, that's brilliant.

290
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
We just need

291
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,440
to soak some styrax and curcuma

292
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,080
in wine for two days.

293
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,360
I bought dozens of catties
of styrax and curcuma.

294
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,000
Sir, smart move.

295
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,280
Mr. Cao, hello.

296
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,040
Drink and eat to your heart's content.

297
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,760
We are not like Yong'an Restaurant.

298
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,680
You can drink Styrax Curcuma Wine here

299
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,160
as much as you want.

300
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,440
Good. Good.

301
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,080
Is it salty?

302
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,760
Thanks, Mr. Wang.

303
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,080
- It's good.
- Thanks, Mr. Wang.

304
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,600
Tomorrow we will offer Orange Crab

305
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,480
like Pan's Restaurant.

306
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,720
Please come.

307
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,280
Okay.

308
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,800
Wang Feng!

309
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,600
Enjoy your drinks.

310
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,360
Don't you know the rules?

311
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,000
Why did you steal

312
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,240
our recipe for Styrax Curcuma Wine?

313
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,200
What's the problem?

314
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,560
Is Styrax Curcuma Wine
your secret recipe?

315
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,320
It is recorded in ancient books.

316
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,440
If you can use it,

317
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,120
why can't we?

318
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,320
Cut out the clever talk!

319
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,920
I'm telling you,

320
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,320
the restaurant guild
has copied the recipe

321
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,680
and sent it to all kinds of restaurants
in the capital.

322
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,960
I promise your amazing wine

323
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,920
will be seen everywhere in the capital
within three days.

324
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,080
Keep fanning yourself. Why did you stop?

325
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,240
I will!

326
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,280
I'm gonna fan your face first!

327
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,920
Beat him!

328
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,960
I'll beat you to death!

329
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,680
Beat him!

330
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,520
Gently.

331
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,680
I don't understand

332
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,079
why you had to fight with them.

333
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
You can bear with it,

334
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,280
but I can't.

335
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,280
They are not stealing our recipe.

336
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,359
They are stealing our money, real money.

337
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,160
You always say

338
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,240
you don't care about money.

339
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,440
Can words be the same as actions?

340
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,800
I've been saying I'll quit gambling
for almost ten years,

341
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,839
but I still haven't.

342
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,680
It hurts.

343
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,520
I'm hurt this badly.

344
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,359
Don't you have a conscience?

345
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,520
Nobody cares about me.

346
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,080
He Si.

347
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,480
Do you think

348
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,560
Young Master Chi deserves this?

349
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,400
He does.

350
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,120
You...

351
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,280
Traitor! I'll beat you to death!

352
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,200
Well, Young Master.
There is something you don't know.

353
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,680
Ms. Zhao asked me

354
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,880
to buy all the styrax and curcuma
on the market

355
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,320
seven days ago.

356
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,040
The more styrax and curcuma
other restaurants buy,

357
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,160
the more money your pharmacy
is going to make, right?

358
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,600
We also bought out
the whole year's supply

359
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,120
of Jiangnan crabs
for making Orange Crabs.

360
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,280
Places like Wang's Restaurant

361
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,080
don't know the secret of the ingredient.

362
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,320
They're using river crabs.

363
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,080
River crabs?

364
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,480
In two days at most,

365
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,840
the river crab meat will
grow old and taste bitter,

366
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,360
and the dish will be ruined.

367
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,640
To run a business well in a long term,

368
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,200
apart from good dishes
and abundant ideas,

369
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,680
keeping a firm hold on the source
of supply is also required.

370
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,360
I've learned a few lessons

371
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,760
from the incident in the Tea Lane

372
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,360
and the ice event.

373
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,040
If we don't make big profits
out of this,

374
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,240
how to cover the loss
from the cheap food in Wanshui Pavilion?

375
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,640
The more guests in Wanshui Pavilion,

376
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,440
the more famous Yong'an Restaurant
will become in the Eastern Capital.

377
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,720
It will also make Qianshan Pavilion

378
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,920
a must-visit for scholar-officials.

379
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,920
What's more, Styrax Curcuma Wine
is not our only specialty

380
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,040
in Yong'an Restaurant.

381
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,920
Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,

382
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,760
we will launch Clove Amber Wine.

383
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,160
- Clove Amber...
- Yes.

384
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,320
Our teahouse used to have
so many kinds of drinks.

385
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,680
We can launch them one by one,

386
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,520
and they'll have to copy one by one.

387
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,600
Hold on. Hold on.

388
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,960
You lost me.

389
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,600
Did you also buy out cloves and amber?

390
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You have a lot of money

391
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,040
and you told me I can withdraw
as much money as I want.

392
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,880
How much money can you make?

393
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,280
Not much.

394
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,480
Before you become
head of the restaurant guild,

395
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,480
I'll make you the deputy
of aromatic drug guild first.

396
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,760
Pan'er, please marry me.

397
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,080
Let's do business
in the Eastern Capital City together.

398
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,720
We will be able
to conquer the business world.

399
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,640
Okay?

400
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,120
He is overjoyed.

401
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,400
Okay?

402
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,920
Okay?

403
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,000
Your master broke his head.

404
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,120
Take him to a doctor.

405
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,280
Let's go.

406
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,920
My face must be disfigured.

407
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,400
She doesn't like me anymore.

408
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,640
I'm so humiliated.

409
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,320
Everything is almost ready

410
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,680
for the next Flower and Moon Banquet.

411
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,360
Apart from Suniang,

412
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,680
I also invited some dancing performers
from the Music Division

413
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,560
to play in the Ode to the Goddess
of the Luo River.

414
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,560
They all want to perform here

415
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,160
after the Emperor
came to Yong'an Restaurant, right?

416
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,120
It's not just that.

417
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,040
They used to perform
at other restaurants

418
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,640
based on the status.

419
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,320
Although it looks glorious,

420
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,120
what they actually do
is still entertaining guests.

421
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,640
Even during breaks,

422
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,760
they can only squeeze
in the booth at the back.

423
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,320
We not only pay them more money,

424
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,960
but also take good care of them.

425
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,760
Many scholars

426
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,840
are also trying to please them
for the poem review

427
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,680
every two weeks.

428
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,600
You planned it well.

429
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,520
I've been there,

430
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,320
so I know what they really want.

431
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,720
Let's do it step by step.

432
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,960
One day,

433
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,960
these two words "lowly status"

434
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,920
will no longer haunt us anymore.

435
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,000
Sister.

436
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,000
Do you really not consider
Young Master Chi?

437
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,240
He is rich after all.

438
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,520
He is also willing
to be subservient to you.

439
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,120
I just realized

440
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,600
that when you like someone,

441
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,280
you won't think too much
about what you can get,

442
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,640
but what you can do

443
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,280
for him.

444
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,360
What do you want to do for him?

445
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,960
Force him out of his world

446
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,080
and into mine.

447
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,040
How is the prisoner
I asked you to interrogate?

448
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,760
Didn't I tell you about it?

449
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,360
When did you tell me about it?

450
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,240
I got drunk that day and forgot.

451
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,720
I knew you couldn't do anything well.

452
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,880
He went from the post to the restaurant

453
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,320
and took off down the West Gate.

454
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,400
When did the flowers bloom?

455
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,480
They weren't there this morning.

456
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,120
Go to drink.

457
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,160
I have something to do.

458
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,320
Don't follow me.

459
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,840
Wait, Chief,

460
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,200
- Where are you going?
- Chief!

461
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,840
Why don't you come with us?

462
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,520
Pan'er.

463
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,280
Do you want to see me?

464
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,600
Gu Qianfan.

465
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,440
The last time, you asked me
to give you a chance.

466
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,560
I'll give you.

467
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,280
Pan'er.

468
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,320
It's just the sky, the earth,

469
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,280
you and me here.

470
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,240
That's why I dare

471
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,680
to risk all my self-esteem and pride

472
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,240
to ask you one last time,

473
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,240
are you still willing to marry me?

474
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,440
Yes.

475
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,000
No matter when you ask me,

476
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,160
I will always say yes.

477
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:12,960
But,

478
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,920
I know you won't forgive me.

479
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,040
Why?

480
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,040
Why?

481
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,840
Because your father is Xiao Qinyan?

482
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,520
Because your father

483
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,680
once was the imperial official
who impeached my father,

484
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,560
who

485
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
got my parents killed,

486
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,000
and made me become a pariah?

487
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,800
You knew it.

488
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,640
This is an unbridgeable

489
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,760
blood feud between us.

490
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,240
I don't deserve you.

491
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,040
I don't deserve to be with you.

492
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,400
It's only unbridgeable for you.

493
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,040
Yes.

494
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,040
Even if Xiao Qinyan impeached my father,

495
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,560
even if he's a treacherous official now,

496
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,480
he only did what he had to

497
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,200
as a speech official.

498
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,960
I became a pariah

499
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,000
not because of your father,

500
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,920
not because of the Emperor.

501
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,400
My father made his own choice.

502
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,480
He knew it was a crime
to open the gate and release them.

503
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,120
He still did it anyway,

504
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,320
because he couldn't stand by
and let the northern people

505
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,160
kill the people of Song.

506
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,400
When my father's old subordinates
came to redeem me,

507
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,120
they told me, in his last breath,

508
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,840
my father said he was sorry
for my mother and me

509
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,720
but he didn't regret it.

510
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,560
Gu Qianfan.

511
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,160
Do you remember

512
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,200
I said the same thing to you?

513
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,200
I will never regret being with you.

514
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,120
But I'm still Xiao Qinyan's son.

515
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,320
So what?

516
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,960
Your last name is Gu, not Xiao.

517
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
Did you ever hurt my father?

518
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,640
Do you know my mother?

519
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,520
Twenty years ago,

520
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,160
we didn't know each other.

521
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,280
What blood feud do we have?

522
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,680
Stop it. You know what,

523
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,480
I want to hold you in my arms right now,

524
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,200
but I can't do it.

525
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,840
This is too heavy.

526
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,120
Even if you can let it go now,

527
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,120
a few years later,

528
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,960
a few decades later,

529
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,520
this is gonna be

530
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,000
a wound between us

531
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,160
that bleeds every time we touch it.

532
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,680
I can't act on impulse

533
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,160
and ruin your life

534
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,160
because of my selfish desires.

535
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,240
Ruin my life?

536
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,720
Do you think

537
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,080
I'm saying this

538
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,600
on impulse?

539
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,640
I'm telling you I'm not.

540
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,920
I've seen

541
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,840
the vicissitudes of life
at the Music Bureau.

542
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,560
And all those tragedies.

543
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,800
Finally, I realized

544
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,600
we should embrace what comes
regardless of where it leads us.

545
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,840
You've wasted
the first half of your life

546
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,200
because of your ill relationship
with your father.

547
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,400
Do you still want

548
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,200
to sacrifice the rest of your life?

549
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,080
Qianfan.

550
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,560
You've been nice to me.

551
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,160
But has it ever occurred to you

552
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,400
how hurt I was

553
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,640
when I couldn't find you?

554
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,840
I never thought about killing myself

555
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,160
even when Ouyang Xu did that to me.

556
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,160
But that day,

557
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,840
when the wind

558
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,120
wiped this place out,

559
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,960
and I couldn't find you,

560
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,840
I did want to jump off the bridge
of the Bian River.

561
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,960
Pan'er.

562
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,360
You gave this to me.

563
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,280
Watch this.

564
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,200
I don't want to waste any more time.

565
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,240
I'll let go of all my self-esteem
and pride

566
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,440
and ask you one last time.

567
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,560
Are you willing to let go of the past

568
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,320
and be with me again?

Greetings to Your Majesty.

602
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:03,920
How dare you?

603
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,400
I'm guilty of failing to stop him.

604
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,520
Go ahead and say it.

605
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,040
Your Majesty, I deserve death.

606
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,200
I framed the Empress.

607
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,520
But I was misled by malicious people

608
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,640
into believing slanders.

609
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,920

I'm so disappointed!

One word for you.

613
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,640
Stupid!

614
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,280
Your Majesty, watch the steps.
Be careful.

615
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,480
I'm getting old.

616
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,080
I've been fighting
with these courtiers for decades.

617
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,440
But now I've fallen for their tricks!

618
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,640
Ouyang Xu is a novice.

619
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,640
Clearly, he was used by Qi Mu

620
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,400
without realizing it.

621
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,720
If it weren't for this fool

622
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,520
to slip out in front of me,

623
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,360
I wouldn't have known

624
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,639
he and Qi Mu

625
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,480
already met each other
in the Western Capital!

626
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,199
I guess Qi Mu

627
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,679
faked the Night Revels

628
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,760
in advance

629
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,239
and asked someone

630
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,000
to give it to Ouyang Xu on purpose.

631
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,320
Your Majesty, please cool down.

632
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,600
How?

633
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,080
How can I calm down?

634
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,239
These Scholar Ministers

635
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,239
obviously wanted to use Ouyang Xu's life

636
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,000
to frame my Empress!

637
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,159
Tell the Empress

638
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,320
that I will have dinner with her

639
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,960
and Prince Sheng.

640
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,040
Yes.

641
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,320
As for Ouyang Xu,

642
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,120
well,

643
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,960
I don't think he should stay
in the capital anymore.

644
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,240
Let the Ministry of Personnel

645
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,680
send him to a small county

646
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,440
and make him a registrar...

647
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,480
Never mind.

648
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,840
He just told me

649
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,040
he couldn't bear
to waste Gao Hui's youth

650
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,480
and wanted to break off
his engagement with her.

651
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,000
He is a good man.

652
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,120
Make him a Controller-general
in a small state

653
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,880
by convention
as he is the Third Graduate.

654
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,240
I need to make Consort Xian look decent.

655
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,800
Or people will criticize the Gao family.

656
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,000
Your Majesty, you're wise.

657
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:55,680
(Gu's Mansion)

658
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,680
You know I've been living

659
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,480
in the Capital Security Office
over the last months.

660
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,960
I haven't been back.

661
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,880
The house has been not cleaned.

662
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,600
So...

663
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,560
Is there no one else in your family?

664
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,360
No.

665
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,680
They are all gone,

666
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,480
but I have you now.

667
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,240
What's the matter?

668
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,000
Xiao Qinyan tried
to break us up earlier.

669
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,920
I didn't know about your father
at that time.

670
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,560
So he released news on purpose
to let me know it.

671
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,800
That's when I started

672
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,720
to be afraid to see you.

673
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,760
To end my relationship with him,

674
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,760
I gave him some of my blood.

675
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
How could you be so silly?

676
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,840
What if you hurt your hand so badly

677
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,560
that you can't swing a sword anymore?

678
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,600
It doesn't matter.

679
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,400
I'll be a civil official
if I can't swing a sword.

680
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,920
If I can't even hold a brush,

681
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,440
I guess I will count on you.

682
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,240
Okay, you can count on me.

683
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,200
All of the furniture
needs to be repaired.

684
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,440
The books need to be taken out to dry.

685
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,920
I want a dresser.

686
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,800
I'll have someone make you a shelf

687
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,800
to place all kinds of your weapons.

688
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,640
Some nails in the wall can do the job.

689
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,280
Don't you want to see
some flowers and plants

690
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,560
when you're back home?

691
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,480
Don't you want to eat

692
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,720
on an exquisite table

693
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,520
and use azure porcelain bowls

694
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,360
and ebony silver-inlaid chopsticks?

695
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,600
Shouldn't there be a couple of
warm stoves next to our bed?

696
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,960
If you put it this way,

697
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,120
I also want a swing in the yard.

698
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,160
I remember I really wanted

699
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,440
to play on the swing when I was a kid.

700
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,320
But my grandfather wouldn't let me.

701
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,040
Chi Pan's family next door had one.

702
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,360
He wouldn't let me play, either.

703
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,320
We have such a big yard.

704
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,640
I'll put ten swings here

705
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,680
and play on different ones

706
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,680
in the morning, in the afternoon
and at night.

707
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,120
When I'm too old to play,

708
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,720
our kids can play.

709
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,400
Speaking of your dresser,

710
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,160
I'm also going to buy a screen.

711
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,680
I saw one with mother-of-pearl
in the palace.

712
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,720
It's really beautiful.

713
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,240
You're gonna love it.

714
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,000
Well done.

715
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,400
It's not in vain to ask the Princess'
Lady-in-waiting to give him a hand.

716
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,320
Yes.

717
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,560
Without your secret support,

718
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,480
Ouyang Xu would never have a chance
to meet His Majesty.

719
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,440
There is one thing I don't understand.

720
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,480
Why would you...

721
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,360
Return good for evil?

722
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,800
I dare not.

723
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,000
Ouyang Xu is just a pawn.

724
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,280
I want the puppies and the old dogs

725
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,560
to bite more fiercely

726
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,000
so that His Majesty will trust

727
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,080
those Scholar Ministers less.

728
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,560
You did a good job today.

729
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,760
Your nephew

730
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,040
will be taken good care
by my brother in the army.

731
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

732
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,560
Do you

733
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,360
mean it

734
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,520
or fake it?

735
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,680
You've been serving His Majesty
for years.

736
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,680
Don't you hate me
for holding your nephew hostage?

737
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,760
All I know

738
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,160
is the more tactical you are,

739
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,720
the better you will
assist the new emperor

740
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,360
in administering the country.

741
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,040
I'm also aware

742
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,960
you don't advise His Majesty
to make the crown prince

743
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,720
because you worry that the crown prince

744
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,800
won't be able to review the memorials
after he administers the country.

745
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,840
His Majesty is a benevolent ruler,

746
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,560
and a good husband.

747
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,000
But he can't protect me forever.

748
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,960
I'm just trying to protect myself.

749
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,960
That's all.

750
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,440
Pan'er.

751
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,080
You're back!

752
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,560
Be honest with us.
Where were you last night?

753
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,200
I went to his place.

754
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,680
It was too late.
I didn't want to disturb you

755
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,480
so I didn't come back.

756
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,000
Commissioner Gu finally
took you to his place.

757
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,640
Even Chen Lian doesn't know
where his house is.

758
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,520
Why did you change your clothes?

759
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,200
It was too late to come back.

760
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,840
We chatted for a while.

761
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,680
My clothes got dirty,

762
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,280
so we went to the garment shop
and bought one.

763
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,840
Are you making fun of me?

764
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,600
Aren't you afraid I'll dock your pay?

765
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,960
My salary is...

766
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,920
Why are you standing here?

767
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,360
Were you at Gu Qianfan's last night?

768
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,120
Morning, Mr. Chi.

769
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,400
Where is Sanniang?

770
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,040
Why?

771
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,920
Zifang is bothering her in the kitchen.

772
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,320
Is he here?

773
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,800
He has been pestering Sanniang.

774
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,160
Sanniang's son behaved well

775
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,760
when he just came to the house.

776
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,600
He used whatever we gave him.

777
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,160
Why?

778
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:07,920
Then he acted weird.

779
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,400
Especially this morning.

780
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,800
Sanniang asked him to go to school,

781
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,080
but he wouldn't go.

782
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,680
I'll teach him a lesson.

783
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,440
Why?

784
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,200
You can't do this to me.

785
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,440
I'm in a much better mood

786
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,160
now seeing you like this.

787
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,280
Pipa Siren, aren't you too annoying?

788
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,760
Do you want to me frighten you
into crying again?

789
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,960
Go ahead.

790
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,120
If I'm frightened,

791
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,200
you can forget about
your Flower and Moon Banquet.

792
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,800
You deserve it.

793
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,120
You own so many shops,

794
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,840
but you have to come here every day
asking for displeasure.

795
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,600
You know Pan'er doesn't like you.

796
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,720
Why? Why?

797
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,600
I'm smart

798
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,040
and charming.

799
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,280
I have money and talent.

800
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,120
How is Gu Qianfan better than me?

801
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,160
I don't know you well,

802
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,680
but I do know one thing.

803
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,720
Pan'er will never like
an awful man like you

804
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,920
who made her do a soft dance.

805
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,320
Well, I can dance for her as an apology.

806
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,560
She did one.

807
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,120
I'll do three dances.

808
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,040
She is way out of your league.

809
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,280
I'm way out of your league!

810
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,040
Why are you laughing?

811
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,960
Am I not right?

812
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,760
You're right.
