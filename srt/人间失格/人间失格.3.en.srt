00:01:05,123 --> 00:01:08,653

right before he left me,</i>

9
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:21,333
<i>lying on the bed he was
stuck to for over 6 years,</i>

10
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:29,043
<i>what was going on his head?</i>

11
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:50,393
<i>He mustered up
all the strength he had left...</i>

12
00:02:07,613 --> 00:02:10,183
<i>Where did he want to go?</i>

13
00:02:17,523 --> 00:02:20,423
<i>Was he suddenly incredibly hungry?</i>

14
00:02:23,663 --> 00:02:27,333
<i>Was he in so much pain
that it was unbearable?</i>

15
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,273
<i>Or...</i>

16
00:02:38,443 --> 00:02:43,053
<i>Did he just want to go home?</i>

17
00:02:48,493 --> 00:02:50,523
<i>How suffocating it must have been...</i>

18
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:01,733
<i>How lonely he must have felt...</i>

19
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:13,113
<i>How scared he must have been...</i>

20
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:33,363
<i>How...</i>

21
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:37,573
<i>How he must have waited for me...</i>

22
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:49,953
<i>Those were the only things
I could think of.</i>

23
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,423
<i>That tormented me.</i>

24
00:03:56,323 --> 00:04:01,693
<i>So I ran far away
from that day, like this.</i>

25
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:08,333
<i>My father always waited for me all day.</i>

26
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:18,043
<i>I don't know what death is yet.</i>

27
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:24,113
<i>I don't know what life is either.</i>

28
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:30,553
<i>Will I understand one day
as time goes by?</i>

29
00:04:35,393 --> 00:04:38,863
<i>What life is and what death is...</i>

30
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:43,933
<i>What the present is
and what the future is...</i>

31
00:04:45,443 --> 00:04:49,873
<i>In the last moments of life,
everyone is alone.</i>

32
00:04:50,073 --> 00:04:53,113
<i>Will I eventually understand that?</i>

33
00:04:56,953 --> 00:04:58,923
Why die?

34
00:05:03,393 --> 00:05:05,163
Just don't pick up.

35
00:05:23,943 --> 00:05:25,383
Take it.

36
00:05:25,383 --> 00:05:26,513
My arm is sore.

37
00:05:48,703 --> 00:05:51,033
It's not easy
when you actually look at it.

38
00:05:53,973 --> 00:05:57,173
You hear about people
jumping off on the news.

39
00:05:59,743 --> 00:06:01,383
This alley

40
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:03,953
is where kids go to private academies.

41
00:06:03,953 --> 00:06:06,083
It will scar those kids.

42
00:06:06,753 --> 00:06:08,223
It won't be easy

43
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:10,053
cleaning up afterwards, either.

44
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:26,483
Not long ago,
a friend of mine killed himself.

45
00:06:27,373 --> 00:06:30,913
He didn't jump. He...

46
00:06:32,883 --> 00:06:33,913
Anyway.

47
00:06:40,823 --> 00:06:41,853
Hey.

48
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,993
I think this is in line with my unit.

49
00:06:44,993 --> 00:06:48,893
If you jump, you might
hit my exhaust pipe.

50
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:51,033
If you want to jump off from here,

51
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:53,633
you'd have to get a good running start.

52
00:07:01,143 --> 00:07:02,213
So...

53
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,103
So that's...

54
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:17,893
That's what humans are like.

55
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:20,663
Normally, they don't really care.

56
00:07:20,663 --> 00:07:23,663
But when it seems like
someone's in trouble,

57
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:26,433
they draw near.

58
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:28,973
They're inherently meddlesome.

59
00:07:30,403 --> 00:07:31,573
So.

60
00:07:31,573 --> 00:07:33,843
I was going out to buy kimchi

61
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:37,113
when I heard yelling
on the emergency stairs.

62
00:07:37,113 --> 00:07:41,243
Then I heard you
clamoring up to the rooftop.

63
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,723
Naturally, I followed you.

64
00:07:46,823 --> 00:07:49,393
What I want to say is,

65
00:07:51,623 --> 00:07:54,923
don't read too much into us

66
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:58,333
running into each other like this again.

67
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:07,203
Do you live on the 10th floor?

68
00:08:09,413 --> 00:08:12,543
Why haven't I seen you before?

69
00:08:13,783 --> 00:08:15,143
Have you seen me before?

70
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:21,563
My father lives here.

71
00:08:22,193 --> 00:08:23,853
Oh, your father.

72
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:27,993
Your father must be sick.

73
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:33,163
I saw you bought porridge.

74
00:08:38,873 --> 00:08:39,943
Darn it.

75
00:08:41,643 --> 00:08:43,243
I had cooked instant noodles.

76
00:08:43,913 --> 00:08:45,243
I have to cook it again.

77
00:08:48,013 --> 00:08:49,753
Your father will be worried.

78
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:52,853
Since you went to buy porridge
but haven't returned.

79
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:55,053
He'll also be hungry.

80
00:08:59,223 --> 00:09:00,463
Well, then.

81
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:04,693
I'm going to go buy kimchi.

82
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:06,963
You should...

83
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:10,303
What should you tell your father?

84
00:09:12,043 --> 00:09:16,713
Tell him you went up to
the roof for some fresh air.

85
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,283
Then a meddlesome,

86
00:09:19,883 --> 00:09:22,583
but quite nice-looking guy

87
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:28,793
was making a scene,
trying to kill himself.

88
00:09:28,793 --> 00:09:30,323
He didn't jump, so you came down.

89
00:09:30,963 --> 00:09:33,423
You're never going back up to the roof.

90
00:09:34,963 --> 00:09:35,963
Yeah.

91
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:42,503
Sounds good.

92
00:09:48,873 --> 00:09:51,943
Okay, then let's leave it at that.

93
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,523
I'll be going now.

94
00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:07,623
I lived here over a year.
Never knew we had this.

95
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:08,863
Thanks.

96
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:16,473
When we meet next time,

97
00:10:17,373 --> 00:10:18,573
let's exchange it.

98
00:10:19,273 --> 00:10:20,273
KakaoTalk.

99
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:22,933
Did I wake you?

100
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:25,063
Huh? You haven't left?

101
00:12:25,063 --> 00:12:27,063
No. I said I'm sleeping over.

102
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:28,663
I thought you left for home.

103
00:12:28,663 --> 00:12:29,533
Oh.

104
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:32,173
Go back to sleep.
I'll wash up and sleep, too.

105
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:34,943
It wasn't Jeong-su.

106
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:37,813
It wasn't him,
so don't kill an innocent man.

107
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:38,883
Yeah, right.

108
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,613
It wasn't him.

109
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:42,253
Don't you believe me?

110
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:43,553
Alright.

111
00:12:44,453 --> 00:12:47,353
It doesn't matter. I'm the witch.

112
00:12:47,353 --> 00:12:50,023
Don't say that, please.

113
00:12:50,923 --> 00:12:52,423
Okay.

114
00:12:52,593 --> 00:12:55,223
It's really all over, right?

115
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:58,393
We're both full of doubt.

116
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:01,233
I believe you. I'm not full of doubt.

117
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:02,603
If you're not using the toilet,
I'm showering.

118
00:13:02,603 --> 00:13:05,203
Why shower in such a small space?

119
00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:06,573
Shower at your place.

120
00:13:06,573 --> 00:13:08,203
My place is small, too.

121
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:09,943
And this is my place.

122
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:11,243
The other one is under Jeong-su's name.

123
00:13:11,243 --> 00:13:12,683
This is mine.

124
00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:15,113
I lived here for 7 years
before you came.

125
00:13:15,113 --> 00:13:16,153
Right.

126
00:13:16,153 --> 00:13:18,893
You did a huge thing,
buying a place in Seoul.

127
00:13:19,853 --> 00:13:22,623
Others will think I bought
a house in Seoul.

128
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:25,453
It's an old studio and
the bank owns half of it.

129
00:13:25,453 --> 00:13:27,363
But you paid off the other half.

130
00:13:27,363 --> 00:13:29,733
There's a bathroom, a kitchen,

131
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,103
a boiler, a window
and no one to answer to.

132
00:13:33,503 --> 00:13:36,833
Not many can do this
without their parents' help.

133
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,843
You've recovered your energy.

134
00:13:38,843 --> 00:13:41,173
I said I wasn't sick.

135
00:13:41,173 --> 00:13:42,313
Also,

136
00:13:42,313 --> 00:13:44,243
of course I got my parents' help.

137
00:13:44,243 --> 00:13:46,043
When I was studying in Seoul,

138
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:48,443
you sold the family property
and paid my rent.

139
00:13:48,443 --> 00:13:51,413
I fainted often so you got me
medicine for 8 years.

140
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,353
It was your grandfather's
property, not mine.

141
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:55,283
That's the same thing.

142
00:13:55,283 --> 00:13:56,523
By the way,

143
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,693
how much debt do you have left?

144
00:14:00,763 --> 00:14:01,663
I don't want to think about it.

145
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:02,733
How much is it?

146
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:03,793
- It's a little. A little.
- Oh, dear.

147
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:04,933
Jeez.

148
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:06,763
- Let go.
- How much...

149
00:14:31,823 --> 00:14:33,023
Dad.

150
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,163
You must eat eggs
within the expiration date.

151
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:39,103
It's the final date for distribution.

152
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,133
You can eat them 1-2 months after that.

153
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:43,573
Then it'll hatch into
a chick in the fridge.

154
00:14:43,573 --> 00:14:46,943
If it hatches,
I'll raise it on the rooftop.

155
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,913
The rooftop isn't yours...

156
00:14:50,113 --> 00:14:52,383
I'm just saying.

157
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:56,013
It won't hatch. How can it hatch?

158
00:14:56,013 --> 00:14:58,213
I'm just saying.

159
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,523
Did something happen while you were out?

160
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:05,023
Huh? Why?

161
00:15:05,793 --> 00:15:07,793
Oh, nothing.

162
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:13,863
I went to the rooftop
to get some fresh air.

163
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:15,933
The rooftop?

164
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:18,573
Why go there at night
when it's dangerous?

165
00:15:19,473 --> 00:15:20,743
Right.

166
00:15:21,603 --> 00:15:23,143
Anyway,

167
00:15:23,143 --> 00:15:26,643
I decided never to go back up there.

168
00:15:29,713 --> 00:15:33,453
You know the guy in
the last unit down the hall?

169
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:35,383
Down the hall?

170
00:15:35,383 --> 00:15:39,363
We met him at the entrance yesterday.

171
00:15:39,363 --> 00:15:41,063
Oh, the playboy?

172
00:15:41,063 --> 00:15:41,963
Yeah.

173
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:43,163
You know what?

174
00:15:43,163 --> 00:15:45,663
It seems he saw me for
the first time yesterday.

175
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:48,403
You met him somewhere else?

176
00:15:48,603 --> 00:15:50,033
Well...

177
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,573
Just briefly when I
came down from the roof.

178
00:15:53,403 --> 00:15:54,623
We met in the elevator

179
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,293
and said hi several times before.

180
00:15:57,913 --> 00:15:59,513
And by mistake,

181
00:15:59,513 --> 00:16:02,453
his bill was sent to us,
so I gave it to him.

182
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:04,953
Yeah, I remember.

183
00:16:05,253 --> 00:16:07,783
But I know what kind of
instant noodles he eats.

184
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:09,693
How do you know that?

185
00:16:09,693 --> 00:16:11,423
You told me.

186
00:16:11,423 --> 00:16:12,523
I did?

187
00:16:12,963 --> 00:16:15,243
You said he throws out

188
00:16:15,243 --> 00:16:18,033
the same 10-20 instant noodle boxes.

189
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:19,333
Oh, yes.

190
00:16:19,703 --> 00:16:21,333
That's right.

191
00:16:21,603 --> 00:16:23,133
I remember.

192
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:26,673
But he doesn't remember me at all.

193
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:29,513
He didn't know I lived here.

194
00:16:30,063 --> 00:16:31,263
Anyway.

195
00:16:31,913 --> 00:16:33,843
He saw me for the first time.

196
00:16:35,683 --> 00:16:39,583
He might be really stupid.

197
00:16:39,683 --> 00:16:40,923
No.

198
00:16:42,253 --> 00:16:44,153
It's not that.

199
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:46,283
You know that feeling.

200
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:50,593
You're there, but you're not there.

201
00:16:56,073 --> 00:16:57,203
Anyway.

202
00:16:57,873 --> 00:17:00,643
I was invisible to him, Dad.

203
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:22,393
<i>Come to think of it,</i>

204
00:17:22,393 --> 00:17:24,633
<i>I was like that when I was young.</i>

205
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:27,463
<i>I only saw what I was interested in.</i>

206
00:17:52,563 --> 00:17:56,163
<i>(Reservation for Sunday 2 PM.
3 hours. Possible?)</i>

207
00:17:57,133 --> 00:18:00,033
<i>Everyone except me was just a passerby.</i>

208
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,573
<i>- (Perfect Stand-in)

209
00:18:05,873 --> 00:18:07,943
<i>We're in the same space</i>

210
00:18:08,543 --> 00:18:10,673
<i>but living in different worlds.</i>

211
00:18:13,743 --> 00:18:17,813
You don't see them
because you're not interested.

212
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,753
You don't know what
I'm talking about, right?

213
00:18:22,253 --> 00:18:24,553
Of course I know.

214
00:18:24,823 --> 00:18:25,893
You do?

215
00:18:26,293 --> 00:18:28,063
Of course.

216
00:18:28,493 --> 00:18:30,823
I think that too sometimes.

217
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:35,433
I think, 'I guess those
people can't see me.'

218
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:39,503
You live like you're not there.

219
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,473
Then you really disappear.

220
00:18:44,243 --> 00:18:45,473
Dad...

221
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:47,043
Huh?

222
00:18:51,183 --> 00:18:53,753
You and I are both invisible.

223
00:18:54,423 --> 00:18:55,453
Right?

224
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,523
You're not invisible yet.

225
00:18:58,693 --> 00:19:01,193
Being invisible is great.

226
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:03,133
You can steal stuff,

227
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:06,343
rob a bank and beat up bad kids.

228
00:19:06,363 --> 00:19:08,863
<i>Where should I start?</i>

229
00:19:13,313 --> 00:19:15,313
That's really old.

230
00:19:15,343 --> 00:19:17,913
<i>When did it all go wrong?</i>

231
00:19:30,353 --> 00:19:31,793
<i>A year ago?</i>

232
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:41,303
<i>Or earlier than that?</i>

233
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:50,273
<i>It's safe here.</i>

234
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,383
<i>It's okay.</i>

235
00:19:58,383 --> 00:20:00,623
<i>Since I'm average.</i>

236
00:20:06,463 --> 00:20:09,563
<i>I had always believed I was average.</i>

237
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,073
<i>But now, I have no place there.</i>

238
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,523
<i>Dad...</i>

239
00:20:35,453 --> 00:20:36,953
<i>I am now...</i>

240
00:20:53,473 --> 00:20:54,573
Sorry.

241
00:20:55,773 --> 00:20:57,743
Just until we arrive.

242
00:20:59,243 --> 00:21:01,313
My head hurts so bad...

243
00:21:10,593 --> 00:21:13,223
I've aged a lot in a year, right?

244
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:18,133
Let's just

245
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:21,203
go quietly.

<i>Where...</i>

259
00:23:11,313 --> 00:23:13,243
<i>could I be?</i>

260
00:23:23,023 --> 00:23:24,993

I'm so anxious.

268
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:46,903
Jeez. How can you drag that down?

269
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:48,843
You're scratching the stairs.

270
00:24:49,003 --> 00:24:51,243
The stairs? These stairs?

271
00:24:51,443 --> 00:24:53,483
The stairs that are over 30 years old?

272
00:24:53,483 --> 00:24:54,043
Soon-gyu.

273
00:24:54,043 --> 00:24:56,213
This suitcase is more expensive.

274
00:24:57,183 --> 00:24:58,853
I told you to quiet down
and you're being louder.

275
00:24:58,853 --> 00:25:01,623
Why are you whispering? So creepy!

276
00:25:02,623 --> 00:25:04,723
How loyal and virtuous you are!

277
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:06,153

00:25:06,593 --> 00:25:08,863

00:25:11,493 --> 00:25:13,233
hold a wedding or something.

281
00:25:20,243 --> 00:25:22,173
How can I hold a wedding?

282
00:25:22,173 --> 00:25:23,073
You're excited already.

283
00:25:23,073 --> 00:25:24,713
You know what?

284
00:25:24,713 --> 00:25:26,343
I didn't comment

285
00:25:26,343 --> 00:25:29,013

286
00:25:29,443 --> 00:25:30,313
But you're just lousy.

287
00:25:30,313 --> 00:25:31,213
I'm leaving.

288
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:32,883
What's up with you today?

289
00:25:33,723 --> 00:25:34,983
Why are you taking that?

290
00:25:34,983 --> 00:25:36,653
You said Gang-jae gave it to you.

291
00:25:36,653 --> 00:25:39,193
No, I didn't. I said he lent it to me.

292
00:25:39,393 --> 00:25:40,723
He lent it to you?

293
00:25:40,923 --> 00:25:41,923
Yes.

294
00:25:42,293 --> 00:25:43,303
It's expensive.

295
00:25:43,303 --> 00:25:45,473
How can you think of just pocketing it?

296
00:25:45,493 --> 00:25:47,233
Gang-jae has a lot of these.

297
00:25:47,233 --> 00:25:50,573
Stop speaking about things
you don't know about.

298
00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:52,333
He's struggling, too.

299
00:25:52,743 --> 00:25:53,843
Why?

300
00:25:55,103 --> 00:25:56,373
Did you two get in trouble?

301
00:25:56,373 --> 00:25:57,243
Never mind.

302
00:25:57,243 --> 00:26:00,113
Wake Woo-nam up and fix him breakfast.

303
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:04,183
You're such a clown.

304
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:09,443
Jeez.

305
00:26:11,123 --> 00:26:12,963
That was embarrassing.

306
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:22,203
Five pairs of shoes, two coats,

307
00:26:22,403 --> 00:26:24,103
five dress shirts

308
00:26:24,103 --> 00:26:25,173
and two watches.

309
00:26:25,173 --> 00:26:26,843
Are you selling the suitcase as well?

310
00:26:26,843 --> 00:26:27,543
Yes.

311
00:26:27,543 --> 00:26:29,943
Oh, this one, too.

312
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,243
Is it consignment?

313
00:26:31,243 --> 00:26:33,413
Or do you want them
purchased altogether?

314
00:26:36,983 --> 00:26:38,423
What do you think?

315
00:26:39,153 --> 00:26:40,683
How much are they altogether?

316
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:50,313
Nice.

317
00:26:51,273 --> 00:26:53,203
- Take a photo of me.
- Okay.

318
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:00,903
One, two, three.

319
00:27:01,273 --> 00:27:03,073
One, two, three.

320
00:27:53,823 --> 00:27:54,923
I asked her to tag along.

321
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,833
I thought it'd be
better than just us two.

322
00:27:57,463 --> 00:27:59,803
She was a trainee for a long time,
so she can act.

323
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:03,673
Why'd you wear that?

324
00:28:03,673 --> 00:28:05,733
Why? You said we're going to a funeral.

325
00:28:05,733 --> 00:28:06,873
I didn't say that.

326
00:28:06,873 --> 00:28:08,843
We're getting money
for the funeral expenses.

327
00:28:09,173 --> 00:28:12,113
You should've dressed like a student.

328
00:28:12,113 --> 00:28:14,113
You look like an old lady
that sells drugs.

329
00:28:15,543 --> 00:28:18,283
Let's just get the money.

330
00:28:18,383 --> 00:28:20,063
And stop nagging all the time.

331
00:28:23,053 --> 00:28:24,053

00:30:27,683 --> 00:30:29,543
Oh... Hello.

367
00:30:29,543 --> 00:30:32,253
We're Jeong-woo's friends from school.

368
00:30:32,253 --> 00:30:33,923
How did you know where I lived?

369
00:30:34,523 --> 00:30:36,453
Oh, umm...

370
00:30:37,623 --> 00:30:40,523
Oh, the police gave us your address.

371
00:30:43,893 --> 00:30:45,863
There's a public parking lot up there.

372
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:47,333
I'll meet you there.

373
00:31:10,553 --> 00:31:12,323
What do you want?

374
00:31:12,593 --> 00:31:13,663
Money?

375
00:31:20,203 --> 00:31:22,703
Well, not necessarily.

376
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:25,503
We held his funeral.

377
00:31:25,503 --> 00:31:28,503
But since we're students,

378
00:31:28,643 --> 00:31:32,043
the funeral costs were
a bit too much for us.

379
00:31:35,283 --> 00:31:39,313
These are Jeong-woo's things.

380
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:42,153
In case you wanted them.

381
00:31:44,923 --> 00:31:46,723
I have to go pick up my kids.

382
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,863
How much do I have to give you?

383
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:50,563
For taking care of things?

384
00:31:56,063 --> 00:31:56,803
35 million won...

385
00:31:56,803 --> 00:31:58,833
Oh, no. Not that much.

386
00:31:59,073 --> 00:32:00,403
It was 3.5 million won.

387
00:32:00,403 --> 00:32:02,143
Just 3.5 million won.

388
00:32:05,613 --> 00:32:08,483
I heard he drowned with some single mom.

389
00:32:08,783 --> 00:32:10,843
Did he really commit suicide?

390
00:32:12,183 --> 00:32:15,223
He didn't die by mistake while trying

391
00:32:15,553 --> 00:32:17,393
to exploit a naïve woman?

392
00:32:22,293 --> 00:32:25,193
This is it. I can't give you more.

393
00:32:27,033 --> 00:32:28,433
How much is this?

394
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:30,433
Count it if you want.

395
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:37,013
So you're the boss here.

396
00:32:38,273 --> 00:32:41,783
He's so pathetic, even until the end.

397
00:32:43,853 --> 00:32:44,883
You kids.

398
00:32:45,413 --> 00:32:47,623
Did you even hold a funeral?

399
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:49,783
Excuse me, but we...

400
00:32:52,993 --> 00:32:54,223
It's 550,000 won.

401
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:56,123
Send the rest to my account.

402
00:32:56,123 --> 00:32:57,093
You have a pen?

403
00:32:57,093 --> 00:32:58,533
I do.

404
00:33:08,873 --> 00:33:10,003
That's Jeong-woo.

405
00:33:11,343 --> 00:33:13,013
Just because he fell behind doesn't mean

406
00:33:13,013 --> 00:33:15,083
you can abandon him like an animal.

407
00:33:15,443 --> 00:33:17,153
We're human.

408
00:33:18,153 --> 00:33:20,453
Send the money on your way
to pick up your kids.

409
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,623
If you don't, you'll get to see

410
00:33:22,623 --> 00:33:23,523
your kids having lunch

411
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:26,393
with our uncles tomorrow.

412
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:33,063
Spend money on your kids,
if not your brother.

413
00:33:34,563 --> 00:33:36,933
Your heart is where your money is.

414
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:38,303
I'm asking you

415
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:40,073
to show me your heart.

416
00:33:48,683 --> 00:33:51,683
They want to go to lunch or brunch

417
00:33:51,683 --> 00:33:53,523
at this age.

418
00:33:55,223 --> 00:33:58,393
They heard a new place
<i>opened near your workplace.</i>

419
00:33:58,393 --> 00:34:01,493
Where did those ladies
get that information?

420
00:34:01,823 --> 00:34:04,763
I don't know. They saw it on TV.

421
00:34:08,433 --> 00:34:09,703
Anyway,

422
00:34:09,933 --> 00:34:12,123
<i>I looked it up on my phone,</i>

423
00:34:12,303 --> 00:34:14,073
and found out their brunch

424
00:34:14,073 --> 00:34:16,243
costs 30,000 won per person.

425
00:34:16,243 --> 00:34:17,313
It's ridiculous.

426
00:34:17,313 --> 00:34:19,143
It must be good.

427
00:34:19,143 --> 00:34:20,343
Good?

428
00:34:20,343 --> 00:34:22,843
It's wasting money to show off.

429
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:24,443
<i>Why did you call me?</i>

430
00:34:24,783 --> 00:34:26,253
I'm working.

431
00:34:26,413 --> 00:34:27,215
<i>Oh.</i>

432
00:34:27,215 --> 00:34:32,093
So I want to have noodles
<i>at your food court</i>

433
00:34:32,423 --> 00:34:33,823
<i>and go meet my friends</i>

434
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:36,403
a little later when they
are having dessert.

435
00:34:37,663 --> 00:34:40,703
Why are you like this
when you have a lot of money?

436
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,703
Just go and have brunch.

437
00:34:42,903 --> 00:34:44,133
<i>Will you give me the money?</i>

438
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:45,303
Okay, I will.

439
00:34:45,303 --> 00:34:47,303
<i>Should I send the money
to you right now?</i>

440
00:34:47,303 --> 00:34:50,253
You barely make ends meet.
Don't be cheeky.

441
00:34:50,373 --> 00:34:53,413
30,000 won is <i>20 rolls of gimbap.</i>

442
00:34:53,413 --> 00:34:55,243
It's been a long time
since you sold gimbap,

443
00:34:55,243 --> 00:34:56,913
but you're still talking about it.

444
00:34:57,753 --> 00:35:00,253
You can treat your friends for once.

445
00:35:01,123 --> 00:35:04,193
What if they exclude you from now on?

446
00:35:04,323 --> 00:35:05,923
You think they're letting me hang out?

447
00:35:05,923 --> 00:35:08,223
I'm a core member of
<i>that group, you bastard.</i>

448
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:10,693
Mom, talk quietly.

449
00:35:10,693 --> 00:35:12,163
I'm in the elevator.

450
00:35:12,493 --> 00:35:14,363
So what will you do? Will you come here?

451
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,563
<i>That's what I've been saying all along.</i>

452
00:35:16,563 --> 00:35:18,673
<i>You keep cutting me off.</i>

453
00:35:19,903 --> 00:35:22,173
<i>Alright. Please continue.</i>

454
00:35:22,443 --> 00:35:23,773
I'll head out now,

455
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:26,073
eat lunch there, look around

456
00:35:26,073 --> 00:35:27,743
and join them later.

457
00:35:27,743 --> 00:35:28,743
Yep.

458
00:35:31,453 --> 00:35:32,783
Keep up the good work.

459
00:35:33,483 --> 00:35:35,123
Call me when you get here.

460
00:35:35,553 --> 00:35:36,553
Okay.

461
00:35:48,403 --> 00:35:50,163
She bled too much.

462
00:35:52,853 --> 00:35:54,753
Let us through, please.

463
00:35:54,943 --> 00:35:56,443
Watch your back. Slowly.

464
00:36:03,613 --> 00:36:05,313
Did she take poison? Self-mutilation?

465
00:36:05,313 --> 00:36:06,683
Both.

466
00:36:06,683 --> 00:36:07,683
Please move.

467
00:36:08,153 --> 00:36:09,383
You can't be on the stairs.

468
00:36:09,383 --> 00:36:10,863
Move out of the way.

469
00:36:11,063 --> 00:36:12,753
- Go down the stairs.
- You're not her guardian, are you?

470
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,453
No, I'm not.

471
00:36:13,453 --> 00:36:15,093
You know the contact
number of her guardian?

472
00:36:16,263 --> 00:36:17,793
It's my first time

473
00:36:17,793 --> 00:36:18,913
coming here...

474
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:22,003
Wait. The applicant's name...

475
00:36:22,603 --> 00:36:24,873
The person who made the request

476
00:36:24,873 --> 00:36:27,803
was old fashioned,
so I thought it was her mother.

477
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:30,043
Many apply for
the service for their kids.

478
00:36:30,473 --> 00:36:31,913
You have a number?

479
00:36:31,913 --> 00:36:32,913
Yes.

480
00:36:33,513 --> 00:36:35,183
Let's talk on the way.

481
00:36:38,383 --> 00:36:40,483
Please come with us for now.

482
00:37:07,983 --> 00:37:09,443
Did someone die?

483
00:37:10,883 --> 00:37:12,113
They might be sick.

484
00:37:12,113 --> 00:37:13,683
Not dead.

485
00:37:21,563 --> 00:37:23,023
Come on. Let's go.

486
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:47,423
Hello, this is Jin Jeong-su
in charge of Foods.

487
00:37:48,983 --> 00:37:50,083
A guest?

488
00:37:52,923 --> 00:37:55,423
There's no way she's this early.

489
00:37:56,223 --> 00:37:58,223
Oh, my mom said she'd be here.

490
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:00,413
It's not my mom?

491
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:02,363
Yeah.

492
00:38:03,973 --> 00:38:05,933
The rice balls she bought this morning

493
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:07,273
are a bit spoiled?

494
00:38:25,123 --> 00:38:26,153
Hello...

495
00:38:29,263 --> 00:38:30,943
Team Leader Jin Jeong-su.

496
00:38:31,633 --> 00:38:34,963
I bought five rice balls
here this morning.

497
00:38:37,703 --> 00:38:40,103
Can we go over there and talk?

498
00:38:40,103 --> 00:38:41,703
I have a lot to say.

499
00:38:48,883 --> 00:38:49,583
Hello.

500
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:50,853
Oh, hello.

501
00:38:55,823 --> 00:38:57,123
Mom, where are you?

502
00:38:57,123 --> 00:38:59,593
<i>I'm about to</i> get on the bus.

503
00:39:00,323 --> 00:39:01,523
Oh, there's the bus.

504
00:39:02,493 --> 00:39:03,893
<i>What shall we eat?</i>

505
00:39:03,893 --> 00:39:04,993
<i>I'm so hungry.</i>

506
00:39:04,993 --> 00:39:06,433
Mom, don't get on just yet.

507
00:39:06,863 --> 00:39:07,863
Huh?

508
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:09,433
Why?

509
00:39:09,903 --> 00:39:11,933
<i>I got a complaint</i> just now,

510
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,803
so I'm stuck here.

511
00:39:14,243 --> 00:39:15,603
Is it bad?

512
00:39:15,903 --> 00:39:17,813
<i>No, it's not.</i>

513
00:39:18,543 --> 00:39:19,743
But I'm a bit busy.

514
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:22,713
<i>Meet up with your friends for lunch</i>

515
00:39:22,713 --> 00:39:24,153
<i>or eat at home and then meet them.</i>

516
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,853
Don't worry about me
at a time like this.

517
00:39:27,053 --> 00:39:28,323
I'll take care of myself.

518
00:39:28,323 --> 00:39:29,623
But what is it about?

519
00:39:29,823 --> 00:39:31,593
Did someone get sick
<i>after eating something?</i>

520
00:39:31,723 --> 00:39:33,353
No, it's nothing like that.

521
00:39:33,353 --> 00:39:34,353
Anyway,

522
00:39:35,023 --> 00:39:37,393
I'm busy, so I'll hang up now.

523
00:39:37,393 --> 00:39:39,493
Okay, go work.

524
00:39:39,733 --> 00:39:41,403
Call me when things are fixed.

525
00:39:41,403 --> 00:39:42,403
<i>Okay.</i>

526
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:45,333
Mom, it's really nothing.

527
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:46,903
So don't worry about it.

528
00:39:47,043 --> 00:39:47,943
<i>Okay?</i>

529
00:39:47,943 --> 00:39:51,013
Don't worry about me and go work.

530
00:39:51,273 --> 00:39:52,443
<i>Okay.</i>

531
00:39:59,183 --> 00:40:00,553
Here's your coffee.

532
00:40:00,553 --> 00:40:01,783
Thank you.

533
00:40:21,803 --> 00:40:24,443
It's impressive, seeing you work.

534
00:40:27,143 --> 00:40:30,483
Work on some new lines.

535
00:40:32,053 --> 00:40:34,583
Saying, "impressive" and
"awesome" insincerely...

536
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,493
Does that still work?

537
00:40:38,623 --> 00:40:40,593
I didn't say you were awesome.

538
00:40:43,563 --> 00:40:45,293
Now that you mention it,

539
00:40:45,293 --> 00:40:47,063
you really are awesome.

540
00:40:50,633 --> 00:40:52,703
See? It still works.

541
00:40:56,273 --> 00:40:57,873
What do you want?

542
00:40:58,843 --> 00:41:00,043
Nothing.

543
00:41:01,743 --> 00:41:04,313
I came here on my way to the hospital.

544
00:41:04,313 --> 00:41:06,283
I just dropped by.
I had to get something, too.

545
00:41:06,283 --> 00:41:08,523
Then you should've bought it and left.

546
00:41:08,523 --> 00:41:10,923
Why? It'd be unnatural.

547
00:41:13,093 --> 00:41:15,893
Because we promised a year ago

548
00:41:17,533 --> 00:41:19,213
never to do this again.

549
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:39,583
What it is that we did?

550
00:41:49,863 --> 00:41:51,733
Don't you think it's a shame?

551
00:41:52,163 --> 00:41:53,163
No.

552
00:41:54,933 --> 00:41:56,163
Seriously.

553
00:41:57,033 --> 00:41:59,103
You don't even know
what I mean, but you say no.

554
00:41:59,103 --> 00:42:00,333
No.

555
00:42:00,533 --> 00:42:01,893
Everything is no.

556
00:42:13,813 --> 00:42:15,583
You take care of

557
00:42:18,053 --> 00:42:20,123
a dying person for a long time,

558
00:42:21,923 --> 00:42:25,793
then you start thinking you must live

559
00:42:26,763 --> 00:42:28,633
selfishly no matter what.

560
00:42:29,303 --> 00:42:31,073
Live like total trash.

561
00:42:38,113 --> 00:42:40,313
Then I saw you again.

562
00:42:43,113 --> 00:42:45,383
And I began to think

563
00:42:46,823 --> 00:42:48,613
I should live a good life.

564
00:42:50,523 --> 00:42:51,963
That's why I came.

565
00:42:58,533 --> 00:42:59,663
I'll leave now.

566
00:43:05,273 --> 00:43:07,373
Now that I'm going,
you want to stop me, right?

567
00:43:10,273 --> 00:43:11,643
I see you're holding back.

568
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,613
Don't be cheeky.

569
00:43:14,913 --> 00:43:17,213
I really have to go and
relieve the caregiver.

570
00:43:17,213 --> 00:43:19,753
Why come here when you're busy?

571
00:43:20,783 --> 00:43:22,583
You should've gone
straight to the hospital.

572
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:24,353
I just told you.

573
00:43:26,123 --> 00:43:28,063
Did you not hear me?
Want me to repeat it?

574
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,963
Seriously, stop being cheeky.

575
00:43:51,183 --> 00:43:53,553
I really don't understand
women like them.

576
00:43:53,813 --> 00:43:56,353
They're married. What's wrong with them?

577
00:43:56,653 --> 00:43:58,253
So, ma'am, you mean

578
00:43:58,753 --> 00:44:00,123
this woman

579
00:44:00,123 --> 00:44:01,963
and that woman are sisters?

580
00:44:02,063 --> 00:44:04,133
That's what I'm betting on.

581
00:44:04,133 --> 00:44:06,463
I'm sure I'm right. Wait and see.

582
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:08,003
That hussy is flirting,

583
00:44:08,003 --> 00:44:09,923
knowing he's her brother-in-law.

584
00:44:12,473 --> 00:44:14,603
The way you cuss is so funny.

585
00:44:15,643 --> 00:44:16,673
It is?

586
00:44:16,673 --> 00:44:17,973
I'm funny?

587
00:44:19,673 --> 00:44:20,843
Yes, yes.

588
00:44:20,843 --> 00:44:22,683
It's ten times more fun

589
00:44:22,683 --> 00:44:24,553
watching TV with you.

590
00:44:26,883 --> 00:44:29,723
I get a free meal and a compliment.

591
00:44:29,953 --> 00:44:32,723
It's good I didn't meet up
with my friends.

592
00:44:34,193 --> 00:44:35,023
Wait.

593
00:44:35,023 --> 00:44:37,133
What meal costs 30,000 won per person?

594
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:39,263
Maybe they give you one whole pig.

595
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:39,893
Yeah.

596
00:44:39,893 --> 00:44:41,463
That's what I said.

597
00:44:41,463 --> 00:44:43,863
I'm finally with people
of the same mind.

598
00:44:44,733 --> 00:44:45,733
Look.

599
00:44:46,033 --> 00:44:47,713
She's the half sister

600
00:44:48,073 --> 00:44:49,743
of the woman who passed by.

601
00:44:50,073 --> 00:44:52,473
No way.

602
00:44:52,813 --> 00:44:54,383
How can a person do that?

603
00:44:54,383 --> 00:44:55,083
Hey.

604
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:56,143
That's a soap opera.

605
00:44:56,143 --> 00:44:58,143
It's different from real life.

606
00:44:58,283 --> 00:45:00,053
Nonsense.

607
00:45:00,153 --> 00:45:02,383
It's not broadcasted on TV,

608
00:45:02,483 --> 00:45:05,423
but real life is more complicated

609
00:45:05,423 --> 00:45:07,453
and dramatic.

610
00:45:07,453 --> 00:45:08,193
Right.

611
00:45:08,193 --> 00:45:10,933
Take the condominium
behind us for instance.

612
00:45:10,933 --> 00:45:11,863
Right?

613
00:45:11,863 --> 00:45:12,693
Oh, my.

614
00:45:12,933 --> 00:45:14,233
Did something happen there?

615
00:45:14,233 --> 00:45:15,533
You don't know?

616
00:45:15,533 --> 00:45:17,463
The old lady living on the 2nd floor.

617
00:45:17,463 --> 00:45:19,033
Her son and his wife are doctors.

618
00:45:19,033 --> 00:45:21,073
- Yes.
- But the daughter-in-law

619
00:45:21,073 --> 00:45:22,743
had an affair with another doctor.

620
00:45:22,743 --> 00:45:24,873
They fought over getting a divorce.

621
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:26,613
I see.

622
00:45:26,613 --> 00:45:28,483
Oh, that's what happened...

623
00:45:28,483 --> 00:45:30,413
Anyway...

624
00:45:30,413 --> 00:45:32,013
Let's talk about that later.

625
00:45:32,283 --> 00:45:33,043
You run a pharmacy.

626
00:45:33,043 --> 00:45:35,333
Why are you slow to hear rumors?

627
00:45:35,353 --> 00:45:36,553
Well,

628
00:45:36,553 --> 00:45:39,493
the customers don't say
things like that.

629
00:45:44,633 --> 00:45:45,933
Did I say something wrong?

630
00:45:45,933 --> 00:45:47,233
Oh, no.

631
00:45:47,433 --> 00:45:49,333
He got a divorce, too.

632
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:50,463
You know.

633
00:45:50,863 --> 00:45:53,003
Yeah, that's right.

634
00:45:55,473 --> 00:45:57,003
Oh, right.

635
00:45:57,003 --> 00:45:59,143
Are your sugar levels okay now?

636
00:45:59,143 --> 00:46:01,413
I'm completely okay thanks to you.

637
00:46:02,413 --> 00:46:04,913
Oh, I should get you these.

638
00:46:12,423 --> 00:46:13,593
Take these.

639
00:46:13,593 --> 00:46:14,723
What are they?

640
00:46:14,723 --> 00:46:16,263
Glucose candy.

641
00:46:16,263 --> 00:46:17,893
Take one when your sugar levels drop.

642
00:46:17,893 --> 00:46:18,763
For an energy boost.

643
00:46:18,763 --> 00:46:19,593
Oh, no.

644
00:46:19,593 --> 00:46:20,333
It's okay.

645
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:21,163
Please take it.

646
00:46:21,163 --> 00:46:23,003
I should've given it to you sooner.

647
00:46:23,003 --> 00:46:23,803
How much are they?

648
00:46:23,803 --> 00:46:24,803
Don't worry about that.

649
00:46:24,803 --> 00:46:26,773
- I can't take them without paying.
- Don't worry about it.

650
00:46:26,773 --> 00:46:27,803
Don't be like this.

651
00:46:27,803 --> 00:46:29,273
Oh, hello.

652
00:46:29,273 --> 00:46:31,173
- Hello.
- You're coming from the eye doctor?

653
00:46:31,173 --> 00:46:32,343
Yes.

654
00:46:38,953 --> 00:46:41,453
Oh, come on. What are you doing?

655
00:46:41,453 --> 00:46:43,283
I want to see how much it is.

656
00:46:44,053 --> 00:46:45,793
The prime cost is cheaper.

657
00:46:46,693 --> 00:46:47,693
I'm so grateful.

658
00:46:47,693 --> 00:46:49,063
Don't mention it.

659
00:46:50,063 --> 00:46:51,333
Enjoy.

660
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:52,263
I'll be going now.

661
00:46:52,263 --> 00:46:53,863
- Okay. Goodbye.
- Go ahead and work.

662
00:46:53,863 --> 00:46:54,603
You're leaving?

663
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:55,603
Yes.

664
00:47:03,073 --> 00:47:04,913
She left in a good mood.

665
00:47:04,913 --> 00:47:06,343
The landlady.

666
00:47:06,343 --> 00:47:07,743
Quiet.

667
00:47:07,743 --> 00:47:09,423
She'll misunderstand.

668
00:47:10,383 --> 00:47:12,783
I'm being nice because
she reminds me of Mom.

669
00:47:13,213 --> 00:47:15,153
I should step outside for a bit.

670
00:47:15,453 --> 00:47:16,323
Why?

671
00:47:16,323 --> 00:47:18,723
To see if a passing dog is laughing.

672
00:47:18,723 --> 00:47:21,523
You're so juvenile.

673
00:47:24,533 --> 00:47:25,793
You're okay, right?

674
00:47:25,793 --> 00:47:26,793
About what?

675
00:47:27,393 --> 00:47:28,803
What do you think?

676
00:47:28,803 --> 00:47:30,463
I'm just asking if you're okay.

677
00:47:32,673 --> 00:47:34,803
Where is that condominium where

678
00:47:34,803 --> 00:47:37,913
the couple is divorcing
because of adultery?

679
00:47:37,913 --> 00:47:40,773
Jeez. You did get hurt.

680
00:47:41,113 --> 00:47:42,743
Will you invite him

681
00:47:42,743 --> 00:47:45,883
to drink because you're
in the same situation?

682
00:47:47,413 --> 00:47:49,023
You're really...

683
00:47:49,123 --> 00:47:50,323
What?

684
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,493
Cruel.

685
00:47:52,653 --> 00:47:54,093
You're realizing that only now?

686
00:47:57,493 --> 00:47:58,533
Yes.

687
00:47:58,693 --> 00:48:01,333
I'm the substitute homemaker
that called earlier.

688
00:48:02,233 --> 00:48:04,533
They said she'll be okay.

689
00:48:05,303 --> 00:48:08,303
So you can calm down a bit.

690
00:48:10,843 --> 00:48:14,513
How long will it take
for you to get here?

691
00:49:17,273 --> 00:49:19,873
<i>Or it might be because
you're sadder than me.</i>

692
00:49:20,813 --> 00:49:22,283
<i>My heart</i>

693
00:49:22,613 --> 00:49:23,843
<i>is leaping</i>

694
00:49:24,713 --> 00:49:26,253
<i>and jolting.</i>

695
00:49:31,223 --> 00:49:32,753
<i>I want to be kind.</i>

696
00:49:41,303 --> 00:49:43,363
<i>Im Ji-yeon's guardian?</i>

697
00:49:47,003 --> 00:49:49,673
<i>Is Im Ji-yeon's guardian here?</i>

698
00:49:50,743 --> 00:49:51,713
Oh.

699
00:49:51,973 --> 00:49:53,413
I'm here.

700
00:49:55,043 --> 00:49:56,943
Are you Im Ji-yeon's guardian?

701
00:49:57,383 --> 00:49:58,113
Well...

702
00:49:58,113 --> 00:49:59,883
Where is Im Ji-yeon?

703
00:50:01,353 --> 00:50:04,493
Just a sec. I think
her real guardians are here.

704
00:50:06,193 --> 00:50:07,193
There she is.

705
00:50:09,393 --> 00:50:12,793
<i>Ji-yeon!</i>

706
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,963
I can take a shower, right?

707
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,063
Yes, ma'am.

708
00:50:51,503 --> 00:50:53,533
I came here straight
from the filming location.

709
00:50:55,073 --> 00:50:57,443
I rolled around outside too much.

710
00:50:57,813 --> 00:50:59,073
You must be exhausted, ma'am.

711
00:50:59,073 --> 00:51:00,543
I'm meeting Writer Heo here.

712
00:51:00,543 --> 00:51:02,473
- Yes. I know.
- Oh, right.

713
00:51:05,683 --> 00:51:07,253
How is the other thing going?

714
00:51:07,253 --> 00:51:08,253
Ma'am?

715
00:51:08,753 --> 00:51:10,623
The thing I asked you to do.

716
00:51:11,923 --> 00:51:14,323
The girl trolling me...

717
00:51:14,523 --> 00:51:16,223
You said you'll make her powerless.

718
00:51:16,223 --> 00:51:17,623
Oh, yes.

719
00:51:17,993 --> 00:51:19,593
It's going well.

720
00:51:20,693 --> 00:51:22,803
What about the lawsuit?

721
00:51:22,803 --> 00:51:24,303
It's going well, right?

722
00:51:24,303 --> 00:51:25,873
I dropped the charges.

723
00:51:25,873 --> 00:51:26,973
What?

724
00:51:28,643 --> 00:51:30,773
No good will come of fighting head on.

725
00:51:30,773 --> 00:51:32,453
It was just to scare her.

726
00:51:38,613 --> 00:51:40,453
What's more, I have you.

727
00:51:45,293 --> 00:51:46,453
How long

728
00:51:47,723 --> 00:51:49,363
has it been between us?

729
00:51:49,893 --> 00:51:50,893
Ma'am?

730
00:51:51,793 --> 00:51:54,063
I was crossing
the Yeongdong Bridge earlier

731
00:51:54,863 --> 00:51:56,833
and suddenly thought

732
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:02,143
that it would've been really hard

733
00:52:02,143 --> 00:52:03,373
if you hadn't been there.

734
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:08,083
It's been seven years since I came here

735
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:11,383
on really tough days.

736
00:52:13,353 --> 00:52:14,823
Thank you, ma'am.

737
00:52:20,023 --> 00:52:21,363
Jong-hoon.

738
00:52:21,723 --> 00:52:22,823
Yes, ma'am.

739
00:52:24,593 --> 00:52:26,393
Let's continue working hard

740
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:29,013
to live our best.

741
00:52:29,433 --> 00:52:30,433
Yes, ma'am.

742
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,273
Let me know
when Writer Heo's car pulls in.

743
00:52:39,273 --> 00:52:40,573
Yes, ma'am.

744
00:52:57,263 --> 00:52:58,233
Oh.

745
00:53:00,063 --> 00:53:01,063
Hey.

746
00:53:01,563 --> 00:53:03,143
What's "shield lift"?

747
00:53:03,533 --> 00:53:04,533
What?

748
00:53:05,303 --> 00:53:06,703
Oh, never mind.

749
00:53:19,153 --> 00:53:21,053
Do you live here?

750
00:53:21,053 --> 00:53:22,223
What's all this?

751
00:53:23,853 --> 00:53:25,923
Where I lie down is where I live.

752
00:53:26,823 --> 00:53:29,063
You're a Seoulite. Why act surprised?

753
00:53:31,093 --> 00:53:32,633
I was living in the dry sauna,

754
00:53:32,633 --> 00:53:34,593
but I had to stand in line
to use the computer,

755
00:53:34,733 --> 00:53:36,013
so I moved here.

756
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:39,273
I was wondering why I
wasn't attracted to you.

757
00:53:39,533 --> 00:53:41,573
You're a true bum.

758
00:53:42,443 --> 00:53:44,443
Bums are bums - true or fake.

759
00:53:45,943 --> 00:53:48,143
I guess your video business
isn't doing well.

760
00:53:48,443 --> 00:53:49,913
You're not getting any views, are you?

761
00:53:50,883 --> 00:53:51,753
You watched?

762
00:53:51,753 --> 00:53:52,783
Why would I?

763
00:53:52,783 --> 00:53:54,183
It's easily predictable.

764
00:53:54,483 --> 00:53:56,083
You come across better in person.

765
00:53:56,083 --> 00:53:58,983
If it's through a screen,
you have no charm.

766
00:54:01,563 --> 00:54:02,693
What does that mean?

767
00:54:02,693 --> 00:54:03,973
That I'm pretty?

768
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:08,333
It means you're a good person.

769
00:54:09,803 --> 00:54:11,403
Are you really sleeping here?

770
00:54:11,603 --> 00:54:12,573
Yeah.

771
00:54:12,573 --> 00:54:14,073
I slept here yesterday.
I'll sleep here today

772
00:54:14,073 --> 00:54:15,573
and tomorrow.

773
00:54:16,843 --> 00:54:18,413
At least go to a boarding house.

774
00:54:18,413 --> 00:54:20,743
Sounds good.

775
00:54:20,743 --> 00:54:22,913
Depending on how much I earned today.

776
00:54:23,313 --> 00:54:24,483
You didn't earn anything.

777
00:54:24,483 --> 00:54:26,353
It was money for the funeral expenses.

778
00:54:27,613 --> 00:54:29,423
You spent all 3.5 million won?

779
00:54:29,823 --> 00:54:30,623
Of course.

780
00:54:30,623 --> 00:54:32,323
I spent more.

781
00:54:33,723 --> 00:54:34,923
Just.

782
00:54:35,223 --> 00:54:37,023
It only cost about 500,000 won, right?

783
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,233
I don't know.

784
00:54:39,263 --> 00:54:40,633
You have no sense of reality.

785
00:54:40,633 --> 00:54:42,133
The pajamas Jeong-woo wore

786
00:54:42,133 --> 00:54:43,533
were 100% silk.

787
00:54:43,533 --> 00:54:45,533
But you didn't buy them.

788
00:54:46,803 --> 00:54:47,833
Did you see?

789
00:54:48,033 --> 00:54:48,773
Did you?

790
00:54:48,773 --> 00:54:51,373
But Min-jeong is right about that.

791
00:54:51,373 --> 00:54:52,613
"Min-jeong"?

792
00:54:53,513 --> 00:54:55,283
Wow, I have the chills.

793
00:54:55,283 --> 00:54:56,613
What is up with you two?

794
00:54:56,813 --> 00:54:58,813
Why? Jealous much, Gang-jae?

795
00:55:08,123 --> 00:55:09,423
<i>(Akira Manager, Seo Jong-hoon)</i>

796
00:55:11,363 --> 00:55:12,863
You're still working the rooms?

797
00:55:13,363 --> 00:55:14,093
What do you mean?

798
00:55:14,093 --> 00:55:15,603
You go work in your own room.

799
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:16,203
Just.

800
00:55:16,203 --> 00:55:17,703
Does he still work the rooms?

801
00:55:18,003 --> 00:55:20,303
No. He quit a long time ago.

802
00:55:20,303 --> 00:55:23,403
See? Your Just says
I quit a long time ago.

803
00:55:25,343 --> 00:55:27,613
If you quit, you should sever ties.

804
00:55:27,613 --> 00:55:29,283
Why are you still calling each other?

805
00:55:29,283 --> 00:55:30,643
You two so fond of each other?

806
00:55:30,913 --> 00:55:32,383
Why do you date male idol singers

807
00:55:32,383 --> 00:55:34,113
when you've quit being a trainee?

808
00:55:35,023 --> 00:55:36,883
Excuse me. Can you help me with this?

809
00:55:36,983 --> 00:55:37,983
Sure.

810
00:55:39,393 --> 00:55:41,023
I'm not dating them. It's pure business.

811
00:55:41,023 --> 00:55:42,223
Did you see?

812
00:55:42,663 --> 00:55:45,593
Business is what you and I are doing.

813
00:55:48,063 --> 00:55:49,903
Why's he calling again?

814
00:55:51,403 --> 00:55:52,873
It's like long lost love.

815
00:55:56,543 --> 00:55:57,503
Yeah.

816
00:55:57,503 --> 00:55:58,373
What's up?

817
00:55:58,373 --> 00:55:59,343
<i>Hey.</i>

818
00:55:59,343 --> 00:56:00,073
<i>You know</i>

819
00:56:00,073 --> 00:56:01,713
<i>the job I told you about before.</i>

820
00:56:02,383 --> 00:56:03,883
<i>Have you thought about it?</i>

821
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:05,683
Before?

822
00:56:07,613 --> 00:56:08,653
What was it?

823
00:56:08,653 --> 00:56:11,523
The job Jeong-woo pooped on.

824
00:56:11,793 --> 00:56:12,793
<i>Oh.</i>

825
00:56:14,153 --> 00:56:16,993
She must be a really big client.

826
00:56:17,393 --> 00:56:18,833
Is she a business tycoon?

827
00:56:19,193 --> 00:56:20,533
<i>Who is she?</i>

828
00:56:20,733 --> 00:56:23,463
I can't tell you now. Anyway!

829
00:56:23,563 --> 00:56:25,993
What tough job did you give Jeong-woo

830
00:56:25,993 --> 00:56:27,503
who was already suffering?

831
00:56:28,273 --> 00:56:30,273
<i>I'm starting to dislike you.</i>

832
00:56:30,503 --> 00:56:32,713
The job itself is nothing.

833
00:56:32,713 --> 00:56:35,713
You can do it with your eyes closed.

834
00:56:35,843 --> 00:56:37,313
What is it?

835
00:56:37,443 --> 00:56:39,843
Is it catching a rich lady's husband

836
00:56:39,843 --> 00:56:41,153
having an affair?

837
00:56:41,153 --> 00:56:42,753
<i>Nice, Gang-jae.</i>

838
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,323
I see you're interested now.

839
00:56:45,523 --> 00:56:46,453
Wait.

840
00:56:46,453 --> 00:56:48,463
I'll text you the deets right away.

841
00:57:09,643 --> 00:57:12,753
<i>She's a nobody working as a publisher.</i>

842
00:57:15,453 --> 00:57:16,853
Where is it?

843
00:57:17,483 --> 00:57:18,253
<i>Jeez.</i>

844
00:57:18,253 --> 00:57:20,453
Hang up, send it, then call me back.

845
00:57:20,793 --> 00:57:22,323
No, no. Don't hang up.

846
00:57:22,323 --> 00:57:24,263
<i>Hang up after you answer me.</i>

847
00:57:24,263 --> 00:57:25,093
Don't get your hopes up.

848
00:57:25,093 --> 00:57:27,033
If I have to take photos, I refuse.

849
00:57:27,033 --> 00:57:28,433
<i>I'm telling you</i>

850
00:57:28,433 --> 00:57:30,003
<i>it's nothing like that.</i>

851
00:58:11,443 --> 00:58:14,013
<i>Making my elderly dad lie sick in bed.</i>

852
00:58:14,013 --> 00:58:16,343
<i>So how could I be in my right mind?</i>

853
00:58:17,513 --> 00:58:19,253
<i>How did you know?</i>

854
00:58:19,613 --> 00:58:21,623
<i>That I want to die?</i>

855
00:58:22,853 --> 00:58:26,593
<i>I'm so embarrassed that
I want to die right now!</i>

856
00:58:28,863 --> 00:58:29,963
<i>Found it.</i>

857
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:34,633
Oh, right.

858
00:58:35,103 --> 00:58:37,433
Have you heard about "shield lift?"

859
00:58:38,503 --> 00:58:39,573
<i>Hello?</i>

860
00:58:41,403 --> 00:58:42,403
Yeah?

861
00:58:42,573 --> 00:58:44,703
Have you heard about "shield lift?"

862
00:58:44,843 --> 00:58:46,013
Shield lift?

863
00:58:46,113 --> 00:58:48,283
<i>A client asked me,</i>

864
00:58:49,243 --> 00:58:51,183
but I can't find it on the internet.

865
00:58:54,013 --> 00:58:55,723
Oh, well,

866
00:58:55,723 --> 00:58:56,523
shield lift is...

867
00:58:56,523 --> 00:58:57,683
I texted you.

868
00:59:16,673 --> 00:59:22,173
<i>(Resume: Lee Bu-jeong)</i>

873
00:59:59,283 --> 01:00:00,513
<i>Hello?</i>

874
01:00:02,523 --> 01:00:03,523
Yeah.

When can you finish the job?

<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

877
01:00:07,523 --> 01:00:08,893
That's a dumb question.

878
01:00:08,893 --> 01:00:10,763
Everything that's bad.

879
01:00:10,763 --> 01:00:11,993
<i>What if there is none?</i>

880
01:00:12,463 --> 01:00:13,463
Huh?

881
01:00:14,633 --> 01:00:16,433
What if there is no dirt on her?

882
01:00:16,763 --> 01:00:18,203
<i>Well, then.</i>

883
01:00:19,103 --> 01:00:20,573
Make up stuff.

884
01:00:49,763 --> 01:00:51,203
Why did you come here?

885
01:00:51,203 --> 01:00:52,433
You should go home.

886
01:00:52,433 --> 01:00:54,133
Why are you out already?

887
01:00:54,133 --> 01:00:56,243
You should rest at home.

888
01:00:56,443 --> 01:00:58,543
Did something good happen at work today?

889
01:00:58,543 --> 01:00:59,543
Huh?

890
01:01:00,233 --> 01:01:01,073
Yeah.

891
01:01:01,543 --> 01:01:02,913
I got a gift.

892
01:01:03,283 --> 01:01:04,283
A gift?

893
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,313
Yes.

894
01:01:05,313 --> 01:01:07,813
I helped someone today.

895
01:01:07,813 --> 01:01:09,123
Is that why you received that?

896
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:12,123
Yes. She said she's so grateful.

897
01:01:12,323 --> 01:01:14,753
I said it was okay.
But she followed me out

898
01:01:14,753 --> 01:01:16,563
and bought this for me.

899
01:01:16,823 --> 01:01:17,923
She did?

900
01:01:17,923 --> 01:01:18,993
Yes.

901
01:01:19,863 --> 01:01:22,433
She said I saved her life.

902
01:01:22,433 --> 01:01:23,633
But I didn't do anything.

903
01:01:23,633 --> 01:01:25,603
Is that why you're in such a good mood?

904
01:01:25,603 --> 01:01:27,283
Yes, I feel good, Dad.

905
01:01:27,803 --> 01:01:29,403
I feel alive.

906
01:01:30,543 --> 01:01:31,643
This is you.

907
01:01:32,213 --> 01:01:33,473
This is the real you.

908
01:01:34,613 --> 01:01:36,743
You were like this
since you've been a child.

909
01:01:37,543 --> 01:01:38,873
If you had two things,

910
01:01:38,893 --> 01:01:41,113
you had to give one to someone else

911
01:01:41,113 --> 01:01:42,853
to feel at peace.

912
01:01:43,523 --> 01:01:45,453
You are that kind.

913
01:01:47,853 --> 01:01:49,493
Was I kind?

914
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:51,563
Of course you were.

915
01:01:52,093 --> 01:01:53,793
Are you coming up?

916
01:01:54,363 --> 01:01:55,933
We have to eat this cake.

917
01:01:55,933 --> 01:01:58,973
Eat it with Jeong-su. Why bring it here?

918
01:02:01,903 --> 01:02:03,443
I want to see her.

919
01:02:03,443 --> 01:02:04,443
Huh?

920
01:02:04,603 --> 01:02:06,313
The person who bought you the cake.

921
01:02:08,483 --> 01:02:10,543
I feel the same way, too.

922
01:02:10,713 --> 01:02:11,783
About what?

923
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:13,783
That you saved my life.

924
01:02:13,783 --> 01:02:15,083
That's what I think.

925
01:02:16,823 --> 01:02:18,453
That's you.

<i>I learned a new word today
at the police station.</i>

929
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:56,693

Just.

935
01:03:40,203 --> 01:03:41,503
What's up with him?

936
01:03:43,543 --> 01:03:44,703
Uhh...

937
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:46,873
Beats me.

940
01:04:03,393 --> 01:04:05,123
That's Jeong-woo's client.

941
01:04:07,363 --> 01:04:08,363
What?

942
01:04:08,633 --> 01:04:10,263
Is something going on with her?

943
01:04:11,733 --> 01:04:13,233
Do you know anything?

944
01:04:14,233 --> 01:04:15,233
Huh?

945
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,043
Should I know something?

946
01:04:21,243 --> 01:04:24,083
You said she was Jeong-woo's client.

947
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:25,413
Yeah.

948
01:04:25,413 --> 01:04:28,013
Jeong-woo sat in that spot

949
01:04:28,013 --> 01:04:29,783
and googled her.

950
01:04:44,303 --> 01:04:46,833
So I asked him why
he was looking her up.

951
01:04:46,933 --> 01:04:48,003
<i>Who is she?</i>

952
01:04:48,273 --> 01:04:49,273

955
01:04:57,183 --> 01:04:58,683
But wasn't this woman

956
01:04:58,953 --> 01:05:01,353
Jong-hoon's client for a long time?

957
01:05:02,723 --> 01:05:04,153
How do you know so well?

958
01:05:04,153 --> 01:05:05,493
No one ever told you anything.

959
01:05:06,293 --> 01:05:07,793
No one has to say anything to know.

960
01:05:07,793 --> 01:05:09,823
You just know
when you spend time with them.

961
01:05:12,763 --> 01:05:14,093
What's going on?

962
01:05:18,163 --> 01:05:19,673
What's going on is...

963
01:05:26,543 --> 01:05:27,843
That's so funny.
