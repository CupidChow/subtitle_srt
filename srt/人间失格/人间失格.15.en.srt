00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,909
<i>What should I do, Father?</i>

4
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:32,279
<i>Even now,</i>

5
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,249
<i>I still think about</i>

6
00:00:39,349 --> 00:00:40,849
<i>what money is</i>

7
00:00:40,849 --> 00:00:42,919
<i>several times a day.</i>

8
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:45,959
<i>And</i>

9
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,359
<i>I think that the person
who loves me the most</i>

10
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:53,329
<i>is the one who spends
the most money on me.</i>

11
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:59,069
<i>Like an old habit, I can't stop.</i>

12
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:02,839
<i>But sometimes,</i>

13
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:06,099
<i>- (Juhyeop Bank Deposit - 300,000 won)
- occasionally,</i>

14
00:01:06,949 --> 00:01:10,679
<i>I sink deep</i>

15
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:14,989
<i>into the thought of what love is,</i>

16
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:16,619
<i>which is something</i>

17
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:19,959
<i>- I've never thought of before.
- (Jeong-woo, Min-su, Hee-sun)</i>

18
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:30,399
<i>- (Transferred-to Name: Lee Gang-jae)
- Not being at the receiving end of love,</i>

19
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:33,629
<i>but being the one to give love,</i>

20
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,549
<i>and creating space for
that person inside me.</i>

21
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:45,019
<i>The space grows.</i>

22
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:46,799
How regrettable.

23
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,359
<i>Then in the end,</i>

24
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,029
<i>I am filled with only that person.</i>

25
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:57,999
<i>I think about this kind
of listless pain.</i>

26
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:11,309
<i>Though I try hard to be alone,</i>

27
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,149
<i>I can't be alone.</i>

28
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:19,149
<i>I think about this kind
of sweet apprehension.</i>

29
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:52,989
<i>What can I do for that person?</i>

30
00:03:04,369 --> 00:03:07,799
<i>What can I be for that person?</i>

31
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:15,409
<i>Maybe not being anything,</i>

32
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:22,319
<i>or trying hard to be something,</i>

33
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:25,689
<i>but rather being honest to myself</i>

34
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:29,639
<i>is the kind of love</i>

35
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:32,689
<i>that I can give.</i>

36
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,559
We meet again.

37
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:06,789
In Seoul.

38
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:46,229
I'll buy this time, too. Let's go!

39
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:47,129
What?

40
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:48,469
Come on. Let's go.

41
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:10,459
I missed you, Ms. Lee Bu-jeong.

42
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,979
This reminds me of our past.

43
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:13,519
This is the first time
we're coming here.

44
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:15,919
How can this remind you of our past?

45
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:21,159
I leaned on you a lot like this.

46
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,459
At coffee shops,

47
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:29,499
on buses, and even subways.

48
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:37,639
I wanted it to last longer,

49
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:42,049
so a lot of the times,
I pretended to sleep.

50
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,089
Did you know?

51
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:48,159
I knew.

52
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,269
I think I wanted to torment you.

53
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:07,639
I wanted you to be upset because of me.

54
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:10,279
I know.

55
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:14,209
I don't know the psychology
behind that though.

56
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:21,349
Did you know that, too?

57
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:23,389
I knew.

58
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,469
What would people say about us?

59
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:41,909
That we're perverted?

60
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:45,109
Who cares?

61
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:48,519
As long as you're comfortable.

62
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:05,729
I feel like I'm going to cry.

63
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:15,139
I don't know what I'm feeling.

64
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,179
But

65
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:32,029
I think today will be
the first and last time.

66
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,239
Get some sleep.

67
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,009
I said let's just go home.

68
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:53,609
We came out to go to the karaoke room.

69
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:55,419
We can't just go back in.

70
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:57,149
Then let's go to the karaoke room.

71
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:58,949
You said you won't be able to sing

72
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:01,449
because your heart is racing.

73
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:09,659
What could be between those two?

74
00:09:11,869 --> 00:09:15,299
It wasn't three or four people.

75
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:19,109
Just the two of them
going to a karaoke...

76
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:21,919
What do you think it is?

77
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:24,179
What about you?

78
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:28,679
An affair.

79
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:35,289
They could be just friends.

80
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:37,289
We also went to a karaoke room.

81
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:39,389
But they went toward a motel.

82
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:47,499
What?

83
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:49,099
Do you

84
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:53,139
still think that when you see...

85
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:55,279
That?

86
00:10:00,849 --> 00:10:02,649
What are you talking about?

87
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:04,989
You know.

88
00:10:07,349 --> 00:10:08,389
Go inside.

89
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:11,119
Hmph.

90
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,639
<i>Were you drinking?</i>

91
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:22,839
No.

92
00:10:24,469 --> 00:10:25,769
You were.

93
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:28,909
I told you to leave it, but you took it.

94
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:32,449
I wouldn't have drunk a lot by myself.

95
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,749
Are you drinking with Gang-jae?

96
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,819
<i>Oh, Gang-jae?</i>

97
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:43,859
<i>He left</i> the moment he came inside.

98
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:46,359
Now he's not answering his phone.

99
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:47,489
Oh.

100
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,529
But eventually, he comes back.

101
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:52,299
Like a real estate agency dog.

102
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:54,369
A real estate agency dog?

103
00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:00,509
That's what my grandma
used to say to me.

104
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,479
Because I'd leave,
go around the neighborhood

105
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:06,449
then come back when she starts worrying.

106
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:07,609
Oh!

107
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:09,949
You lived with your grandmother?

108
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,189
I guess Gang-jae never talked about me.

109
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:15,549
You know nothing.

110
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:22,059
My mom and dad were both busy,

111
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:24,429
so I lived with my grandma.

112
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:27,869
When I became a trainee,
I lived at the dorm.

113
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:31,069
9 years ago,

114
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:35,779
I almost debuted.

115
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:38,509
<i>Several times after that, too.</i>

116
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,849
But that time, it was for real.

117
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,079
Anyway,

118
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:49,419
things were hectic. They divorced,

119
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:51,089
each got remarried,

120
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:53,259
<i>and then immigrated.</i>

121
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:55,899
<i>My dad took only my brother.</i>

122
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:04,239
<i>Hello? Are you listening?</i>

123
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:06,539
Yes, I'm listening.

124
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:12,149
I have a web-drama audition on Monday.

125
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,909
<i>Huh?</i> A web-drama?

126
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:15,919
<i>Yes.</i>

127
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,649
<i>The role is the girlfriend</i>
of an agency's CEO.

128
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:19,689
Isn't it perfect?

129
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:23,159
Idol singers are
a good drama subject nowadays.

130
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,759
Since it's a national project.

131
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,989
<i>Idol singers are a national project?</i>

132
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:33,499
Oh, I'm not saying it as a fact.

133
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:36,129
<i>I'm just saying it's that hot.</i>

134
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:37,999
Anyway.

135
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:41,039
Can you pick what I should wear with me?

136
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,539
Tell me what's the cutest.

137
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,709
Me?

138
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:47,509
Hang up for a sec.

139
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:12,309
Wait here.

140
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,379
Is there an empty table for two?

141
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:20,279
- I'll have to clear that up.
- Okay.

142
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:34,829
I think they're full.

143
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:35,829
Let's go.

144
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:40,629
Let's go.

145
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:48,609
That place might seem hectic
but it's really good.

146
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,879
It was even more hectic today.

147
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:56,179
Do you know a place?

148
00:13:56,749 --> 00:13:58,949
A place you went to often

149
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:01,419
when you worked at your office.

150
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:04,119
Or a place you want to try.

151
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:08,359
I don't know.

152
00:14:13,469 --> 00:14:14,669
What do you like?

153
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:21,809
Oh, you said you don't like anything.

154
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:27,609
I like everything.

155
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,219
I like it all.

156
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:40,219
<i>(Missed calls) (Mom)</i>

157
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:41,849
Is it home?

158
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:44,489
You're awake?

159
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:46,389
Yeah.

160
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,159
Is it home?

161
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:51,969
It's Mom.

162
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,569
You're still a good son.

163
00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:57,369
No, I'm not.

164
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,569
She still calls me bastard.

165
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:07,709
I love you, Jeong-su.

166
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:16,289
What?

167
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:21,739
Why, all of a sudden?

168
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:30,339
I deeply regretted not saying it

169
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,459
in the past.

170
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:37,879
I should've said it,
even if it were as a joke.

171
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:50,949
The day before my husband died,

172
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:55,599
I asked him.

173
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:03,169
I said there's a man
I've liked since I was young.

174
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,839
I asked if I could see him.

175
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:13,009
He started crying.

176
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,489
That means no, right?

177
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:30,929
<i>(Mom)</i>

178
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:38,839
Is it home?

179
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:40,809
It's Mom.

180
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:43,579
Why don't you answer it?

181
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:45,609
It may be urgent.

182
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:46,979
It's nothing.

183
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:48,949
She's just calling.

184
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:59,659
I don't know how others do it.

185
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:01,859
Do what?

186
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,179
Have an affair.

187
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:08,469
Many married people
meet other married people.

188
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:13,839
My heart sinks every time
you look at your phone.

189
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:18,109
How do other people have an affair?

190
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,809
I liked you the most, Jeong-su.

191
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:50,639
I still do.

192
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:03,889
Don't you have anything to say?

193
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:05,929
This might be the last.

194
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:10,659
Or not.

195
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:24,039
I still

196
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:28,109
use the same PIN number
for my bank account.

197
00:19:28,949 --> 00:19:30,219
It's your birthday.

198
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:34,189
Since college,

199
00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:37,089
I've never changed it.

200
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:45,429
Maybe you were too lazy to change it.

201
00:19:48,469 --> 00:19:49,939
There's that, too.

202
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:57,839
You're needlessly honest.

203
00:20:22,939 --> 00:20:24,099
Let's go.

204
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,339
Okay.

205
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,669
Where is everyone?

206
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,499
It's almost 11 o'clock.

207
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,799
My goodness.

208
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:02,209
What is she doing all day?

209
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:04,079
She got fired.

210
00:21:05,949 --> 00:21:09,549
What does she go around doing?

211
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,019
Jeez.

212
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,489
Even if I try to be nice,

213
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:20,949
she's hard to like.

214
00:21:34,469 --> 00:21:37,939
Her husband works hard even on weekends.

215
00:21:37,939 --> 00:21:39,309
If she stays at home,

216
00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:40,909
she should make pickled vegetables

217
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:44,079
and keep the place tidy.

218
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:50,059
Bu-jeong.

219
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:52,529
I'm going in here.

220
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:08,109
Yeah, I bet you're frustrated, too.

221
00:22:08,469 --> 00:22:10,639
I wish I could understand you.

222
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:24,789
The fridge is too big.

223
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:33,799
I guess this is better than crying and

224
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:36,369
locking herself in her room,

225
00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:38,739
not letting Jeong-su go out either.

226
00:22:38,739 --> 00:22:40,209
Yeah, going out is better.

227
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:43,109
I wish I could understand you.

228
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:52,649
Should I give Chang-suk his right now?

229
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,959
It's too late, right?

233
00:24:35,689 --> 00:24:37,219
I'm fine.

234
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,159
I'm okay.

235
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,499
I'm fine.

236
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:44,759
I'm okay.

237
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:52,169
Huh?

238
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:41,919
Do you want a drink?

239
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,789
Let's drink.

240
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:02,539
If I pour like this,

241
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:04,909
we'll drink it all with
two glasses each.

242
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:06,709
We have a long way to go.

243
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:12,379
I think this is the first time
I'm pouring drinks

244
00:26:12,749 --> 00:26:14,489
off the clock.

245
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:20,389
It's true.

246
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:21,629
Okay.

247
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:24,329
It's an honor.

248
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:28,999
I'm telling the truth.

249
00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:37,239
But

250
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,979
why did you tell me to meet you there?

251
00:26:39,979 --> 00:26:41,549
It's near your father's place.

252
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:42,579
No reason.

253
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:47,389
That motel came to mind.

254
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:51,489
I remembered getting off the bus there.

255
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:08,669
I hesitated for a long time,
unable to cross

256
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,239
the crosswalk.

257
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:13,539
Why?

258
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,649
I don't know.

259
00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:30,659
You must've been really hungry.

260
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,469
I didn't eat all day.

261
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,769
Why?

262
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:36,639
Well...

263
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,639
I was busy.

264
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,939
Doing what?

265
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:46,909
Oh, well, you know,

266
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,379
I want to imagine it
so I should know the details.

267
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,019
I think you wore those clothes.

268
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:56,059
Your shoes...

269
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:57,289
are heels.

270
00:27:57,789 --> 00:27:59,329
What did you do?

271
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:14,469
On what I'm wearing now, I wore an apron

272
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:17,739
and peeled fruits.
I also put away dishes.

273
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,209
At the hospital.

274
00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:23,879
Oh, the hospital.

275
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:28,289
Normally,

276
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:32,459
I'd go to my employer's house and clean

277
00:28:34,489 --> 00:28:38,329
and cook, but she was hospitalized

278
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,799
so I had to go there to work.

279
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,699
I have to go a few more days.

280
00:28:43,469 --> 00:28:46,069
You're thinking why
I'm dressed like this, right?

281
00:28:46,209 --> 00:28:47,909
It looks uncomfortable
to work in, right?

282
00:28:49,139 --> 00:28:51,469
Well, no, not in particular, but...

283
00:28:53,009 --> 00:28:54,809
Is there a special reason?

284
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:01,749
I didn't tell anyone.

285
00:29:02,219 --> 00:29:03,819
Not my dad

286
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,889
or my husband.

287
00:29:08,689 --> 00:29:10,699
I dress and speak the same

288
00:29:10,699 --> 00:29:13,229
just as when I went
to work at the office.

289
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,469
But I think they all know.

290
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:23,109
Before, they'd ask me
about my work and book.

291
00:29:25,949 --> 00:29:27,149
But now,

292
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:30,619
no one talks about it.

293
00:29:34,219 --> 00:29:36,059
It must be a coincidence.

294
00:29:42,229 --> 00:29:45,729
Recently, he went to
my former workplace.

295
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:47,929
Who?

296
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:49,599
My husband.

297
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:55,369
You talked about
the pumpkin carriage, right?

298
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:58,139
About coming to reality
from an illusion.

299
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:00,239
Yes.

300
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:03,279
Actually, until recently,

301
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:08,319
for about a year,

302
00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:10,529
I've been thinking that.

303
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:13,629
It's similar but a totally
different story.

304
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:16,159
What was before me

305
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,059
was the illusion.

306
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:27,449

Sir!

311

Sir!

312
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:40,449

00:31:55,189 --> 00:31:56,869
<i>Thinking my life was okay,</i>

316
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:00,429
<i>that I was living better than most...</i>

317
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:03,399
<i>All of that was an illusion.</i>

318
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:05,869
<i>I realized that</i>

319
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:08,739
<i>in that moment.</i>

321
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:13,009
What the hell?

00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:16,109
Did you tell the baby's mama

You included these in the bill, too?

339
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:55,039
Okay.

340
00:33:55,649 --> 00:33:56,919
Where should we go?

341
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:01,249
I know.

342
00:34:02,449 --> 00:34:05,079
How about life with an illusion?

343
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:07,929
Don't tease me.

344
00:34:08,459 --> 00:34:09,729
I'm not.

345
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:12,559
I knew you'd tease me.

346
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,369
Where are you going?

347
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:18,059
Nowhere.

348
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:05,249
Oh, ma'am.

349
00:35:06,949 --> 00:35:08,449
You're here early.

350
00:35:08,449 --> 00:35:10,859
You said you were
stopping by your house.

351
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,189
I was just arranging things.

352
00:35:13,629 --> 00:35:15,429
Is it raining outside?

353
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:17,959
It just started pouring.

354
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:20,769
You should've called me.

355
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:30,939
I was going home, but came here.

356
00:35:30,939 --> 00:35:32,909
Because Mr. Seo is there.

357
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:36,349
Seriously.

358
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,919
I should change this habit.

That bastard doesn't deserve a title.

360
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:48,689
Anyway, that bastard's
at home waiting for me.

361
00:35:49,629 --> 00:35:51,459
So I came straight here.

362
00:35:52,129 --> 00:35:53,129
I see.

363
00:35:53,729 --> 00:35:55,069
Do you have a pill for headaches?

364
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,869
Yes.

365
00:36:08,549 --> 00:36:10,319
Do you always prepare like this?

366
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:11,319
What?

367
00:36:13,949 --> 00:36:15,689
When I call, do you drop everything

368
00:36:15,689 --> 00:36:17,889
and come here to set things up?

369
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:20,329
Oh, well.

370
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,489
I don't do much.

371
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,029
Since you're filming.

372
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:29,269
Did you see this

373
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:31,839
at my dressing room and copied it?

374
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,709
For my throat?

375
00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:36,309
Yes.

376
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,779
I should've set it up sooner.

377
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:41,289
I wasn't thinking.

378
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,249
It must've been dry
and stuffy until now.

379
00:37:05,569 --> 00:37:09,009
If you quit here and get married,

380
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:10,379
what will I do?

381
00:37:11,009 --> 00:37:12,579
How can I get married?

382
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:14,349
Why can't you?

383
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:17,849
Bastards like Seo Jin-seop did.

384
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:20,789
Oh.

385
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:24,559
The photos of Writer Lee
that you gave me.

386
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:27,759
I sent them to her.

387
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:31,599
Did your conversation not go well?

388
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,399
It wasn't a matter of going well or not.

389
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:34,799
It's all over.

390
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:36,999
But

391
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:41,459
Her "holier than thou" act
struck a nerve,

392
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:43,719
so I sent them.

393
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:48,379
She should see the reality

394
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:50,829
and wake up.

395
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:55,299
She told me she prays every day

396
00:37:55,699 --> 00:37:56,819
for me to die.

397
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,989
What are you thinking about?

398
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:10,559
Oh, no,

399
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:13,589
I'm not thinking about anything.

400
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:16,219
Remember

401
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:19,479
when I suggested we die together?

402
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:23,799
Yes, I do.

403
00:38:24,149 --> 00:38:27,989
Do you remember you said no?

404
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,109
Yes.

405
00:38:30,649 --> 00:38:32,089
You said your goal was

406
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:34,019
to live a long and mediocre life.

407
00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:37,489
Is that still your goal?

408
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:41,139
Yes.

409
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:44,669
I see.

410
00:38:46,729 --> 00:38:48,409
I'm kind of disappointed.

411
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:53,529
If you said you'd die with me,

412
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,609
it would've been great.

413
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,079
You should...

414
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,249
live with me.

415
00:39:05,499 --> 00:39:07,499
Live a long and mediocre life.

416
00:39:20,899 --> 00:39:22,219
Oh, my!

417
00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:26,179
Why is it raining all of a sudden?

418
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:27,349
It's raining?

419
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:28,139
Yes.

420
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:31,579
First it was a drop,
and then it's suddenly pouring.

421
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,059
You should've bought
an umbrella on the way back.

422
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:35,919
Hey.

423
00:39:36,049 --> 00:39:38,809
I could buy more soju with that money.

424
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:39,989
Look at you.

425
00:39:39,989 --> 00:39:41,339
Jeez. You'll catch a cold.

426
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:43,019
Where are the towels?

427
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:45,299
There aren't any here.

428
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:46,499
No?

429
00:39:46,899 --> 00:39:47,799
Hey.

430
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:50,599
Why are you over-reacting
all of a sudden?

431
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:53,179
You didn't bat an eye even when

432
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:54,619
I got hit by hail.

433
00:39:54,649 --> 00:39:56,579
When did we have hail?

434
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,599
I'm just saying.

435
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:09,159
What?

436
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,159
Huh? What?

437
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,019
Why are you looking at me like that?

438
00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:14,069
Huh?

439
00:40:15,509 --> 00:40:18,709
Since I'm soaking wet,

440
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:22,239
do I look sexy and all?

441
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:29,779
No?

442
00:40:29,779 --> 00:40:33,069
Oh, no, that's not it. I was thinking...

443
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:34,099
Yeah?

444
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:37,789
...that's how I treated you, huh?

445
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:41,519
I never got you an umbrella
when it was raining.

446
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,539
When we've been
living together for 6 months.

447
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:45,959
What?

448
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:48,739
It didn't rain that much
during that time.

449
00:40:48,919 --> 00:40:50,609
And I have a lot of umbrellas.

450
00:40:50,609 --> 00:40:53,139
Some, you can fold. Others, you can't.

451
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:58,299
What? Did you do all that for Ji-yeon?

452
00:40:59,609 --> 00:41:02,379
The glasses are inside?
I'll go get them.

453
00:41:02,709 --> 00:41:04,229
You did, huh?

454
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:08,579
And you still got dumped like a fool?

455
00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:18,049
That's not all there is in a marriage.

456
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:20,159
Hmph. Then what is marriage?

457
00:41:24,509 --> 00:41:25,789
What is it?

458
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:30,759
Living with one person continuously.

459
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:33,559
But...

460
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:36,639
Some people find that stifling.

461
00:41:38,049 --> 00:41:40,379
But isn't that why you get married?

462
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:42,339
Because you want to
be with them forever?

463
00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:43,379
Right.

464
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:44,759
But...

465
00:41:45,759 --> 00:41:47,439
Having been married,

466
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:49,999
I realized I didn't truly know.

467
00:41:50,399 --> 00:41:52,859
What it meant to live with one person

468
00:41:54,339 --> 00:41:56,069
for the rest of your life.

469
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:12,339
That's it?

470
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:15,999
That's it.

471
00:42:20,589 --> 00:42:21,949
Goodness!

472
00:42:22,529 --> 00:42:24,469
What brings you here at this hour?

473
00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:26,229
You have an umbrella, right?

474
00:42:26,229 --> 00:42:27,589
Can I borrow one?

475
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,099
Get an umbrella from under there.

476
00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:32,709
And a pill to calm down.

477
00:42:32,729 --> 00:42:34,099
That's why I'm here.

478
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:35,719
- A pill to calm down?
- Yes.

479
00:42:36,669 --> 00:42:38,279
- Hold on.
- This is bad.

480
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,749
What should I do?

481
00:42:40,869 --> 00:42:41,869
This is bad.

482
00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:47,829
Can you

483
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:50,289
take me somewhere

484
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:52,619
in your car?

485
00:42:52,649 --> 00:42:53,819
- Huh?
- Car?

486
00:42:55,099 --> 00:42:57,869
My daughter-in-law won't pick up.

487
00:42:59,069 --> 00:43:02,359
My bastard son must've
turned off his phone.

488
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:05,979
The dial signal goes, then stops.

489
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:07,329
Oh, okay.

490
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:09,099
- Hey, go home and get your car.
- Okay.

491
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:10,099
Ma'am!

492
00:43:10,189 --> 00:43:11,269
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

493
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:12,579
- Sit here.
- Okay.

494
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:15,129
Calm down and tell me.

495
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:17,579
What's going on?

496
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:18,899
Oh, well.

497
00:43:20,169 --> 00:43:23,909
Someone called me
at home on the landline.

498
00:43:23,909 --> 00:43:25,809
- Landline?
- Yes, the landline.

499
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:28,869
I went home after going
to my son's place.

500
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:32,619
When I got in,
the phone rang in a million years.

501
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:34,089
Yikes!

502
00:43:34,659 --> 00:43:35,659
Oh, my.

503
00:43:36,099 --> 00:43:37,099
Who is it?

504
00:43:38,569 --> 00:43:39,889
- My son.
- Your son?

505
00:43:39,889 --> 00:43:41,169
He must be home.

506
00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:44,549
I don't think so.

507
00:43:44,799 --> 00:43:45,919
Is that you, Jeong-su?

508
00:43:45,919 --> 00:43:47,679
<i>Yes, Mom. What is it?</i>

509
00:43:48,279 --> 00:43:50,309
Why didn't you pick up?

510
00:43:50,329 --> 00:43:51,009
Huh?

511
00:43:51,009 --> 00:43:52,809
I called you so many times.

512
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,579
Someone called me
at home on the landline.

513
00:44:14,979 --> 00:44:23,159
<i>(Lottery Store)</i>

514
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:26,619
Sir?

515
00:44:27,009 --> 00:44:28,149
Sir, you can't go out!

516
00:44:28,149 --> 00:44:29,419
Grab him.

517
00:44:29,469 --> 00:44:31,379
Sir, please sit down.

518
00:44:32,749 --> 00:44:34,429
It's okay. Sit down here.

519
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:42,359
Who is he? Why's he here?

520
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:45,969
He came in drenched,
asking about a payphone.

521
00:44:45,969 --> 00:44:47,649
So I let him use my cell.

522
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:52,599
I think his mind has started to go.

523
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:56,769
Gosh...

524
00:45:06,699 --> 00:45:08,389
After graduate school,

525
00:45:08,389 --> 00:45:10,479
I finally landed a job.

526
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:13,669
But I was sick the whole
3 years I worked there.

527
00:45:14,999 --> 00:45:19,009
In the end,
I called my dad to tell him I quit.

528
00:45:20,689 --> 00:45:23,429
He didn't say anything for a long time.

529
00:45:25,149 --> 00:45:26,669
Then, nonchalantly,

530
00:45:28,829 --> 00:45:31,229
he said, "It's okay, Bu-jeong."

531
00:45:33,669 --> 00:45:35,399
I thought he'd worry less

532
00:45:35,759 --> 00:45:38,699
if I bought a place in Seoul.

533
00:45:39,689 --> 00:45:42,639
So I pushed myself hard
and bought the studio.

534
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:45,339
For over an hour, he thoroughly

535
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:48,589
observed that small place,

536
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:52,329
then once again, nonchalantly,

537
00:45:53,799 --> 00:45:54,989
he said,

538
00:45:56,299 --> 00:45:57,679
"It's pretty."

539
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:03,719
It's pretty...

540
00:46:05,089 --> 00:46:06,759
To my dad,

541
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:10,439
"okay" means he's worried

542
00:46:11,549 --> 00:46:13,819
and "pretty" means he's concerned.

543
00:46:39,799 --> 00:46:40,799
Father?

544
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:43,799
Father!

545
00:46:53,009 --> 00:46:55,779
Why are you so wet?

546
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,049
Father.

547
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:28,459
How did you get here?

548
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:30,279
He told me

549
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:32,179
he walked.

550
00:47:37,919 --> 00:47:38,939
Father...

551
00:47:53,739 --> 00:47:56,759
Why buy me these?
I have nowhere to wear them.

552
00:47:57,049 --> 00:47:59,909
Father, wear them
when something good happens.

553
00:48:01,939 --> 00:48:02,859
Father.

554
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:05,259
Let's go home, huh?

555
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:10,499
Bu-jeong is waiting.

556
00:48:13,669 --> 00:48:15,509
- Bu-jeong?
- Yes, let's go home.

557
00:48:18,209 --> 00:48:19,209
Okay.

558
00:48:20,399 --> 00:48:21,759
I'll help you up.

559
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:31,159
The towel...

560
00:48:31,339 --> 00:48:32,379
Just take it.

561
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,229
Thank you.

562
00:48:33,229 --> 00:48:35,719
I'll come back later
and thank you properly.

563
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:36,539
Thank you.

564
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:38,509
- Your father is leaving.
- Thank you!

565
00:48:39,309 --> 00:48:40,309
Father!

566
00:48:47,859 --> 00:48:50,699
Father, let's take a cab.

567
00:48:50,909 --> 00:48:52,589
It won't cost that much.

568
00:48:53,149 --> 00:48:55,119
We can't walk home.

569
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,509
You walked more than 10km.

570
00:49:11,299 --> 00:49:13,449
Oh, right!

571
00:49:14,769 --> 00:49:15,769
Jeong-su.

572
00:49:17,739 --> 00:49:18,739
So...

573
00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:21,439
Yes, that's right. I'm Jeong-su.

574
00:49:21,749 --> 00:49:23,269
Jeong-su. Jeong-su.

575
00:49:23,379 --> 00:49:25,459
Yes, I'm Jeong-su, Father.

576
00:49:26,469 --> 00:49:27,629
I'm Jeong-su.

577
00:49:27,989 --> 00:49:28,989
Jeong-su.

578
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:52,049
<i>If you see my text, call me.
It's urgent.</i>

579
00:49:54,049 --> 00:49:55,259
<i>My dad?</i>

580
00:49:58,479 --> 00:50:01,169
<i>He has everything in his heart.</i>

581
00:50:01,949 --> 00:50:05,759
<i>Law, philosophy, literature...</i>

582
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,719
<i>They're all in his heart.</i>

583
00:50:08,669 --> 00:50:11,669
<i>No one taught him. He didn't learn them.</i>

584
00:50:13,939 --> 00:50:16,669
<i>But they accumulated over time.</i>

585
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:23,789
<i>My dad is a one and only book of poems.</i>

586
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:25,589
Father!

587
00:50:27,189 --> 00:50:28,189
Father!

588
00:50:32,419 --> 00:50:33,419
Father!

589
00:50:36,329 --> 00:50:37,809
Father, wake up!

590
00:50:37,809 --> 00:50:39,569
<i>To Dad,</i>

591
00:50:40,129 --> 00:50:41,769
<i>in his heart,</i>

592
00:50:42,269 --> 00:50:45,349
<i>there are a lot more thoughts
than spoken words.</i>

593
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:48,589
Excuse me, can you call an ambulance?

594
00:50:51,989 --> 00:50:53,859
Father, wake up!

595
00:50:53,969 --> 00:50:57,539
<i>He mulls over numerous thoughts.</i>

596
00:50:57,539 --> 00:50:58,329
Father!

597
00:50:58,329 --> 00:51:00,459
Sir, are you okay? Do something!

598
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:04,319
- <i>Then chooses a few and voices them out.</i>
- Father! Father!

599
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:09,009
I think he's unconscious.

600
00:51:35,479 --> 00:51:38,049
Wait here for a sec.
I'll go get an umbrella.

601
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:39,199
Let's go home.

602
00:51:40,819 --> 00:51:41,939
Take the call!

603
00:51:59,539 --> 00:52:02,339
<i>Where are you?
I called you so many times.</i>

604
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:03,409
Oh.

605
00:52:03,749 --> 00:52:05,819
Things were hectic
so I couldn't pick up.

606
00:52:05,819 --> 00:52:07,239
What is it?

607
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,799
It's 5,000 won.

608
00:52:20,959 --> 00:52:22,939
- You're all set.
- Thanks.

609
00:52:28,489 --> 00:52:29,509
<i>(Ms. Lee Bu-jeong)</i>

610
00:52:30,649 --> 00:52:32,909
<i>(Something urgent came up
so I had to leave.)</i>

611
00:52:35,809 --> 00:52:36,709
Excuse me.

612
00:52:36,729 --> 00:52:37,509
May I?

613
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,529
I'm sorry.

614
00:53:10,009 --> 00:53:13,029
<i>(Emergency Room)</i>

615
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:14,519
Oh, no!

616
00:53:14,819 --> 00:53:15,819
Mom.

617
00:53:15,989 --> 00:53:18,489
How... how is he doing? Huh?

618
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:20,139
What do you mean?

619
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:21,419
He's doing well.

620
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:22,989
How's the situation inside?

621
00:53:22,989 --> 00:53:24,719
He doesn't have a bed yet,

622
00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:26,379
but he'll get one soon.

623
00:53:48,339 --> 00:53:49,219
Oh, right.

624
00:53:49,419 --> 00:53:52,709
The landlady said
he called the landline.

625
00:53:52,709 --> 00:53:53,519
Yeah.

626
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:55,899
He remembered

627
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,759
only that phone number.

628
00:53:59,179 --> 00:54:01,779
But he never actually called it before.

629
00:54:02,569 --> 00:54:05,289
So if he had forgotten
that number as well,

630
00:54:05,289 --> 00:54:07,419
they would never have found him.

631
00:54:08,309 --> 00:54:09,309
Jeez.

632
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:12,689
It's sad

633
00:54:13,289 --> 00:54:16,129
that he only remembers that number.

634
00:54:17,569 --> 00:54:18,569
Why?

635
00:54:19,749 --> 00:54:22,919
It means whenever
he missed his daughter,

636
00:54:23,369 --> 00:54:25,169
he kept pressing that number.

637
00:54:25,169 --> 00:54:27,099
But since it's his in-law's house,

638
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:28,959
he couldn't call.

639
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:39,829
I miss my mom.

640
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:44,949
Me, too.

641
00:54:55,319 --> 00:54:56,319
Hey.

642
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:58,519
Why are you outside?

643
00:54:58,539 --> 00:55:00,259
Oh, he's stable now.

644
00:55:00,929 --> 00:55:03,469
I took turns with Mom.

645
00:55:04,729 --> 00:55:07,739
What were you doing?
You couldn't even pick up?

646
00:55:07,879 --> 00:55:09,569
You should've answered your phone!

647
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,269
Well...

648
00:55:13,949 --> 00:55:16,329
The conversation got longer.

649
00:55:18,529 --> 00:55:20,209
Did you have a drink?

650
00:55:23,499 --> 00:55:24,699
What about Dad?

651
00:55:28,919 --> 00:55:30,989
He was in a bad state at first.

652
00:55:31,759 --> 00:55:33,869
He's conscious now, but...

653
00:55:34,919 --> 00:55:37,219
He has acute pneumonia.

654
00:55:38,499 --> 00:55:40,749
It could lead to sepsis.

655
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:49,189
You're his daughter.

656
00:55:49,189 --> 00:55:50,639
What were you doing when

657
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:52,109
your father was in that state?

658
00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:53,339
You don't even answer your phone!

659
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:55,059
Stop that, Mom.

660
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,359
She's the one that's most upset.

661
00:55:57,849 --> 00:55:59,839
How's Father?

662
00:56:02,189 --> 00:56:03,789
He wakes up for a minute,

663
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:07,029
worries about the bill,
and goes back to sleep.

664
00:56:08,109 --> 00:56:09,439
Give me the pass.

665
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:13,449
I'm so upset.

666
00:56:13,549 --> 00:56:14,549
Go inside.

667
00:56:19,449 --> 00:56:21,219
Your father knows everything.

668
00:56:22,659 --> 00:56:24,239
What's wrong with you?

669
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:26,449
I said your father knows everything!

670
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:28,499
Stop saying that.

671
00:56:29,949 --> 00:56:31,139
Seriously.

672
00:56:33,509 --> 00:56:34,509
Go inside.

673
00:56:34,679 --> 00:56:36,129
Don't mind her.

674
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:01,599
Dad...

675
00:57:06,529 --> 00:57:08,189
I'm here.

676
00:57:10,899 --> 00:57:12,999
Bu-jeong is here, Dad.

677
00:57:18,479 --> 00:57:19,679
Can you see me?

678
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:22,939
Yes.

679
00:57:26,169 --> 00:57:27,169
Who am I?

680
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:31,239
Bu-jeong, of course.

681
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,499
That's right. I'm Bu-jeong.

682
00:57:37,529 --> 00:57:39,379
Did you go somewhere?

683
00:57:41,259 --> 00:57:43,269
Yes. I went somewhere.

684
00:57:45,409 --> 00:57:46,609
I'm sorry, Dad.

685
00:57:48,499 --> 00:57:49,939
You got rained on?

686
00:57:52,049 --> 00:57:53,049
Yes.

687
00:57:54,029 --> 00:57:56,259
Don't go around like that.

688
00:57:58,919 --> 00:58:02,099
It's no picnic if you catch a cold.

689
00:58:02,969 --> 00:58:03,969
Okay.

690
00:58:06,589 --> 00:58:07,369
I...

691
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:10,609
I think I'm okay now.

692
00:58:13,649 --> 00:58:15,679
Can I go home?

693
00:58:21,709 --> 00:58:23,379
I'm so sleepy.

694
00:58:25,829 --> 00:58:28,729
I fell asleep in front of
your mother-in-law.

695
00:58:47,549 --> 00:58:49,679
His immunity has grown weak.

696
00:58:49,989 --> 00:58:51,619
But his fever has gone down.

697
00:58:51,619 --> 00:58:53,299
So we'll watch him for a bit more.

698
00:58:53,389 --> 00:58:54,669
Okay. Thank you.

699
00:58:55,459 --> 00:58:56,699
Thank you.

700
00:59:16,669 --> 00:59:17,669
Don't worry.

701
00:59:18,929 --> 00:59:21,419
Father won't be able
to leave his daughter.

702
00:59:23,999 --> 00:59:26,329
His fever has gone down.

703
00:59:27,029 --> 00:59:28,709
So let's wait and see.

704
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:32,489
Stop crying.

705
00:59:32,749 --> 00:59:34,429
You'll wear yourself out.

706
00:59:36,789 --> 00:59:38,469
Father will get back up.

707
01:00:04,179 --> 01:00:06,069
Change your clothes before you sleep.

708
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:07,669
You'll catch a cold.

709
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:09,469
Even if you're young.

710
01:00:10,699 --> 01:00:11,699
Okay.

711
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,959
Is this really for me?

712
01:00:19,329 --> 01:00:20,329
Yes.

713
01:00:20,679 --> 01:00:23,679
What's with the beer
instead of the usual milk?

714
01:00:27,569 --> 01:00:28,569
No reason.

715
01:01:02,679 --> 01:01:03,679
Mom.

716
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:06,079
What?

717
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:08,459
Have you ever

718
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,679
woken up from a dream?

719
01:01:13,889 --> 01:01:15,269
Well, I...

720
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,839
I don't dream that much.

721
01:01:19,919 --> 01:01:21,929
Not that kind of dream.

722
01:01:25,489 --> 01:01:27,209
Someone told me

723
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:32,719
that living without a dream
is not living at all.

724
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:36,969
The wording wasn't like this.

725
01:01:37,349 --> 01:01:40,009
But I changed it
so you could understand.

726
01:01:40,009 --> 01:01:40,629
Hmph.

727
01:01:41,449 --> 01:01:42,999
What was the original wording?

728
01:01:43,189 --> 01:01:44,519
Originally, it was

729
01:01:48,249 --> 01:01:50,399
"Life without an illusion

730
01:01:50,399 --> 01:01:52,199
is closer to death."

731
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,619
You don't know what that means, huh?

732
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,139
I don't.

733
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:06,779
But I know what the illusion is.

734
01:02:12,289 --> 01:02:13,289
What is it?

735
01:02:14,859 --> 01:02:15,859
You.

736
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:22,989
Yuck. I should burn my ears.

737
01:02:24,229 --> 01:02:26,709
I have to burn my ears.

738
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:28,359
Jeez.

739
01:02:28,909 --> 01:02:31,639
You sounded like
an old man with that saying.

740
01:02:31,669 --> 01:02:33,799
Where do you think? From you.

741
01:02:43,979 --> 01:02:44,979
Mom.

742
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:47,069
What?

743
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:50,549
You don't have to send me money anymore.

744
01:02:54,219 --> 01:02:55,219
Why not?

745
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:58,189
No reason. I just say so.

746
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:05,719
Okay.

747
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:08,799
Thanks.

748
01:03:10,039 --> 01:03:13,679
You could at least pretend to refuse.

749
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:17,239
Why would I do that?

750
01:03:17,489 --> 01:03:19,169
It's a gift from my son.

751
01:03:21,419 --> 01:03:22,129
Jeez.

752
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:23,319
Good for you.

753
01:03:23,319 --> 01:03:25,759
Don't expect to get
an allowance from me.

754
01:03:26,209 --> 01:03:28,049
I don't. Just take care of yourself.

755
01:03:28,049 --> 01:03:29,449
I am.

756
01:03:34,819 --> 01:03:37,329
I can still come and
sleep over sometimes, right?

757
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:39,909
Of course.

758
01:03:41,479 --> 01:03:42,919
You can come every day.

759
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:46,729
Why would I come every day?

760
01:03:49,249 --> 01:03:50,969
<i>(Ms. Lee Bu-jeong)</i>

761
01:03:52,199 --> 01:03:54,459
<i>(Okay. Be safe. Call me later.)</i>

762
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:26,269
Gang Min-jeong!

763
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:29,079
Yes!

764
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:48,219
Whoa, you're like

765
01:04:48,219 --> 01:04:49,769
Frankenstein or something.

766
01:04:49,939 --> 01:04:51,169
You're like a nightmare.

767
01:04:51,259 --> 01:04:52,459
Potatoes again?

768
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:55,639
You can't cook them that well,

769
01:04:55,639 --> 01:04:57,729
but you keep making this.

770
01:04:58,449 --> 01:04:59,759
Don't eat it then.

771
01:05:00,009 --> 01:05:00,929
Soon-gyu,

772
01:05:01,089 --> 01:05:03,819
today is an important day for me.

773
01:05:04,379 --> 01:05:07,119
So say only good things to me.

774
01:05:07,369 --> 01:05:09,019
Why is it an important day?

775
01:05:09,019 --> 01:05:10,589
I have my reasons.

776
01:05:11,799 --> 01:05:14,609
Why's he in a good mood
these days? Creepy.

777
01:05:14,609 --> 01:05:15,369
Hi.

778
01:05:17,949 --> 01:05:18,929
Potatoes again?

779
01:05:18,929 --> 01:05:20,449
Yeah! Potatoes again!

780
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:21,729
Potatoes again! So what?

781
01:05:21,999 --> 01:05:24,659
Whoa, why are you getting mad?

782
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:26,429
I was just asking.

783
01:05:28,189 --> 01:05:29,869
You ungrateful bastards.

784
01:05:30,369 --> 01:05:31,329
Don't eat it!

785
01:05:31,729 --> 01:05:33,929
I'll feed you.
Why are you refusing my help?

786
01:05:34,729 --> 01:05:36,329
There's no need.

787
01:05:36,689 --> 01:05:38,119
I have to move to get well.

788
01:06:21,739 --> 01:06:22,739
Dad.

789
01:06:24,509 --> 01:06:25,509
What?

790
01:06:27,069 --> 01:06:28,069
Dad...

791
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:31,439
There you go again.

792
01:06:32,769 --> 01:06:34,969
I'm not going anywhere. I'm here.

793
01:06:37,939 --> 01:06:40,249
You only have me.

794
01:06:42,209 --> 01:06:43,699
But I'm so lacking,

795
01:06:44,279 --> 01:06:46,129
not giving you a grandkid

796
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:47,959
when you love babies.

797
01:06:48,649 --> 01:06:50,359
Stop your nonsense.

798
01:06:52,029 --> 01:06:53,809
I don't like babies.

799
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:55,119
Liar.

800
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:56,219
Have you ever

801
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:00,379
seen me hold a child?

802
01:07:00,609 --> 01:07:03,329
You don't because
you're being extra careful.

803
01:07:04,779 --> 01:07:07,379
You'd have loved your grandkid so much.

804
01:07:07,669 --> 01:07:09,739
Were you upset because of that?

805
01:07:09,969 --> 01:07:11,489
Of course I was.

806
01:07:11,869 --> 01:07:13,699
Since you were upset.

807
01:07:20,679 --> 01:07:22,649
I'm not just saying this.

808
01:07:23,709 --> 01:07:27,399
but when I see babies on the street,

809
01:07:28,899 --> 01:07:31,359
I don't feel the need for a grandkid.

810
01:07:31,609 --> 01:07:33,209
I'm reminded of you.

811
01:07:34,449 --> 01:07:36,189
How pretty you were.

812
01:07:36,909 --> 01:07:37,909
Me?

813
01:07:37,949 --> 01:07:38,949
Yes.

814
01:07:39,719 --> 01:07:41,319
When you were young,

815
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:46,859
I left you by yourself so much

816
01:07:47,769 --> 01:07:48,949
that whenever you saw me,

817
01:07:48,949 --> 01:07:50,819
you wanted a piggyback ride.

818
01:07:53,149 --> 01:07:56,739
I also went everywhere to find someone

819
01:07:57,659 --> 01:07:58,979
to look after you.

820
01:08:14,849 --> 01:08:17,319
Leave it up. Why shut it?

821
01:08:17,569 --> 01:08:19,099
But you're going to sleep.

822
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:20,779
Pull it up. It's stuffy.

823
01:08:23,609 --> 01:08:26,619
I'm going home for a bit.
Do you need anything?

824
01:08:27,009 --> 01:08:28,009
No.

825
01:08:29,149 --> 01:08:30,149
Oh!

826
01:08:30,609 --> 01:08:34,559
You know the blue kimchi
container in the fridge?

827
01:08:35,239 --> 01:08:37,659
I put my bankbook and

828
01:08:37,949 --> 01:08:39,639
some money in there.

829
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:43,099
The PIN number is your birthday.

830
01:08:43,949 --> 01:08:46,619
I'm paying with a credit card.
I don't need that.

831
01:08:46,619 --> 01:08:49,119
Just know they're there.

832
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:52,979
Let me know again when we go home.

833
01:08:52,979 --> 01:08:54,279
Okay.

834
01:08:54,559 --> 01:08:56,389
- I won't be long.
- Okay.

835
01:08:58,659 --> 01:08:59,659
What?

836
01:09:00,639 --> 01:09:02,009
You're pretty.

837
01:09:03,909 --> 01:09:04,909
Pretty.

838
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:08,929
I'll be right back.

839
01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:18,309
- Bye!
- Bye.

840
01:09:38,539 --> 01:09:41,069
<i>I don't remember why,</i>

841
01:09:42,419 --> 01:09:44,949
<i>but I didn't have a job for some time,</i>

842
01:09:44,949 --> 01:09:46,789
<i>so there was no money.</i>

843
01:09:48,049 --> 01:09:50,549
I carried you on my back, trying to find

844
01:09:50,549 --> 01:09:51,829
someone who'll care for you for a while.

845
01:09:52,749 --> 01:09:55,189
What? But I'm your daughter.

846
01:09:55,259 --> 01:09:56,779
Well, that happened.

847
01:09:57,779 --> 01:09:59,459
Times were tough.

848
01:10:01,699 --> 01:10:04,169
I even thought of leaving you

849
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:07,159
with someone and killing myself.

850
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:11,719
But then,

851
01:10:12,569 --> 01:10:17,069
you woke up at the smell of bread.

852
01:10:33,939 --> 01:10:37,259
<i>I thought, 'Oh, no.</i>

853
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:39,469
<i>I should put you to sleep fast.'</i>

854
01:10:40,539 --> 01:10:41,489
But

855
01:10:44,559 --> 01:10:47,669
you stroke my ear

856
01:10:48,559 --> 01:10:52,019
like this and said,

857
01:10:53,419 --> 01:10:54,419
"Dad...

858
01:10:56,429 --> 01:10:58,359
When you earn a lot of money,

859
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:01,099
you'll buy me that, right?"

860
01:11:24,419 --> 01:11:26,279
<i>You were only three.</i>

861
01:11:27,669 --> 01:11:29,929
But you knew I was bad-off

862
01:11:29,929 --> 01:11:31,299
and didn't whine.

863
01:11:33,549 --> 01:11:34,679
Even though

864
01:11:35,779 --> 01:11:37,819
you wanted to eat it

865
01:11:37,819 --> 01:11:39,219
because it smelled so good.

866
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:52,629
<i>I couldn't kill myself
and leave you alone.</i>

867
01:12:01,979 --> 01:12:04,249
You're precious to me.

868
01:12:15,319 --> 01:12:18,319
<i>Dad, when you earn a lot of money,</i>

869
01:12:18,319 --> 01:12:21,069
<i>you'll buy me that, right?</i>

870
01:13:31,899 --> 01:13:34,869
<i>(Lost)</i>

871
01:13:35,859 --> 01:13:38,889
<i>Did... something happen
to the man living here?</i>

872
01:13:40,289 --> 01:13:42,969
<i>I thought you were a scammer,
but you're a thief.</i>

873
01:13:42,979 --> 01:13:45,859
<i>Even if you grill me, you should know</i>

874
01:13:46,169 --> 01:13:48,739
<i>it's over between you two.</i>

875
01:13:48,939 --> 01:13:50,819
<i>She has the photos.</i>

876
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:53,919
<i>You and Gang-jae are two of a kind.</i>

877
01:13:56,709 --> 01:13:58,899
<i>Want to know a secret?</i>

878
01:13:59,839 --> 01:14:00,919
<i>I...</i>

879
01:14:01,879 --> 01:14:04,229
<i>I think I like someone.</i>

880
01:14:04,779 --> 01:14:06,259
<i>What should we do?</i>

881
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,889
<i>Did you tell him?</i>

882
01:14:09,729 --> 01:14:12,469
<i>I'm sorry, but can we turn back?</i>

883
01:14:12,539 --> 01:14:14,929
<i>Even if you wait,
she won't call, Gang-jae.</i>

884
01:14:15,079 --> 01:14:16,959
<i>She's married.</i>

885
01:14:17,737 --> 01:14:21,541
