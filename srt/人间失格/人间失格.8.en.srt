I'm having a drink in a million years.

10
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:53,599
Because I'm so upset about my son.

<i>I think</i>

12
00:01:56,769 --> 00:01:58,599
I raised him wrong.

13
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:02,239
He treats me worse than dog poo.

14
00:02:02,309 --> 00:02:03,969
Bastard.

15
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:05,139
Oh, my.

16
00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:08,609
You're being modest.

17
00:02:08,609 --> 00:02:10,849
Jeong-su is...

18
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:13,419
He's one of a kind.

19
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:15,589
Even today...

20
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,189
Are you at home?

21
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:23,029
<i>Are you drinking alone?</i>

22
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:25,829
Yes, I'm drinking alone.

23
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,769
I drink alone.

24
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:31,799
I eat alone.

25
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:34,909
You know that

26
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:42,609
I was against him
marrying Bu-jeong at first.

27
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:45,179
<i>But...</i>

28
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,219
<i>I allowed it because of you.</i>

29
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:54,159
Bu-jeong was so sweet to you.

30
00:02:54,429 --> 00:02:57,689
It was so good to see that.

31
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,929
<i>I thought she was a sweet girl.</i>

32
00:03:00,929 --> 00:03:03,929

<i>I thought if she lived with my Jeong-su,</i>

34
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:12,909
he wouldn't be lonely.

35
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:15,849
That's why I allowed it.

36
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:19,019
I was so envious

37
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:23,119
of your relationship with your daughter.

38
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:45,139
For the patient,

39
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,949
it's best to make your choice now.

because she's worried.

00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:21,739
Ma'am, can I borrow this?

47
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:22,639
Yes.

48
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,239
Thank you.

49
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:31,479
You know what?

50
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:34,649
Before I called you,

51
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:36,619
I called my mom.

52
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:40,259
Because she's my mom.

53
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,589
You know what the first thing
she said was?

54
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,969
How should I know?

55
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:50,569
Yeah.

56
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:55,039
You'd never guess what she said.

57
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:58,539
Why? What did she say?

58
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:04,779
"How can your husband

59
00:06:05,049 --> 00:06:07,719
do this to me on a day like this?"

60
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:13,459
Because today is my mother's birthday.

61
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:18,099
Shocking, right?

62
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:22,669
But what she said next
was even more shocking.

63
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:26,569
"You wench."

64
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:31,239
"Steel yourself this time."

65
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:38,949
You don't know what that means, right?

66
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:45,919
When you're hospitalized,
you sign an agreement.

67
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,229
A life support care refusal agreement.

68
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:56,029
When cardiac arrest
like earlier happens,

69
00:06:56,669 --> 00:06:59,469
it means I agree not to ask

70
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,639
for a resuscitation.

71
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,809
I signed that three times already.

72
00:07:08,049 --> 00:07:10,279
First, when he was
admitted to the hospital.

73
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:15,119
Second, around this time last year.

74
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:18,619
And today.

75
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:24,959
I signed it just now.

76
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:31,329
When I came,

77
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:34,569
like my mom said,

78
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:38,179
I steeled myself.

79
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:43,149
If that happened

80
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:50,519
while I'm not there,

81
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:53,459
then

82
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:56,829
I'd ask them to do

83
00:07:57,689 --> 00:07:59,849
what it says on the form.

84
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:05,359
But he's right before my eyes.

85
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:07,839
He's right before me.

86
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:11,469
So I have to beg them to save him.

87
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:51,209
For people who come now and then,

88
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,919
it seems he's just
lying in bed, sleeping.

89
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:57,119
But if you see him every day,

90
00:08:57,349 --> 00:08:59,289
if you're with him every day,

91
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:04,799
every moment is different.

92
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,629
He smiles when something's funny.

93
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:10,369
He cries when he's sad.

94
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:15,939
The last few days, he smiled a lot.

95
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:25,449
So I asked them to
resuscitate him again.

96
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,359
Jeong-su.

97
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:36,829
What should I tell my mom?

98
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:40,719
What time is it?

99
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:46,959
Past ten, right?

100
00:10:49,099 --> 00:10:50,099
Yes.

101
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:01,309
I have to be on the set at four.

102
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:03,279
But I can't sleep at home.

103
00:11:08,989 --> 00:11:10,149
Sit.

104
00:11:11,489 --> 00:11:13,159
Is it busy outside?

105
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,189
No.

106
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:19,129
Things are going slow.

107
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:25,499
Are you

108
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:27,169
seeing someone nowadays?

109
00:11:28,609 --> 00:11:29,709
Me?

110
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:32,539
No.

111
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:35,579
Okay.

112
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:38,849
Why?

113
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,279
Nothing.

114
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:44,719
You just have a different vibe.

115
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,429
Except for paying more taxes,

116
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:50,829
nothing has changed with me.

117
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:56,369
Your comments smell of money now.

118
00:11:58,469 --> 00:11:59,839
Be careful.

119
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:03,439
If you suddenly become rich,
people start hating.

120
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:05,809
I'll be careful.

121
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:17,919
You know

122
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:20,439
the account last time.

123
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:25,729
The one that posted the story about

124
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,369
my secret kid on
my 10th wedding anniversary.

125
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:33,539
That account

126
00:12:34,469 --> 00:12:35,809
disappeared.

127
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:37,439
Oh.

128
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:39,279
Yes.

129
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:42,149
Did you remove it?

130
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:44,879
Yes.

131
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:47,519
You don't know who it is?

132
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:50,619
All I did was remove it.

133
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,459
So I don't know who it is.

134
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:56,959
Okay.

135
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,129
I can't report it because it's true.

136
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:09,239
Was it you?

137
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:22,719
The only people who know about it

138
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:25,189
are you, me,

139
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:27,359
Mr. Seo

140
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:30,829
and Writer Lee.

141
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:34,759
It can't be Mr. Seo.

142
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:38,129
Even though he's out of control,

143
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,999
he's his father.

144
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:52,649
It wasn't me.

145
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:00,189
Then it was her.

146
00:14:10,729 --> 00:14:13,239
I wonder what will be
posted the next morning.

147
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:16,269
There might be a post saying

148
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:19,639
"woke" Jeong Ah-ran
has a kid in Canada who

149
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:22,309
hasn't seen his mother in 20 years.

150
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:24,379
That's absurd.

151
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:28,649
I'm scared to even look up my name.

152
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:32,189
So this is "shield lift."

153
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:35,459
Your closest person
stabbing you in the back.

154
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:40,629
Don't Google your name.

155
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:44,399
You just get upset.

156
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,929
There are good posts, too.

157
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:49,709
I just don't know
if they mean it or not.

158
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:51,609
How can I not look?

159
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:53,109
I'm curious to death.

160
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:56,739
What are you so curious about?

161
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:01,279
About what people think about me.

162
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:05,119
When I find a nasty comment,

163
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:08,859
I go to their friend's
friend account and look.

164
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:10,229
To see what kind of person they are,

165
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:12,899
what they eat, how they live...

166
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:14,099
Why?

167
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:16,999
No reason.

168
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:20,969
I just want to know
if they're better than me.

169
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:28,309
But they're all the same.

170
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:32,919
They're the same as me.

171
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:38,889
Maybe it's hate against
the same kind of people.

172
00:15:57,369 --> 00:15:58,239
You know.

173
00:15:58,239 --> 00:15:59,239
Yeah?

174
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:01,809
What if a post really does come up?

175
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,109
About what?

176
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:04,779
About Canada...

177
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:08,349
My son?

178
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:12,219
Yes.

179
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:15,229
Will you admit it?

180
00:16:17,229 --> 00:16:19,329
I'll kill Writer Lee.

181
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:21,329
Through you.

182
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:34,809
I'll drive you home.

183
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:37,009
Okay.

184
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:38,719

192
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,769
You got up earlier than I thought.

193
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:32,199
I thought you were in a deep sleep.

194
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:33,569
So I came out first.

195
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:42,449
If I had known...

196
00:17:42,449 --> 00:17:45,079
I don't want to talk about that here.

197
00:17:52,189 --> 00:17:53,289
Here?

198
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:55,789
The rooftop?

199
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:59,329
Or the building your father lives in?

200
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:07,599
Oh, okay.

201
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:09,769
I get what you're saying.

202
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:15,579
Setting boundaries is a good thing.

203
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:30,629
Want something to eat?

204
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:37,969
Want some milk?

205
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:39,369
Milk...

206
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:41,439
Do you not like milk?

207
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:43,509
But I only have milk.

208
00:19:02,629 --> 00:19:04,229
We were supposed to die together

209
00:19:04,229 --> 00:19:06,029
if we met by chance next time.

210
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,969
But we've met too quickly.

211
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,539
We can't die while drinking milk.

212
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:19,879
Do you usually speak so rashly?

213
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:22,609
What do you mean?

214
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:26,119
Things like, "Let's die together."

215
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:29,949
No.

216
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:34,259
Not at all.

217
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:37,429
Then why did you?

218
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:42,099
Well.

219
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:45,499
I don't know why I said that.

220
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:03,049
I can guess what kind of
instant noodles you got.

221
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:05,989
Instant noodles?

222
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:08,959
You always eat the same thing.

223
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:10,759
Korean beef instant noodles.

224
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:12,929
Huh?

225
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:15,599
Wow.

226
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:18,169
How did you know?

227
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,599
I just knew.

228
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:24,369
Wow.

229
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:29,149
It's good you have a favorite.

230
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:33,019
You don't have

231
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:34,379
a favorite?

232
00:20:35,449 --> 00:20:36,989
I don't think so.

233
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:39,259
I did long ago.

234
00:20:40,689 --> 00:20:43,489
I had likes and dislikes.

235
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:46,759
I had easy issues and hard issues.

236
00:20:48,969 --> 00:20:51,329
But at some point,

237
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:53,199
everything became the same.

238
00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:57,809
I don't like it nor do I dislike it.

239
00:20:58,469 --> 00:21:00,479
It's neither easy nor hard.

240
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:12,319
Last year, for a brief moment,

241
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:15,689
I had a baby.

242
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:20,299
In my belly for about 5 months.

243
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,169
I was so busy then

244
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:27,439
that I didn't have time to be happy.

245
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:31,009
Then I lost it.

246
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:34,039
Even before I could celebrate.

247
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:45,319
<i>Because of you,</i>

248
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,859
<i>I lost my job.</i>

249
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:50,159
<i>I lost my child.</i>

250
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:52,699
<i>And I lost myself.</i>

251
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:54,559
<i>But you...</i>

252
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:05,939
I was physically exhausted
and constantly crying.

253
00:22:07,139 --> 00:22:08,839
But on the inside,

254
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:13,049
strangely, it was all the same.

255
00:22:14,879 --> 00:22:17,279
There was nothing of mine inside me.

256
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:19,989
I didn't know why I was sad

257
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:22,019
or why I was angry.

258
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:24,729
I was just embarrassed.

259
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:33,569
When you don't have a favorite,

260
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:37,939
it's not just that favorite thing
that disappears,

261
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:42,279
but everything disappears all together.

262
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:49,689
That song from earlier.

263
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:52,049
Can I listen to it again now?

264
00:23:29,689 --> 00:23:31,359
Is this a song you like?

265
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:34,829
No.

266
00:23:36,699 --> 00:23:38,469
It's a song I know.

267
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:43,639
But

268
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:47,239
listening to it like this,

269
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:50,079
I see it's good.

270
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:29,679
What were you listening to?

271
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:32,579
Oh, just

272
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:33,949
a song.

273
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:52,099
But

274
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:55,139
can you be out here when you're sick?

275
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:56,839
You didn't even make it to work.

276
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:57,839
Oh.

277
00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:01,009
I got better as night fell.

278
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:04,349
Then I got hungry.

279
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:07,519
That's good.

280
00:26:09,749 --> 00:26:11,719
Oh, should we order?

281
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:18,489
I want

282
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:20,729
everything but meat.

283
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:26,599
You don't eat meat?

284
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:28,799
Pork, beef, chicken,

285
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,479
and mutton? All meat?

286
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:31,609
Yes.

287
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:35,009
I don't eat anything that
can recognize its baby.

288
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:37,609
Oh.

289
00:26:39,979 --> 00:26:42,119
I won't hate you for eating meat,

290
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,849
so if you want, you can order it.

291
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:44,919
Oh, it's okay.

292
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:47,319
I don't have to eat meat.

293
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:56,429
Did you get a hold of Gang-jae?

294
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:05,239
No, not yet.

295
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:11,849
Oh, it's that song.

296
00:27:12,749 --> 00:27:13,879
Right?

297
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:15,579
David and Bathsheba.

298
00:27:15,949 --> 00:27:17,219
Bath... Who?

299
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:19,259
You know.

300
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:20,979
King David saw

301
00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:24,169
Bathsheba taking a bath
and fell in love.

302
00:27:24,189 --> 00:27:26,399
He sent her husband to war

303
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,899
and seduced her.
The lyrics are about that.

304
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:32,529
This song is about that?

305
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:34,439
Maybe not.

306
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:37,139
But I think I'm right.

307
00:27:39,109 --> 00:27:42,179
The singer died at a young age.

308
00:27:44,249 --> 00:27:45,919
Oh, and the two were best friends.

309
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:48,319
Who?

310
00:27:48,819 --> 00:27:51,119
David and Bathsheba's husband.

311
00:27:57,389 --> 00:27:58,959
Things never change.

312
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:01,029
May I take your order?

313
00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:02,529
What would you like to eat?

314
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:04,569
Anything is fine.

315
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:39,599
You're awake.

316
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:41,659
When did you get here?

317
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:43,329
Just now.

318
00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:48,539
You said you couldn't come today.

319
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:56,949
So?

320
00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:01,649
Is Ji-yeon, your pretty ex-wife, okay?

321
00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:06,159
I checked she was okay before I came.

322
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:19,199
Did Just call you?

323
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:21,339
Yes.

324
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:24,609
He said something came up and wanted me

325
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,109
to pick you up.

326
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:29,309
I see.

327
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:33,849
Did you drink a lot?

328
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:35,749
No.

329
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,489
The landlady drank a lot.

330
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,199
What's hurting Ji-yeon?

331
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:01,879
Her heart.

332
00:31:20,699 --> 00:31:22,259
Okay then.

333
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:42,619
Let's go home.

334
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,169
Oh, well,

335
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:00,339
I was thinking of buying something else.

336
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:21,319
When you go home,

337
00:32:22,829 --> 00:32:26,159
your husband takes your clothes,

338
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:30,929
and your coat and hangs them.

339
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:31,929
Right?

340
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:36,809
I'm asking you

341
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:40,439
because of your blouse.

342
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:45,279
There's a button undone in the back.

343
00:32:45,979 --> 00:32:48,119
I was wondering if it's okay.

344
00:33:21,219 --> 00:33:22,709
Hush now, Sang-ho.

345
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:41,299
Aren't you getting out?

346
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:44,639
Oh, yes. I am.

347
00:33:56,919 --> 00:33:57,649
Oh!

348
00:33:57,649 --> 00:33:58,919
Dad.

349
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:00,719
When did you get here?

350
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:02,279
Right now...

351
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:04,259
Why are you out here?

352
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:07,659
I texted you so many times.
Why didn't you check?

353
00:34:17,259 --> 00:34:19,469
Jeong-su stopped by earlier.

354
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:21,279
You're going to spend the night?

355
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,679
Yes, but even so,

356
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,749
you shouldn't have waited here.

357
00:34:25,749 --> 00:34:28,479
Let's go inside. Go inside.

358
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:30,649
Go inside.

359
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:48,229
<i>(Canada)</i>

360
00:35:30,449 --> 00:35:31,449
<i>(Manager Ahn)</i>

361
00:35:45,689 --> 00:35:47,129
Lee Gang-jae.

362
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,229
Amazing.

363
00:35:57,439 --> 00:35:58,939
He's a pro.

364
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:06,379
<i>Yeah?</i>

365
00:36:06,379 --> 00:36:07,719
Oh, wow.

366
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:13,659
Is this really Gang-jae's phone?

367
00:36:13,989 --> 00:36:16,019
I can't believe you picked up

368
00:36:16,219 --> 00:36:17,929
my call in one try.

369
00:36:21,029 --> 00:36:22,559
There must be something good going on.

370
00:36:23,229 --> 00:36:26,439
Where are you? Why are you whispering?

371
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:28,669
It doesn't seem like the club.

372
00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:30,839
Nowhere.

373
00:36:32,569 --> 00:36:33,639
I'm outside.

374
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,239
You?

375
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:38,079
<i>At home.</i>

376
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:43,419
What are you doing at home already?

377
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:45,089
You're young.

378
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:48,959
Hey.

379
00:36:49,759 --> 00:36:51,089
<i>What happened with that woman?</i>

380
00:36:52,529 --> 00:36:53,829
<i>How far did you get?</i>

381
00:36:54,499 --> 00:36:55,859
What do you mean?

382
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:57,169
What woman?

383
00:36:57,269 --> 00:36:59,029
Oh, wow.

384
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:01,639
Your voice is so moist.

385
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,209
You must've met her.

386
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:08,809
<i>Did you sleep with her?</i>

387
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:21,719
Hello?

388
00:37:23,689 --> 00:37:25,229
What are you talking about?

389
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:28,559
Don't act modest.

390
00:37:29,299 --> 00:37:30,669
You haven't met her yet?

391
00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:33,269
<i>No, I haven't.</i>

392
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:38,909
Really?

393
00:37:39,969 --> 00:37:40,939
<i>Yes.</i>

394
00:37:43,379 --> 00:37:45,349
Is that so?

395
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:49,749
<i>Meeting someone isn't that easy.</i>

396
00:37:49,749 --> 00:37:51,589
We were total strangers a few days ago.

397
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:54,619
I texted her, but she's not replying.

398
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,259
<i>I see.</i>

399
00:37:58,629 --> 00:38:01,499
I thought she'd be easy
because she's ordinary.

400
00:38:01,699 --> 00:38:03,729
<i>- (Band-aid)
- I guess she isn't.</i>

401
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:06,429
You can't tell a book by its cover.

402
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:11,609
<i>I really want to know
what kind of person she is.</i>

403
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,639
I'll text you when she calls.

404
00:38:30,889 --> 00:38:32,189
<i>Your blouse.</i>

405
00:38:34,059 --> 00:38:37,099
<i>There's a button undone in the back.</i>

406
00:38:37,969 --> 00:38:40,139
<i>I was wondering if it's okay.</i>

407
00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:44,989
<i>If, by chance,</i>

408
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:47,709
<i>we meet again coincidentally,</i>

409
00:38:48,509 --> 00:38:50,809
<i>but not like today,</i>

410
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,949
<i>do you want to die with me?</i>

411
00:39:23,209 --> 00:39:25,109
Are you asleep, Dad?

412
00:39:26,179 --> 00:39:27,749
Of course I am.

413
00:39:30,249 --> 00:39:32,089
No, you're not.

414
00:39:32,949 --> 00:39:35,589
Go to sleep. You must be tired.

415
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:39,229
Okay. Good night.

416
00:39:39,229 --> 00:39:40,459
Good night.

417
00:39:47,299 --> 00:39:50,309
It's cold. You dressed too lightly.

418
00:39:50,809 --> 00:39:53,139
It was warm during the day.

419
00:39:53,269 --> 00:39:55,739
It got cold all of a sudden at night.

420
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:58,709
What time did you get in?

421
00:40:00,419 --> 00:40:02,519
Until that late,

422
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:06,959
were you

423
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,259
working at your office?

424
00:40:13,029 --> 00:40:14,259
No.

425
00:40:15,699 --> 00:40:18,099
I was out, meeting people.

426
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:20,239
People?

427
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:22,299
Yes, people.

428
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:24,609
Several people.

429
00:40:27,309 --> 00:40:29,079
That must've been hard.

430
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:31,249
Yeah.

431
00:40:32,149 --> 00:40:34,279
Meeting people

432
00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:37,119
is the hardest thing.

433
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,259
But today

434
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:43,259
was alright.

435
00:40:57,769 --> 00:40:59,369
Are you sleeping, Dad?

436
00:41:00,279 --> 00:41:01,679
No.

437
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:05,179
Dad.

438
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:07,379
Yeah?

439
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:11,049
Has this ever happened to you?

440
00:41:13,419 --> 00:41:15,889
Your heart pounds so much

441
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:19,229
that your clothes move

442
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:24,399
like this? Like this?

443
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:26,939
Along with your heart?

444
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:31,369
Your heart pounds inside you.

445
00:41:33,339 --> 00:41:35,879
Why would the clothes you wear move?

446
00:41:36,909 --> 00:41:38,109
I know, right?

447
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:39,209
But

448
00:41:40,819 --> 00:41:42,749
it really moved.

449
00:41:45,149 --> 00:41:47,319
It's not like I was running.

450
00:41:48,459 --> 00:41:50,489
I wasn't startled.

451
00:41:52,289 --> 00:41:54,499
I wasn't even that happy.

452
00:41:55,929 --> 00:41:57,669
That's puzzling.

453
00:41:58,199 --> 00:41:59,899
It is, right?

454
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:02,569
Then

455
00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:06,209
isn't that person sick?

456
00:42:07,409 --> 00:42:09,539
No, they're not.

457
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:12,879
What about you?

458
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:14,319
Huh?

459
00:42:15,779 --> 00:42:17,919
Are you okay?

460
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:21,189
You aren't sick?

461
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:24,359
No, I'm not.

462
00:42:25,689 --> 00:42:26,759
Okay.

463
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:30,569
If you aren't sick, then that's great.

464
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:34,119
If you aren't sick,

465
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:37,309
then you'll live.

466
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:40,309
Yes.

467
00:42:41,509 --> 00:42:43,109
Good night.

468
00:42:44,709 --> 00:42:45,809
Good night.

469
00:43:08,499 --> 00:43:10,839
<i>(No hope whatsoever)</i>

470
00:43:15,979 --> 00:43:18,249
<i>(Death Certificate)</i>

471
00:44:16,709 --> 00:44:18,139
<i>Hello.</i>

472
00:44:19,419 --> 00:44:20,999
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

473
00:44:32,329 --> 00:44:34,180
<i>(Hello... It's been a long time.)</i>

474
00:44:34,189 --> 00:44:38,159
<i>More than anything,
I was glad that you seemed</i>

475
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:39,689
<i>to be doing well.</i>

476
00:44:47,739 --> 00:44:50,609
<i>I don't know for sure,</i>

477
00:44:51,009 --> 00:44:52,339
<i>but as I live,</i>

478
00:44:52,569 --> 00:44:58,109
<i>I think I'll encounter some good days.</i>

479
00:45:03,279 --> 00:45:05,019
<i>Like when you walk after running.</i>

480
00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:07,959
<i>Like when you sit after walking.</i>

481
00:45:11,989 --> 00:45:14,859
<i>Even if it's peace
that won't last for long,</i>

482
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:20,029
<i>there will be days that I can call good</i>

483
00:45:21,439 --> 00:45:23,339
<i>because there's rest.</i>

484
00:45:24,939 --> 00:45:26,539
<i>That's what I believe.</i>

485
00:45:35,749 --> 00:45:37,549
<i>Like walking after resting.</i>

486
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:42,489
<i>Like running again after walking.</i>

487
00:45:47,429 --> 00:45:51,429
<i>Like rain turning into snow
and piling up.</i>

488
00:45:55,369 --> 00:45:57,539
<i>The post you sent a photo of</i>

489
00:45:57,709 --> 00:45:59,469
<i>was not written by me.</i>

490
00:46:00,709 --> 00:46:03,009
<i>The account is not mine.</i>

491
00:46:03,209 --> 00:46:07,249
<i>It cannot be me anymore.</i>

492
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:55,999
You're coming from Father's house?

493
00:46:56,529 --> 00:46:57,629
Yes.

494
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:30,429
You must be devastated.

495
00:47:31,529 --> 00:47:32,629
Oh, dear.

496
00:47:32,629 --> 00:47:34,969
How did you come such a long way?

497
00:47:34,969 --> 00:47:36,839
We took the express bus.

498
00:47:38,539 --> 00:47:42,309
You must be so sad and hurt.

499
00:47:42,979 --> 00:47:45,279
Honey, you should say hello.

500
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,809
What? Oh.

501
00:47:46,809 --> 00:47:47,809
Huh?

502
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:53,249
My parents owed him a lot
when he was alive.

503
00:47:53,249 --> 00:47:55,489
- I see.
- Yes, they owed him a lot.

504
00:47:55,489 --> 00:47:57,759
Yes, my late future father-in-law

505
00:47:57,759 --> 00:48:00,129
spoke a lot about your parents.

506
00:48:00,129 --> 00:48:02,629
My parents wanted me
to tell you they're grateful.

507
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,629
Right.

508
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:05,799
You haven't eaten yet, right?

509
00:48:06,199 --> 00:48:07,199
You must eat.

510
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:08,139
Yes.

511
00:48:08,139 --> 00:48:09,799
Yes, I heard.

512
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:15,809
- Welcome.
- You must be so sad.

513
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:16,839
I'm okay.

514
00:48:17,609 --> 00:48:19,709
This is my husband-to-be.

515
00:48:20,179 --> 00:48:21,519
He's handsome.

516
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:22,879
A spring wedding...

517
00:48:22,879 --> 00:48:25,219
You had to cancel your wedding

518
00:48:25,219 --> 00:48:27,019
because your father died.

519
00:48:27,019 --> 00:48:29,019
I'm so sorry.

520
00:48:39,399 --> 00:48:40,799
So to summarize, it's this.

521
00:48:40,969 --> 00:48:42,939
The king fell in love with a woman.

522
00:48:42,939 --> 00:48:44,569
But she was married.

523
00:48:44,569 --> 00:48:47,209
So he sent her husband
to war and killed him.

524
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:50,909
He didn't kill him himself.

525
00:48:50,909 --> 00:48:51,909
I know.

526
00:48:52,249 --> 00:48:53,879
He sent him, wanting him to be killed.

527
00:48:53,879 --> 00:48:55,249
And he was killed.

528
00:48:56,649 --> 00:48:58,049
And the two lived happily ever after.

529
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:00,249
That's it?

530
00:49:00,249 --> 00:49:02,419
In a nutshell.

531
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,729
That's not what's important.

532
00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:07,729
The king and the woman's husband

533
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:09,829
were best friends.
That's what's important.

534
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:12,729
But they weren't really best friends.

535
00:49:12,729 --> 00:49:14,539
He was a subordinate.

536
00:49:15,499 --> 00:49:16,899
Saying it out loud,

537
00:49:17,969 --> 00:49:19,409
it sounds like my mom's story.

538
00:49:19,409 --> 00:49:21,139
Why are you bringing up your mom?

539
00:49:21,139 --> 00:49:23,039
The context is similar.

540
00:49:23,809 --> 00:49:25,579
No way.

541
00:49:29,479 --> 00:49:32,319
When did you become
friends with Gang-jae?

542
00:49:32,649 --> 00:49:33,689
Me?

543
00:49:33,689 --> 00:49:34,689
Yes.

544
00:49:35,789 --> 00:49:37,229
Let me see.

545
00:49:37,729 --> 00:49:40,559
I've known him for 5-6 years.

546
00:49:41,029 --> 00:49:43,199
The first time we met...

547
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:48,039
There's a street famous
for street casting.

548
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:51,869
It turned out to be a false rumor,

549
00:49:53,209 --> 00:49:55,609
but we met on that street.

550
00:49:56,809 --> 00:49:58,479
We became friends a year later.

551
00:49:58,809 --> 00:49:59,849
Oh.

552
00:49:59,869 --> 00:50:01,259
Well...

553
00:50:01,279 --> 00:50:02,979
When I was kicked out of
the trainee dorm,

554
00:50:02,979 --> 00:50:04,749
he let me crash at his place.

555
00:50:06,149 --> 00:50:09,089
He... let you sleep at his place?

556
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,019
Yes.

557
00:50:10,529 --> 00:50:12,359
A lot. He let me in a lot.

558
00:50:18,869 --> 00:50:21,399
I was going to go to Seoul
without interfering,

559
00:50:21,399 --> 00:50:23,299
but I can't keep listening to this.

560
00:50:24,169 --> 00:50:25,339
What do you mean "a lot"?

561
00:50:25,339 --> 00:50:26,769
I let you crash only twice.

562
00:50:27,069 --> 00:50:28,609
When I wasn't home
and on the second floor.

563
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,949
Twice is a lot between
a man and a woman.

564
00:50:32,479 --> 00:50:34,179
Yeah, whatever.

565
00:50:39,919 --> 00:50:42,619
Did they pay an additional fee?

566
00:50:43,189 --> 00:50:45,659
Stop trying to get a free ride.

567
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:10,819
<i>(Dressing Room / "Last Goodbye")
(Jeong Ah-ran)</i>

568
00:51:36,479 --> 00:51:37,909
How may I help you?

569
00:51:37,909 --> 00:51:40,379
Are they filming right now?

570
00:51:40,379 --> 00:51:43,719
They're taking a break for the moment.

571
00:51:43,849 --> 00:51:46,249
There's a problem.

572
00:51:46,989 --> 00:51:48,019
A problem?

573
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:50,389
What do you want?

574
00:51:50,389 --> 00:51:51,589
Oh, I...

575
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,159
Here we go again.

576
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:55,899
We won't be able to go home tonight.

577
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,509
Director.

578
00:52:06,909 --> 00:52:07,809
Yes?

579
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:09,809
Cohesive or not,

580
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:11,849
I can't get beaten up anymore.

581
00:52:12,909 --> 00:52:15,249
I know you're having a hard time,

582
00:52:15,249 --> 00:52:19,989
but your character must seem real.

583
00:52:19,989 --> 00:52:20,989
Real?

584
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:24,399
If I'm hit this much,
I should be hospitalized.

585
00:52:25,729 --> 00:52:28,259
Last time, my head burst
because I got kicked,

586
00:52:28,259 --> 00:52:29,899
but I didn't go to the hospital.

587
00:52:29,899 --> 00:52:32,499
I ate chicken for my kid's birthday.

588
00:52:32,499 --> 00:52:33,829
I even wore a weird fur hat

589
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:35,439
and showed them the menu.

590
00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:38,369
I was kicked for several minutes,

591
00:52:38,969 --> 00:52:40,139
but then I cried

592
00:52:40,879 --> 00:52:42,209
and made coffee.

593
00:52:42,479 --> 00:52:44,249
While vowing to live.

594
00:52:47,619 --> 00:52:48,719
Director.

595
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,649
You've never been beaten up, right?

596
00:52:51,149 --> 00:52:52,719
No, I haven't.

597
00:52:54,789 --> 00:52:56,359
Look at me.

598
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:01,629
If you're hit this much,
you're nearly dead.

599
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:05,929
Your mouth is so swollen,
you can't swallow.

600
00:53:06,729 --> 00:53:10,139
Your ribs painfully
crush you with each step.

601
00:53:10,939 --> 00:53:14,339
In the morning,
you think you died in your sleep.

602
00:53:17,139 --> 00:53:18,139
But

603
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:22,679
you still make me
boil water and drink tea.

604
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:24,199
That's a character set-up?

605
00:53:25,019 --> 00:53:26,849
You know it's product placement.

606
00:53:33,029 --> 00:53:35,199
I'm not saying I don't want to get hit.

607
00:53:36,629 --> 00:53:37,989
I'm not really...

608
00:53:38,499 --> 00:53:40,599
I'm not really getting hit.

609
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:41,869
I'm just pretending.

610
00:53:41,869 --> 00:53:43,969
So it's not that hard to endure.

611
00:53:45,239 --> 00:53:46,239
But...

612
00:53:46,909 --> 00:53:50,179
getting beaten to a pulp,
then going on with life,

613
00:53:50,949 --> 00:53:52,779
smiling like nothing happened...

614
00:53:54,619 --> 00:53:56,379
I can't do that anymore.

615
00:53:58,249 --> 00:53:59,649
Am I the weird one here?

616
00:54:01,059 --> 00:54:01,819
Huh?

617
00:54:01,819 --> 00:54:05,089
Am I not qualified to act
because of this?

618
00:54:05,859 --> 00:54:06,859
Huh?

619
00:54:09,099 --> 00:54:10,229
Seriously.

620
00:54:21,609 --> 00:54:22,609
Well,

621
00:54:22,879 --> 00:54:24,549
let's eat and film again.

622
00:54:24,649 --> 00:54:26,349
You should go eat, too, Mr. Seo.

623
00:54:26,349 --> 00:54:27,349
Come on.

624
00:54:27,779 --> 00:54:30,319
What's wrong with you?

625
00:54:30,579 --> 00:54:32,289
You know this business.

626
00:54:32,289 --> 00:54:33,789
You're making it tough for others.

627
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:37,789
Give that to me. I'll drink it.

628
00:54:38,229 --> 00:54:41,959
It doesn't matter who drinks it, right?

629
00:54:41,959 --> 00:54:43,429
Yes, but

630
00:54:43,429 --> 00:54:44,899
let's talk about it later.

631
00:54:44,899 --> 00:54:46,329
I'll drink it.

632
00:54:56,739 --> 00:54:58,129
What are you doing?

633
00:54:58,979 --> 00:55:01,119
Are you on a power trip
because you're the lead?

634
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:40,919
Let's go home.

635
00:55:46,389 --> 00:55:47,759
Let's go.

636
00:55:53,329 --> 00:55:55,999
No. We have 5 scenes left.

637
00:55:59,169 --> 00:56:00,239
Then...

638
00:56:03,479 --> 00:56:04,709
let's go sit in your car.

639
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:50,759
Jeong-su!

640
00:56:51,589 --> 00:56:53,589
How about this?

641
00:56:54,129 --> 00:56:55,329
They look nice.

642
00:56:57,869 --> 00:57:00,499
You didn't even look closely enough.

643
00:57:00,499 --> 00:57:02,139
You look pretty in everything.

644
00:57:02,139 --> 00:57:03,999
They're pretty, so buy anything.

645
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,919
How much is this and this?

646
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,719
This is 310,000 won.

647
00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:25,159
And this is 273,000 won.

648
00:57:25,159 --> 00:57:26,189
Oh, my!

649
00:57:26,189 --> 00:57:27,959
Why are they so expensive?

650
00:57:28,359 --> 00:57:30,329
They're not even a designer label.

651
00:57:30,899 --> 00:57:31,969
Jeez.

652
00:57:33,569 --> 00:57:35,499
Come on, Mom.

653
00:57:35,799 --> 00:57:36,899
What?

654
00:57:37,169 --> 00:57:39,739
Be quiet. There are customers here.

655
00:57:40,139 --> 00:57:41,609
I'm a customer, too, you bastard.

656
00:57:41,609 --> 00:57:44,439
Then do whatever you want.

657
00:57:44,439 --> 00:57:45,609
I'm sorry.

658
00:57:45,609 --> 00:57:46,809
It's okay.

659
00:57:48,279 --> 00:57:52,049
With an employee discount
and member discount,

660
00:57:52,049 --> 00:57:53,089
the amount is this.

661
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:56,719
It's still expensive.

662
00:57:56,719 --> 00:57:58,459
Mom, just get them.

663
00:57:58,459 --> 00:57:59,729
I'll buy them for you.

664
00:57:59,729 --> 00:58:00,529
Here you go.

665
00:58:00,529 --> 00:58:01,629
Thank you.

666
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:03,959
Just get them?

667
00:58:03,959 --> 00:58:05,329
Just get them.

668
00:58:05,529 --> 00:58:08,269
Look pretty when you're
meeting your friends.

669
00:58:08,269 --> 00:58:09,739
You said you're the oldest.

670
00:58:09,739 --> 00:58:11,369
Wear new shoes at least.

671
00:58:11,369 --> 00:58:14,039
There's always a catch.

672
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:15,309
- We'll take them.
- Okay.

673
00:58:15,309 --> 00:58:16,779
This size fits you, right?

674
00:58:16,779 --> 00:58:18,279
- Yes.
- Okay.

675
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:24,919
You know your father-in-law?
Bu-jeong's dad?

676
00:58:24,919 --> 00:58:26,119
What about him?

677
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:27,519
Did...

678
00:58:27,789 --> 00:58:30,259
he say anything about me?

679
00:58:31,789 --> 00:58:32,859
About you?

680
00:58:32,859 --> 00:58:35,329
About a phone call with me.

681
00:58:35,329 --> 00:58:37,399
Or just about everyday life.

682
00:58:37,399 --> 00:58:39,129
Did you call him?

683
00:58:39,129 --> 00:58:40,269
Oh, well.

684
00:58:40,269 --> 00:58:42,239
We can talk on the phone.

685
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:46,009
We're in-laws each with
an only child. We're close.

686
00:58:47,879 --> 00:58:49,809
Something's fishy.

687
00:58:50,039 --> 00:58:51,479
You caused some kind of trouble, right?

688
00:58:51,479 --> 00:58:52,809
What do you mean?

689
00:58:52,809 --> 00:58:54,819
I'm not the type to cause trouble.

690
00:58:54,819 --> 00:58:55,919
Look at you.

691
00:58:56,179 --> 00:58:59,319
You're not calling me names.
You did something.

692
00:58:59,319 --> 00:59:00,749
What did you do?

693
00:59:01,219 --> 00:59:02,959
I didn't do anything.

694
00:59:02,959 --> 00:59:04,459
You're making me more suspicious of you.

695
00:59:04,459 --> 00:59:06,889
If I say I didn't do anything, I didn't.

696
00:59:09,329 --> 00:59:12,669
Is everything alright at
Bu-jeong's workplace?

697
00:59:12,829 --> 00:59:13,769
Huh?

698
00:59:14,469 --> 00:59:15,469
Of course.

699
00:59:15,669 --> 00:59:16,769
Why?

700
00:59:16,769 --> 00:59:17,909
What do you mean?

701
00:59:17,909 --> 00:59:21,509
I can ask about
my daughter-in-law's work.

702
00:59:23,539 --> 00:59:26,309
Did you meet Father

703
00:59:26,709 --> 00:59:28,319
because of Bu-jeong?

704
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:30,549
I didn't meet anyone.

705
00:59:30,549 --> 00:59:31,789
No.

706
00:59:32,289 --> 00:59:33,949
It looks like you did.

707
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:37,589
- Thank you.
- Here's your card.

708
00:59:37,989 --> 00:59:39,429

Yes?

726
01:01:34,479 --> 01:01:36,209
Get your blood pressure
checked over there.

727
01:01:36,479 --> 01:01:37,479
Okay.

728

Sir, take a look at this.

Sir!

732
01:02:30,129 --> 01:02:31,129
Huh?

733
01:02:31,499 --> 01:02:32,729
Is everything okay?

734
01:02:33,869 --> 01:02:34,799
What?

735
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:36,259
Your apron...

736
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,039
Oh. Jeez.

Sir...

738
01:02:43,439 --> 01:02:44,439
Okay.

739
01:02:59,959 --> 01:03:01,999
The last time you came was...

740
01:03:03,429 --> 01:03:04,529
about a year ago.

741
01:03:04,529 --> 01:03:05,729
Yes.

742
01:03:05,729 --> 01:03:07,699
You came because of uterine hemorrhage

743
01:03:07,699 --> 01:03:09,369
and you have no possibility
of being pregnant?

744
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:10,799
Right.

745
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:13,209
Change clothes and
go to the examination room.

746
01:03:13,209 --> 01:03:14,169
Okay.

01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:15,649
<i>Let's check her vitals first.</i>

750
01:04:17,579 --> 01:04:18,509
<i>Where's her guardian?</i>

751

♫ <i>When the red flowers</i> ♫

760
01:05:30,444 --> 01:05:36,983
♫ <i>Start to wither</i> ♫

761
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:44,090
♫ <i>Under the red shadow of the flowers</i> ♫

762
01:05:44,658 --> 01:05:49,529

763
01:05:52,098 --> 01:05:56,803
♫ <i>Felt so shy</i> ♫

764
01:06:00,109 --> 01:06:04,109
<i>(Lost)</i>

765
01:06:05,279 --> 01:06:08,009
<i>You had a miscarriage last March...</i>

766
01:06:08,009 --> 01:06:08,919

769
01:06:14,959 --> 01:06:17,159
<i>Young man in the last unit
down the hall, right?</i>

770

<i>Yes.</i>

771
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:20,829
<i>I think I've seen him before.</i>

772
01:06:21,259 --> 01:06:22,999
<i>The man who just left.</i>

773
01:06:24,459 --> 01:06:27,269
<i>What's wrong?
Did you forget your password?</i>

774
01:06:27,269 --> 01:06:30,299
<i>I put it in my vest and jacket.</i>

775
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:32,739
<i>Shutting this down at this point</i>

776
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:34,569
<i>is good for all of us, isn't it?</i>

777
01:06:35,179 --> 01:06:38,009
<i>Then go visit her with some snacks.</i>

778
01:06:38,749 --> 01:06:40,309

<i>Was today</i>

780
