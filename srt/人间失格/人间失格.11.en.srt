she wrote a suicide note

chafe your heels,

00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,580
That's what's wrong with you.

189
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,780
What comes next?

190
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,620
Huh?

191
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,190
What is it?

192
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,430
I don't know.

193
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,830
I forgot.

194
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,100
You forgot in that second?

195
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,440
This is too heavy.

196
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,270
- What's in here?
- I'll carry it.

197
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,040
- I said I got it.
- No, it's okay.

198
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,810
I'll carry it.

199
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,310
I'll hold that, too.

200
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,280
Give it here.

201
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:33,130
<i>(Dugeun Station)</i>

202
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Excuse me!

203
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,610
Looks closed...

204
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,870
<i>(Dugeun Restaurant)</i>

205
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,400
<i>Did you know that she was reported</i>

206
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,540
<i>for a similar thing in
the same reservoir before?</i>

207
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,210
<i>(Jin Jeong-su:
I don't think I can come home tonight.)</i>

208
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:04,080
<i>(Sorry...)</i>

209
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,790
Who was that?

210
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,260
Your father?

211
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,460
It wasn't my father.

212
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,300
Then who?

213
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,700
Your husband?

214
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,570
He wants you to come home?

215
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,180
No.

216
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,420
When was the last time you rode a train?

217
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,870
I rode it a lot in my previous job.

218
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,670
I often went on business trips.

219
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,840
And sometimes field trips.

220
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,480
A company goes on field trips?

221
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,580
I thought only students went on those.

222
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,380
When was the last time you rode a train?

223
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,120
Me?

224
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,460
It was...

225
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,530
when we cremated
my dad after his funeral.

226
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,970
So in 10th grade.

227
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,810
After that, I had no reason
to leave Seoul.

228
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,010
So no train ride.

229
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,610
And I've never been on a field trip.

230
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,230
Anyway,

231
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,730
the last time I rode
a train was at night.

232
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,940
But

233
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,010
I just followed my mom so I don't know.

234
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,010
It was a small station like this.

235
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,310
Was it here?

236
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,110
What's the name of the station?

237
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,220
Dugeun Station.

238
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,560
Dugeun Station...

239
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,660
Maybe it was here.

240
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,190
Back then,

241
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,930
I saw something like that, too.

242
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,400
But I thought

243
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,900
it was an amusement park.

244
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,710
I was staring at it because it was cool.

245
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,480
But my mom said not to look.
She said it was bad.

246
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,210
Since they were motels.

247
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,080
I didn't understand.

248
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,650
Now I know.

249
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,390
I was innocent then.

250
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,590
In 10th grade.

251
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,590
Where did you go on the train?

252
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,900
To a mountain.

253
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,640
I went up a mountain,

254
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,410
then to the sea,

255
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,220
and then home.

256
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,210
A cab will arrive in 5 minutes.

257
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,980
Wife

258
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,410
There you are.

259
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,270
Where are the others?

260
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,740
They left.

261
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,110
I didn't even get to say bye.

262
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,320
They'll come tomorrow after work.

263
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,350
What about you?

264
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,290
I'll come, too, of course.

265
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,190
I mean why are you still here?

266
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,630
Oh, I just

267
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,530
stayed in the car for a bit.

268
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,230
I had to see you before I left.

269
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,140
Why?

270
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,640
Well, I didn't take your calls...

271
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,180
I want to apologize for that.

272
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,650
You apologized over a text earlier.

273
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:12,250
Still, I wanted to apologize in person.

274
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,400
Can I take a break in your car?

275
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,140
Huh?

276
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,480
My legs hurt because
I was standing all day.

277
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,850
My in-laws are in the lounge,
so I can't sit down.

278
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,910
Where's your car?

279
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,840
Can I get some shut-eye?

280
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,740
Okay.

281
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,630
Thank you

282
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,200
for coming.

283
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,500
Of course.

284
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:39,040
Don't come tomorrow, Jeong-su.

285
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,640
Why not?

286
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,820
My mom's coming tomorrow.

287
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,920
She might say the wrong things.

288
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:57,330
I'm so worried.

289
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,760
Get some rest for now.

290
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,610
What did the others say?

291
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,540
They all

292
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,810
pity me, right?

293
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,480
No.

294
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,280
They're your friends.

295
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,750
They're sad.

296
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,790
I hate that I'm like this.

297
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,370
But my pride is hurt.

298
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,200
I'm ruined, Jeong-su.

299
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,440
I don't know if this will help,

300
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,940
but have you seen a stall on the road?

301
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,880
A stall?

302
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,180
Yes.

303
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,850
Where people sell gum
and lottery tickets?

304
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,780
Yes.

305
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,220
Have you seen

306
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,260
a post that says, "We buy gold teeth?"

307
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,390
Beside the window or the signboard.

308
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,030
No, I haven't.

309
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,530
You haven't?

310
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,240
No, I haven't.

311
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,210
Then you're okay.

312
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,140
Who says so?

313
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,610
My mom.

314
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,620
Your mom?

315
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,480
Yes.

316
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,590
A long time ago,

317
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,130
when I was very young, my mom told me

318
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,830
that if you can't see it
even when it's there,

319
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,500
you're not that bad off to consider

320
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
selling your teeth,
so you're still okay.

321
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,980
Sometimes, I wonder what that means.

322
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,910
But then, I see it on the roads.

323
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,780
Since I know,

324
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,850
I look for it.

325
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,990
Then I can see it.

326
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,060
Then

327
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,860
I hate myself for it,

328
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,770
but I strangely feel relieved.

329
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,580
You'll be okay.

330
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,790
Gyeong-eun.

331
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,470
It's way past 5 minutes.

332
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,440
He'll come since he said he will.

333
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,150
Right?

334
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,560
By the way,

335
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,260
how much should I pay you?

336
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,730
For today.

337
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,370
A while ago,

338
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,340
I took a look at
your business card again.

339
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,550
It only says how to make a reservation

340
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,350
but not the price.

341
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,760
So how much should I pay you?

342
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,540
How much do you have?

343
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,910
I don't have cash.

344
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,480
But I can transfer money
to your account.

345
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,690
How much do you have in your account?

346
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,500
Can you read my mind?

347
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,340
Then

348
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,320
how did you ask me that just now?

349
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,610
How'd you know what I was thinking?

350
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,010
Were you thinking
how much you'd charge me?

351
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,880
No, that's not it.

352
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,850
That's not it...

353
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,690
Well, okay.

354
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,260
Something like that.

355
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,970
Something like that? What?

356
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,040
I was thinking about money.

357
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,830
I had a friend.

358
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,400
He died.

359
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,020
Because he felt empty.

360
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,510
I think I told you this before.

361
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,750
On the rooftop.

362
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,920
Anyway,

363
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,390
we weren't that close.

364
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,060
But we weren't not close.

365
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,390
He was that kind of a friend.

366
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,800
When I was signing the form
at the police station,

367
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,070
I was reminded of him.

368
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,340
Because I signed a form

369
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,660
after he died.

370
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,810
I didn't want to

371
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,080
but somehow it just happened.

372
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,780
Being here with you,

373
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,180
I'm reminded of him more.

374
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,660
What is it like to feel empty?

375
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,160
Did he do it because
he didn't have money?

376
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,830
If you don't have money, you feel empty.

377
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,470
And hungry.

378
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,540
Then

379
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,440
I thought about why you wanted to die.

380
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,350
You studied a lot.

381
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,720
You had an office job.

382
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,620
You have a father.

383
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,420
You have a husband.

384
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,870
But why do you feel empty?

385
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:55,440
Money doesn't seem to be an issue.

386
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,610
That's what I was thinking.

387
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,810
It's because the cab
was taking too long.

388
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,820
It wasn't about how much
I should charge you

389
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,150
or if I should accept a wire transfer.

390
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,360
I wasn't thinking that at all.

391
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,910
It was the same for me.

392
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,770
'How much should I pay?'

393
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,970
'How much is his fee per hour?'

394
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,980
'Why does he do this?'

395
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,380
That's not what I was thinking about.

396
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,750
'Why did he come all this way?'

397
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,030
'He probably erased my number.'

398
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,090
'Perhaps

399
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,530
he was worried about me.'

400
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:59,270
'Does he pity me because of my dad?'

401
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,400
That's what I was thinking.

402
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,940
Then you talked

403
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:08,880
about your mom and your late father.

404
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,180
I just

405
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,250
felt sad.

406
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,250
'On the day you cremated your father,

407
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,460
why did you go

408
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,330
to the mountain with your mother?'

409
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:30,000
'Why did you go to the sea?'

410
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:33,770
'I'm glad

411
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:38,170
you made it home in the end.'

412
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,850
'I think we're very similar.'

413
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:47,120
And then

414
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,920
I wanted to be nice to you.

415
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,960
If I had something to offer,

416
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,260
I wanted to give it to you.

417
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,230
But what could I give?

418
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,470
I have nothing.

419
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:11,740
So I asked you about the fee earlier.

420
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:15,280
I didn't want to talk
about this in the cab.

421
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,320
Is there somewhere

422
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,360
you want to go besides home?

423
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,160
I don't know.

424
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,570
Then...

425
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,970
You want to go to the mountain,

426
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,610
then to the sea,

427
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,780
and then home?

428
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,450
If you want to go home,

429
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,920
you can say it.

430
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,350
Don't feel pressured.

431
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,260
We're still friends.

432
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,060
<i>(Wife)</i>

433
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,800
<i>A perfume?</i>

434
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,760
<i>Huh?</i>

435
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,500
<i>Did you give someone a ride?</i>

436
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,580
I'll open the window.

437
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,580
Okay.

438
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,090
Hello?

439
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,190
<i>Hello.</i>

440
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,600
What's going on, Mom?

441
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,200
Wait, Mom.

442
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,900
Are you sick?

443
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:21,800
I'm not sick.

444
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,110
<i>I was sleeping so my voice is hoarse.</i>

445
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,840
Mom!

446
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,240
Well, if you're not sick,

447
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,210
<i>why would you call me this late?</i>

448
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,350
You had me worried.

449
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,780
What time is it?

450
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,890
It's 2:30 AM!

451
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:41,160
<i>I dozed off.</i>
I didn't know it was that late.

452
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,260
Perhaps

453
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,590
it's because I have
a wrap around my head,

454
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,100
but I had a really bizarre dream.

455
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,530
A dream?

456
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,000
What dream?

457
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,900
In my dream,

458
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:57,810
well,

459
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,940
I can't remember the context,

460
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,630
but I got into a fight with a crazy lady

461
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,240
on a bus.

462
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,580
But that witch

463
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,020
suddenly

464
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,350
grabbed my head and spun me around.

465
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,490
<i>Then,</i>

466
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,560
<i>my teeth fell out. That's bad luck.</i>

467
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,400
<i>I screamed, "Please stop!"</i>

468
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,130
I got her off me and saw

469
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,570
that it wasn't a crazy woman.

470
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,970
It was your father.

471
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,040
Mom.

472
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,540
That's a silly dream.

473
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,580
Why is it a silly dream?

474
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,080
<i>First,</i>

475
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,150
<i>it's a silly dream because
you can't remember it.</i>

476
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,720
And a woman becoming a man

477
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,250
and a stranger becoming someone you know

478
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,990
indicate it's a silly dream.

479
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,020
<i>It's the stream of consciousness</i>

480
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,460
<i>if you want to sound educated.</i>

481
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,190
Forget about that.

482
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,430
Is...

483
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,860
<i>everything okay with you?</i>

484
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,170
Why wouldn't things be okay?

485
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,630
Everything's fine.

486
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,240
What about Bu-jeong?

487
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,970
Bu-jeong?

488
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,940
I don't know.

489
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,610
I think she's okay.

490
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,080
What do you mean, you think?

491
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,050
You're a married couple.

492
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,120
Married couples don't know everything.

493
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,420
There are things we don't know.

494
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:18,720
<i>Anyway, Mom...</i>

495
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,690
I'm...

496
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,190
I'm driving.

497
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,230
Let's talk later.

498
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,000
Why are you still out?

499
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,400
I had to go somewhere.

500
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,570
<i>Where did you go?</i>

501
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,330
I worked late, okay?

502
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,000
Mom,

503
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,870
you had a bad dream,

504
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,640
so let me drive safely. I'm hanging up.

505
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,540
Oh, right.

506
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,580
Drive safely.

507
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,540
Text me when you get home.

508
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,750
<i>Okay.</i>

509
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,520
My mom worries a lot.

510
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,630
I see.

511
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,300
<i>(Wife: I'll sleep over at Dad's.
Do as you wish.</i>

512
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:10,010
<i>(I am...)</i>

513
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,980
You know,

514
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,310
when I came with my mom,

515
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:54,920
we walked from all the way down there.

516
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:01,360
We got off a train station
I'd never seen before.

517
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,830
It was still dark.

518
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,760
So...

519
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,830
we went to a 24-hour hamburger store.

520
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,060
My mom and I

521
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:12,830
waited until the sun came up.

522
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,940
We ordered French fries

523
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,240
and kept getting refills for coke.

524
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,450
I saw on the wall of
that hamburger store

525
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,610
an ad about some kind of

526
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:28,120
observatory.

527
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:29,950
So

528
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:33,050
we went to this terminal,

529
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:35,620
got on a bus

530
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:39,960
and came here.

531
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,670
Hello.

532
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:45,370
Hello.

533
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,070
You have on high-heels.

534
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,970
That must be tough.

535
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:51,070
Fight on!

536
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,450
What were you wearing
when you first came here?

537
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:04,820
What was I wearing?

538
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,360
I see you're into details.

539
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,890
No, I was just

540
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:16,260
trying to picture it as I listened.

541
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:18,760
Since you were in 10th grade,

542
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,700
did you wear a school uniform?

543
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,100
You don't have to answer.

544
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,740
It's okay.

545
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,210
I...

546
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,280
was wearing a mourning suit.

547
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,920
Since we came right after Dad's funeral.

548
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:38,750
Oh.

549
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,290
We didn't have

550
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:43,930
anything black then.

551
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:46,760
So we had to buy mourning clothes.

552
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:50,570
We were close with my dad's caretaker.

553
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:53,230
We went to the store he worked

554
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,040
on the weekends and
bought clothes there.

555
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:02,810
<i>(Changing room)</i>

556
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:07,780
<i>I hadn't gotten any
new clothes in a long time.</i>

557
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:11,150
<i>I got excited that,
for a moment, I forgot Dad died.</i>

558
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,890
<i>I felt good.</i>

559
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,310
<i>My mom and I</i>

560
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:36,410
<i>were so sad before we went there.</i>

561
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:38,680
<i>It felt strange.</i>

562
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,470
<i>Cherry blossoms were in
full bloom in Seoul then.</i>

563
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,920
<i>When cherry blossoms fall,</i>

564
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,790
<i>you feel strange.</i>

565
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:20,790
<i>You're sad.</i>

566
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,080
<i>I guess it was because of that.</i>

567
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,910
<i>Or maybe because I was young.</i>

568
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:29,160
<i>I thought that was why
people say the living live.</i>

569
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:34,330
<i>(Mt. Jogyeong Observatory)</i>

570
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:54,020
<i>I thought, 'How would I
live without my dad?'</i>

571
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:56,920
<i>'If I don't go to the hospital
after school,</i>

572
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:00,390
<i>where should I go every day?'</i>

573
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:05,490
<i>But because I didn't go to the hospital,</i>

574
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:08,160
<i>I got to have time like this.</i>

575
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:13,800
<i>I thought it was a gift
Dad had left for me.</i>

576
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:19,310
I...

577
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:21,940
I was filled with

578
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,250
out-of-the-blue, strange thoughts.

579
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,350
I felt like a stream

580
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:31,350
was trickling into my heart.

581
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:55,640
My mom and I had walked up this far

582
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,810
when snow fell

583
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:01,680
although it was spring.

584
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:11,860
It's cold, right?

585
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,400
It's okay since we're walking.

586
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,570
Once you get to the top,

587
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,010
you'll love that you came here.

588
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:47,430
Oh, they're letting campers
camp here now.

589
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,230
You might cry.

590
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,070
My mom

591
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:58,370
cried a lot as she looked at the stars.

592
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,640
I think it was over there.

593
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,750
Back then, it seemed strange to me.

594
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,980
So I asked her why she
cried on our way down.

595
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,520
She didn't answer for a long while.

596
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:17,860
Then she said she cried
because she remembered

597
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,490
the bread and milk she left on the bus.

598
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,700
I believed her.

599
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,580
For a long time.

600
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:27,870
I was really naive.

601
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,730
<i>(Wife)</i>

602
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,540
Umm...

603
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:39,980
I searched online.

604
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:42,050
They said they keep it
open for the people

605
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:44,520
who come to look at
the stars early morning.

606
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:50,390
It's written here. For the time being,

607
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,890
they're closed.

608
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,400
The lobby is closed in
the early morning hours for now.

609
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,980
Darn it.

610
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,680
A taxi...

611
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:56,920
It's cold, right?

612
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,490
I think I should

613
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:01,360
go down and get a cab.

614
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,460
Excuse me.

615
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:06,700
You look so cold.

616
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:07,870
Take this.

617
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:13,210
Thank you.

618
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:15,710
We came here on a sudden whim.

619
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:17,980
Yes, I could tell.

620
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:19,680
Thank you.

621
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,290
I was afraid we might freeze to death,

622
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:23,850
then you came.

623
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,450
These will help a lot.

624
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,390
Thank you.

625
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:32,930
I'll hurry down and get a cab.

626
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:35,960
Umm...

627
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:38,500
If you're staying longer,

628
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:40,870
do you want a spare tent?

629
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,870
We're leaving after we see the sunrise.

630
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:47,140
You can use it until then.

631
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:53,980
Hold on a sec.

632
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,220
A tent...

633
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,220
Soon-ju.

634
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:34,020
Are you asleep?

635
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:36,520
No.

636
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,110
You're still awake?

637
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:02,550
I want to sleep.

638
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,690
I had a lot going on today.

639
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,320
But

640
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:12,960
it's been such a long time
since I slept in a bed.

641
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:15,330
So I can't sleep.

642
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:22,160
So this is what it's like
to stretch your limbs.

643
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,640
I wish this were my place.

644
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:40,950
You have your own room, right?

645
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,190
Yes, I do.

646
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,130
What does it look like?

647
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,160
It's...

648
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,630
Ordinary.

649
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:51,230
How is it ordinary?

650
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,830
Is it an apartment?

651
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:55,300
It's a single-family house.

652
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,670
I've lived there since grade school.

653
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,940
So it's very old.

654
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:03,340
Is it two stories?

655
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,110
Huh?

656
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,800
How did you know?

657
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,980
I just knew.

658
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,420
You have that vibe.

659
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:14,390
I felt it when I first saw you.

660
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,060
You looked like

661
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,610
someone who lives in
an old two-story house

662
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:21,260
with a yard.

663
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,970
What kind of vibe is that?

664
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,640
That vibe?

665
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,640
Yes.

666
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:36,680
It's so ideal

667
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,780
that it's unreal.

668
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:43,180
Like an old educational TV show.

669
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:47,790
Then it's bad.

670
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,790
Why is that bad?

671
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:54,700
Because it's boring.

672
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,560
It's boring and no fun.

673
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,000
What?

674
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,570
The people who have it all are worse.

675
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:08,480
Why are you so greedy?

676
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,980
You have almost everything.

677
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:14,210
You want to live
a fun life on top of that?

678
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:22,590
Leave that

679
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:26,960
to people like us.

680
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:30,060
That way, the world is fair.

681
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:56,920
Want to come lie here?

682
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:10,940
You don't feel anything

683
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:14,370
being alone with me, do you?

684
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:17,910
Because nothing will happen.

685
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:29,490
I don't think anything will happen.

686
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:33,090
But that's why

687
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:38,270
my heart flutters more.

688
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,500
It'd be perfect
if the blanket didn't smell

689
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:52,500
like Gang-jae.

690
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,490
You're going home?

691
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,760
I'm going to buy new blankets.

692
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,860
Where will you buy them at this hour?

693
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,530
I'll find somewhere that's open.

694
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:13,730
A lot of places in
Seoul is open 24/7.

695
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,000
There must be a bedding store.

696
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,020
Then I'll go with you.

697
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:27,550
I don't want to be here alone.

698
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,420
Want some water?

699
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:55,710
She gave us water, too.

700
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:57,340
I'll have some.

701
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:21,750
Want to watch it with me?

702
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,470
I heard

703
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:25,740
it's trending.

704
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:31,610
Mind if I lie down?

705
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:33,710
Go ahead.

706
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:50,560
Get some sleep if you're tired.

707
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:10,750
Back at the police station,

708
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,860
the policeman asked you

709
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:19,420
if you knew it wasn't
my first time there.

710
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,700
Right.

711
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,500
But

712
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:32,040
when I saw the situation,

713
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,670
I understood the vibe,

714
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:36,380
so I gathered

715
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:38,210
the information I knew

716
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:40,210
and made something up.

717
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:43,450
I'm not asking how you came to know.

718
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:45,090
I just

719
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:48,160
want to tell you I regret it.

720
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:55,500
It's one of the things
I regret the most in life.

721
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:59,730
I couldn't tell anyone
because I was mortified.

722
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:08,640
You said

723
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:13,210
I studied a lot,

724
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:15,680
worked at an office job,

725
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:20,490
and I have a father and husband.

726
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:24,420
You asked why I felt empty
despite all that.

727
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:27,930
Yes.

728
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:34,070
It's because I didn't become anything.

729
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:36,840
Nothing.

730
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,910
What did you want to become?

731
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:43,810
Everything.

732
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,680
I acted like I wasn't greedy,

733
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:54,020
like I was humble
while doing bad things.

734
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,020
I wanted to be everything.

735
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:01,260
I wanted to achieve
recognition from others.

736
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,170
I wanted to show my dad.

737
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:09,770
I wanted to show my husband.

738
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,570
And I wanted to show myself

739
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:15,440
what kind of a person I was.

740
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:20,550
But come to think of it,

741
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,720
there wasn't a specific thing
I wanted to become.

742
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,860
I just wanted to become something.

743
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,400
But...

744
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,600
It didn't work out.

745
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:46,300
So...

746
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,000
What do you want to do?

747
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,950
I want to wait.

748
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,050
I was so embarrassed with my life.

749
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:01,990
So I wanted to end it.

750
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:04,690
But now, I just...

751
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:07,250
I want to wait.

752
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,750
Until it all passes.

753
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:14,330
Although I don't know what all that is.

754
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:36,820
Can I

755
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,420
lie down, too?

756
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:41,690
Yes.

757
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:08,960
This tent

758
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,710
looks like a pumpkin, right?

759
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,230
When the sun comes up,

760
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:19,630
and the morning comes,

761
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:23,800
everything will disappear,
like a pumpkin carriage.

762
01:09:26,610 --> 01:09:29,840
This place. This time.

763
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,240
Everything.

764
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:40,220
Tomorrow...

765
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:45,860
I mean, today.

766
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:48,330
So today,

767
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:50,300
later,

768
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:54,000
are we going to the sea?

769
01:09:58,370 --> 01:09:59,970
Or are we going home?

770
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:03,180
I don't know.

771
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,850
Want to make a bet?

772
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:14,750
50,000 won.

773
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:19,290
You have

774
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:22,600
a small 50,000 won bill

775
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,400
folded up in your purse, right?

776
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:29,970
Let's make a bet with that.

777
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:34,210
I'll bet on not going.

778
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:36,340
You bet on us going.

779
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:48,650
Are you asleep?

780
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:01,840
Good night.

781
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:48,450
Can I touch your face?

782
01:12:41,808 --> 01:12:48,281

790

<i>Did you know Bu-jeong's father
collects boxes?</i>

<i>with a person like me?</i>

800
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,100
