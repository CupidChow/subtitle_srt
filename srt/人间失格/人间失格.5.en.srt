00:02:24,092 --> 00:02:26,932

Goodbye.

20
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:25,822

21
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:36,132

<i>also words you wrote and erased,</i>

23
00:03:43,212 --> 00:03:45,882

24
00:04:18,912 --> 00:04:21,582

25

<i>When you said, "I wish you good health,"</i>

26
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:34,832

originally was.</i>

28
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:53,682
<i>perhaps</i>

29
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:03,422
<i>it was a sentence</i>

30
00:05:03,422 --> 00:05:04,922
<i>you really didn't mean.</i>

31

Let's go.

34
00:06:20,122 --> 00:06:22,072
Come on. There's so much to do.

35
00:06:22,232 --> 00:06:23,272
Where are you going to put it?

36
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:25,072
You keep it.

37
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:35,712
Wait for me.

38

39

Okay.

40
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:45,962
Pretty, right?

41
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,502
What do you think?

42
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:48,542
Good.

43
00:09:49,912 --> 00:09:51,512
You're still decorating?

44
00:09:51,512 --> 00:09:52,642
We're finished.

45
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:53,782
What about you?

46
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:55,782
I don't know.

47
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:03,152
We've just started,
but it's going to take long.

48
00:10:03,222 --> 00:10:05,592
There are five teams
singing congratulatory songs.

49
00:10:05,592 --> 00:10:07,792
Oh, it's that kind of wedding.

50
00:10:08,162 --> 00:10:09,562
I think we'll be done soon.

51
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:12,502
Instead of an officiant,
they'll read letters.

52
00:10:12,502 --> 00:10:13,502
Really?

53
00:10:13,662 --> 00:10:14,932
I've never heard of that.

54
00:10:14,932 --> 00:10:16,772
People do that a lot these days.

55
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:19,572
Well, then.

56
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:20,802
Did you write a letter, too?

57
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:22,172
Oh, come on.

58
00:10:22,172 --> 00:10:23,942
There are professionals who do that.

59
00:10:24,112 --> 00:10:24,912
Huh?

60
00:10:39,662 --> 00:10:40,792
Didn't he come with you?

61
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:44,462
I saw you with him earlier.

62
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:49,232
Your husband?

63
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:53,072
Yes.

64
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,552
You're here for a wedding?

65
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:04,352
A relative?

66
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:08,822
Just someone I know.

67
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:09,992
Then

68
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:13,162
why are you hiding?

69
00:11:16,162 --> 00:11:17,592
You just hid.

70
00:11:18,562 --> 00:11:19,762
Since he came.

71
00:11:24,472 --> 00:11:25,672
Pay me back now.

72
00:11:26,122 --> 00:11:27,442
Earlier... Not again.

73
00:11:27,442 --> 00:11:28,772
I lent you money.

74
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,212
Does your husband smoke?

75
00:11:30,912 --> 00:11:31,712
No.

76
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:32,752
Are you sure?

77
00:11:33,312 --> 00:11:34,642
Buy me coffee.

78
00:11:34,742 --> 00:11:36,382
I gave you a bill earlier.

79
00:11:38,422 --> 00:11:39,952
Remember that I'm buying.

80
00:11:40,352 --> 00:11:41,022
Let's have coffee.

81
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:42,292
What will you have?

82
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:43,922
Regular coffee.

83
00:11:49,662 --> 00:11:51,002
What's that purse?

84
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,132
Your wife's?

85
00:11:53,702 --> 00:11:55,832
Yeah, it's my wife's.

86
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:58,502
You're sweet.
Even holding her bag for her.

87
00:11:58,502 --> 00:11:59,702
That's not it.

88
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:03,212
She threw her bag at me and disappeared.

89
00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:04,772
She disappeared?

90
00:12:04,772 --> 00:12:05,772
To where?

91
00:12:06,212 --> 00:12:07,382
Beats me.

92
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:09,682
She was walking in the lobby,

93
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:12,082
then frantically ran off,
saying she left something

94
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:14,622
in the restroom, and hasn't returned.

95
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,792
What about her phone?

96
00:12:17,122 --> 00:12:19,262
Her phone is in her purse.

97
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:21,462
She's not in the restroom.

98
00:12:25,332 --> 00:12:26,462
She'll be back.

99
00:12:27,802 --> 00:12:30,772
She might have met someone.

100
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:32,942
Or she might have really left something.

101
00:12:33,772 --> 00:12:35,872
I don't understand her.

102
00:12:36,242 --> 00:12:39,612
I wanted to see her and say hello.

103
00:12:39,812 --> 00:12:40,982
No need.

104
00:12:40,982 --> 00:12:42,212
Still.

105
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:44,812
I also wanted to see how prickly she is.

106
00:12:44,812 --> 00:12:46,082
Seriously.

107
00:12:47,322 --> 00:12:50,552
I don't know
when she'll lose her temper.

108
00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:54,492
What should I do on days like this?

109
00:12:54,492 --> 00:12:55,732
You're good at things like this.

110
00:12:55,932 --> 00:12:56,892
Just...

111
00:12:57,232 --> 00:12:58,702
Go with a straightforward tactic.

112
00:12:59,602 --> 00:13:01,062
What's that?

113
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:04,402
Say what you always think,

114
00:13:04,402 --> 00:13:06,242
but can't say out loud.

115
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:08,942
Thank you for your effort. I'm sorry.

116
00:13:09,712 --> 00:13:10,972
I love you.

117
00:13:11,302 --> 00:13:12,122
Things like that.

118
00:13:13,842 --> 00:13:16,012
You know everything.

119
00:13:16,452 --> 00:13:18,222
You'll live well when you get married.

120
00:13:18,222 --> 00:13:19,222
Forget it.

121
00:13:19,922 --> 00:13:21,552
- I'll be going now, sir.
- Bye.

122
00:13:24,252 --> 00:13:25,562
Oh, Jun-hyuk.

123
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:29,762
Those kids from earlier.

124
00:13:29,762 --> 00:13:31,462
The stand-in service.

125
00:13:33,362 --> 00:13:35,002
How much does it cost?

126
00:13:35,002 --> 00:13:37,132
It depends on the job,
but it's not that much.

127
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:40,602
Why? You want to use the service?

128
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:41,872
Oh, no.

129
00:13:41,872 --> 00:13:43,642
I was just curious.

130
00:13:48,952 --> 00:13:50,452
I got their business card.

131
00:13:52,422 --> 00:13:55,322
I won't have any use for it.

132
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,322
Stop by later.

133
00:13:58,822 --> 00:14:00,322
Take a look.

134
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:03,132
Stop laughing. Get going.

135
00:14:03,132 --> 00:14:04,662

Leave first.

00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:35,392
It'll be weird if someone
sees us leaving together.

146

Did you take the handkerchief?

00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:45,632
I left it in your mail box.

00:17:04,012 --> 00:17:05,012
You didn't even pick up.

154
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:06,242
Don't get me started.

155
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:08,082
I ran into my sister.

156
00:17:08,082 --> 00:17:09,512
I was stuck with her

157
00:17:09,982 --> 00:17:12,182
and barely got out,
saying I had to go to work.

Hello.

This is my mother.

00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:16,452
Hello.

162
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,362
Wow, you look so pretty.

163
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:20,262
Right?

164
00:17:20,262 --> 00:17:21,822
You're so pretty, too.

165
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:23,762
It was bad without me, huh?

166
00:17:23,762 --> 00:17:24,962
Forget it.

167
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:26,562
Why is Soon-gyu here?

168
00:17:26,932 --> 00:17:29,002
I don't know.
She's here for someone's wedding.

169
00:17:29,572 --> 00:17:32,172
She might just call you.

170
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,342
Then just make something up.

171
00:17:34,742 --> 00:17:37,172
It'd be best if you
don't run into each other.

172
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:39,512
Okay. I'm going to leave soon.

173
00:17:44,112 --> 00:17:45,152
Oh, she's so pretty.

174
00:17:45,152 --> 00:17:46,452
You have great taste.

175
00:18:09,142 --> 00:18:11,242
Do you smell cigarettes?

176
00:18:14,382 --> 00:18:15,582
I don't know.

177
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:20,092
I guess I have rhinitis.

178
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:29,102
The lyrics are our story.

179
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,002
Be quiet.

180
00:18:41,442 --> 00:18:43,042
Did I tell you I met Jun-hyuk,

181
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:46,112
my subordinate at work?

182
00:18:47,682 --> 00:18:48,542
Huh?

183
00:18:49,152 --> 00:18:50,152
Yes.

184
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,322
He told me something interesting.

185
00:18:53,722 --> 00:18:55,892
Have you heard about stand-in service?

186
00:18:59,092 --> 00:19:00,092
So

187
00:19:00,962 --> 00:19:05,432
you get paid to act as
a family member or friend.

188
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:08,002
You remember that guy?

189
00:19:10,002 --> 00:19:11,002
Who?

190
00:19:11,702 --> 00:19:15,672
The guy holding
a big balloon in the lobby.

191
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:19,142
He was holding a lips-shaped balloon.

192
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:22,052
He had long hair and
looked like a model.

193
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:26,682
Yeah.

194
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:30,452
Anyway, he has a friend.

195
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:34,562
A girl with a tiny face who looks like

196
00:19:34,722 --> 00:19:35,722
a celebrity.

197
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:39,302
They do that kind of thing.

198
00:19:40,102 --> 00:19:41,832
Seriously.

199
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:44,832
There are various jobs
these days, right?

200
00:19:46,472 --> 00:19:47,472
Yes.

201
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:52,712
They not only do jobs like this,

202
00:19:53,112 --> 00:19:55,882
but also act as a lover

203
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:58,582
to lonely old men and women.

204
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:01,822
Since weddings
don't make that much money.

205
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:05,622
The guy and girl

206
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:08,222
both wore designer clothes
from head to toe.

207
00:20:09,232 --> 00:20:11,032
On my way in,

208
00:20:11,332 --> 00:20:13,502
I saw them work a bit.

209
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:15,732
Wow, they were

210
00:20:15,732 --> 00:20:17,332
total professionals.

211
00:20:17,802 --> 00:20:18,602
You know

212
00:20:18,602 --> 00:20:21,002
the guy who held the balloon?

213
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:23,872
He read a letter
representing the friends' side.

214
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:27,912
I listened, knowing he was fake,

215
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:30,482
but I almost cried.

216
00:20:34,782 --> 00:20:37,522
If kids like them come at you,

217
00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:41,662
people like us will sway and fall.

218
00:20:44,962 --> 00:20:46,732
Who is "people like us"?

219
00:20:48,002 --> 00:20:49,002
Huh?

220
00:20:51,372 --> 00:20:53,102
Are people like us

221
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:55,072
me?

222
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:58,612
What's with you this time?

223
00:20:58,612 --> 00:20:59,942
You're so sensitive.

224
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,612
I was just telling you
in case you were bored.

225
00:21:04,352 --> 00:21:07,252
I was talking about normal people.

226
00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:24,032
Let's give them a round of applause.

227
00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:33,592
It was a touching performance
by great men.

228
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,692
Aren't you going to ask?

229
00:21:44,852 --> 00:21:45,852
About what?

230
00:21:46,162 --> 00:21:47,592
Who hired me.

231
00:21:49,232 --> 00:21:50,912
It must be your client.

232
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:58,502
Why are you picking a fight?

233
00:21:58,502 --> 00:22:01,302
I'm tired because I worked all day.

234
00:22:02,102 --> 00:22:03,712
Are you really not interested in me?

235
00:22:03,712 --> 00:22:05,642
Do I have to be?

236
00:22:07,312 --> 00:22:08,312
No.

237
00:22:10,182 --> 00:22:13,222
It's been so long that
a guy wasn't interested.

238
00:22:13,222 --> 00:22:14,452
It's strange.

239
00:22:14,452 --> 00:22:16,192
Change that kind of thinking.

240
00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:17,652
It's getting old.

241
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:19,662
It's true.

242
00:22:24,592 --> 00:22:26,902
Just is interested in me.

243
00:22:28,562 --> 00:22:31,332
You're so nice to him when he's present.

244
00:22:31,702 --> 00:22:34,142
But not when he's gone.

245
00:22:36,212 --> 00:22:37,772
He seems interested in me, right?

246
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:39,942
It doesn't matter if he is or not.

247
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:41,582
Just is off limits.

248
00:22:41,582 --> 00:22:43,452
Don't you dare touch him.

249
00:22:43,452 --> 00:22:44,482
If you do, you're dead.

250
00:22:44,982 --> 00:22:45,982
Why?

251
00:22:45,982 --> 00:22:47,782
What do you mean, why?

252
00:22:50,322 --> 00:22:51,522
He's my soulmate.

253
00:22:56,062 --> 00:22:57,962
He's someone that must not be defiled.

254
00:22:57,962 --> 00:23:00,702
Right. You get what I'm saying.

255
00:23:02,922 --> 00:23:04,902
I'm the female version of Lee Gang-jae.

256
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,992
The person who hired me.

257
00:23:25,592 --> 00:23:27,992
We met for the first time today.

258
00:23:28,932 --> 00:23:30,562
But I guess he found me attractive.

259
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:31,932
Congratulations.

260
00:23:33,062 --> 00:23:35,362
He asked me about
my relationship with you.

261
00:23:35,802 --> 00:23:38,632
You told him that it was nothing, right?

262
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,772
That we're business partners.

263
00:23:42,372 --> 00:23:44,072
I said you were my boyfriend.

264
00:23:49,452 --> 00:23:52,252
He said he wanted to date me
if I had no boyfriend.

265
00:23:53,152 --> 00:23:55,422
He asked how much I was per hour.

266
00:23:57,792 --> 00:23:59,422
That's why I said that.

267
00:23:59,422 --> 00:24:00,962
It'd be humiliating

268
00:24:01,762 --> 00:24:03,162
if I seemed lacking.

269
00:24:04,662 --> 00:24:06,602
Does it make it better
if I'm your boyfriend?

270
00:24:10,702 --> 00:24:12,642
It's better than not having one.

271
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:18,642
How much are you per hour?

272
00:24:19,742 --> 00:24:21,442
Why do you ask?

273
00:24:22,982 --> 00:24:24,282
I'm more expensive than you.

274
00:24:25,252 --> 00:24:26,452
So how much is that?

275
00:24:26,582 --> 00:24:28,102
What's up with you?

276
00:24:29,122 --> 00:24:31,292
It depends on the situation.

277
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:34,162
You want an exact price list?

278
00:24:41,902 --> 00:24:45,202
If I ask you to be with me for one hour,

279
00:24:46,272 --> 00:24:47,702
how much is that?

280
00:25:00,222 --> 00:25:01,782
If it's starting now,

281
00:25:03,892 --> 00:25:06,962
I don't know what you
want to do with me,

282
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,832
but you'll have to
pay for the cab first.

283
00:25:13,902 --> 00:25:15,002
Okay.

284
00:25:17,832 --> 00:25:19,202

Huh?

295
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,842
Did you do something wrong?

296
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,072
Something wrong?

297
00:26:29,472 --> 00:26:30,912
I do something wrong

all the time.

My daughter tells me

305
00:28:18,052 --> 00:28:20,352
to stop doing this work.

306
00:28:20,522 --> 00:28:22,182
She hates it.

00:28:22,622 --> 00:28:24,692
But I'm acquisitive.

308
00:28:27,322 --> 00:28:29,522
I'm doing it because of my greed.

309
00:28:31,532 --> 00:28:32,632
Okay.

310
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:35,902
I was coming from the doctor's office.

311
00:28:36,502 --> 00:28:39,972
Someone had thrown a box away so neatly.

312
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,812
It looked like it might rain.

313
00:28:43,812 --> 00:28:44,852
And I thought

314
00:28:45,412 --> 00:28:47,092
someone might take it.

315
00:28:49,112 --> 00:28:50,412
So I was greedy

316
00:28:50,982 --> 00:28:52,382

You know why we moved
out of here a year ago?

477
00:43:58,622 --> 00:44:01,222
I lived with you two. Of course I know.

478
00:44:02,592 --> 00:44:04,762
Mom, I am a total traitor

479

to Bu-jeong.

480
00:44:11,202 --> 00:44:14,212
That's why I got you
a new place with my money.

481
00:44:15,902 --> 00:44:17,412
But to be honest,

482
00:44:17,642 --> 00:44:19,072
it's not like

483
00:44:19,072 --> 00:44:22,282
you actually had an affair.

484
00:44:22,482 --> 00:44:24,912
If you had, I'd be on
my knees in front of her.

485
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,112
All you did

486
00:44:26,352 --> 00:44:28,652
was meet with
your ex-girlfriend a few times

487
00:44:28,652 --> 00:44:30,552
and talked on the phone.

488
00:44:30,552 --> 00:44:32,422
But she goes to see a shrink

489
00:44:32,522 --> 00:44:34,762
and has a miscarriage because of that.

490
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,932
That means she has OCD.

491
00:44:39,462 --> 00:44:41,802
I'm not saying this
because you're my son.

492
00:44:42,002 --> 00:44:43,802
But it's not like you
shacked up with her

493
00:44:43,802 --> 00:44:45,772
or gave her a ton of money.

494
00:44:46,002 --> 00:44:47,602
With no particular emotions,

495
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:50,002
you met a few times,
but she couldn't take that...

496
00:44:50,002 --> 00:44:51,442
No, Mom.

497
00:44:55,412 --> 00:44:57,112
I like Gyeong-eun.

498
00:44:59,382 --> 00:45:01,082
I mean, I liked her.

499
00:45:03,622 --> 00:45:06,222
If she had accepted me...

500
00:45:06,692 --> 00:45:08,492
Then what?

501
00:45:11,962 --> 00:45:13,902
If she had accepted me...

502
00:45:14,432 --> 00:45:15,402
You crazy bastard!

503
00:45:15,402 --> 00:45:16,332
What?

504
00:45:16,332 --> 00:45:17,702
What if she was okay with it,
you bastard?

505
00:45:17,702 --> 00:45:19,332
Why are you getting worked up?

506
00:45:19,332 --> 00:45:21,172
How dare you say such a thing?

507
00:45:21,172 --> 00:45:22,272

You gutless bastard!

510
00:45:25,772 --> 00:45:27,242
You have no self-respect!

511
00:45:27,242 --> 00:45:29,442
You call yourself an adult?

512
00:45:30,382 --> 00:45:32,252
You don't have to do that.

513
00:45:33,182 --> 00:45:34,852
You have to go.

514
00:45:35,152 --> 00:45:37,352
I'm doing this because I'm bored.

515
00:45:37,922 --> 00:45:39,652
You don't have to pay me.

516
00:45:49,802 --> 00:45:51,902
Have you quit being an idol singer?

517
00:45:52,302 --> 00:45:53,302
Me?

518
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:54,442
Yes.

519
00:45:55,442 --> 00:45:57,012
Yes, I quit.

520
00:45:57,872 --> 00:45:59,572
But I've never started.

521
00:45:59,572 --> 00:46:01,482
So I don't know if I can say I quit.

522
00:46:02,612 --> 00:46:04,682
Why did you quit?

523
00:46:06,452 --> 00:46:08,022
There's no future.

524
00:46:10,092 --> 00:46:11,192
You see,

525
00:46:11,692 --> 00:46:13,292
in the idol group market,

526
00:46:13,622 --> 00:46:16,122
the CEO is the same for decades,

527
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:20,432
but the kids change like products,

528
00:46:21,032 --> 00:46:24,172
rising and falling.

529
00:46:25,432 --> 00:46:27,502
It doesn't matter
if they're popular at first.

530
00:46:27,502 --> 00:46:29,442
They can't last for 30 years.

531
00:46:29,572 --> 00:46:32,042
An idol group isn't Cheetos.

532
00:46:36,812 --> 00:46:37,812
So

533
00:46:38,312 --> 00:46:40,182
I'm going to become a CEO.

534
00:46:40,852 --> 00:46:42,522
Oh, a CEO.

535
00:46:45,992 --> 00:46:48,192
I ran a few scenarios in my head.

536
00:46:48,422 --> 00:46:49,622
Want to hear?

537
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:52,532
First,

538
00:46:52,532 --> 00:46:55,902
my YouTube channel
becomes a great success.

539
00:46:56,162 --> 00:46:59,132
With that as momentum, I become CEO.

540
00:46:59,132 --> 00:47:01,602
Or I get a job at an agency,

541
00:47:01,602 --> 00:47:05,072
climb the corporate ladder
and become CEO.

542
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:06,812
Or

543
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:10,082
I marry the CEO of the biggest agency,

544
00:47:10,382 --> 00:47:11,852
and inherit it.

545
00:47:14,922 --> 00:47:16,182
What do you think is the best?

546
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:21,992
I don't know.

547
00:47:26,092 --> 00:47:28,992
I should ask Lee Gang-jae about this.

548
00:47:39,912 --> 00:47:41,642
How could you do this to me?

549
00:47:42,082 --> 00:47:43,882
I'm sick and tired of this.

550
00:47:43,982 --> 00:47:45,852
How dare you do this
in front of the kids?

551
00:47:47,022 --> 00:47:49,952
No, you kids go inside.

552
00:47:50,282 --> 00:47:51,752
I'll take care of this.

553
00:48:03,032 --> 00:48:05,172
What am I going to do?

beaten up these days.

567

Beaten up on the bed,

568

Does the writer hate me?

569
00:49:20,882 --> 00:49:23,112
I think it's because ratings are good.

570
00:49:23,112 --> 00:49:25,712
