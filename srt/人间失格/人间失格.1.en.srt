Part 1 The Right to Be Human

3
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,920
Choose a room, then choose form of rent

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,920
Rent for 3 hours: KRW 30,000
Rent for the night: KRW 60,000

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,220
Reserve

6
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,590
My Daughter
Arrived at academy

7
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,330
I love you

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:47,400
...

9
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,130
Hello, Ma'am.

10
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:58,109
Ever since I last saw you,

11
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,180
I've been thinking about the right to be human.

12
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,280
Not a family member,

13
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,150
a friend,

14
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,790
or a colleague,

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,389
but the right to be a human being.

16
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,560
Your time is up.

17
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,830
I'm afraid I have to go.

18
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,480
Then why did you come all the way here?

19
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,850
It's my duty to do my best

20
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,760
in satisfying my customers.

21
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,120
So I came here.

22
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,810
I'll extend my time.

23
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,600
How's that?

24
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,370
I have another appointment

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,270
after this.

26
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,540
And going to a second location is illegal.

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,590
Wait.

28
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,730
I'll leave first.

29
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,520
For you.

30
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,800
Please leave a good review!

31
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,300
The right given only to people

32
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,540
who bide by the rules of society

33
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:17,580
and proudly set forth their names.

34
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,210
The right to judge the world,

35
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,250
criticize,

36
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,710
be enraged

37
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,950
and despair.

38
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,410
Just

39
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,650
The right that you have

40
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,150
and I don't.

41
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,180
I've been thinking about that.

42
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,020
But Ma'am...

43
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,820
What is that world you speak of?

44
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,790
And what is that human being?

45
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,760
Does...

46
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,200
...that even really exist?

47
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,670
Just
Did you...get the call...?

48
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,610
Did you get the call?

49
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,650
Hey, Gang-jae.

50
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,450
What's with all the dots?

51
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,350
What call?

52
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,180
Oh, well...

53
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,700
What's up?

54
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,460
Did you and Soon-gyu fight?

55
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,080
No, it's nothing like that.

56
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,410
Then what is it?

57
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,810
Did she find out...

58
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,450
You found that bastard, right?

59
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,880
That bastard?

60
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,920
Is that bastard...

61
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,420
Jeong...Jeong-woo?

62
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,760
I'm right.

63
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,860
Wow.

64
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,060
I've got goosebumps.

65
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,560
I dozed off

66
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,230
for a moment

67
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,200
and in my dream, I met that bastard.

68
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,910
You met Jeong-woo in your dream?

69
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,910
Well, I ran into him on the street.

70
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,940
From behind, I could tell it was Jeong-woo.

71
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,710
You know how he hunches his back and stands crooked.

72
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,780
So...

73
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,580
Did you

74
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,250
speak with him?

75
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,520
Yes.

76
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,000
I asked what he did with my money for two months.

77
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,220
And then?

78
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,360
And then...

79
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,910
He cried.

80
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,810
He cried?

81
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,610
Jeong-woo cried?

82
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,080
Yes, he cried.

83
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,620
I don't know if it was because he felt sorry.

84
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,660
Well, Gang-jae...

85
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,830
Hey.

86
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,970
What's taking you so long?

87
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,070
Just a sec.

88
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,910
Gang-jae.

89
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,970
I'll call you back right away.

90
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,140
He's so young, but he's so constipated.

91
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,560
Jeez, you blockhead.

92
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,460
Spicy chicken goes on this side.

93
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,890
How many times do I have to tell you?

94
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,860
When did you tell me about spicy chicken?

95
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,760
I just opened this.

96
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,730
Red east, white west.

97
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,270
Red food is placed to the east.

98
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,640
You don't know where east is, do you?

99
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,710
Of course I know!

100
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,840
Where is it?

101
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,680
To the right.

102
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,210
Then where does the pickled radish go?

103
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,750
Radish?

104
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,550
For the chicken?

105
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,650
Yes!

106
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,830
Hey, where are you going?

107
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,590
Wait, Brother.

108
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,000
Where are you going? Want me to go with you?

109
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,899
You're calling him "Brother"?

110
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,899
The thumbprint on your divorce papers is still fresh.

111
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,470
Not, it's not. It'll be over three months tomorrow.

112
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,670
Hey, where are you going?

113
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,610
I'll go buy a cake.

114
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,040
- Cake?
- Should I tag along?

115
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,050
Oh, right. Get cheese cake.

116
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,580
Why put cheese cake on the ancestral rites table?

117
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,850
It's too rich.

118
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,920
My mom loves that kind of food.

119
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,390
Where does the cheese cake go?

120
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,630
The east or the west?

121
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,530
If it's cheese...

122
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,270
You don't know.

123
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,710
Where should I put it?

124
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,810
(Here?)

125
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:11,430
Jo Min-jee (Gangnam, 44)

126
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,070
Bae Yoon-hee (Mok-dong, 36)
You're on your way, right? If you're late, it's over.

127
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,140
Bae Yoon-hee (Mok-dong, 36)
You're on your way, right? If you're late, it's over.

128
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,090
Deluxe taxi

129
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,240
So where is that bastard Jeong-woo?

130
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,010
What should I do?

131
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,750
Are you crying?

132
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,060
Gang-jae...

133
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,560
Jeong-woo...

134
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,530
Jeong-woo what?

135
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,200
Did he use up all my money?

136
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,350
Well...

137
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,440
Well what?

138
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,770
Hey, you're called Just for a reason. Just spit it out.

139
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,380
Stop scaring me.

140
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,780
Hold on.

141
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,860
I got a call

142
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,430
from the police a moment ago.

143
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,460
They couldn't reach anyone.

144
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,070
So I ended up getting the call.

145
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,860
He's dead, right?

146
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,690
They fished out a car from a reservoir in Gyeonggi-do.

147
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,860
Jeong-woo and...

148
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,500
...a woman...

149
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,370
Those two were in the car.

150
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,670
Was it an accident?

151
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,970
No.

152
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,350
They were holding hands

153
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,820
and a scarf was tied to hold their wrists together.

154
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,460
So it doesn't look like an accident.

155
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:21,990
Sir.

156
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,600
Get out.

157
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,060
Excuse me.

158
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,490
19th floor, right?

159
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,750
I think I saw you in the elevator.

160
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,520
Yes.

161
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,980
Who was the woman?

162
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,310
The door has closed.

163
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,750
A client?

164
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,020
Your manager is here.

165
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,390
I don't know. I'll find out at the police station.

166
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,060
You have to go to the police station?

167
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,160
No way.

168
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,190
I can't send Just alone.

169
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,560
Right.

170
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,270
He's a little...

171
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,370
Hey, you lent Jeong-woo money.

172
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,970
You won't be getting it back.

173
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,970
Too bad.

174
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,250
How much was it?

175
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,310
KRW 20 mil.? KRW 30 mil.?

176
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,980
You're so heartless.

177
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,280
A man died and that's all you're curious about?

178
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,580
You crazy?

179
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,220
My grandma said the living must live.

180
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,760
A girl like you had a grandmother?

181
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,760
What the?

182
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,630
Despite what you see,

183
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,070
my grandma raised me until I was 10.

184
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,430
Then I guess your character

185
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,500
hit rock bottom after 10.

186
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,270
I'm ready to order now!

187
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,770
Why? What are you doing?

188
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,080
Don't order anything.

189
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,210
Why not?

190
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,840
We'll just drink water and leave.

191
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,210
A cup of water, please.

192
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,550
Green tea is free, right?

193
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,120
Order something, too.

194
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,120
Give him a cup of green tea.

195
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,090
Okay.

196
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
Today's work begins at 4PM.
Begin work

197
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,820
Requests
Take a bath before coming into my house

198
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,190
What do I have to do today?

199
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,590
Just sit here cordially, then leave.

200
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,920
Perfume prohibited
Don't wake me up

201
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,230
That's so vague.

202
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,960
I need to know the set-up to act.

203
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,730
I met a woman while doing the proxy service.

204
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,940
You were her boyfriend?

205
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,240
Family?

206
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,920
I was a family member.

207
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,610
I was hired to act like a family member.

208
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,480
This Year's Popular Movie Star Award Park Ji-na

209
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,580
I met her a few more times on a deeper level.

210
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,140
So?

211
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,080
Her boyfriend's wife

212
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,890
saw me go into her house.

213
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,000
Her boyfriend's wife?

214
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,430
Hmm...

215
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,860
Then her boyfriend is married,

216
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,730
and if his wife saw you,

217
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,300
that means his wife and your woman are friends.

218
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,100
You're really quick with this kind of matter.

219
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,270
So?

220
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,860
You want me to act like your girlfriend

221
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,020
in front of her?

222
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,710
So the husband will hear about it?

223
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,950
Something like that.

224
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,350
Jeez. She should just break up with him.

225
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,720
She's so pathetic.

226
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,320
She can't because of all

227
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,130
the expensive things she wants.

228
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,630
Things she wants?

229
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,690
Total KRW 1.99 mil.

230
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,000
- Yeah, things she wants.
- KRW 1.99 mil.?

231
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,010
Then she can't break up.

232
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,939
Excuse me.

233
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,179
In 10 minutes,

234
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,120
a guest will arrive.

235
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,719
Oh.

236
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,150
Then what should I do?

237
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,120
Leave for now.

238
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,190
How about working an extra hour next time?

239
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,230
Okay, then.

240
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,030
I'll put these in the dressing room and leave.

241
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,130
Okay. Leave within 5 minutes.

242
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,670
Yes, Ma'am.

243
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,910
They're here.

244
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,620
What are you doing?

245
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,490
What?

246
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,920
Just go with it.

247
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,160
Huh? You must be crazy.

248
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,390
Gang-jae!

249
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,200
What are you doing here?

250
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,430
Oh, hi!

251
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,800
What brings you here?

252
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,480
I came to grab a bite.

253
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,330
Say hi. This is my cousin.

254
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,470
Oh.

255
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,240
Hello.

256
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,180
Oh, hello.

257
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,140
- She's my friend from high school.
- Oh.

258
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,380
How is Auntie doing?

259
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,650
Oh, she's fine.

260
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,850
Who is she?

261
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,290
My cousin.

262
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,720
Your girlfriend?

263
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,160
Nonsense. She's an old buddy.

264
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,070
I'm kidding.

265
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,750
My girlfriend.

266
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,000
- Say hi.
- Hello.

267
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,370
Hello.

268
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,910
She's my cousin.

269
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,640
Just

270
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,780
How can a cleaning lady

271
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,920
come into a facility for residents

272
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,490
and wash in the same bathtub as us?

273
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,630
Are you saying our staff used the bathhouse?

274
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,660
No, not the staff.

275
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,830
The cleaning ladies most residents hire privately.

276
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,110
Seriously, I'm confused.

277
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,910
It seems like there are no rules.

278
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,210
You should have basic manners.

279
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,480
Yes, Ma'am?

280
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,780
I'm returning the key.

281
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,190
Why make a good person like me

282
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:07,060
become a bully on a power trip?

283
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,030
They're all low lives.

284
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:13,760
I'm sorry.

285
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,430
Should I call you after investigating?

286
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,100
Missed calls
Mother-in-law

287
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,870
There's no need to call me.

288
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,500
Put up a warning sign

289
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,740
or make a PA announcement.

290
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,480
Then I'll make sure it's taken care of.

291
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,410
Your name?

292
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,780
Lee Bu-jeong.

293
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,690
Jin Jeong-su
Mom is desperately waiting for your call.

294
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,910
Oh, my.

295
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,860
Does Seo Jin-seop live here?

296
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,530
Ma'am?

297
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:51,630
The actor Seo Jin-seop.

298
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,700
Jeong A-ran's husband.

299
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,740
They're on the same soap opera these days.

300
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,110
We don't know...

301
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,080
Did they move here?

302
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,010
Where do you think she is?

303
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,850
She went to work, so she'd be at her office.

304
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,980
You didn't call her office again, did you?

305
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,260
You don't have to yell at me.

306
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,130
I'll talk to you later, Mom.

307
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,500
I'm so busy that I don't even have time to breathe.

308
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,060
I texted her, so she'll call...

309
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,070
Hello?

310
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,570
She's so fiery.

311
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,740
Wife
Mom is desperately waiting for your call.

312
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,740
Wife

313
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,190
She still hasn't changed her profile pic.

314
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,390
This is gross.

315
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,580
Why doesn't she reply to her texts?

316
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,890
Hello.

317
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,490
Sir!

318
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,760
Yes?

319
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,460
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

320
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,390
You called?

321
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,130
He's here.

322
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,830
Who's he?

323
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,930
Him.

324
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,470
Nails.

325
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,770
Oh.

326
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,640
Look at me.

327
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,640
Teeth.

328
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,140
Okay.

329
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,190
Good. Let's go.

330
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,320
He's waiting.

331
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,480
Where's the tall one?

332
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,050
Did he do the nail inspection again?

333
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,120
Yes.

334
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,990
He said to hurry and call the tall one, right?

335
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,990
Yes.

336
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,120
Why isn't he here already?

337
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,360
Hello, Sir.

338
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,170
Is there something making you uncomfortable?

339
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,470
Stop smiling.

340
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,500
Sir?

341
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,010
You're asking if I'm uncomfortable.

342
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,770
So how can you feel good?

343
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,410
Oh, I'm sorry.

344
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,480
I will never smile again.

345
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,280
Oh.

346
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,090
If you're selling food, you have to be neat and tidy.

347
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
Painting your nails red

348
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,690
and splattering yourself with perfume...

349
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,830
That's wrong.

350
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,460
Very ignorant behavior.

351
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,960
Yes, yes. You're right.

352
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,230
You're running this place upright, clean

353
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,210
and on a good conscience, right?

354
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,330
Yes, Sir.

355
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,770
Goodbye, Sir.

356
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,850
Good work.

357
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,920
Hee-sun!

358
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,950
How could this happen?

359
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,660
Rest in peace

360
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,050
Funeral Service

361
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,830
You should've come to your mother!

362
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,030
Why are you lying here?

363
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,060
Hee-sun...

364
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,760
That woman...

365
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,630
I heard her name was Hee-sun.

366
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,350
Her son's name is Min-su.

367
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,800
When I talked about her with Jeong-woo,

368
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:47,080
I just called her Baby Mama.

369
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,210
Did you know?

370
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,790
No. He didn't tell me.

371
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,990
I guess he was embarrassed.

372
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,560
Stop snooping.

373
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,170
I heard what the police said earlier.

374
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,770
The woman's family doesn't know Jeong-woo at all.

375
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,910
They just think

376
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,740
they met online and committed

377
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,100
suicide together.

378
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,980
Or they might be pretending that they don't know him.

379
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,380
I heard the son is very sick.

380
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,850
It's just for one day. Just today.

381
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,220
What happened today that you want to stay out?

382
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,550
Are you crazy?

383
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,060
Think however you want.

384
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,990
I really just can't

385
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,930
go home today.

386
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:46,860
Woo-nam has the night shift, so I'm alone.

387
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,000
He hung up, that bastard.

388
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,870
I told you to go home. Why stay out?

389
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,370
How can I go home at a time like this?

390
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,740
Be good to Soon-gyu.

391
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,780
If not, you might become like Jeong-woo.

392
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,920
I have you.

393
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,660
That's funny, but since you

394
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,090
didn't say you'll live longer than me,

395
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,250
I'll let that slide.

396
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,500
About Jeong-woo...

397
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,300
Are we leaving him like this?

398
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,400
The police said they'll take care of it

399
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,650
all at once later.

400
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,070
No, I'm not talking about that.

401
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
Gang-jae.

402
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,980
If Jeong-woo

403
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,850
had a mother, would it be different?

404
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,190
Why are you asking me that?

405
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,530
At least you have a mom.

406
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,160
Seeing that woman's family,

407
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,400
I noticed her mother weeping the saddest.

408
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,940
By now, she's probably

409
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,210
holding a funeral with her family.

410
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:09,140
I saw earlier how they were

411
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,650
calling relatives, looking for a funeral hall.

412
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,710
They were in a frenzy.

413
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,050
What's the use of all that when you're dead?

414
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,400
Right.

415
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,770
But still,

416
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,270
they died at the same time in the same way.

417
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,800
But right now, it's so different.

418
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,390
Jeong-woo

419
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,410
always told me he felt

420
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,440
empty.

421
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,350
When I just saw his face earlier...

422
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,390
Did you think it, too?

423
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,260
Think what?

424
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,220
Jeong-woo is in there, thinking,

425
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,730
'Okay, it's my turn.'

426
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,770
'I wonder who showed up.'

427
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,930
He's waiting expectantly.

428
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,780
But then he looks

429
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,310
and sees it's us.

430
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,710
What about us?

431
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,610
What about Jeong-woo?

432
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,180
Think he might be disappointed?

433
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,550
Not disappointed. Just...

434
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,820
Empty.

435
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:29,990
Come on, why feel so empty?

436
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,200
Also, Jeong-woo said

437
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,860
he had a rich sister in Seoul

438
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,470
and his father is a realtor in Daejeon.

439
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,210
How can no one come?

440
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,380
No mother.

441
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,040
Not even a grandmother.

442
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,410
Whatever.

443
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,650
I can stand in for weddings 10 times,

444
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,420
but never for a funeral.

445
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,050
Do you know how much it costs to

446
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,990
set up a ceremonial table and cremate someone?

447
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,300
So how much is it?

448
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,710
Go find out.

449
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,580
Lee Gang-jae, you...

450
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,610
I really just can't help

451
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,280
but respect you.

452
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,760
You're awesome.

453
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,900
Stop right there.

454
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,350
Open the door!

455
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,100
How dare you ignore me!

456
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,470
I said open the door!

457
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,690
Mom!

458
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,030
Bu-jeong!

459
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,130
What are you two doing?

460
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,240
Why did she lock this part?

461
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,340
Mom! Bu-jeong!

462
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,970
Open the door!

463
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,670
What are you two doing?

464
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,820
Open the door, quick!

465
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,780
Seriously.

466
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,180
Sir, perhaps

467
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,610
it would be best to smash the lock.

468
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,850
What?

469
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,880
Smash this?

470
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,850
Seems like something's going on in there.

471
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:42,320
I don't believe this!

472
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,720
What are you doing?

473
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,970
Open the door!

474
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,460
Mom! Seriously!

475
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,230
If I want to smash this,

476
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,230
do I need a hammer?

477
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,240
A hammer...

478
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,300
Should I run to the security office?

479
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,740
I can lend you ours.

480
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,510
Huh?

481
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,880
We have a lot of hammers.

482
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,980
Can you?

483
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,750
Come on, he's a kid.

484
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,420
Your mom isn't home yet?

485
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,420
No. They all come home after nine.

486
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:16,200
Then go back inside and do your homework.

487
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,990
I finished it already.

488
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,460
Still, go inside and do your homework.

489
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,600
Bu-jeong! Mom!

490
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,100
Seriously!

491
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,900
Mom!

492
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,540
That nasty witch.

493
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,240
What were you two doing?

494
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,280
Are you okay?

495
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,650
That one...

496
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,050
She's totally crazy.

497
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,320
What should we do, Jeong-su?

498
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,890
She's gone totally insane.

499
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,490
What did you say to her this time?

500
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,620
I didn't say anything.

501
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,490
Hey, I really

502
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,190
didn't say one word.

503
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,400
I barely opened my mouth.

504
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,060
You must've pushed her buttons again!

505
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,330
You bastard!

506
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,300
Whose son are you?

507
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,270
I told you I didn't do anything!

508
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,470
Okay, okay.

509
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,610
Thank you for your trouble.

510
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:04,940
You can leave now.

511
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,610
I'm sorry.

512
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,110
- I'm sorry.
- No problem.

513
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,610
- Goodbye.
- I'm sorry.

514
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,680
Excuse me.

515
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,770
If it's possible,

516
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,720
can you keep it down?

517
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,120
I didn't shout.

518
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,050
Of course.

519
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,450
Yes. I'm sorry.

520
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,050
- Thank you for your trouble.
- Sure.

521
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,660
Go inside.

522
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,990
Good.

523
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,830
What's this?

524
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,040
Why did she lock the door?

525
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,070
What's all this?

526
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:43,010
She thought I wasn't here

527
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,690
and put the double locks on the door

528
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,720
when she came in.

529
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,010
What is it this time?

530
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,750
She got something

531
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,420
from the police.

532
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,520
My only crime is asking her about this.

533
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,390
Summons

534
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,190
Why did you go and open someone else's letter?

535
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,930
Someone else's? You bastard.

536
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,100
I'm her mother-in-law.

537
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,130
Alright, Mom. And?

538
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,940
What do you mean, "and"?

539
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,070
That's it.

540
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:11,210
Alright. Let's talk later.

541
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,770
And keep it down.

542
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:15,110
She got mail from the police.

543
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,680
She's not at home.

544
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,750
She doesn't pick up her phone all day.

545
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,180
So when she came home,

546
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,580
I asked why she didn't pick up

547
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,990
and why her office number changed.

548
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,450
She suddenly screamed at me

549
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,970
and ripped that up.

550
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,660
She glared at me with rabid eyes.

551
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,200
Don't exaggerate.

552
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,910
How can she have rabid eyes?

553
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,530
I'm not exaggerating.

554
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,370
You didn't see her.

555
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,370
She might

556
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,840
be going mental again.

557
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,040
Mom!

558
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,200
Yikes!

559
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,270
If you say that one more time...

560
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,580
I'm calling it out like it is.

561
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,110
What's wrong with that?

562
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,610
Depression isn't going mental.

563
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,150
It's the same thing.

564
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,480
If depression isn't going mental,

565
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,880
then what is?

566
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,180
Stop talking nonsense

567
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,730
and go to another room for now.

568
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,720
Why come here without calling first?

569
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,290
It's our house.

570
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,330
It's my house that I got for you.

571
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,800
It's not like I live here with you.

572
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,400
I can't even stop by?

573
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,700
More precisely, you lent us half.

574
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,270
We paid back the other half.

575
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,640
I'm hopping mad as it is.

576
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,870
Are you egging me to die of anger?

577
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,810
Making my blood pressure rise? Bastard.

578
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,880
Mom, calm down and go to another room.

579
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,680
Go in. Go in.

580
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,480
You're not physically beating me,

581
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,280
but this is abuse, too...

582
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,650
He'll be the death of me.

583
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,120
That son. That bastard.

584
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,690
Even dogs are grateful and become loyal.

585
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,350
I didn't initiate it.

586
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,819
Your mother first

587
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,250
called me a crazy witch.

588
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:09,120
What came from the police?

589
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,460
It's nothing.

590
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,400
What's the summons?

591
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:20,830
Huh?

592
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,700
Using the communication network system...

593
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,470
I said it's nothing.

594
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,950
What's wrong?

595
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,120
I heard you shouting earlier.

596
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,220
I wasn't shouting.

597
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,190
Your mother went overboard.

598
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,220
So what is that?

599
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,420
Why does the police want you to come?

600
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,660
I said it's nothing. Stop asking.

601
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:47,230
If this isn't something, then what is?

602
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,370
They want to see me for some mean comments.

603
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,840
Mean comments?

604
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,040
On the internet?

605
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:01,910
Yes.

606
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,980
Wait.

607
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,450
What in the world did you write

608
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,150
to get sued for it?

609
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:16,220
I said don't live like that and go kill yourself.

610
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,290
Happy?

611
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,930
You wrote that? To who?

612
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,960
I don't know.

613
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,700
A celebrity?

614
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:32,070
Something like that.

615
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,640
It's a celebrity?

616
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,240
That's...

617
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,210
You'll know when you get older.

618
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,320
Why talk about age again?

619
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,820
When you're over 40, you'll have experienced

620
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,990
a tramp that you can never forgive.

621
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,960
Tramp?

622
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,240
A bad woman to me is a tramp.

623
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,500
It's not a cuss word.

624
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,600
Whatever.

625
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,100
So what do they want you to do?

626
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,770
Do what?

627
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:07,070
We need to fix this.

628
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,180
What's with all this sudden interested?

629
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,810
I'll take care of it, so back off.

630
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,250
Where are you going?

631
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,690
To my dad's. I'll be back after dinner.

632
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,220
Go comfort your mother.

633
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,260
But it's so late.

634
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,930
It's not even 8 o'clock.

635
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:28,230
Why are you overreacting today?

636
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,530
Did something happen again?

637
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,970
I'm not overreacting.

638
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,540
I was just saying it's late.

639
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,600
Things will die down quicker if I'm gone.

640
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
Right?

641
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,810
Text me when you get there.

642
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,900
Hello, Ma'am.

643
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,810
How was your day today?

644
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,410
Today,

645
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,860
if something even slightly

646
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,830
unfortunate happened to you,

647
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,000
then it probably was

648
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,610
because of my earnest prayer.

649
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,650
Relationships
Depression

650
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,380
Aftereffects of an accident
Conflict between generations

651
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,760
Personality problems

652
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,860
Huh? Hello!

653
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,190
Hi.

654
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,020
You're coming home from an academy?

655
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,260
Ju-ah, say hello.

656
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,840
These days,

657
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:20,470
I pray for you almost every day.

658
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,830
Hello, Ma'am...

659
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:46,870
When I get up in the morning...

660
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,820
When I open my eyes in the morning...

661
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,640
When I close my eyes at night...

662
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,930
When I watch TV...

663
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,020
When I eat a meal...

664
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,000
Welcome.

665
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,610
How can I help you?

666
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,870
In the subway on my way to work...

667
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:30,310
At my new workplace...

668
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,210
Whenever I have time...

669
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:37,650
I always pray earnestly.

670
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:42,430
Squeeze each one out and take it one at a time.

671
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,410
And right now...

672
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,680
I pray you become unhappy like me.

673
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:59,910
I pray every moment you breathe is hell.

674
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,080
I pray

675
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,760
you become like me.

676
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,650
Select transaction.

677
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,380
Short term loan withdrawal

678
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:13,020
Select the amount that you want.

679
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:16,890
KRW 100,000

680
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,390
Fee rate notification
Confirm

681
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,470
I pray to all the stars in the cloudy sky.

682
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,350
I pray to the stale wind blowing in the hill.

683
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,680
I pray to the abandoned land and filthy air.

684
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:37,760
And...

685
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,400
I pray to

686
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,160
all the bad people

687
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,380
that undoubtedly exist somewhere in this world.

688
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,440
Who is it?

689
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,020
Dad, your daughter's here.

690
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:22,760
Oh, what brings you here?

691
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,120
What about Jeong-su?

692
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,390
Dad.

693
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,360
It's just me. Forget about Jeong-su.

694
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,660
You're here alone?

695
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,660
Yes.

696
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,000
How about dinner?

697
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,600
You haven't eaten yet, huh?

698
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,810
No. I have no appetite.

699
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,040
Tada!

700
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:48,580
Chinese food delivers 24/7 nowadays, Dad.

701
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,780
Let's order in.

702
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,020
We should be frugal.

703
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,760
The economy is bad. Don't be wasteful.

704
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,960
Should we order sweet and sour pork?

705
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,160
Sweet and sour pork?

706
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,800
Yes.

707
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,600
They take credit cards, Dad.

708
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,160
But I have cash today.

709
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,030
I stopped by the bank.

710
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,570
You teased me for not having cash last time,

711
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,240
calling me a beggar.

712
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,610
I didn't call you a beggar.

713
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,610
Yes, you did.

714
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,740
So how much is the sweet and sour pork?

715
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,650
Well, it's...

716
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,850
Let's see...

717
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:21,950
It's no use suing me.

718
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,980
Order from the cheapest place.

719
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,850
If you sue me one more time,

720
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:28,320
I'll write your name in blood,

721
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,020
send it to a TV station

722
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,830
and kill myself.

723
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,260
If you want soup, you can have jjamppong.

724
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:38,570
Hearse
Funeral portrait

725
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:42,170
Mourning robes

726
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:47,370
KRW 700,000... KRW 2.7 mil...

727
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:49,740
Oh, this one's KRW 4.2 mil.

728
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,080
Is that one this?

729
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,080
Yes.

730
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,950
But the color is a bit blah.

731
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,780
The fit, too.

732
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,410
Horrific.

733
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,660
He loved fashion.

734
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,130
If this doesn't keep him from going to heaven,

735
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,800
I'll get clothes from home.

736
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,800
What?

737
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,400
Oh.

738
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:20,370
To get something cuter.

739
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,910
Thank you. Bye.

740
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,620
What's this?

741
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:27,150
I don't know if it's the poo

742
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:29,350
or the flies that are good.

743
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,810
They must be psychic.

744
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:32,710
What?

745
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:37,420
- Earlier from there...
- Do you need anything else?

746
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,160
Oh, no.

747
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,490
- No, thanks.
- It's okay.

748
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:44,570
Feel free to come to us if you need anything.

749
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:45,630
It's okay.

750
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,130
Thank you.

751
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,800
See?

752
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,440
You should just give them your business card.

753
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,770
They want you so bad.

754
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,440
He looks happy in this photo.

755
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:06,910
Looks good.

756
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,160
What's this?

757
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:21,830
A hymn?

758
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,800
So Jeong-woo can go to heaven?

759
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:26,810
How'd you know it's a hymn

760
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,150
if it says "Halleluiah"?

761
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,350
You'd know since your clients

762
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:31,780
have various religions.

763
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:34,610
Jeez. Don't get wise with me.

764
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,840
This isn't a hymn.

765
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,580
Don't you remember?

766
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,910
Jeong-woo sang this all the time.

767
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:42,680
His background music

768
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,490
and ring tone are all this song.

769
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:48,360
How come I can't remember anything?

770
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:51,330
Because you're so busy.

771
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,040
He was handsome.

772
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,810
Tall.

773
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:08,680
A good singer.

774
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,010
Eloquent.

775
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,110
Knowledgable.

776
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:15,720
He was good at golf.

777
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,890
- He was good at bowling, too.
- Yeah.

778
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,320
So what went wrong?

779
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,070
You were closer to him than I was.

780
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:34,030
Being close means nothing.

781
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:35,870
Where's everyone he was close with now?

782
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,900
Only you and I are here.

783
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,840
It's all futile.

784
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,180
But Jeong-woo was really good to us.

785
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:50,350
When we had no money,

786
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:54,420
he bought us good food

787
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,620
and gave us work.

788
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,300
Although he collected all at once in the end.

789
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,570
I lent him KRW 40 mil.

790
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:08,400
and you lent him KRW 5 mil.?

791
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,380
Yeah, about that much.

792
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,820
He borrowed from a bunch of people

793
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:14,480
and got two big ones.

794
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,620
You know what, Just?

795
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:30,490
What?

796
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:33,730
If I had two big ones

797
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:34,860
in cash...

798
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,360
KRW 200 mil.?

799
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,430
Yeah.

800
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:40,300
Then even if

801
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:43,910
I felt empty inside,

802
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:49,610
I wouldn't want to die.

803
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,200
Bastards with no money or family

804
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,060
shouldn't die. It's a nuisance.

805
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,440
Hey, but still,

806
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,640
if you ask that woman over there,

807
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:23,010
she'll probably hold your funeral for free.

808
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:24,250
So don't worry.

809
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:27,940
That's how you comfort me

810
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,720
on a gloomy day like this?

811
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,750
For you, I'll hold

812
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:36,160
an extravagant funeral like they're doing.

813
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,470
Don't you worry.

814
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,360
You said you'll die before I do.

815
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:45,700
But just look at the reality.

816
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,830
I don't smoke or drink.

817
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:50,970
I don't hang out with girls.

818
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:53,670
No doubt I'll live longer than you.

819
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,620
I quit smoking, too, jerk.

820
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:57,850
Give me one, too.

821
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,720
I have to go home and change

822
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,070
and also get Jeong-woo's shroud.

823
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:28,380
But I just don't want to move an inch.

824
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,420
I guess it's because I'm sad.

825
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,560
It's because you were

826
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,570
running around covering the cost.

827
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,660
I'll be back.

828
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,320
Is it okay

829
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,860
for you to be here without fixing dinner?

830
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,020
He's probably having fun with his mom.

831
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,920
How can you call her that?

832
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,930
If you divide sides, that really hurts.

833
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:55,430
Jeong-su doesn't care.

834
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,440
Oh, hi.

835
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,010
You seem busy.

836
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,940
What time is it now?

837
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,660
Is it a busy time?

838
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,630
You have a lot of customers?

839
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,960
I was wondering if you were stopping by later.

840
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:29,460
Isn't he strange?

841
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,360
Huh? Who?

842
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,830
The guy who just passed us.

843
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:35,970
We say hi whenever we see him, but he doesn't.

844
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:40,010
People living in Seoul don't say hi that often.

845
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:43,410
Why are you being so kind all of a sudden? No fun.

846
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:45,510
Huh? What did I do?

847
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,690
You said he's a playboy,

848
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,330
changing girls all the time.

849
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:51,420
Oh, dear.

850
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:55,960
Don't fret over someone else's son

851
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,820
and be good to Jeong-su.

852
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:58,860
Jeong-su, Jeong-su!

853
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,870
Aren't you tired of mentioning him?

854
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,400
Come on. Gangbuk isn't Pyongyang.

855
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,630
It doesn't take long to get there from Gangnam.

856
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:07,630
How can you say it's a hassle?

857
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,570
But still.

858
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:14,010
You're being so harsh.

859
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:15,700
Just come.

860
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,480
I'll stay until tomorrow morning.

861
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:19,750
Okay. Bye.

862
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,040
Okay.

863
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:04,020
I just don't want to call her "Mother."

864
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,160
Why?

865
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,230
My mom has died.

866
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:09,730
If I call Jeong-su's mother

867
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:11,410
"Mother,"

868
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,270
then my poor mom will hear that.

869
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:17,240
Why does that make her poor?

870
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,040
Mom is "Mom"

871
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,940
and your mother-in-law is "Mother."

872
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:24,680
"Mom" and "Mother" all belong to my mom.

873
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:28,250
Jeong-su calls me "Father."

874
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:31,140
He calls everyone "Father" and "Mother"

875
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,220
all day long. That's his job.

876
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:35,890
Don't talk down to your husband.

877
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:37,090
I'll scold you.

878
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:40,690
I'm 5 years older than him.

879
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,870
When he was in 6th grade, I was in 11th grade.

880
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:47,770
Still, don't talk down to him.

881
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:50,600
He talks down to me.

882
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,410
Do you think men are superior to women?

883
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,640
What?

884
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,640
Did you two fight again?

885
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,840
We don't fight anymore.

886
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,180
Why not?

887
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,620
It's strangely awkward when we're alone together.

888
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,190
Did that happen to you, too?

889
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:20,400
Dad!

890
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,040
Can you stop collecting boxes now?

891
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:27,640
You said no one's buying them now.

892
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:28,880
What do you mean?

893
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,340
There are still those who buy them.

894
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:33,650
Don't you watch TV?

895
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:35,750
They're worth less than KRW 30.

896
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,080
It's not worth your hard work.

897
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:42,260
It's my job. Don't tell me what to do.

898
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:43,960
Would you like it if I tell you

899
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,530
to quit the publishing house?

900
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:24,930
Dad.

901
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,400
Why do you keep calling me?

902
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:30,070
I'm out of breath.

903
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,540
If I quit

904
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:34,710
the publishing house,

905
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,510
will you quit doing this?

906
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:41,210
What are you talking about?

907
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:44,550
What do you mean? It's just as I said.

908
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:46,940
If I quit the publishing house,

909
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:48,860
will you quit doing this?

910
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,620
Why quit

911
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,760
a good job in this recession?

912
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,770
I'm quitting because of the recession.

913
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,270
You sometimes say puzzling things

914
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:04,480
and make me frustrated.

915
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,940
Seriously.

916
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,810
This isn't easy for you.

917
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:16,150
Leave it.

918
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:19,920
Nothing in this world is easy.

919
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,460
Everyone lives like that.

920
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,040
Yeah, grab that side.

921
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,770
One, two, three.

922
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:51,290
Calling a taxi

923
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:52,750
All vehicles are in operation
Please call again later

924
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:39,910
Aren't you getting on?

925
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,980
Come here, Dad.

926
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,910
The bus can't leave because of you.

927
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:46,680
You can go on.

928
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,580
Is the bus schedule really okay?

929
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,790
You saw it yourself.

930
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:04,120
There are four buses left.

931
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:08,940
Alright. I'll get the next one.

932
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,200
You two didn't fight, right?

933
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,690
How many times do I have to tell you?

934
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,980
We didn't fight.

935
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:19,680
We don't have the energy to fight.

936
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,270
Then fine.

937
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,620
Huh? Oh, my.

938
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,460
Don't people look down on you when you do that?

939
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,560
What's wrong with this?

940
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,240
It's not a bad thing.

941
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:47,770
I get exercise, it's good for the environment

942
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:49,840
and good for the country's economy.

943
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,310
How patriotic.

944
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,990
Dad!

945
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:59,090
I'm not going anywhere. Why call me?

946
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:04,270
Should I collect boxes like you?

947
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,070
If that's going too far,

948
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:14,450
then I can do housekeeping.

949
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:18,540
You talking nonsense again is upsetting me.

950
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,400
They don't call them housekeepers anymore.

951
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,610
The kitchen maid became a housekeeper.

952
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:29,210
But the name changed again?

953
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,750
Helper, substitute homemaker,

954
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:34,420
partner, manager...

955
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:36,050
That's what they call them.

956
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,800
Like you said, it's not a bad thing.

957
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:42,020
I get exercise, so it's good.

958
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:44,060
It's okay for me to do that.

959
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,160
But not you.

960
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:47,930
Why?

961
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,930
Because you're my child.

962
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:57,940
What about it?

963
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:00,670
What's a child?

964
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:03,510
Children must lead

965
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:06,410
a better life than their parents.

966
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:18,960
Right.

967
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:22,800
You're right.

968
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:26,330
Everything you say is right.

969
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,070
Now you get it?

970
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:33,310
The boxes in the alley earlier...

971
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:36,080
How much is is all of that?

972
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:38,750
I don't know.

973
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,810
It changes every day.

974
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:45,420
I collect them, not knowing how much it's worth.

975
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,250
Your medicine.

976
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:51,020
You take them regularly, right?

977
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:52,590
Why?

978
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:55,930
Worried I might forget?

979
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:03,720
Dad.

980
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:05,740
What?

981
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:10,310
Dad.

982
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:14,950
I'm right here. Why do you keep calling me?

983
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:18,050
You wanted me

984
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:21,690
to become a warmhearted rich person.

985
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:24,340
So you named me like that.

986
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,330
Dad.

987
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:36,670
Hey.

988
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:39,820
Is something the matter?

989
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:43,550
Dad.

990
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:46,480
Yes, I'm here.

991
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:52,690
Dad, I think...

992
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:56,890
I failed.

993
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:01,860
I think I failed.

994
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,600
Hey.

995
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:07,600
Did something happen at work?

996
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,100
No.

997
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:11,740
Then...

998
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:15,110
Are you and Jeong-su having problems?

999
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,480
No.

1000
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,140
It's not that.

1001
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:20,110
It's not that kind of issue.

1002
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:21,280
It's just...

1003
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:27,190
It's just that I'm so foolish.

1004
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:29,260
What are you talking about?

1005
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:32,060
You're my pride and joy.

1006
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,760
No, I'm not, Dad.

1007
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:38,430
Don't say that I am.

1008
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:40,730
I think...

1009
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,510
I think I've become bad.

1010
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:50,110
Why?

1011
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,140
Because of the baby?

1012
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:54,150
Because of losing the baby?

1013
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:55,750
Are you continuously...

1014
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:57,220
...upset...

1015
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:58,920
...because of that?

1016
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,290
No.

1017
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:02,220
No.

1018
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,230
It's not that.

1019
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:08,900
What right do I have to say that?

1020
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,600
It's just...

1021
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:13,830
It's just that I'm bad.

1022
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:16,100
There's no reason.

1023
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:21,510
I wanted to make an effort,

1024
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:24,480
thinking about how you raised me

1025
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:27,040
by toiling away on the streets.

1026
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:34,260
But I don't know how to make an effort.

1027
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,430
Dad, I...

1028
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,130
I didn't become anything.

1029
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:48,830
I got born into this world

1030
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,770
and didn't become anything.

1031
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:57,340
I think I won't ever make anything of myself.

1032
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:00,280
That's why I'm so lonely, Dad.

1033
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:05,340
I have you and Jeong-su.

1034
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:09,820
But I'm just so lonely.

1035
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:13,860
Of course.

1036
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:15,760
You're lonely.

1037
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,530
Why wouldn't I know that?

1038
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,430
It's just...

1039
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:21,300
It's okay.

1040
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:23,700
My life is such an embarrassment.

1041
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,840
Don't cry. Huh?

1042
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:28,740
You'll exhaust yourself. Don't cry.

1043
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:32,680
I think

1044
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,450
I will become poorer than you.

1045
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:39,560
I think I'll be worse.

1046
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:43,120
Then you'll be heartbroken.

1047
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,390
Oh, dear.

1048
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:47,290
It's okay.

1049
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:50,400
Don't be like this, Bu-jeong.

1050
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,230
My heart is breaking to pieces.

1051
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:56,200
What can I do, Dad?

1052
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,840
Dad...

1053
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,480
I have no right.

1054
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:10,040
Seoul Police Station
To Lee Bu-jeong

1055
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:19,090
Hello, Father.

1056
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:21,760
I was getting worried. Bu-jeong hasn't come.

1057
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,160
She wanted to sleep over,

1058
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,290
but I put her on a bus just now.

1059
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,360
Everything is fine, right?

1060
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:33,500
Yes, of course.

1061
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:35,230
What about you?

1062
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:38,040
I'm fine.

1063
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,570
Jeong-su.

1064
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,610
Please take care of Bu-jeong.

1065
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,650
Thank you.

1066
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,920
I'm sorry, Father.

1067
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:00,960
I'll hang up now.

1068
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:11,200
Oh.

1069
01:08:11,959 --> 01:08:13,800
It's okay.

1070
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,740
No, just use it.

1071
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:18,419
Don't ruin your clothes.

1072
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:22,010
Thank you.

1073
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:51,570
Normally, I'd just give that to you.

1074
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:53,840
What?

1075
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,280
That handkerchief.

1076
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:57,940
Oh.

1077
01:08:58,940 --> 01:08:59,980
But it's...

1078
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:03,180
expensive.

1079
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,120
Oh.

1080
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,360
No, don't unfold it. You already used it.

1081
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,890
Then what should I do?

1082
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:18,200
Well, normally, I'd give it to you.

1083
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:20,000
Yes.

1084
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
But...

1085
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:23,940
Just in case you throw it away.

1086
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:25,970
I'm telling you that it's expensive.

1087
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:27,940
What?

1088
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:29,740
Don't throw it away.

1089
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:31,420
Wash it and use it again.

1090
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:54,970
This is my stop.

1091
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:09,910
Lost

1092
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:13,390
Work a room before you go, Player.

1093
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:14,720
Would you feel better

1094
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,830
if I get off on the next stop?

1095
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:19,730
But I can't stay on the bus for you.

1096
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:21,330
You shouldn't have come.

1097
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:23,660
If I knew you were coming, I wouldn't have come.

1098
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:25,430
I just wanted to see you one more time.

1099
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:27,430
Have you heard about "shield lift"?

1100
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:29,300
Are you threatening me right now?

1101
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:30,500
I read the book.

1102
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,910
You didn't change a word.

1103
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:33,980
It was all as I had written.

1104
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:35,510
He died because life was so hard.

1105
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:37,910
How can you talk trash about him? That's not right.

1106
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:39,080
He doesn't have a voice now.

1107
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,010
Do you have a death wish?

1108
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:41,480
I'm so embarrassed

1109
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,080
that I want to die right now!

1110
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,420
Because of you...

1111
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:46,850
What the hell are you doing?

1112
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:48,990
I lost my child.

1113
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:50,690
And I lost myself.
