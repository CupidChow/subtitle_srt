Work?

182
00:16:39,302 --> 00:16:41,392
Something happened at work?

183
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:43,372
It's no big deal, Mom.

184
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:45,832
Do you have clean clothes?

185
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:50,912
Yes, I have some.

186
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:56,482
Mom.

187
00:16:56,692 --> 00:16:57,462
Huh?

188
00:16:58,342 --> 00:17:00,352
You don't have to rush.

189
00:17:15,932 --> 00:17:17,612
You're Just's friend?

190
00:17:20,232 --> 00:17:20,932
Yes.

191
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:23,742
Did Just not mention me?

192
00:17:24,562 --> 00:17:27,232
He came to my club a few times.

193
00:17:29,202 --> 00:17:30,612
Oh, right.

194
00:17:32,532 --> 00:17:33,702
Are you his girlfriend?

195
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:36,542
Well.

196
00:17:37,332 --> 00:17:38,392
I'm a girl

197
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:40,982
and his friend.

198
00:17:41,752 --> 00:17:43,492
I can't be his guy friend.

199
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:49,122
School friend?

200
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:57,032
It wasn't for me?

201
00:17:58,482 --> 00:18:00,542
I thought it was for me, so I waited.

202
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:08,582
Want some water?

203
00:18:08,582 --> 00:18:09,662
No, it's okay.

204
00:18:10,182 --> 00:18:12,922
How long have you been staying here?

205
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,432
I'm not staying here.
I come to work here.

206
00:18:15,432 --> 00:18:17,232
This is our office.

207
00:18:18,202 --> 00:18:19,202
Office?

208
00:18:19,992 --> 00:18:20,992
Yes.

209
00:18:25,552 --> 00:18:26,892
Oh, you mean

210
00:18:27,202 --> 00:18:28,402
the stand-in service.

211
00:18:28,762 --> 00:18:29,612
I see.

212
00:18:29,862 --> 00:18:31,302
I never knew that.

213
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:34,712
I just thought this
was Gang-jae's place.

214
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:41,572
You came here because he won't pick up.

215
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:43,972
Right.

216
00:18:45,172 --> 00:18:46,622
Then of course you don't know.

217
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:48,302
It's only been 4 days.

218
00:18:54,982 --> 00:18:57,452
Why is the door open?

219
00:18:58,892 --> 00:19:00,462
Huh? Jong-hoon!

220
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:03,162
Hey, are you hurt?

221
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:05,642
Oh, yeah.

222
00:19:05,902 --> 00:19:07,272
Where did you get hurt?

223
00:19:07,742 --> 00:19:08,982
Was it an accident?

224
00:19:09,492 --> 00:19:10,932
Oh, well,

225
00:19:11,212 --> 00:19:14,222
I was carrying some stuff
from the second floor

226
00:19:14,422 --> 00:19:16,562
and slightly fractured my leg.

227
00:19:16,742 --> 00:19:18,942
But the doctor said I had to do this.

228
00:19:19,002 --> 00:19:19,752
I'm glad it's not serious.

229
00:19:19,752 --> 00:19:21,302
Hey, come in and sit down.

230
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:22,092
Okay.

231
00:19:24,432 --> 00:19:25,432
Jong-hoon.

232
00:19:25,652 --> 00:19:28,252
Why are you here...?

233
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:30,732
Oh, well.

234
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:33,152
That bastard's not picking up his phone.

235
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:34,722
You should've been careful.

236
00:19:34,722 --> 00:19:35,332
Oh, right.

237
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:36,522
I'm fine now.

238
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:40,172
If you use this on wrinkles,

239
00:19:40,302 --> 00:19:43,232
it will manage both wrinkles
and elasticity.

240
00:19:43,292 --> 00:19:46,682
It'll glow naturally,
making your skin look smooth.

241
00:19:47,262 --> 00:19:50,332
You can use it with your makeup on.

242
00:19:53,422 --> 00:19:55,112
I'll apply it for you.

243
00:19:56,342 --> 00:19:58,962
You just have to sweep it
around your eyes

244
00:19:59,062 --> 00:20:02,332
and sweep it across your neck wrinkles.

245
00:20:02,332 --> 00:20:04,062
You can use it on your lips, too.

246
00:20:04,132 --> 00:20:05,722
Tap it on.

247
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,872
You can manage
your wrinkles and look dewy.

248
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:34,562
How did you get here?

249
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:36,332
Are you feeling alright?

250
00:20:36,732 --> 00:20:37,732
What?

251
00:20:38,412 --> 00:20:39,542
I'm not sick.

252
00:20:39,752 --> 00:20:41,272
No, that's not why.

253
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:43,992
Well.

254
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,622
I asked since you
went through a tough thing.

255
00:20:47,602 --> 00:20:50,112
You look like a student
in those clothes.

256
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:52,652
A student, my foot.

257
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:56,232
Stop talking nonsense.

258
00:20:56,742 --> 00:20:57,742
It's true.

259
00:21:01,412 --> 00:21:02,532
Don't do that.

260
00:21:02,812 --> 00:21:04,882
You can't get anything from me.

261
00:21:05,512 --> 00:21:06,952
What do you mean?

262
00:21:07,042 --> 00:21:08,942
I told you to bring a lot of money.

263
00:21:09,112 --> 00:21:10,532
Seriously.

264
00:21:12,112 --> 00:21:13,212
Forget it.

265
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,682
Did it disappear?

266
00:21:26,672 --> 00:21:27,672
Huh?

267
00:21:28,202 --> 00:21:29,202
What?

268
00:21:30,052 --> 00:21:32,292
Did my wrinkles disappear?

269
00:21:34,712 --> 00:21:37,252
Was something there in the first place?

270
00:21:50,252 --> 00:21:52,382
Now I see you're a total player.

271
00:21:52,552 --> 00:21:54,422
Why are you picking a fight?

272
00:21:54,562 --> 00:21:56,842
Nothing's there.
I'm calling it as it is.

273
00:21:57,572 --> 00:22:00,122
I know it's empty talk,
but I still feel good.

274
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,932
I'll take the whole set.

275
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:10,532
You're not paying,
so don't look at me like that.

276
00:22:12,662 --> 00:22:14,902
I just feel

277
00:22:17,552 --> 00:22:20,482
like thinking about something else.

278
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:24,012
So don't stop me from buying.

279
00:22:25,162 --> 00:22:26,892
I'm not going to stop you.

280
00:22:27,712 --> 00:22:29,772
How will you make your payment?

281
00:22:30,692 --> 00:22:32,182
No, I'm going to pay.

282
00:22:32,182 --> 00:22:33,012
Don't.

283
00:22:34,742 --> 00:22:36,312
Stop it.

284
00:22:37,472 --> 00:22:39,672
Just accept it in situations like this.

285
00:22:50,592 --> 00:22:52,582
We were practicing acting,

286
00:22:53,342 --> 00:22:54,972
and feelings started boiling up.

287
00:22:55,662 --> 00:22:57,422
I'm at the hospital.

288
00:22:57,892 --> 00:22:59,812
Six weeks to heal?

289
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,432
No, it's two weeks.

290
00:23:05,462 --> 00:23:08,382
People report to the police
for nothing these days.

291
00:23:08,562 --> 00:23:10,242
It's driving me insane.

292
00:23:11,662 --> 00:23:13,662
Is it that hard to stay still?

293
00:23:14,842 --> 00:23:16,692
How frustrating.

294
00:23:40,872 --> 00:23:42,152
Are you alright?

295
00:23:44,522 --> 00:23:47,022
Can you pull up the bed more?

296
00:23:58,402 --> 00:23:59,522
That's enough.

297
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:01,972
This is good.

298
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:07,112
You didn't call the police, did you?

299
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,042
After you left,
he came back to apologize,

300
00:24:15,652 --> 00:24:17,172
then this happened.

301
00:24:17,772 --> 00:24:21,512
He was beating me up when security came,

302
00:24:24,682 --> 00:24:26,752
saying someone called the cops.

303
00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:31,822
So I sent him away.

304
00:24:32,402 --> 00:24:34,272
Maybe someone saw something.

305
00:24:35,122 --> 00:24:36,852
Things got out of hand.

306
00:24:39,862 --> 00:24:42,452
I heard Ms. Jeong talk to a reporter.

307
00:24:42,612 --> 00:24:45,412
I don't think my story
will make the news.

308
00:24:47,122 --> 00:24:49,722
I'll probably be dropped from the show.

309
00:24:52,272 --> 00:24:53,552
It's a relief.

310
00:24:59,922 --> 00:25:02,012
I didn't call the police.

311
00:25:03,382 --> 00:25:06,192
But I did tell security downstairs

312
00:25:06,192 --> 00:25:07,912
to go up to check on you.

313
00:25:10,692 --> 00:25:11,692
Darn it!

314
00:25:17,742 --> 00:25:19,152
It was you.

315
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,092
It could've been someone else.

316
00:25:24,092 --> 00:25:25,562
Maybe next door.

317
00:25:29,192 --> 00:25:31,242
Do you need anything else?

318
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:32,442
How do

319
00:25:35,362 --> 00:25:36,792
I look to you?

320
00:25:39,432 --> 00:25:40,772
Pathetic?

321
00:25:44,182 --> 00:25:45,422
Well...

322
00:25:48,112 --> 00:25:50,272
Not pathetic.

323
00:25:51,382 --> 00:25:52,742
Sad.

324
00:26:03,202 --> 00:26:05,052
The woman who worked before you.

325
00:26:05,052 --> 00:26:06,402
Your friend.

326
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:10,132
Hee-sun.

327
00:26:11,182 --> 00:26:12,702
Right? Nam Hee-sun.

328
00:26:12,882 --> 00:26:13,882
Yes.

329
00:26:15,252 --> 00:26:18,202
She got hurt while sticking up for me.

330
00:26:21,152 --> 00:26:23,272
<i>Is your hand okay?</i>

331
00:26:24,012 --> 00:26:24,702
<i>Yes.</i>

332
00:26:24,942 --> 00:26:27,552
<i>She was trying to stop
Mr. Seo from dragging me</i>

333
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:28,992
<i>to the front door.</i>

334
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:34,002
I told her to get a lot of
compensation from him.

335
00:26:34,632 --> 00:26:36,152
But a little later,

336
00:26:37,622 --> 00:26:39,302
rather than compensation,

337
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:41,332
she got fired.

338
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:46,632
Be careful.

339
00:26:47,642 --> 00:26:48,922
If you get

340
00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:50,952
fired because of me,

341
00:26:52,162 --> 00:26:54,402
I can't help you.

342
00:27:00,572 --> 00:27:02,492
Can you put a pillow behind my back?

343
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:07,812
What kind of friend was she?

344
00:27:08,372 --> 00:27:11,492
Because of the age difference,
you can't be alumni.

345
00:27:12,682 --> 00:27:14,402
We met at a club.

346
00:27:15,412 --> 00:27:16,412
A club?

347
00:27:19,242 --> 00:27:20,522
On the internet?

348
00:27:21,142 --> 00:27:22,142
Yes.

349
00:27:24,552 --> 00:27:25,992
What kind of club?

350
00:27:27,802 --> 00:27:29,362
A suicide club.

351
00:27:38,102 --> 00:27:40,672
Have you made an attempt?

352
00:27:41,212 --> 00:27:42,212
For real?

353
00:27:43,892 --> 00:27:46,592
I went to the place with other people,

354
00:27:47,412 --> 00:27:49,212
but I never actually tried.

355
00:27:53,162 --> 00:27:55,102
Did you write a suicide note?

356
00:28:18,842 --> 00:28:20,582
I haven't finished it yet.

357
00:28:23,162 --> 00:28:24,162
Ms. Lee.

358
00:28:25,112 --> 00:28:26,972
After you clean that up,

359
00:28:27,822 --> 00:28:29,172
you can leave.

360
00:28:29,772 --> 00:28:30,772
Okay.

361
00:29:32,782 --> 00:29:35,122
Why don't you pick up your phone?

362
00:29:35,122 --> 00:29:36,262
What the?

363
00:29:36,702 --> 00:29:37,742
Keep it open.

364
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,802
Just left it open
as he went out with his girlfriend.

365
00:29:41,222 --> 00:29:42,702
They'll be back soon.

366
00:29:42,922 --> 00:29:44,822
They went to get something to drink.

367
00:29:47,582 --> 00:29:49,412
I'm a guest.

368
00:30:02,042 --> 00:30:04,722
<i>(When will you come?
Jong-hoon is at your house.)</i>

369
00:30:04,742 --> 00:30:05,442
Huh?

370
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:06,722
He saw.

371
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:08,402
Gang-jae read it.

372
00:30:08,972 --> 00:30:09,872
He checked my text.

373
00:30:09,872 --> 00:30:11,522
It says he read it.

374
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:15,932
If he can come, he'll be here.

375
00:30:15,932 --> 00:30:17,732
If not, he won't.

376
00:30:19,462 --> 00:30:20,462
Right.

377
00:30:30,692 --> 00:30:33,232
Did you choose? What did you choose?

378
00:30:35,822 --> 00:30:37,982
Just something suitable.

379
00:30:38,802 --> 00:30:41,492
Why did you come with me?
You hurt your leg.

380
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:43,302
You should've stayed with Manager Seo.

381
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:45,182
Just...

382
00:30:45,222 --> 00:30:49,212
I have nothing to say to him.

383
00:30:51,612 --> 00:30:52,852
Why not?

384
00:30:53,132 --> 00:30:55,132
I heard you were very popular.

385
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:58,722
What? Me? Why was I popular?

386
00:30:58,722 --> 00:31:00,412
Manager Seo said he really wanted you.

387
00:31:00,412 --> 00:31:03,082
Because the middle-aged women liked you.

388
00:31:04,312 --> 00:31:06,642
He says things like that

389
00:31:06,672 --> 00:31:09,212
for no reason

390
00:31:09,212 --> 00:31:10,722
all the time.

391
00:31:11,122 --> 00:31:12,122
Why?

392
00:31:13,312 --> 00:31:14,312
Oh, well.

393
00:31:14,972 --> 00:31:18,362
It's the highest compliment he can give.

394
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:25,862
You told me to wake you early.
Where did you go?

395
00:31:27,312 --> 00:31:28,052
What?

396
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:32,922
Where did you go?
You turned your phone off.

397
00:31:34,752 --> 00:31:36,432
I went to the library.

398
00:31:37,202 --> 00:31:38,202
Library?

399
00:31:38,432 --> 00:31:39,192
Yes.

400
00:31:39,452 --> 00:31:41,882
What library? What's the name?

401
00:31:43,482 --> 00:31:45,542
A library is a library.

402
00:31:45,562 --> 00:31:48,002
There's no other name.

403
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,532
You're lying.

404
00:31:56,132 --> 00:31:57,362
I can tell.

405
00:31:57,792 --> 00:31:59,152
It's so obvious.

406
00:32:07,332 --> 00:32:08,452
Later,

407
00:32:10,842 --> 00:32:13,362
when things work out, I'll tell you.

408
00:32:16,262 --> 00:32:17,862
When what works out?

409
00:32:20,162 --> 00:32:21,162
Just.

410
00:32:21,782 --> 00:32:23,452
Everything.

411
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:28,962
If it doesn't work out,
you won't tell me?

412
00:32:36,032 --> 00:32:37,472
This is so frustrating.

413
00:32:37,712 --> 00:32:40,542
- Oh, no, that's not it.
- I should just get crazy drunk.

414
00:32:43,152 --> 00:32:44,152
You'll drink soju?

415
00:32:44,152 --> 00:32:45,692
I'll hold this.

416
00:32:46,022 --> 00:32:47,302
I can hold this.

417
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,762
I didn't break my arm.

418
00:32:50,252 --> 00:32:51,852
Please. I'll hold it.

419
00:32:51,852 --> 00:32:52,852
Please.

420
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:03,852
Whoa. So much soju...

421
00:33:31,402 --> 00:33:34,172
Wow, you really have nothing.

422
00:33:34,662 --> 00:33:36,232
Want to go out for drinks?

423
00:33:36,952 --> 00:33:39,402
Why go through someone else's fridge?

424
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:40,542
How rude.

425
00:33:40,932 --> 00:33:42,382
And I quit drinking.

426
00:33:44,602 --> 00:33:46,402
You're just taking a break.

427
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:47,932
You didn't quit.

428
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:50,472
What are you so confused about?

429
00:33:52,022 --> 00:33:54,292
Wow, you have a good hunch.

430
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:57,582
How did you know I was
getting confused again?

431
00:33:58,002 --> 00:33:59,522
You hit the bull's-eye.

432
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,272
Seeing you suddenly come to my house,

433
00:34:03,692 --> 00:34:06,672
I figured you suddenly
got confused again.

434
00:34:07,062 --> 00:34:09,602
Hey, is #1003 here that woman's place?

435
00:34:10,252 --> 00:34:11,942
Or is it her father's?

436
00:34:11,992 --> 00:34:13,792
It's listed under her name.

437
00:34:16,442 --> 00:34:17,882
Who is that woman?

438
00:34:18,132 --> 00:34:19,952
Hey, don't be coy.

439
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:23,642
You acted like you knew
everything just now.

440
00:34:23,722 --> 00:34:25,572
Let's not make this awkward.

441
00:34:26,292 --> 00:34:27,292
What?

442
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,792
Beating about the bush is my thing.

443
00:34:29,792 --> 00:34:32,322
You don't like beating about the bush.

444
00:34:36,922 --> 00:34:38,732
It's about Jeong-woo.

445
00:34:43,772 --> 00:34:44,972
What about him?

446
00:34:46,232 --> 00:34:47,752
That woman.

447
00:34:48,222 --> 00:34:51,042
I said I gave Jeong-woo
the job before you.

448
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:53,292
But Jeong-woo didn't do anything.

449
00:34:54,132 --> 00:34:55,132
I thought

450
00:34:56,122 --> 00:34:57,912
the kid was sick

451
00:34:58,292 --> 00:35:00,422
so he wasn't in his right mind.

452
00:35:00,902 --> 00:35:03,162
He used up all the money and left.

453
00:35:04,092 --> 00:35:07,652
But now I think he gave me
nothing on purpose.

454
00:35:09,172 --> 00:35:10,172
Why?

455
00:35:10,882 --> 00:35:13,172
I don't know why.

456
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:17,082
No, I mean why do you think that?

457
00:35:18,062 --> 00:35:19,062
Huh?

458
00:35:27,082 --> 00:35:28,082
Yeah.

459
00:35:29,072 --> 00:35:31,052
Why do I think that?

460
00:35:37,422 --> 00:35:38,862
How about you?

461
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:41,662
What about me?

462
00:35:42,512 --> 00:35:45,322
Come to think of it,
you gave me nothing, too.

463
00:35:45,322 --> 00:35:46,522
It confuses me.

464
00:35:46,552 --> 00:35:47,552
Huh?

465
00:35:48,252 --> 00:35:50,092
You don't have a sick kid
like Jeong-woo.

466
00:35:50,092 --> 00:35:51,692
You're not suicidal.

467
00:35:51,962 --> 00:35:54,972
You don't want to talk
to Jeong Ah-ran yourself.

468
00:35:55,452 --> 00:35:57,982
She was a ghost writer for Jeong Ah-ran.

469
00:35:57,982 --> 00:36:00,302
She held her bag,
and acted like a secretary.

470
00:36:00,302 --> 00:36:02,522
She doesn't have anything
you can suck dry.

471
00:36:02,592 --> 00:36:05,172
Hey, I'm not a vampire.

472
00:36:05,172 --> 00:36:06,822
What do you mean, suck dry?

473
00:36:07,052 --> 00:36:09,332
That's how I lived.

474
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,412
If they had a weakness, I caught it.

475
00:36:11,412 --> 00:36:12,342
If they didn't, I made stuff up.

476
00:36:12,342 --> 00:36:15,142
After I made it,
I covered it up for them.

477
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:16,542
Like that, I let them know

478
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:17,542
I existed.

479
00:36:20,072 --> 00:36:21,672
Then I got attached.

480
00:36:25,262 --> 00:36:28,382
You can feel pity, then fall in love.

481
00:36:28,382 --> 00:36:30,062
You and I are only human.

482
00:36:32,242 --> 00:36:36,132
I got attached to Jeong Ah-ran that way.

483
00:36:36,202 --> 00:36:38,112
What is it you want to say?

484
00:36:38,502 --> 00:36:41,402
What's so confusing?
What do you want to do?

485
00:36:47,112 --> 00:36:48,112
You know.

486
00:36:49,012 --> 00:36:50,132
Your pictures.

487
00:36:51,132 --> 00:36:52,932
I gave them to Jeong Ah-ran.

488
00:36:55,442 --> 00:36:56,562
What pictures?

489
00:36:57,452 --> 00:36:58,702
What pictures?

490
00:36:58,942 --> 00:37:01,032
The pictures that you saw. Those ones.

491
00:37:01,032 --> 00:37:02,712
It's weird that you ask.

492
00:37:11,292 --> 00:37:13,742
To be honest, on my way here,

493
00:37:13,742 --> 00:37:16,802
I thought about my promise,
and I felt bad.

494
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:20,062
So I came to see you and talk.

495
00:37:21,552 --> 00:37:24,352
But I don't know. Whatever.

496
00:37:33,272 --> 00:37:34,272
Leave.

497
00:37:52,612 --> 00:37:54,972
<i>I can hold this much.</i>

498
00:37:55,702 --> 00:37:58,442
<i>Forget it. I can do it.</i>

499
00:38:09,682 --> 00:38:11,082
You're leaving?

500
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:11,982
Huh?

501
00:38:12,502 --> 00:38:13,502
Yeah.

502
00:38:16,322 --> 00:38:17,762
See you next time.

503
00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:20,032
Be careful.

504
00:38:21,462 --> 00:38:23,062
You shouldn't drink.

505
00:38:23,752 --> 00:38:25,292
I'll be careful.

506
00:38:25,292 --> 00:38:26,492
Give me a call.

507
00:38:28,752 --> 00:38:29,872
See you later.

508
00:39:10,282 --> 00:39:11,282
Writer Lee.

509
00:39:20,632 --> 00:39:22,192
Come talk with me.

510
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,332
I'll talk with Writer Lee for a second.

511
00:39:26,772 --> 00:39:29,842
Oh, okay.

512
00:39:30,872 --> 00:39:31,832
I'm sorry, ma'am.

513
00:39:31,832 --> 00:39:33,512
I'll call you tomorrow.

514
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:34,992
No, it's okay.

515
00:39:36,412 --> 00:39:39,732
Then I'll be going now.

516
00:39:40,012 --> 00:39:41,072
I'm sorry.

517
00:39:47,672 --> 00:39:48,672
Get in.

518
00:39:49,222 --> 00:39:51,692
If you're going home, I'll take you.

519
00:40:09,212 --> 00:40:11,072
You have her address, right?

520
00:40:11,372 --> 00:40:12,372
Yes, ma'am.

521
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:15,942
Did you move?

522
00:40:16,752 --> 00:40:18,532
It's been a year.

523
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,142
I'll talk here and take the subway home.

524
00:40:22,642 --> 00:40:23,732
I'll take you.

525
00:40:23,732 --> 00:40:25,992
We don't have a lot to talk about.

526
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:29,762
Okay then.

527
00:40:32,212 --> 00:40:34,682
Park the car somewhere
and go get some air.

528
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,802
I'll call you.

529
00:40:35,982 --> 00:40:36,902
Yes, ma'am.

530
00:40:43,982 --> 00:40:45,512
I guess you saw it all.

531
00:40:49,692 --> 00:40:51,892
I'm so embarrassed to go on site.

532
00:40:54,432 --> 00:40:57,332
He says it happened
while practicing acting.

533
00:40:58,432 --> 00:41:00,112
That'll make a dog laugh.

534
00:41:01,902 --> 00:41:04,572
I don't know how long I have to do this.

535
00:41:06,442 --> 00:41:08,512
You do it because you like him.

536
00:41:10,072 --> 00:41:13,012
If you didn't, you'd just let him sink.

537
00:41:15,252 --> 00:41:16,292
You're right.

538
00:41:17,632 --> 00:41:18,632
But

539
00:41:21,072 --> 00:41:23,472
I'm not doing it because I like him.

540
00:41:25,492 --> 00:41:27,172
It's because I need him.

541
00:41:51,752 --> 00:41:53,432
I heard it's been months

542
00:41:54,362 --> 00:41:56,162
since you worked for Ji-na.

543
00:41:56,622 --> 00:41:58,302
That's what she said.

544
00:41:59,022 --> 00:42:00,702
A little over 6 months.

545
00:42:03,742 --> 00:42:06,342
Then it's when you started trolling me.

546
00:42:07,982 --> 00:42:10,312
I trolled you for longer than that.

547
00:42:11,272 --> 00:42:12,952
It's been over a year.

548
00:42:13,862 --> 00:42:16,872
I started at the last stages
of the manuscript.

549
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:20,742
There's a lot you haven't seen yet.

550
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,622
Say what you want to say.

551
00:42:32,252 --> 00:42:34,252
What is it that I want to say?

552
00:42:34,842 --> 00:42:37,372
You want to talk about the plagiarism.

553
00:42:37,942 --> 00:42:38,942
Seriously.

554
00:42:39,752 --> 00:42:41,482
You haven't changed a bit.

555
00:42:43,172 --> 00:42:45,242
You're so high and mighty, huh?

556
00:42:47,342 --> 00:42:49,212
Is that why you plagiarized?

557
00:42:49,842 --> 00:42:52,742
From the book
you were translating, no less?

558
00:42:59,242 --> 00:43:00,682
I couldn't believe

559
00:43:01,552 --> 00:43:03,962
you'd do that to your own book.

560
00:43:04,802 --> 00:43:06,422
So when the company first told me,

561
00:43:06,422 --> 00:43:08,022
I didn't believe it.

562
00:43:10,532 --> 00:43:12,842
When you first came to me
to publish a book,

563
00:43:12,842 --> 00:43:14,202
what did you say?

564
00:43:14,252 --> 00:43:17,392
That you liked books,
and wanted to publish yours.

565
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:20,072
You said that was the reason you lived.

566
00:43:20,692 --> 00:43:23,352
Even when they called you night and day,

567
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:25,062
you said you can endure it

568
00:43:25,062 --> 00:43:27,062
because you like making books.

569
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:31,742
Were you the one

570
00:43:32,282 --> 00:43:33,582
that posted it?

571
00:43:42,842 --> 00:43:43,842
Well.

572
00:43:44,852 --> 00:43:46,632
It doesn't matter.

573
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:51,492
The book didn't even sell 1,000 copies.

574
00:43:52,682 --> 00:43:55,652
We collected all that was
in stock, discarded them

575
00:43:55,822 --> 00:43:57,552
and discontinued the book.

576
00:43:58,422 --> 00:44:00,622
People can have similar thoughts.

577
00:44:01,212 --> 00:44:03,842
But using the exact same words
was the problem.

578
00:44:04,552 --> 00:44:06,732
The company said they'll sue you.

579
00:44:06,732 --> 00:44:08,252
But I stopped them.

580
00:44:13,572 --> 00:44:16,042
Why are you working at Ji-na's house?

581
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:21,012
To find something to screw me over?

582
00:44:22,612 --> 00:44:23,612
Yes.

583
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:25,262
So?

584
00:44:26,062 --> 00:44:27,742
Did you find something?

585
00:44:27,882 --> 00:44:30,372
Why would i reveal that to my opponent?

586
00:44:32,362 --> 00:44:34,472
How can you beat me?

587
00:44:35,502 --> 00:44:37,702
I'm not fighting you to beat you.

588
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:39,982
Even if I can't beat you,

589
00:44:40,462 --> 00:44:42,262
I can hurt you.

590
00:44:42,862 --> 00:44:44,542
I can make you bleed.

591
00:44:49,552 --> 00:44:51,192
I prayed every day.

592
00:44:53,052 --> 00:44:54,792
I sometimes pray even now.

593
00:44:55,482 --> 00:44:57,812
I prayed the both of you would die.

594
00:45:01,332 --> 00:45:03,232
I think you two are trash.

595
00:45:04,122 --> 00:45:05,522
You disregard others,

596
00:45:05,522 --> 00:45:07,702
and only think of your survival.

597
00:45:14,802 --> 00:45:15,802
Writer Lee.

598
00:45:18,932 --> 00:45:20,932
If you hate someone that much,

599
00:45:21,292 --> 00:45:23,292
you're the one that suffers.

600
00:45:26,362 --> 00:45:28,162
What do you think hell is?

601
00:45:28,212 --> 00:45:31,412
If your hatred becomes unbearable,
then that's hell.

602
00:45:34,222 --> 00:45:35,222
Besides,

603
00:45:36,632 --> 00:45:38,072
you can't beat me.

604
00:45:38,942 --> 00:45:41,652
It'll be good for you to stop hoping.

605
00:45:43,252 --> 00:45:45,272
Although I'm not giving you advice.

606
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:51,882
You think

607
00:45:52,802 --> 00:45:54,912
I don't have anything on you?

608
00:46:01,142 --> 00:46:02,882
You think you're so clean?

609
00:46:18,592 --> 00:46:21,442
<i>(Hello, Ms. Lee Bu-jeong.
Thanks to you, I returned home safely.)</i>

610
00:46:21,442 --> 00:46:22,582
<i>(You don't have to reply.)</i>

611
00:46:27,032 --> 00:46:28,032
What?

612
00:46:29,762 --> 00:46:30,632
Hey.

613
00:46:30,632 --> 00:46:31,782
Next week,

614
00:46:31,992 --> 00:46:33,992
Min-jeong can move into a study room.

615
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:36,542
You can stay with me until then.

616
00:46:36,632 --> 00:46:37,822
Forget it.

617
00:46:37,822 --> 00:46:39,432
Soon-gyu is loud

618
00:46:39,792 --> 00:46:41,472
and her cooking is bad.

619
00:46:42,282 --> 00:46:43,912
I'd rather get take-out.

620
00:46:43,992 --> 00:46:45,512
That's true.

621
00:46:46,142 --> 00:46:48,142
You smirk? I'm telling on you.

622
00:46:48,442 --> 00:46:50,122
I'm telling on you first.

623
00:46:55,672 --> 00:46:59,122
I didn't say anything
because Min-jeong was there.

624
00:46:59,912 --> 00:47:01,912
In case you'd get embarrassed.

625
00:47:02,472 --> 00:47:06,762
But you hurt your ankle
while carrying blankets?

626
00:47:07,902 --> 00:47:09,262
It got fractured.

627
00:47:10,132 --> 00:47:12,132
You expect me to believe that?

628
00:47:12,522 --> 00:47:13,482
Tell me.

629
00:47:13,482 --> 00:47:16,142
What did you two do when I wasn't there?

630
00:47:18,812 --> 00:47:20,322
What do you mean?

631
00:47:21,432 --> 00:47:22,702
You know.

632
00:47:22,782 --> 00:47:24,262
When I wasn't there,

633
00:47:24,262 --> 00:47:25,542
you two could've

634
00:47:26,192 --> 00:47:28,062
slept under one blanket...

635
00:47:28,372 --> 00:47:29,092
Jeez.

636
00:47:29,382 --> 00:47:30,782
...or used the same spoon

637
00:47:30,782 --> 00:47:33,252
or played hide-and-seek or something.

638
00:47:33,412 --> 00:47:35,372
When we're alone,

639
00:47:35,992 --> 00:47:38,072
we usually talk about you.

640
00:47:39,372 --> 00:47:41,642
Why talk about me? Talk about you.

641
00:47:42,142 --> 00:47:42,942
Well,

642
00:47:43,432 --> 00:47:46,162
you're the only common topic
we have now.

643
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,642
And it's fun talking about you.

644
00:47:49,292 --> 00:47:50,172
What?

645
00:47:50,172 --> 00:47:51,292
What about me?

646
00:47:51,992 --> 00:47:52,992
There's a lot.

647
00:47:53,182 --> 00:47:56,342
Your first stand-in service
was in 4th grade

648
00:47:56,552 --> 00:47:59,162
when you acted as my friend
when I was bullied.

649
00:47:59,162 --> 00:48:01,172
I paid you 100,000 won for two months.

650
00:48:01,172 --> 00:48:02,112
You bastard.

651
00:48:04,972 --> 00:48:05,972
What?

652
00:48:06,702 --> 00:48:09,772
You always tell that story
when you meet a girl.

653
00:48:11,042 --> 00:48:13,622
No, I don't.

654
00:48:13,622 --> 00:48:16,342
You tell that story to get sympathy,

655
00:48:16,342 --> 00:48:20,262
but girls don't fall for that easily.

656
00:48:21,222 --> 00:48:22,382
Min-jeong

657
00:48:22,632 --> 00:48:23,802
found it funny.

658
00:48:23,952 --> 00:48:25,872
Min-jeong? Whoa.

659
00:48:26,512 --> 00:48:27,872
Unbelievable.

660
00:48:30,512 --> 00:48:34,092
Something happen
between you and Jong-hoon?

661
00:48:36,262 --> 00:48:37,752
Nothing happened.

662
00:48:39,142 --> 00:48:41,682
You look distressed.

663
00:48:43,292 --> 00:48:43,932
Hmm?

664
00:48:46,302 --> 00:48:47,902
Never mind.

665
00:48:48,202 --> 00:48:50,302
The day will come when I tell you.

666
00:48:51,582 --> 00:48:53,262
It's a first for me, too.

667
00:48:54,092 --> 00:48:55,092
So there.

668
00:48:55,902 --> 00:48:56,612
Okay.

669
00:48:56,612 --> 00:48:57,962
I'll wait.

670
00:48:59,462 --> 00:49:00,462
Thanks.

671
00:49:01,902 --> 00:49:03,302
Hey, right now,

672
00:49:04,112 --> 00:49:05,482
you look really charming.

673
00:49:05,482 --> 00:49:07,092
- Stop it.
- Wait for me.

674
00:49:08,462 --> 00:49:09,462
It's true.

675
00:49:11,422 --> 00:49:12,422
What's that?

676
00:49:13,212 --> 00:49:13,852
Huh?

677
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:15,082
You going somewhere?

678
00:49:15,972 --> 00:49:17,412
You got a haircut.

679
00:49:18,142 --> 00:49:19,522
What's with your hair?

680
00:49:19,522 --> 00:49:20,902
You said you'll grow it out

681
00:49:20,902 --> 00:49:22,582
and braid it into pigtails.

682
00:49:23,162 --> 00:49:24,562
You copied my hair, right?

683
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:26,342
Who copied who?

684
00:49:26,342 --> 00:49:28,182
This isn't an ordinary haircut.

685
00:49:28,452 --> 00:49:30,512
If it's not ordinary, then what is it?

686
00:49:30,822 --> 00:49:31,822
Retro.

687
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:34,672
- What the?
- You wouldn't know.

688
00:49:34,712 --> 00:49:36,522
So where are you going?

689
00:49:36,522 --> 00:49:37,562
Karaoke room.

690
00:49:37,712 --> 00:49:39,392
Out of the blue? Why?

691
00:49:40,642 --> 00:49:42,002
Why do you think?

692
00:49:42,082 --> 00:49:44,162
- To sing.
- To sing.

693
00:49:44,712 --> 00:49:45,642
Together?

694
00:49:45,642 --> 00:49:46,642
Yeah.

695
00:49:47,602 --> 00:49:49,042
Want to tag along?

696
00:49:49,552 --> 00:49:51,612
Want to go, Gang-jae?

697
00:49:51,842 --> 00:49:53,022
You crazy? What's with you?

698
00:49:53,022 --> 00:49:55,122
It's really soundproof.

699
00:49:55,122 --> 00:49:56,832
It's really private.

700
00:49:56,832 --> 00:49:58,252
Why go there?

701
00:49:58,552 --> 00:49:59,672
And your leg hurts.

702
00:49:59,672 --> 00:50:01,542
Oh, it's good you brought it up.

703
00:50:01,562 --> 00:50:02,192
Huh?

704
00:50:02,272 --> 00:50:04,272
How could you get
my precious boy injured?

705
00:50:04,562 --> 00:50:06,072
Who? Me?

706
00:50:06,122 --> 00:50:07,002
Yeah.

707
00:50:07,492 --> 00:50:09,592
He hurt himself
moving stuff at your place,

708
00:50:09,592 --> 00:50:10,742
so it's your fault.

709
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:12,072
What are you talking about?

710
00:50:12,072 --> 00:50:14,392
It was because he brought
blankets from here.

711
00:50:14,502 --> 00:50:15,502
Blankets?

712
00:50:16,242 --> 00:50:17,692
What blankets?

713
00:50:18,072 --> 00:50:19,222
- Huh?
- Crazy bastard.

714
00:50:19,902 --> 00:50:21,582
Tell me. What blankets?

715
00:50:21,762 --> 00:50:25,362
We'll be off. Keep an eye on the house.

716
00:50:25,362 --> 00:50:26,942
Okay. Have fun.

717
00:50:26,962 --> 00:50:28,532
Not in front of the kids.

718
00:50:29,382 --> 00:50:30,312
Be careful!

719
00:50:30,312 --> 00:50:31,892
Go on inside.

720
00:50:31,912 --> 00:50:33,792
- Be careful having fun?
- Let's go.

721
00:50:33,792 --> 00:50:34,712
They might follow us.

722
00:50:34,712 --> 00:50:36,972
What's to be careful about at a karaoke?

<i>I want to see you.</i>

738
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:41,208
<i>I lay down and look at the ceiling</i>

739
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:49,016
<i>And you shimmer before my eyes</i>

740
00:52:50,317 --> 00:52:56,290
<i>And when I try to forget that image</i>

741
00:52:57,291 --> 00:53:04,765
<i>The silent dew drops fall from my eyes</i>

742
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:11,839
<i>If I just bury those past memories</i>

743
00:54:45,072 --> 00:54:46,352
Are you alright?

744
00:54:46,792 --> 00:54:48,552
I'm so tired.

745
00:54:55,332 --> 00:54:57,142
If you're tired, let's go.

746
00:55:00,142 --> 00:55:02,382
I'm tired, but I can't sleep.

747
00:55:12,872 --> 00:55:15,322
Help me sleep, Jeong-su.

748
00:55:15,542 --> 00:55:17,622
I feel like I'm dying.

749
00:55:27,322 --> 00:55:29,372
I'm so clingy, right?

750
00:55:31,112 --> 00:55:33,052
Don't say that.

751
00:55:43,352 --> 00:55:45,442
Let's go home after this song.

752
00:55:54,722 --> 00:55:56,002
Will you be okay?

753
00:56:01,722 --> 00:56:02,732
About what?

754
00:56:08,152 --> 00:56:09,152
Can you

755
00:56:11,922 --> 00:56:13,912
go home alone?

756
00:56:15,282 --> 00:56:17,622
You said you didn't sleep for days.

757
00:56:19,502 --> 00:56:21,972
I'm alone, so going alone is nothing.

758
00:56:30,004 --> 00:56:34,840
♫ <i>You let go of my hands</i> ♫

759
00:56:34,842 --> 00:56:37,742
Let's stand up and sing.
It's the last song.

760
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:44,652
♫ <i>So I got lost</i> ♫

761
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:52,593
♫ <i>But I can't stop</i> ♫

762
00:56:52,593 --> 00:57:01,035
♫ <i>This is my love</i> ♫

763
00:57:30,831 --> 00:57:38,739
♫ <i>You let go of my hands</i> ♫

764
00:57:38,739 --> 00:57:46,013
♫ <i>So I got lost</i> ♫

765
00:57:46,013 --> 00:57:54,188
♫ <i>But I can't stop</i> ♫

766
00:57:54,188 --> 00:58:03,263
♫ <i>This is my love</i> ♫

767
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:10,004
♫ <i>Don't say</i> ♫

768
00:58:10,004 --> 00:58:17,177
♫ <i>You're not my love, my love</i> ♫

769
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:25,152
♫ <i>I plan on being alone without you</i> ♫

770
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:29,623
♫ <i>Don't try to tell me</i> ♫

771
00:58:29,623 --> 00:58:33,627
♫ <i>That my love</i> ♫

772
00:58:33,627 --> 00:58:43,504
♫ <i>Is not love</i> ♫

773
00:59:29,792 --> 00:59:31,102
<i>(Ms. Lee Bu-jeong)</i>

774
00:59:38,812 --> 00:59:41,582
<i>(Ms. Lee Bu-jeong)</i>

775
00:59:43,782 --> 00:59:49,322
<i>(I'll come to you.)</i>

776
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:53,932
Huh? Gang-jae, where...

777
00:59:56,972 --> 00:59:58,332
Where's he going?

778
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:15,852
The rooms are full. What do we do?

779
01:00:15,852 --> 01:00:17,532
We need to wait an hour?

780
01:00:17,542 --> 01:00:18,542
An hour?

781
01:00:19,302 --> 01:00:20,582
That's too long.

782
01:00:42,162 --> 01:00:43,602
You know her, huh?

783
01:00:44,062 --> 01:00:44,942
Yes.

784
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:45,942
Who is she?

785
01:00:46,172 --> 01:00:49,532
The guardian of
a patient at the hospital.

786
01:01:13,452 --> 01:01:14,162
<i>(Yire Motel)</i>

787
01:02:01,352 --> 01:02:02,352
Is it

788
01:02:04,472 --> 01:02:05,942
the first time for us?

789
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,432
Yes.

790
01:02:09,722 --> 01:02:10,832
I think

791
01:02:11,022 --> 01:02:12,622
it's our first time.

792
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,132
But we dated for so long.

793
01:02:30,182 --> 01:02:31,702
It's unbelievable.

794
01:04:10,897 --> 01:04:15,035
♫ <i>The lonely face</i> ♫

795
01:04:17,337 --> 01:04:21,808
♫ <i>That remains in my left hand</i> ♫

796
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:30,584
♫ <i>Makes me wait for the end of a long day</i> ♫

797
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,889
♫ <i>Every season where the stars
are usually present</i> ♫

798
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:43,463
♫ <i>On this street alone</i> ♫

799
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,836
♫ <i>When I call out your name</i> ♫

800
01:04:50,537 --> 01:04:54,674
♫ <i>I wonder how it feels?</i> ♫

801
01:04:55,542 --> 01:05:02,249
♫ <i>I'll remember that heart as well</i> ♫

802
01:05:06,386 --> 01:05:11,057
♫ <i>I didn't know anything</i> ♫

803
01:05:12,359 --> 01:05:17,898
♫ <i>When we loved each other so much</i> ♫

804
01:05:18,432 --> 01:05:23,820
♫ <i>Now I finally know</i> ♫

805
01:05:23,822 --> 01:05:25,192
<i>(Lee Bu-jeong)</i>

806
01:05:26,873 --> 01:05:31,545
♫ <i>That this street
that we always walked on is... ♫</i>

807
01:05:33,113 --> 01:05:35,449
♫ <i>My home</i> ♫

808

♫ <i>When I call out your name</i> ♫

810
01:05:53,033 --> 01:05:56,903
♫ <i>I wonder how it feels?</i> ♫

811
01:05:58,205 --> 01:06:04,478
♫ <i>I'll take this heart as well</i> ♫

812
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:10,116
♫ <i>I didn't know anything</i> ♫

813
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:13,802
We meet again.

814
01:06:14,702 --> 01:06:15,912
In Seoul.

815
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:25,298
♫ <i>The street with the many stars</i> ♫

816
01:06:25,832 --> 01:06:30,604
♫ <i>That secretly embraced my soft heart is... ♫</i>

817

820
01:07:13,346 --> 01:07:20,854
♫ <i>The street with the many stars</i> ♫

821

824
01:07:30,712 --> 01:07:33,452
<i>I liked you the most, Jeong-su.</i>

825

<i>Where should we go?</i>

827
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:37,552
<i>I know.</i>

828
01:07:37,992 --> 01:07:40,292
<i>How about life with an illusion?</i>
