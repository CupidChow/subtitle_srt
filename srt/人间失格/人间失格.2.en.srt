Part 2 A Country of Rage

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,180
Hello, Father.

4
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,830
Yesterday,

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,090
for the first time in my life,

6
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,690
I wondered if I would have become

7
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,360
a different person

8
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,100
than I am today

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,330
if you were alive.

10
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,310
Where are the other pieces?

11
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:02,420
Hermes?

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,490
Are you doing well?

13
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,630
She's gone mad.

14
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,760
She's not afraid of money.

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,870
She says she's poor

16
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,630
but she buys what she wants.

17
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,370
Seriously. Unbelievable.

18
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,980
Summons

19
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,160
As you can see,

20
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,530
I am

21
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,830
seriously

22
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,400
totally

23
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,100
a mess.

24
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,260
Silence
Pray for the deceased with respect

25
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,150
You may say your last goodbyes.

26
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:19,930
Umm...

27
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:22,390
Jeong-woo.

28
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,130
You look just handsome today.

29
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,570
Your outfit is just perfect.

30
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,640
- Stand here.
- Okay.

31
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,120
I'm sorry

32
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,320
I'm sorry I didn't know.

33
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,690
Goodbye, Jeong-woo.

34
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,950
You owe me KRW 40 mil. and 50,000 now.

35
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,320
Don't forget and pay me back.

36
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,130
Dad, I...

37
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,770
I didn't become anything.

38
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,510
I got born into this world

39
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,480
and didn't become anything.

40
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,750
I think I won't ever make anything of myself.

41
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,950
That's why I'm so lonely, Dad.

42
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,320
Of course.

43
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,920
You're lonely.

44
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,060
Why wouldn't I know that?

45
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,960
It's okay.

46
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,800
- Don't cry. Huh?
- Father...

47
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,410
I think I will become poorer than you.

48
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,700
Father, I...

49
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,570
haven't made anything

50
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,410
of myself.

51
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,660
The Late Jeong Jeong-woo

52
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,890
I was born into this world in the same way.

53
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,330
But I don't think I will be able to

54
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,130
become anything.

55
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,480
The Late Jeong Jeong-woo

56
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,280
Hello.

57
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,910
- Hello.
- Hello.

58
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,050
How can I help you?

59
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,550
- How can I help you?
- How can I help you?

60
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,120
Thank you.

61
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,320
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

62
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,490
Please receive customers energetically and safely.

63
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,130
If you get a complaint,

64
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,730
contact the management team immediately.

65
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,660
Wife
Why did you call?

66
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's have a great and exciting day.

67
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,340
- One, two, three. Fight on!
- She just woke up?

68
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,010
What a life!

69
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,110
Jin Jeong-su

70
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,790
Yeah.

71
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,460
What happened yesterday?

72
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,400
Huh?

73
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,730
What about yesterday?

74
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,140
What do you mean?

75
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,440
You went straight to bed,

76
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,010
wept bitterly, then fell asleep.

77
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,410
Mom was sleeping in the living room.

78
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,740
You didn't even apologize.

79
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,810
When I got in, your mom...

80
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,020
Your mother was out cold, snoring.

81
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,490
Still, you could have talked to her.

82
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,920
What's wrong with you?

83
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,860
What do you mean?

84
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,560
Have some common courtesy.

85
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,730
Courtesy?

86
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,800
She snuck in, opened someone else's mail,

87
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,790
and amidst the chaos, she spent the night.

88
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,500
But I should've woken her up and apologized?

89
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,310
Don't overreact.

90
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,210
And how can you say it was someone else's mail?

91
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,250
People other than me are all someone else.

92
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,750
Your mother, you...

93
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,950
Everyone is someone else.

94
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,150
Okay.

95
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,750
I get it. Wash up and go to work.

96
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,120
Don't get fired from your laid-back job.

97
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,600
Hello?

98
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,070
Hang up. I'm in the toilet.

99
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,340
That's nothing new. Why be shy all of a sudden?

100
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,510
We're family.

101
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,410
What job is ever laid-back?

102
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,650
Why are you yelling all of a sudden?

103
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,880
I didn't...

104
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,790
I didn't do anything.

105
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,230
Hang up.

106
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,610
Is something the matter, Sir?

107
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,450
I called to tell her

108
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,520
I'll be late because of a reunion.

109
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,750
But I didn't get to say that at all.

110
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:27,890
Why?

111
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,190
Was she already angry?

112
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,690
I can't talk to her nowadays.

113
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,500
She's so...

114
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,240
high and mighty.

115
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,700
Is she going through menopause?

116
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,200
Menopause?

117
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,300
You said she's older than you.

118
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,610
She's only 5 years older.

119
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,580
It can't be.

120
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,180
Could it really be menopause?

121
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,650
It's not easy living with an older woman.

122
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,390
Consider that when you get married.

123
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,760
Why get married? I'm not going to.

124
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,030
Why?

125
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,730
What's wrong with marriage?

126
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,600
It's inconvenient. From beginning to end.

127
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,370
Inconvenient...

128
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,940
Right...

129
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,700
It's inconvenient.

130
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,070
Marriage is losing myself.

131
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,280
What?

132
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,450
Why haven't I thought of that before?

133
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,350
Because you're earnest.

134
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,420
Am I earnest?

135
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,590
Yes.

136
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,860
Even your appearance is.

137
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,040
If it's a reunion,

138
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,350
then you'll be out till 12 or 1 AM?

139
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,780
About 1 or 2 AM.

140
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,550
3 AM if I'm really late.

141
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,750
2 AM, 3 AM, 3 AM, 3 AM...

142
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,990
It's a matter of texting or calling.

143
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,860
Calling would be better, right?

144
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,690
But I'm scared to call her.

145
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,030
Apologize for what happened via text.

146
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,300
Apologize? For what?

147
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,600
You know.

148
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,540
"Come to think of it, I was insensitive."

149
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,840
Something like that.

150
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,240
Oh, right, right.

151
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,740
"I have a reunion, so I'll be late today."

152
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,640
- Oh.
- "I'll be home before 12 AM."

153
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,550
Then around 12 AM, you say, "We're wrapping up."

154
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,980
Then at 1 AM,

155
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,120
"I'm trying to get a cab."

156
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,490
"Since I'm in Gangnam, there's so much traffic..."

157
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,890
If you go on like this,

158
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,500
you'll hold out until 2:30 AM.

159
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,720
Wow.

160
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,190
It all sounds so smooth.

161
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,460
What's important to women is

162
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,360
emotional time, rather than physical time.

163
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,230
Wow.

164
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,900
What are you?

165
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,300
Are you a woman?

166
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,030
Oh, my.

167
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,610
You didn't know?

168
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,740
Hmph.

169
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,280
I'll be off now, Sir.

170
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,750
Okay. Bye.

171
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,520
Jin Jeong-su
Come to think of it, I was insensitive.

172
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,130
Jin Jeong-su
I'll be late due to a college reunion.

173
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,830
Jin Jeong-su
I'll be home by midnight.

174
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,250
You know...

175
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,490
Normally, I'd just give that to you.

176
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,820
What?

177
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,160
Don't throw it away. Wash it and use it again.

178
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,700
So...

179
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,800
Would you feel better

180
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,470
if I get off on the next stop?

181
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,480
This situation isn't easy for me either.

182
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,820
But I can't

183
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,830
stay on the bus for you.

184
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,260
Seems like

185
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,300
I need your permission to get off.

186
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,370
Yeah...

187
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,840
It would be

188
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,140
problematic if you stop me again.

189
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,410
I understand.

190
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,320
When a person is extremely sad,

191
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,350
they want to lean on a stranger.

192
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,520
What I'm saying is,

193
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,160
you don't have to feel embarrassed.

194
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,300
So.

195
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,570
Can I get off

196
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,200
at the next stop?

197
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,640
Is that a yes?

198
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,050
Then...

199
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,090
The bell.

200
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,730
If you have more to say,

201
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,730
perhaps I should give you my number.

202
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,900
It's not like the past...

203
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,730
Like the 90s.

204
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,830
Exchanging numbers isn't a big deal nowadays.

205
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,210
What messenger do you use?

206
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,610
Text?

207
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,210
Or...

208
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,580
KakaoTalk?

209
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,660
Okay, KakaoTalk.

210
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,310
What did that mean?

211
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,590
What?

212
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,530
You scrutinized me,

213
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,400
then asked if I used KakaoTalk.

214
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,470
I didn't scrutinize you.

215
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,100
I glanced at you.

216
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,740
You can tell by my clothes?

217
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,650
Clothes have nothing to do with KakaoTalk.

218
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,880
In the past and even now,

219
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,950
people use KakaoTalk a lot.

220
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,720
I was just asking.

221
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,690
You're very sensitive.

222
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,160
What do you use?

223
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,460
I use everything.

224
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,430
Text, KakaoTalk, more recent DMs.

225
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,000
What fits the age and situation.

226
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,030
It's a diverse world.

227
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,170
I'll pay for the handkerchief now.

228
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,170
Jeez.

229
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,710
You're being too cold.

230
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,350
I already gave it to you.

231
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,080
You're right. I use KakaoTalk.

232
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,750
Do you have change?

233
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,730
You want me to give you change?

234
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,560
I only have a KRW 50,000 bill.

235
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,100
Well...

236
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
This is...

237
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,770
US $350...

238
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,940
The exchange rate is KRW 1,200 for a dollar.

239
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,170
I think

240
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,080
I'll have to take it all.

241
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,720
It might be because of the day.

242
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,460
Or it might be because you're sadder than me.

243
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,600
My heart

244
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,430
is leaping

245
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,730
and jolting.

246
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,140
I wanted to be kind.

247
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,230
That is my good will.

248
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,820
This is your good will.

249
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,360
Let's leave it at that.

250
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,280
You should've done that beforehand.

251
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,350
We're on a bus, for crying out loud.

252
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,990
At this rate, you'll never get a job.

253
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,890
I can't do the attendance check beforehand.

254
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,590
I'll turn it off after the roll call.

255
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,430
I have to answer the roll call to get back my money.

256
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,460
You're paid to answer the roll call?

257
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,100
No, it's not that.

258
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,630
It's a long story to explain.

259
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,200
How much do you have?

260
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,440
I'm taking KRW 20,000.

261
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,150
Oh.

262
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,280
What was that money earlier?

263
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,720
Huh?

264
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,750
You just put it in Jeong-woo's pocket.

265
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,020
The folded bill.

266
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,720
Looked like there was a story behind it.

267
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,530
You seem infinitely dense,

268
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,000
but you're infinitely sensitive.

269
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,470
A client folded it? Like a talisman?

270
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,700
Oh.

271
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,440
So other women won't cling to you?

272
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,170
Yeah, could be.

273
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,540
What? There really is a story?

274
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,450
I'm putting an address in your wallet.

275
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:02,980
What address?

276
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,090
Jeong-woo's sister's address I got from the police.

277
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,890
- Sister?
- Yes.

278
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,060
Why?

279
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,420
What do you mean?

280
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,230
What's this?

281
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,270
When we were scattering his ashes in the park,

282
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,870
I grabbed a spoonful.

283
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,370
- Of what?
- Jeong-woo.

284
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,570
What about him?

285
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,110
His ashes.

286
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,040
Hey!

287
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,110
You!

288
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,710
What the?

289
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,350
Why did you throw it?

290
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,580
How can you...

291
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,720
Take this...

292
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,620
A spoonful...?

293
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,490
You sprinkled it just fine with just your hands.

294
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,230
Why are you surprised all of a sudden?

295
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,400
Hey, that's...

296
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,330
...where you do that.

297
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,500
But here...

298
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Huh?

299
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,170
It's an everyday space.

300
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,800
- How could you...
- That's nonsense.

301
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,770
We live all mixed and blended together.

302
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,380
That's not right.

303
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,850
I have to pull an all-nighter at my part-time job.

304
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,950
You give that to Jeong-woo's sister.

305
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,250
But this is...

306
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,260
This is what?

307
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,360
She'll hate it.

308
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,230
If you don't want to go alone, let's go next week.

309
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,600
We need to see her to get the money.

310
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,540
Money?

311
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,540
For the funeral expenses.

312
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,710
Hey.

313
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,980
When have you become so calculative?

314
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,980
The roll call and the funeral expenses...

315
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,750
I was thinking in your shoes,

316
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,820
and it came naturally.

317
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,690
Seriously...

318
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,830
What?

319
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,890
You just hate it?

320
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,930
I just love it. You're the best.

321
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,000
The student

322
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,630
has become the maestro.

323
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,370
The student has become the maestro?

324
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,470
You don't know?

325
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,510
I know.

326
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,500
Music to my ears.

327
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,550
Tougher penalties! Tougher penalties!

328
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,310
Trolling is indirect murder

329
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,480
Tougher penalties for trolls!

330
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,010
No to Trolling! Yes to Polite Comments!

331
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,380
Tougher penalties! Tougher penalties!

332
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,020
Trolling is indirect murder!

333
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,890
Indirect murder! Indirect murder!

334
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,690
Tougher penalties! Tougher penalties!

335
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,560
Stop trolling!

336
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,390
Stop! Stop!

337
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,210
Give tougher penalties...

338
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,840
Ms. Lee Bu-jeong.

339
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,350
What do you do for a living?

340
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,040
Have you heard about "shield lift"?

341
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,400
Shield lift.

342
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,140
Shield is defense.

343
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,310
Lift

344
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,810
is removing it.

345
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:26,890
It's scariest when the person who knows about me

346
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,390
the most turns on me.

347
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,090
Especially about the bad stuff.

348
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,490
That happened to all the presidents.

349
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,560
There are stalking fans.

350
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,840
They chase celebrities 24/7.

351
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,670
This itself is a problem.

352
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,470
But the biggest problem is

353
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,280
when these people turn,

354
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,820
they become the biggest threat.

355
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:57,050
Since they have so much private information.

356
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,720
A person is scary because

357
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,090
the nicer they are when they enter,

358
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,160
the more likely they'll be evil when they exit.

359
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:13,060
With good will, they expect more.

360
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,730
When they are wronged, they feel more betrayed.

361
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,000
That builds up.

362
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,220
It's only a matter of time

363
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,050
for slander to become blackmail.

364
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,820
You're swept up in emotions. You threaten them.

365
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,850
But they don't get scared.

366
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,660
Then you get more agitated.

367
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,660
You exaggerate on the damage you suffered.

368
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,930
Then

369
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,730
you make up stuff.

370
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:48,330
That's how you come to blackmail people.

371
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,210
Of course,

372
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,810
you've been sued for trolling.

373
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,810
But it could change when it goes to prosecution.

374
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,520
Are you threatening me right now?

375
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,520
Did Jeong A-ran say that?

376
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,320
That I'm making stuff up?

377
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,740
You wrote this, right?

378
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,740
Answer me!

379
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,210
Yes.

380
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,750
Your comments are very well written.

381
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,220
Did you major in literature?

382
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,860
I don't think I have to answer that.

383
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,400
Seriously...

384
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,070
You all

385
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:00,410
look so normal on the outside.

386
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,810
Hello, Ms. Jeong Flappy.

387
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,750
Just saying your nickname is making me mad.

388
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,820
In this country of rage that's full of anger,

389
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,190
there's much ridicule, obscenities, thoughtlessness...

390
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,920
You do horrible things in secret,

391
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,920
and act like you have character in public...

392
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,930
You do horrible things in secret,

393
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,700
and act like you have character public.

394
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,430
I'd like to gather all the world's filth

395
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,200
and shove it in your flappy mouth.

396
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,310
How is Writer Heo?

397
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,290
Are you two still

398
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,900
doing that in secret?

399
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,550
Oh, dear. I'm late.

400
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,250
Please keep eating.

401
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,380
No, I'm finished. I'm finished.

402
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,550
Please sit.

403
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,550
Okay.

404
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,390
You're substituting

405
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,530
lunch with bread?

406
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:27,360
No.

407
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,160
I had lunch.

408
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,060
Buying coffee for the same price seemed wasteful.

409
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,570
But I couldn't just sit here.

410
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,000
I got a cup of water for you.

411
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,240
I didn't know what you'd want.

412
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:43,010
I should buy.

413
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,020
What do you want to have?

414
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,810
Then should I have water

415
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,710
and the same thing you're having?

416
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,480
No.

417
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,750
Please sit.

418
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,850
I asked you to meet me, so I'll buy.

419
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:58,460
Oh, but still...

420
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,390
Please sit.

421
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,600
Can I have this and that?

422
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,740
The round one.

423
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:20,010
My friend's daughter is a judicial scrivener.

424
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,520
I casually asked,

425
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,500
Summons

426
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,450
not saying it was about us.

427
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,580
I asked about it.

428
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,020
Yes.

429
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,920
Trolling is

430
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,690
saying bad things

431
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:35,890
to famous people on the computer and phone.

432
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:38,300
Yes, I know what trolling is.

433
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,800
Of course.

434
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,570
It was on the news a lot.

435
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,730
The kids are covering it up,

436
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,310
saying they'll handle it on their own.

437
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,540
But I'm so worried

438
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,210
I can't sleep

439
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,890
and I have no appetite.

440
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,280
What in the world did she say?

441
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,350
If things go wrong,

442
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:00,650
worst case scenario is she could go to jail.

443
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,450
When I heard that,

444
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,920
my heart began pounding.

445
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,870
She didn't hit that person. It was just words.

446
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,860
Why go that far...?

447
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,900
I was so frustrated

448
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,800
and so embarrassed to tell others...

449
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:19,400
I had no one to talk to, so I asked to meet you.

450
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,620
Of all things,

451
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,240
the accuser's name

452
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,980
has been ripped away.

453
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,250
I don't know who it is.

454
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,820
Chang-suk.

455
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:32,680
Umm...

456
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,720
Yes?

457
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,090
I don't know who it is.

458
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,860
I'm not saying this because Bu-jeong is my daughter.

459
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,060
Objectively speaking,

460
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,490
I don't know who she takes after,

461
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,170
but she liked books since she was little.

462
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,740
Liking books doesn't have

463
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,000
anything to do with this.

464
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,040
Anyway,

465
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,680
Bu-jeong

466
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,910
wouldn't do that unless she was provoked.

467
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,880
I want to think that, too.

468
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,020
However,

469
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,550
Bu-jeong...

470
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,820
I mean, your daughter sometimes

471
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,290
screams to herself.

472
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,500
You know that, right?

473
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,900
You know she got treatment for that last year.

474
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,200
But that was...

475
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:25,970
Oh.

476
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,340
Excuse me.

477
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,740
Do you sell soda?

478
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,480
No, but we sell ade drinks

479
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,020
that have carbonated water.

480
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,350
Oh, okay.

481
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,880
I'll have one.

482
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,190
Please get me one, too.

483
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,200
About last year...

484
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,830
You shouldn't say that.

485
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,840
She lost her child.

486
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,010
She had a miscarriage at 5 months.

487
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,040
Because she was busy at work.

488
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,050
Anyway, my Bu-jeong

489
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,080
would never do such a thing

490
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,050
unless she was provoked.

491
00:34:01,469 --> 00:34:02,469
Mom!

492
00:34:05,469 --> 00:34:06,840
Ms. Mi-sun!

493
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:11,640
Where do you think you're going?

494
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,140
- Mom!
- Gang-jae!

495
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,080
- Let go of me!
- Mom! Mom!

496
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,090
What's wrong?

497
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,660
You!

498
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,730
What's going on?

499
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,030
She bit me again!

500
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,430
Don't talk down to me in front of my kid.

501
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,760
It's embarrassing!

502
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,060
What is it this time?

503
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,470
He didn't hit you, did he?

504
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:35,770
He hit me.

505
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:36,700
No way!

506
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,740
I hit you?

507
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,740
You hit me!

508
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,370
I told you, don't talk down to me!

509
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,040
What's going on?

510
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,980
Did he hit you or not?

511
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,240
- I didn't hit her.
- You...

512
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,710
yanked my vest

513
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,080
and pushed me.

514
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,310
Isn't pushing considered hitting?

515
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,120
You attacked me like a rabid dog!

516
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,180
Should I have hugged you instead?

517
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,120
Don't talk down to me in front of my kid!

518
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,350
You want to die?

519
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,320
Kill me! Bite me!

520
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,890
- Bite me! Kill me!
- Get inside!

521
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,320
Mom! Stop biting him!

522
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,730
You! Stop talking down to her.

523
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:01,990
Go inside. Go inside.

524
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,330
Go inside. Go inside.

525
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,670
When I was four,

526
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,840
I got bitten by a pig.

527
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,970
I still remember that.

528
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,540
- I went to the hospital...
- Stop it.

529
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,410
Why are the lights off?

530
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,380
Habits are hard to break.

531
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,380
Here.

532
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,990
Why do you bite people, Mom?

533
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,150
Because I have no strength.

534
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,690
Want me to get beaten up?

535
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,520
You're making things up again!

536
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,460
I get beaten, not you!

537
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,360
Not you, Honey!

538
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,100
So why go to a karaoke that has strippers?

539
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,700
I went there, but I didn't hang out!

540
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,430
A mutt would cut off its poo.

541
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,070
A mutt doesn't eat its poo!

542
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,740
Fight after I leave.

543
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,170
Give me my child support.

544
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,650
What is this vibe?

545
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,580
Oh.

546
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,880
Well...

547
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,490
You're not

548
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:06,260
acting so you won't have to give me money, right?

549
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,740
Get inside.

550
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,100
Oh.

551
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,630
You two talk. The third party is leaving.

552
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,410
Can I give it to you

553
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,580
next month?

554
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,420
Why? You have no money?

555
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,650
I always

556
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,120
have no money.

557
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,790
How can you not give

558
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,560
KRW 300,000 to your only son?

559
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,330
I can't help not having money.

560
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,330
I have no money.

561
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,240
Mom.

562
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,450
Do you love me?

563
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:09,950
Money is love.

564
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,930
I'll give it to you next month.

565
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,200
Okay, then.

566
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,900
The interest is KRW 30,000 a week.

567
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,540
Come on. Lower the interest.

568
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,570
I don't know.

569
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,870
I'll think about it.

570
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,310
The coffee-flavored milk expires tomorrow. Drink.

571
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,780
Cool suit.

572
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,350
Is it a designer label?

573
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,380
Of course.

574
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,220
Are you going somewhere?

575
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,320
Yes.

576
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,160
Where? Somewhere good?

577
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,660
To a funeral. Why?

578
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,930
You're coming next week, right?

579
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:52,230
Next week? Why?

580
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,130
It's your birthday. We'll eat seaweed soup.

581
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,230
Gang-jae's birthday

582
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,270
Wow, how old am I?

583
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,380
You'll be 27.

584
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,310
You don't even know your own age?

585
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,250
What did you do when you were 27?

586
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,490
Well...

587
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,620
Your dad was still alive.

588
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,440
I sent you to school.

589
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,160
Shinyul Elementary. Grade 1 Class #3.

590
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,230
You were an adult.

591
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,340
So you'll come next week?

592
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,710
We'll see.

593
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,230
Father.

594
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:59,960
What should I do, Father?

595
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,950
Somehow, I will

596
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,250
be 27 next week.

597
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,830
We must first learn about the facts.

598
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:32,830
Let's go over Tripitaka Koreana, the easiest one.

599
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,050
Gang-jae
13-2, 67-gil, Itaewon-ro, Yongsan-gu, Seoul

600
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,350
Gang-jae
Want to go get the funeral expenses together?

601
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:48,350
At 27, Mom was already sending me to school.

602
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,220
During the last days of being 26...

603
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,920
I'm thinking, 'What is money?'

604
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,690
And that's it.

605
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,910
Eventually,

606
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,880
I started thinking whoever loves me the most

607
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:27,050
is the one who spends the most money on me.

608
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,050
These bad thoughts fill my mind.

#Jeong A-ran #"Jeong A-ran's Notes on Life" #5:30 PM Today

611
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,690
Father.

612
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,700
If you had money,

613
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,670
you would've given it all to me.

614
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,580
My beloved

615
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,380
Father.

616
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:57,070
I think money is love.

617
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,280
Have I turned completely bad?

618
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:29,140
Have I failed to live like a decent human being?

619
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,180
Gang-jae!

620
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,050
Long time no see.

621
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,350
- How have you been?
- Good.

622
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,890
Hello.

623
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,090
Catch you later.

624
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,060
Gang-jae!

625
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,990
Long time no see!

626
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:56,830
Where's Jong-hoon?

627
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:58,190
In the last room.

628
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,310
Despite that, I still

629
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:07,810
- Hey, Gang-jae!
- What brings you here?

630
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,350
don't want to give up on anything.

631
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,020
Jeong A-ran's Notes on Life

632
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,050
Hello.

633
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,050
Oh, hello.

634
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,990
Oh, my. Thank you.

635
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:20,790
- I'm a fan.
- Thank you.

636
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:21,630
Your name is?

637
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,660
Lee Yeon-joo.

638
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,560
Okay, Lee Yeon-joo.

639
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,170
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

640
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:31,570
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

641
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,200
- I'm a huge fan.
- Why, thank you!

642
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,170
- Can I get a picture?
- Of course.

643
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,940
One, two, three.

644
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,110
- Thank you.
- Sure.

645
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,510
- Your name is?
- Yoon Han-na.

646
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:41,710
- Han-na.
- Yes.

647
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,720
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

648
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:56,860
Hello.

649
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:57,960
I'm a long-time fan.

650
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,560
Can I get your autograph?

651
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Yes.

652
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,970
Thank you.

653
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:03,970
What's your name?

654
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,340
Kang Jae-Hyun.

655
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,270
Oh, Jae-Hyun.

656
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:09,310
- Hello.
- Hi.

657
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:12,080
Yes, thank you.

658
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,480
Thank you.

659
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:17,420
Yes.

660
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,250
This is for you.

661
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,680
Oh, my. What a surprise!

662
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,990
I'm a huge fan.

663
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,590
- Can I shake your hand?
- Oh, yes.

664
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,060
Thank you.

665
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,800
Jin-ah! Jin-ah!

666
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:35,700
Call Jin-ah for me.

667
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,700
Yes, Ma'am.

668
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:44,680
Jin-ah must be busy.

669
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,110
How have you been?

670
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,050
Writer Lee.

671
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,420
Why are you doing this?

672
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,350
I was questioned at the police station earlier.

673
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,190
The detective there told me

674
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:02,020
that you wanted to see me.

675
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:10,130
If you've come to beg for forgiveness,

676
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,070
you picked the wrong date.

677
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,710
You're not here for a favorable arrangement?

678
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,180
Favorable arrangement?

679
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:29,350
Why else would you be here?

680
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,890
I thought you had changed.

681
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:35,490
But you're the same.

682
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:37,600
You don't even know what situation you're in.

683
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,360
If you're not here to beg for forgiveness, leave.

684
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:44,240
I have no time for you.

685
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:48,610
Why?

686
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:51,370
If I don't leave,

687
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,880
are you going to hit me like last time?

688
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:57,720
- Jin-ah!
- Yes, Ma'am.

689
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,460
I'm going to take five.

690
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,120
We'll take a break for five minutes.

691
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,120
Okay.

692
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:06,590
I'm sorry. We'll take a five-minute break.

693
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,790
Have you been well, Jin-ah?

694
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:09,910
Yes, Bu-jeong.

695
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:12,530
Everyone's doing well?

696
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:15,130
Yes.

697
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:18,300
I wanted to drop by to say hi, but I couldn't.

698
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,040
Time just flew by.

699
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:25,080
Bu-jeong. The thing is...

700
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,240
We're in the middle of an event.

701
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:31,050
I read the book.

702
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,650
You didn't change a word.

703
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:35,450
It was all as I had written.

704
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:41,290
Stop making me write pathetic letters to you.

705
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:44,230
Keep your promise.

706
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:49,900
Thanks for coming, Writer Lee.

707
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:53,370
Hello.

708
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:55,670
Oh! We've met before, right?

709
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,480
Oh, thank you for coming to see me again.

710
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:19,100
Hello, Ma'am.

711
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,730
"Jeong A-ran's Notes on Life"
Intent of Plan

712
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,670
If we want to secure our existing readers

713
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:28,770
and expand to readers in their 20s and 30s,

714
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:30,740
we need a new marketing plan.

715
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:32,910
To do that, we need to research more

716
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:34,910
on Jeong A-ran's younger years...

717
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:41,650
before she got famous.

718
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,520
Hello.

719
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:52,760
What the hell are you doing?

720
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:53,930
What the hell?

721
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,370
Just quit everything.

722
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:56,600
Just quit!

723
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,770
What the hell are you doing?

724
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:00,040
Ma'am. Wait. Please calm down, Ma'am.

725
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,370
- Calm down?
- Ma'am, please.

726
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:03,010
Let go! Let go!

727
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:23,030
The crappy book

728
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,760
that was published just the way I wrote it

729
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,730
without changing a damn word...

730
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:31,340
I read it well.

731
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,980
To my dismay,

732
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:41,210
you seem to be

733
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,780
doing so well.

734
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,890
But Ma'am...

735
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,390
If this gets out into the world,

736
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,490
who do you think

737
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,900
would be more damaged by it?

738
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:04,540
Hello, ladies. This way.

739
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,140
I went to tell you something, but forgot.

740
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:18,480
You're not the only one who can sue.

741
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,360
There's nothing I can't do right now.

742
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,840
Because I have nothing to lose.

743
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:06,300
What's with the smile?

744
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,600
It's been a long time.

745
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,770
Work a room before you go, Player.

746
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:15,010
I've retired a long time ago. Stop bugging me.

747
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:17,210
Retire, my foot.

748
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:19,880
My father died of liver cancer at the age of 42.

749
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,510
I resemble him

750
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:24,450
in that fatally attractive look

751
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:26,780
that exudes loneliness.

752
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:30,690
But I also have a bad liver, so I can't drink.

753
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:33,160
I've heard that a thousand times,

754
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,430
but every time, I wonder what he looked like.

755
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:39,260
You have to like to play to do this long, like you.

756
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,430
Play, my foot.

757
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:42,300
I'm dying here.

758
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,970
No matter how much I drink,

759
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:48,270
it's getting me nowhere.

760
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:51,880
So I've been working as a rider since last week.

761
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:53,880
Oh, my.

762
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,710
Delivery? What?

763
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:57,910
Everything.

764
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:59,220
Food.

765
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,280
Daily necessities.

766
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,250
Wow, how did Manager Lee of this famous

767
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:06,660
Gangnam male escort club become like this?

768
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,190
If I'm like this, then it's worse for the others.

769
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:11,230
They're all penniless.

770
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:12,930
They looked good to me.

771
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,370
It's all fake.

772
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,640
You know this.

773
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,900
What do I know?

774
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,970
I'm a normal member of society.

775
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:24,410
That was funny.

776
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:36,190
That bastard.

777
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:38,790
He kept saying he wanted to die.

778
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,060
He got what he wanted.

779
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:45,490
But we're the ones severely damaged.

780
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:51,400
How much did you lend him?

781
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,570
A lot, right?

782
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,110
Let it go.

783
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,710
I heard that Just also lent him money.

784
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,210
Your old friend who was good at studying.

785
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,510
Whatever.

786
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,020
I guess it was a lot.

787
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,690
I don't know. I can't remember.

788
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:10,020
Bastard.

789
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:13,590
You looked for him the most when he disappeared.

790
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:15,990
What do you mean you can't remember?

791
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:18,230
Why act so innocent?

792
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:24,030
I'm scared we'll lose our VIPs because of him.

793
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,910
He had no skills in shadowing someone

794
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:30,810
but he said he'd do it, greedy for money.

795
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,780
He took a big down payment,

796
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,540
but didn't hand in even one photo.

797
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:37,050
What a pain in the butt.

798
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,420
You're the one really good at shadowing.

799
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,620
Right?

800
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:49,890
Want to take the job?

801
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:54,630
Clean up the mess he left.

802
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:59,440
She's a plain housewife. find her dirty secret.

803
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,470
- If she doesn't have any, make one up.
- Jong-hoon.

804
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:02,470
Huh?

805
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,210
I didn't come here to talk about this.

806
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:07,740
Then why are you here?

807
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:09,510
You said you came to talk about Jeong-woo.

808
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:10,850
Jeez.

809
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:15,790
You just scared the bejeesus out of me!

810
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:17,590
Is this talking about Jeong-woo to you?

811
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,830
Even though we met by chance,

812
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,570
we spent a long time together.

813
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:31,570
He died because life was so hard.

814
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:32,870
How can you talk trash about him?

815
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:34,200
That's not right.

816
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,070
He doesn't have a voice now.

817
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,050
How can you ask someone who just held a funeral

818
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,730
to clean up his mess?

819
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,920
Alright, dude!

820
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,500
I take back what I said.

821
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,320
Happy?

822
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:52,960
Huh?

823
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:54,930
Sit down, bastard!

824
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:57,060
If you've come to talk, talk.

825
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,230
How can I talk in this situation?

826
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,570
I'm going through hard times, too.

827
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:05,170
I'm upset that bastard died, too.

828
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:06,240
But

829
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,920
I'm also a victim here.

830
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,510
What should I do? Kill myself?

831
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:16,850
I'm leaving.

832
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,950
You came because you're lonely.

833
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:27,520
You belong with us. Not kids like Just.

834
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,360
Oh, and think about that job!

835
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,700
I'll make sure you get paid a lot! Jeez.

836
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:40,640
So hardheaded.

837
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,220
Someone's coming?

838
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,520
Gyeong-eun.

839
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,190
She just got off the subway.

840
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,490
You should've told me beforehand.

841
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:06,830
Hey.

842
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,700
She's also an alumnus. She can come if she wants.

843
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,270
No one needs your permission.

844
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,370
I don't feel comfortable.

845
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:17,110
We had to have a reunion twice a year for 6 years

846
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:19,810
because of you two. We're exhausted.

847
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:21,810
Let things go and relax now.

848
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:24,750
I'm uncomfortable.

849
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,180
Then

850
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:29,050
you should've married her no matter what.

851
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:32,490
You two were madly in love, but married separately.

852
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:33,520
Making us all uncomfortable.

853
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,460
You didn't marry your first love either.

854
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:39,160
My situation is different.

855
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:42,630
Gyeong-eun said she's okay with you being here.

856
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,370
That's not why I'm uncomfortable.

857
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:52,140
Didn't she say her husband was sick?

858
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,240
Yeah.

859
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,610
Cancer.

860
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:58,010
But last time, she said he got well after surgery.

861
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,750
Gyeong-eun

862
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,420
talked about you a lot when we met.

863
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,520
About me?

864
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,860
- Yeah.
- Don't look excited.

865
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,190
She's living a good life.

866
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:11,290
Don't even think about it.

867
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:12,970
Are you drunk already?

868
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,230
Watch what you're saying.

869
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,530
You don't know anything.

870
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:20,040
You picking a fight?

871
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,600
Where are you going?

872
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,240
You're not going home, are you?

873
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,640
Hey, eat up.

874
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,580
The meat is all cooked.

875
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,580
This is delicious.

876
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,540
- Gyeong-eun!
- Hey!

877
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,440
- Oh, hi!
- Hi!

878
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,240
- It's been such a long time!
- Hi!

879
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,350
You look so pretty!

880
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:03,950
Long time no see!

881
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:14,590
Gyeon-eun, have a drink.

882
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:17,260
- Let's have a drink.
- Pour me a glass.

883
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,760
It's so good to see you.

884
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,000
How have you been?

885
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:24,030
Cheers!

886
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:26,500
Good to see you!

887
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:32,740
Eat up, Gyeong-eun.

888
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,840
Okay. Let's eat.

889
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,050
- You came straight from the office?
- Yeah.

890
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:39,280
You haven't changed a bit.

891
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,750
You've gotten prettier.

892
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:42,410
You look so good.

893
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:45,990
Five-way Intersection Pharmacy

894
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:56,670
Huh?

895
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:58,170
You're closing up?

896
00:57:58,170 --> 00:57:59,370
Long time no see.

897
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:00,400
What brings you here?

898
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:04,610
Did you not get my monthly rent?

899
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:06,710
I got it.

900
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:07,710
Then why...

901
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:09,910
Oh, are you not feeling well?

902
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:11,820
Give me that thing.

903
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,280
That thing?

904
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,720
That thing I drank the other time.

905
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:19,120
Oh, that!

906
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,690
Yeah, that.

907
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:22,160
You want to drink it now?

908
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,460
It's not good to drink it before going to bed.

909
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:25,700
Are you going somewhere?

910
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:28,470
My insides feel clogged up and I'm suffocating.

911
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:29,830
Where would I go?

912
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:32,070
Oh, you want digestive medicine.

913
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:34,500
I thought you were looking for an invigorating drink.

914
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,540
So I thought you were going somewhere nice.

915
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,040
Somewhere nice for an old person?

916
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,040
You mean heaven?

917
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,680
Oh, stop that.

918
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,660
You're still young.

919
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:47,920
Drink it slowly.

920
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:53,260
Ah, that's more like it.

921
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:56,330
What did you eat that caused you indigestion?

922
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:57,660
Did you have too much for dinner?

923
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,340
I haven't eaten anything.

924
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:02,730
But I've been stressed for a few days.

925
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:04,900
Right.

926
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,340
Stress is the worst.

927
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,640
Did something unsettling happen?

928
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:14,380
You're kind, smart,

929
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,750
prettier the more I look

930
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:17,810
and you speak so prettily.

931
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:20,250
Me?

932
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:23,650
If my brother heard you, he'd barf.

933
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:25,390
You're funny and easygoing.

934
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,020
Oh, stop it now.

935
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,830
I'm going to have indigestion.

936
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:34,160
You should've met my son when I asked you to.

937
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,730
Not that again.

938
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:37,430
It's been more than 10 years.

939
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:39,970
It's already been that long?

940
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:40,970
Yes.

941
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,210
And your son is already married.

942
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:47,440
That's right.

943
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:50,480
No matter how upset I am, I shouldn't say this.

944
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:52,720
I'll be punished.

945
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:54,420
Thank you

946
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:58,320
for locking up my mouth before I sinned again.

947
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,620
Want me to get more digestive medicine?

948
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:02,990
The syrup kind and pills?

949
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,130
You're so kind and thoughtful.

950
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,500
Oh, no, I'm not.

951
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,240
I'm only good-natured in the pharmacy.

952
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,040
At home, I'm like a fighting bull.

953
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:17,770
That's better than the crazy cow at home.

954
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:18,770
What?

955
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,910
I was talking to myself.

956
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,550
You're making me blush.

957
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:31,690
Dad!

958
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,130
Open up.

959
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,200
Should I call the ambulance? Huh?

960
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,500
Seriously...

961
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:57,090
Are you okay, Dad?

962
01:00:58,410 --> 01:00:59,480
Wait.

963
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:02,720
Did you get an upset stomach after eating this?

964
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,890
No.

965
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,060
Where did you get this?

966
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:09,390
Did someone give it to you?

967
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:10,660
No.

968
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,360
I got a doggy bag for the leftovers at lunch.

969
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:27,640
You...

970
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:31,280
went there for lunch?

971
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:33,850
Huh?

972
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:36,520
Who did you meet for lunch?

973
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,520
I didn't meet anyone.

974
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:42,290
Who'd you meet? Jeong-su?

975
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:44,330
No.

976
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:48,370
I'm fine. Go home and fix dinner.

977
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:51,030
Jeong-su said he'll be late. He has a reunion.

978
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:52,840
Still, go home.

979
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,070
How can I leave when you're sick like this?

980
01:01:57,610 --> 01:01:58,680
Dad.

981
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:01,610
If it's bad, let's go to the hospital.

982
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:03,150
No.

983
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:04,880
I'm not sick.

984
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,180
It's not that kind of thing.

985
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:09,420
Then what is it?

986
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:13,490
What made you look so miserable in one day?

987
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:16,890
When you're old, you always look miserable.

988
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:24,570
You met someone, right?

989
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:27,740
Huh?

990
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:31,040
Dad!

991
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:36,950
Oh, dear.

992
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:39,630
What is it, Dad? Huh?

993
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:41,750
Tell me.

994
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:50,890
I...

995
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:51,890
Yeah.

996
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,200
I thought hard all day.

997
01:02:58,330 --> 01:03:01,370
But I know no one in the police.

998
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:06,640
I remembered someone from the Seosan family

999
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,410
worked at a local police station,

1000
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:12,280
so I called everyone I knew.

1001
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:16,120
But they're all dead and gone.

1002
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,690
I...

1003
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:26,930
I lived a poor life

1004
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,900
and you're suffering for that.

1005
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,370
Since the police summoned you,

1006
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:37,570
you must've been so scared alone.

1007
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:40,740
I didn't know that.

1008
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,950
I thought you were acting strange.

1009
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:46,850
But I thought it was just family matters.

1010
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:51,250
I thought it was about the miscarriage.

1011
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,060
I'm such a fool

1012
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,730
that I don't know even when I see it.

1013
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:02,670
I'm a knucklehead.

1014
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,870
You poor little thing.

1015
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,810
You must've suffered so much.

1016
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,780
I'm not little.

1017
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:18,720
Did you meet Jeong-su for lunch?

1018
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,420
Did he tell you?

1019
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:24,450
No. I said it wasn't Jeong-su.

1020
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:27,220
But there's no one else but Jeong-su.

1021
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,660
It's not important who I met.

1022
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:33,900
I should know.

1023
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:37,770
Even if I can't do anything, I should know.

1024
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:44,370
Was...

1025
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:47,640
there a big misunderstanding?

1026
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:51,910
The only bad words you know are stupid and jerk.

1027
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:54,250
So what could you have said to go to the police?

1028
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:58,920
There was a misunderstanding, right?

1029
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:01,720
Right.

1030
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,330
What you said is right.

1031
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:05,700
There was a misunderstanding.

1032
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:10,170
When do you go to the police station?

1033
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:11,200
I'm coming with you.

1034
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,140
That's nonsense. I'm old enough to go alone.

1035
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:17,040
What does age have to do with it?

1036
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,310
Even when you're 60, you're still my child.

1037
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:21,840
They said I don't have to go.

1038
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:24,780
I don't have to go.

1039
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:26,050
Huh?

1040
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:28,020
Really?

1041
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:30,990
It's all been taken care of.

1042
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:33,490
Like you said, there was a misunderstanding.

1043
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,930
A long time ago...

1044
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,600
There was someone

1045
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,570
I got to know while making a book.

1046
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:47,240
I guess she held a grudge against me.

1047
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,910
So we met up and got things sorted.

1048
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,380
I don't have to go to the police station.

1049
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,180
Really?

1050
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:55,310
Yes.

1051
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:57,610
Are you sure?

1052
01:05:57,610 --> 01:05:59,050
Yes.

1053
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:16,370
You think I'm crazy?

1054
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:17,400
It wasn't me.

1055
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,800
Then who was it? Only you and I know about it.

1056
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:23,170
I'm telling you, it wasn't me.

1057
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:24,370
Then was it your mother?

1058
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:25,910
How can you...

1059
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:30,580
I'm going to spend the night at my dad's house.

1060
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:31,880
Don't wait up.

1061
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,150
Do what you want,

1062
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,190
but know that it wasn't me.

1063
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:39,090
Let's talk tomorrow. I'm hanging up now.

1064
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:45,730
That sounded pretty serious.

1065
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:47,930
Was that your wife?

1066
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:51,100
It's nothing. Nothing serious.

1067
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,670
I came out to call home, too.

1068
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:00,980
How's your wife?

1069
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,020
You want to know how she is?

1070
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,520
Hmph...

1071
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,360
Can't I even ask?

1072
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,920
Why are you so serious?

1073
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:24,670
They're getting ready to hit another place.

1074
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,570
Let's go inside.

1075
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,870
You shouldn't have come.

1076
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:35,140
If I knew you were coming, I wouldn't have come.

1077
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:37,950
I just

1078
01:07:40,419 --> 01:07:42,690
wanted to see you one more time.

1079
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:45,020
I wondered

1080
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,289
how you were after that time.

1081
01:07:49,789 --> 01:07:51,789
Why would you wonder about that?

1082
01:07:55,999 --> 01:07:57,070
Just...

1083
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,039
I still think about you first

1084
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:06,080
whenever things get tough for me.

1085
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,110
You're really

1086
01:08:11,749 --> 01:08:12,980
sickening.

1087
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:14,780
Why?

1088
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:17,289
Because I'm more honest than you?

1089
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:20,860
You're honest?

1090
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:23,629
I'm more honest than you.

1091
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:39,440
My husband...

1092
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:48,379
...is dying.

1093
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:54,560
Since that time,

1094
01:08:55,589 --> 01:08:57,270
a year has passed, I think.

1095
01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:01,959
He's been in a nursing hospital all year.

1096
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,740
I did my best.

1097
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:18,950
But I got punished in the end.

1098
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:36,770
Thank you.

1099
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:45,940
Jeong A-ran
Can we talk over the phone?

1100
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:04,760
Jeong-woo...

1101
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,300
KRW 40 mil...

1102
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:09,400
I'm selling clothes I don't wear

1103
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,430
and a bunch of other stuff.

1104
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:13,140
And this studio apartment

1105
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:13,870
gets leased out quickly

1106
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:16,940
so I'm thinking of putting it on the market.

1107
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:18,410
You know the security deposit

1108
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:20,040
for this place is KRW 15 mil.

1109
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:23,280
I'll use KRW 5 mil. to move.

1110
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:27,180
How long will you hold out?

1111
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,390
Until you win the lottery?

1112
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:30,850
Until you get a job.

1113
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:32,090
When you get a job,

1114
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:33,290
I'll clean up everything.

1115
01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:34,820
Winning the lottery will be faster.

1116
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:37,560
She's still here.

1117
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,290
Who?

1118
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:39,400
Enjoy.

1119
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,000
Min-jeong.

1120
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:42,730
You watch your back with her.

1121
01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:44,430
She's the female version of me.

1122
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:45,470
Oh.

1123
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:48,800
I'm doomed.

1124
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,640
It's the end of the world. The apocalypse.

1125
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:53,270
Jeez.

1126
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,960
How can this be?

1127
01:10:57,870 --> 01:10:59,310
There's no kimchi.

1128
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:06,990
What do you mean she's the female version of you?

1129
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:10,390
She'll do anything to survive.

1130
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:19,470
This is insane.

1131
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,440
So?

1132
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:24,870
You'll go out to buy some kimchi?

1133
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:30,640
If you're going out, turn off the stove.

1134
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:37,850
Jeong A-ran
Can we talk over the phone?

1135
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:52,230
Jeong A-ran

1136
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:02,080
Writer Lee?

1137
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:05,580
Writer Lee?

1138
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,550
Don't call me that.

1139
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:15,190
What are you playing at?

1140
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:16,960
What do you mean?

1141
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:19,760
What do you want?

1142
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:22,310
There's nothing I want.

1143
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,600
For how...

1144
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,870
For how long are you going to do this?

1145
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:29,970
Do you know how hard it is for us to find and

1146
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:32,710
remove all the things you write about me?

1147
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,610
Us? Who's us?

1148
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:37,970
Is it Writer Heo?

1149
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:39,380
Hey!

1150
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,080
How dare you!

1151
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,130
Don't yell at me.

1152
01:12:56,130 --> 01:12:57,600
You shouldn't have brought up Writer Heo!

1153
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,700
Is that all

1154
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:01,670
you can say

1155
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:04,210
to me in this situation?

1156
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,280
As you said,

1157
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,290
I have no human decency.

1158
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:19,960
So don't expect any forgiveness or mercy from me!

1159
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,490
Got that?

1160
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:24,190
You're right.

1161
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:26,570
I've gone crazy.

1162
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:29,900
I'm in and out of the police station,

1163
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,040
making my elderly dad lie sick in bed.

1164
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:36,300
So how could I be in my right mind?

1165
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:40,380
Just you wait.

1166
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,280
You'll see everything that I know,

1167
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:46,450
even the things you've forgotten,

1168
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:48,880
spread out before the world.

1169
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:50,950
Do you have a death wish?

1170
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,160
How did you know?

1171
01:13:57,630 --> 01:13:59,330
I do want to die.

1172
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:02,400
I'm

1173
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,800
so embarrassed

1174
01:14:06,370 --> 01:14:08,340
that I want to die right now!

1175
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:14,610
Because of you,

1176
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:16,580
I lost my job.

1177
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:18,530
I lost my child.

1178
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:20,690
And I lost myself.

1179
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,450
Yet you can't find it in you

1180
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,420
to say sorry,

1181
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,720
and make me like this again?

1182
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,290
Alright.

1183
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:31,530
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1184
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:34,260
Okay? Happy? Huh?

1185
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:41,300
Ms. Jeong A-ran.

1186
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:48,240
I learned a new word today at the police station.

1187
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:53,920
Have you heard about "shield lift"?

1188
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:56,150
If you haven't,

1189
01:14:56,790 --> 01:15:00,360
ask what it is to an idol star on your TV show.

1190
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:05,330
I have a medical report of when you hit me.

1191
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:10,930
I have tons of info on you the world doesn't know.

1192
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:12,820
Starting today,

1193
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,410
I'm shield lifting you.

1194
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:11,890
Jeong A-ran

1195
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,950
Why die?

1196
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:15,310
Just don't pick up.

1197
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:14,810
Lost

1198
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,750
When we meet next time,

1199
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:18,620
let's exchange it.

1200
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:19,330
KakaoTalk.

1201
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:20,790
You know the guy living at the end of the hall?

1202
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:21,920
The playboy?

1203
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,960
It seems he saw me for the first time yesterday

1204
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:26,460
while I know what kind of instant noodles he eats.

1205
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,030
Why'd you wear that?

1206
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:30,770
We're going to get money for the funeral expenses.

1207
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:32,300
What do you want?

1208
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:33,570
Money?

1209
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:36,240
It's impressive, seeing you work.

1210
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:38,670
What do you want?

1211
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:40,380
Don't you think it's a shame?

1212
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:42,380
The girl trolling me...

1213
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:44,210
You said you'll make her powerless.

1214
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:45,980
Please come with us for now.

1215
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:49,080
What do you want me to do?

1216
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:51,750
Everything that's bad.
