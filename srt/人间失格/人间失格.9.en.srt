Part 9 Three People

3
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:25,855
Hello, Ma'am.

4
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:33,125
Ever since I last saw you,

5
00:00:35,675 --> 00:00:40,175
I've been thinking about the right to be human.

6
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:58,425
Manager Ahn / A photo has been sent

7
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:11,745
Not a family member,

8
00:01:12,345 --> 00:01:13,405
a friend,

9
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:15,675
or a colleague,

10
00:01:16,115 --> 00:01:18,145
but the right to be a human being.

11
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,695
The right to judge the world,

12
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:32,765
criticize,

13
00:01:33,824 --> 00:01:34,995
be enraged

14
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,435
and despair.

15
00:01:39,635 --> 00:01:42,405
Meeting someone isn't that easy.

16
00:01:42,905 --> 00:01:44,675
We were total strangers a few days ago.

17
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:47,745
I texted her, but she's not replying.

18
00:01:49,315 --> 00:01:50,845
I'll text you when she calls.

19
00:01:58,525 --> 00:02:01,155
The right that you have and I don't.

20
00:02:06,395 --> 00:02:08,065
I've been thinking about that.

21
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,345
Yes, I received it well. Thank you.

22
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:21,275
I'll forward it to her.

23
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:24,615
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Wait.
- Hello.

24
00:02:26,585 --> 00:02:27,645
Oh, and

25
00:02:27,645 --> 00:02:30,355
what about the issue with Mr. Seo?

26
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:38,225
Oh, I'll call you back later.

27
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:39,225
Hello.

28
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:41,965
But Ma'am...

29
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:47,065
What is that world you speak of?

30
00:02:49,305 --> 00:02:51,125
And what is that human being?

31
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,655
Don't mind them.

32
00:02:56,115 --> 00:02:56,945
Let's begin.

33
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:58,245
I'll move the chair backward.

34
00:03:07,425 --> 00:03:08,955
Let's begin the exam.

35
00:03:09,395 --> 00:03:10,695
Relax.

36
00:03:13,165 --> 00:03:14,295
Does...

37
00:03:15,765 --> 00:03:17,965
...that even really exist?

38
00:03:24,345 --> 00:03:25,505
Is that mine?

39
00:03:26,545 --> 00:03:28,375
No, it's mine.

40
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:29,975
Should I turn it off?

41
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:34,415
No, you're doing business.

42
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:40,984
Don't overreact.

43
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:43,195
Okay.

44
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:44,825
Can you pull up my seat?

45
00:03:53,905 --> 00:03:56,775
Go see if they're starting again.

46
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,345
You're going back?

47
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,105
I'm not retiring, so I should go back in.

48
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,195
Can you give me a wet wipe?

49
00:04:11,015 --> 00:04:12,015
Okay.

50
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:20,325
Just doing what you want

51
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:21,795
isn't living.

52
00:04:22,935 --> 00:04:24,495
You should do what you dislike well.

53
00:04:25,205 --> 00:04:26,885
That's the real deal.

54
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:31,135
Why are you just staring at me?

55
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,845
Go see if they're starting or not.

56
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,785
I don't want the staff to say I delayed the shoot.

57
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:40,785
Okay.

58
00:04:42,885 --> 00:04:45,025
Oh, uh...

59
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:46,855
Hmm?

60
00:04:48,095 --> 00:04:49,895
That woman.

61
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:51,695
What woman?

62
00:04:58,635 --> 00:04:59,635
Never mind.

63
00:05:00,505 --> 00:05:01,805
I'll be right back.

64
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:29,695
Just

65
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:42,245
When I was kicked out of the trainee dorm,

66
00:05:42,245 --> 00:05:43,675
he let me crash at his place.

67
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:47,985
He...let you sleep at his place?

68
00:05:47,985 --> 00:05:48,885
Yes.

69
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:51,285
A lot. He let me in a lot.

70
00:05:54,485 --> 00:05:57,495
Your call cannot be connected...

71
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,935
Why isn't Gang-jae just picking up?

72
00:06:07,205 --> 00:06:10,375
Is Ji-yeon, your pretty ex-wife, okay?

73
00:06:13,675 --> 00:06:16,314
I checked she was okay before I came.

74
00:06:32,865 --> 00:06:33,725
Hey.

75
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:37,435
Just don't.

76
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:38,535
Why are you getting irritated?

77
00:06:38,535 --> 00:06:40,435
I'm doing my best.

78
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,635
That's doing your best?

79
00:06:44,675 --> 00:06:47,545
You shelved two boxes in 30 minutes.

80
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:49,145
If you don't want to help out, don't.

81
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:51,415
I didn't say I didn't want to help out.

82
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:53,815
I was on the phone.

83
00:06:55,055 --> 00:06:57,715
Is Gang-jae your girlfriend? Are you two dating?

84
00:06:57,715 --> 00:06:58,485
What's wrong with you?

85
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,555
I almost fell.

86
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:03,755
You left early morning and were with him all day.

87
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:06,125
You just got home. And you're calling him again?

88
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,025
If I have business with him, I can call him.

89
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:09,995
I don't have to wait hours between calls.

90
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:11,275
You're being weird.

91
00:07:13,035 --> 00:07:15,135
- Forget it.
- Huh?

92
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:17,535
You're so...

93
00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:20,605
I came here straight without even changing.

94
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:22,445
But you keep getting irritated.

95
00:07:22,445 --> 00:07:23,615
You're getting irritated, too.

96
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:25,115
You're getting more irritated.

97
00:07:25,115 --> 00:07:27,145
You're really lousy.

98
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:28,085
You're lousy, too.

99
00:07:28,085 --> 00:07:30,285
You're lousier. I'm leaving.

100
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:32,285
What are you doing? Where are you going?

101
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:33,285
You're really leaving?

102
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:34,855
Of course.

103
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,555
If you leave, who will do all this?

104
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:39,695
Call Woo-nam, who's sleeping at home.

105
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:42,325
Be quiet. You're too loud.

106
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:44,635
Welcome...

107
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,005
Long time no see, Soon-gyu.

108
00:07:51,535 --> 00:07:52,575
Yeah.

109
00:07:55,045 --> 00:07:56,725
It's been a long time.

110
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:02,385
Has it been a long time?

111
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:05,324
Yes, it has.

112
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:07,985
I haven't seen you since I got married.

113
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:11,155
Right.

114
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:15,765
Oh, Soon-ju.

115
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,565
- Huh?
- Come over here and say hi.

116
00:08:17,905 --> 00:08:19,205
She's a college acquaintance.

117
00:08:19,435 --> 00:08:20,835
Oh.

118
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:22,735
Hello.

119
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,075
Hello.

120
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:25,975
This is my brother.

121
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:27,405
Oh.

122
00:08:27,545 --> 00:08:30,245
You saw him, but you probably don't remember.

123
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:32,845
He has a common face.

124
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:38,955
Oh, you know.

125
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:41,225
She came over to our house a few times.

126
00:08:41,695 --> 00:08:43,395
With Woo-nam.

127
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:49,465
Oh.

128
00:08:49,465 --> 00:08:52,435
Woo-nam is in, right?

129
00:09:00,545 --> 00:09:01,715
I don't know.

130
00:09:08,455 --> 00:09:09,655
He isn't

131
00:09:10,185 --> 00:09:11,855
picking up his phone.

132
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:16,395
The hospital said he's on the night shift.

133
00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:17,595
So I came here.

134
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:20,225
I want to see him.

135
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:46,885
Soon-ju

136
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:49,255
This is no time to sleep, Woo-nam.

137
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:53,365
She might charge into our home.

138
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:54,995
Pick up. Now. Jeez.

139
00:09:56,635 --> 00:09:58,935
Woo-nam is in big trouble.

140
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:06,365
I have a bad memory.

141
00:10:06,805 --> 00:10:10,245
I forget the face of the person I just saw.

142
00:10:10,645 --> 00:10:14,785
So I don't even try to memorize names.

143
00:10:15,385 --> 00:10:18,685
But I can memorize scripts extremely well.

144
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:22,095
If you grasp the context of the role,

145
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:23,555
you can memorize the script naturally.

146
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:25,325
You don't have to make an effort.

147
00:10:25,695 --> 00:10:26,765
That's why

148
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:30,435
Mr. Seo doesn't read the script while on site.

149
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:32,705
Come to think of it, that's right.

150
00:10:32,835 --> 00:10:35,135
Don't you get anxious without the script?

151
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:38,175
I'm so scared when I put the script down.

152
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,505
You should enjoy the filming as it is

153
00:10:42,045 --> 00:10:44,175
and prepare at home.

154
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:47,485
An artist enjoys the anxiety.

155
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,155
An actor shouldn't be mature.

156
00:10:50,285 --> 00:10:52,185
If you are,

157
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:54,325
then you become an office worker.

158
00:11:57,685 --> 00:11:59,045
Mr. Seo Jin-seop.

159
00:12:11,635 --> 00:12:12,765
I'm a fan.

160
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:16,835
Okay.

161
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:27,985
You should get that.

162
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:30,855
Sure.

163
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:50,775
Yes, Ma'am?

164
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:53,185
You don't have to hurry.

165
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,615
The hole becomes larger as you age.

166
00:12:58,075 --> 00:12:59,645
The photo you see on the screen

167
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,855
is a cross section of the spine of a man in his 30s.

168
00:13:02,855 --> 00:13:06,825
As you can see, there are small holes evenly.

169
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,045
The channels are all the same.

170
00:13:28,415 --> 00:13:31,445
Do you want to see anything? A soap opera?

171
00:13:33,015 --> 00:13:34,545
The sports channel?

172
00:13:42,525 --> 00:13:43,995
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

173
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:53,565
Are you not going to answer?

174
00:13:57,505 --> 00:13:59,645
Why should I?

175
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:05,915
Why should I do that?

176
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:20,065
Where did it go?

177
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:25,095
Whoa.

178
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:27,095
Woo-nam is a different person.

179
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:29,235
Incredible.

180
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,775
I'm going mad.

181
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:31,805
What are you doing?

182
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,605
Where did that go?

183
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:34,505
What?

184
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:36,145
You know.

185
00:14:36,945 --> 00:14:38,715
That thing

186
00:14:38,715 --> 00:14:41,015
we bought on the home shopping channel.

187
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:42,685
That's no help at all.

188
00:14:42,885 --> 00:14:44,615
You buy almost everything on that channel.

189
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:46,585
No, I mean

190
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,925
what you bought with your first paycheck.

191
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:53,895
The tea set used in Buckingham Palace.

192
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:55,325
Oh.

193
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,495
For when you get married...

194
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:03,875
What I bought you as a gift?

195
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:07,745
Where is that?

196
00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:09,415
On top of the fridge.

197
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:12,615
Why'd you put this here?

198
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:13,985
Bring it down and wash it.

199
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,415
I'm going to work.

200
00:15:18,455 --> 00:15:20,685
You can't go alone.

201
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:22,095
Take me with you.

202
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:23,195
Take you with me where?

203
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:25,195
I'm going to give them drinks and leave, too.

204
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:28,165
Soon-gyu, I'm really late for work.

205
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,575
Just to the front door.

206
00:15:36,175 --> 00:15:37,875
If you leave by yourself, you're dead.

207
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:39,895
Wash it quickly.

208
00:15:42,715 --> 00:15:44,245
I'm really late.

209
00:15:49,655 --> 00:15:52,885
Are you really going to leave after washing this?

210
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:53,755
Huh?

211
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:56,325
Huh?

212
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:57,525
Yeah.

213
00:16:00,565 --> 00:16:02,865
Look at the bags under my eyes.

214
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,165
E-Commerce Zone

215
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:13,045
Sir, you know the text earlier?

216
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:14,205
What text?

217
00:16:14,745 --> 00:16:16,545
From your wife.

218
00:16:16,915 --> 00:16:17,915
Oh.

219
00:16:19,815 --> 00:16:20,645
Hey.

220
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:23,555
You think it's weird, too, right?

221
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,055
"Let's eat out tonight."

222
00:16:27,425 --> 00:16:29,395
"I'll be late because of a meeting."

223
00:16:29,395 --> 00:16:30,155
"Sorry."

224
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,425
I don't think it's weird, but...

225
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:33,595
But?

226
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:38,035
You said your wife doesn't apologize much.

227
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:39,905
So I keep thinking about it.

228
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:42,365
Does she really not apologize?

229
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,004
Nope.

230
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,605
Not because she's nasty and mean.

231
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:50,075
Because she doesn't do anything wrong.

232
00:16:51,045 --> 00:16:52,244
At first,

233
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,485
I think I'm right.

234
00:16:54,845 --> 00:16:56,415
But then I listen to her,

235
00:16:56,855 --> 00:16:58,755
and she turns out to be right.

236
00:16:58,825 --> 00:16:59,925
Oh.

237
00:17:01,325 --> 00:17:02,395
I guess that can happen.

238
00:17:02,395 --> 00:17:03,755
It's true.

239
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:05,155
I believe you.

240
00:17:06,265 --> 00:17:07,465
So...

241
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:12,635
Why is she sorry then?

242
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:15,675
Beats me.

243
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,375
Then go visit her with some snacks.

244
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:20,645
Where?

245
00:17:20,645 --> 00:17:21,945
At her workplace.

246
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,015
Are you crazy?

247
00:17:24,015 --> 00:17:26,585
Why? You need snacks when you work late.

248
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:28,485
Her work requires her to use her brain a lot.

249
00:17:29,055 --> 00:17:30,185
You're right.

250
00:17:30,915 --> 00:17:33,125
When she'd work late when we just got married,

251
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,725
I packed a bunch of desserts from our store

252
00:17:36,195 --> 00:17:38,125
and went to her workplace often.

253
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:39,625
What does she like?

254
00:17:40,495 --> 00:17:41,825
My wife likes

255
00:17:43,465 --> 00:17:44,395
macarons.

256
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:45,935
Wow.

257
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,775
Macarons when you first got married?

258
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:51,105
She had an advanced taste in food.

259
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:53,545
When did you visit her last?

260
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:55,275
I don't know.

261
00:17:55,845 --> 00:17:57,675
About a year or two ago?

262
00:17:58,315 --> 00:18:01,045
No, I think it's been 3 years.

263
00:18:03,855 --> 00:18:05,885
It's only been 3 years,

264
00:18:08,385 --> 00:18:10,255
but it seems like a lifetime ago.

265
00:18:19,105 --> 00:18:20,765
You won't understand.

266
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:25,445
The bleeding will stop in a couple of days.

267
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:29,245
Overall, it looks good.

268
00:18:29,715 --> 00:18:31,945
There's nothing to worry about for now.

269
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:34,385
Okay.

270
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:37,615
You missed the last follow-up.

271
00:18:38,255 --> 00:18:41,225
You had a miscarriage last March...

272
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:42,795
2nd.

273
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:46,105
It's been a year today.

274
00:18:50,435 --> 00:18:52,705
I think I told you then.

275
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:56,005
A missed miscarriage on Week 20

276
00:18:56,005 --> 00:18:58,705
isn't common, but it can happen.

277
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,805
It's no one's fault.

278
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,545
But you have to be careful

279
00:19:05,315 --> 00:19:08,325
because it was an advanced maternal age pregnancy

280
00:19:08,985 --> 00:19:12,425
and the baby was in the womb after cardiac arrest

281
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:14,705
for quite a long time.

282
00:19:15,825 --> 00:19:18,195
That's why there was heavy infection.

283
00:19:18,295 --> 00:19:19,465
In the end,

284
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,695
you had emergency surgery

285
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,935
and you were hospitalized for a long time.

286
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:27,735
Actually,

287
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:29,705
to be brutally honest,

288
00:19:31,235 --> 00:19:35,075
you were with a dead baby for over 5 weeks.

289
00:19:35,915 --> 00:19:38,475
In a small room with no one else

290
00:19:39,085 --> 00:19:40,445
but the two of you.

291
00:19:44,955 --> 00:19:46,225
In that case,

292
00:19:47,425 --> 00:19:49,555
there is damage to the body and mind.

293
00:19:51,495 --> 00:19:53,295
If you're experiencing pain anywhere,

294
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:56,035
don't feel guilty. Tell me.

295
00:19:57,035 --> 00:19:58,135
One by one.

296
00:19:58,735 --> 00:19:59,865
Step by step.

297
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:09,675
What can I do?

298
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:17,145
I was passing by the hospital, and thought of Min-su. How is he?
He went to heaven recently.

299
00:20:14,985 --> 00:20:17,485
How should I start?

300
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,325
Gu Min-young!

301
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:23,395
Over here, please.

302
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:27,645
I'll take a blood sample.

303
00:20:32,555 --> 00:20:33,705
Wait, please.

304
00:20:39,275 --> 00:20:40,705
It's all done.

305
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:42,615
Here's your credit card. You're done.

306
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:43,615
Thank you.

00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:03,235

00:21:28,585 --> 00:21:31,125
I don't know if it's right

311
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:35,025
saying this right now...

312
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:05,925
But

313
00:22:07,395 --> 00:22:09,265

I'm sorry.

317
00:22:53,445 --> 00:22:55,045
Hello.

318
00:22:55,045 --> 00:22:56,215
How may I help you?

320
00:22:58,115 --> 00:22:59,885
It's been a long time since I bought them.

321
00:23:01,585 --> 00:23:03,105
I'll have this one.

326
00:23:20,305 --> 00:23:22,235
Please look after his soul.

327
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,605
Please give him courage.

328
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:28,875
I haven't experienced what you've been through.

329
00:23:30,245 --> 00:23:32,845
So I don't know...

330
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,105
what shape of sadness you're in...

331
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:33,875
how great an agony it is...

332
00:24:52,355 --> 00:24:54,035
what kind of pain it is.

Would you

344
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:04,995
forgive me a little?

345
00:27:11,795 --> 00:27:13,265
Thank you.

00:30:41,245 --> 00:30:42,375
Hello!

377
00:30:43,445 --> 00:30:44,915
Hello.

378
00:30:45,215 --> 00:30:46,845
What brings you here?

379
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,385
It's been a long time.

380
00:30:48,385 --> 00:30:49,855
Yes.

381
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:51,755
Go on ahead.

382
00:30:51,755 --> 00:30:52,985
Okay.

383
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:54,185
Goodbye.

384
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:59,255
What brings you here?

385
00:30:59,595 --> 00:31:01,565
Oh, Bu-jeong...

386
00:31:01,565 --> 00:31:03,835
My wife isn't picking up her phone.

387
00:31:03,835 --> 00:31:05,635
I told her I'll wait downstairs,

388
00:31:05,635 --> 00:31:07,465
but I don't know when she'll be out.

389
00:31:07,735 --> 00:31:11,375
I bought macarons so you could all share,

390
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:12,775
but you're all leaving.

391
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:16,445
I guess the meeting is taking very long.

392
00:31:20,515 --> 00:31:23,055
Well, I'll see you next time.

393
00:31:27,025 --> 00:31:28,155
Excuse me!

394
00:31:28,885 --> 00:31:30,125
The thing is...

395
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:30,925
Huh?

396
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:05,965
Missed calls Wife
Missed calls Wife

397
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:20,135
I'll wait in the car.

398
00:33:42,455 --> 00:33:45,124
I would've missed you if I were a little late.

399
00:33:47,894 --> 00:33:49,624
We would've missed each other.

400
00:33:52,035 --> 00:33:53,035
Yeah.

401
00:33:54,635 --> 00:33:56,834
You didn't finish work that late.

402
00:33:57,975 --> 00:34:00,044
I wrapped it up.

403
00:34:01,144 --> 00:34:03,515
We weren't getting anywhere so I got frustrated.

404
00:34:03,915 --> 00:34:04,915
Right.

405
00:34:06,385 --> 00:34:09,144
Did you have dinner?

406
00:34:10,584 --> 00:34:11,584
Yes.

407
00:34:12,285 --> 00:34:13,785
Oh, you did?

408
00:34:14,624 --> 00:34:16,155
Just a simple meal.

409
00:34:18,555 --> 00:34:20,195
You look tired.

410
00:34:25,195 --> 00:34:26,635
Why did you come?

411
00:34:29,705 --> 00:34:31,065
Why do you think?

412
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:34,405
To give you macarons.

413
00:34:35,045 --> 00:34:37,745
They were on sale, so I had to get some.

414
00:34:40,415 --> 00:34:41,945
That's it?

415
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:44,785
Of course that's it.

416
00:34:54,825 --> 00:34:56,835
Do you know what day it is today?

417
00:35:05,935 --> 00:35:07,045
Yes.

418
00:35:12,045 --> 00:35:13,915
The baby was mine, too, you know.

419
00:35:38,105 --> 00:35:40,605
I wonder if Father had dinner yet.

420
00:35:41,675 --> 00:35:43,915
I haven't had dinner yet.

421
00:35:44,615 --> 00:35:48,085
I bought him a pair of shoes while buying Mom's.

422
00:35:49,345 --> 00:35:51,955
Every spring,

423
00:35:52,555 --> 00:35:54,925
I bought him a pair of shoes.

424
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:57,795
Last year,

425
00:35:58,855 --> 00:36:01,165
I couldn't because a lot was going on.

426
00:36:02,765 --> 00:36:05,265
Call him. He'll like it.

427
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:08,705
Dad is pleased to hear from you

428
00:36:09,505 --> 00:36:11,535
rather than me.

429
00:36:15,245 --> 00:36:16,675
Mom, too.

430
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:23,085
Mom is pleased to hear from you rather than me.

431
00:36:50,345 --> 00:36:52,275
Just
Min-jeong's Live Broadcast "Living at an Internet Café for a Week"

432
00:36:52,415 --> 00:36:54,815
Do you know where I am?

433
00:36:55,085 --> 00:36:57,385
A lot of people are commenting.

434
00:36:57,385 --> 00:37:00,225
You're right. I'm at an internet café.

435
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:02,385
Just like I told you in my last episode,

436
00:37:02,385 --> 00:37:05,055
I'm going to live here for a week.

437
00:37:06,565 --> 00:37:10,195
Living at an internet café for a week.

438
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:14,565
Nowadays, internet cafés have really improved.

439
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:18,005
The chairs are huge and comfortable.

440
00:37:18,005 --> 00:37:21,305
I think I can lie down and sleep here.

441
00:37:22,245 --> 00:37:25,845
I heard the food here is good, too.

442
00:37:25,845 --> 00:37:28,085
I look forward to trying it.

443
00:37:28,685 --> 00:37:29,725
Okay, then...

444
00:37:37,395 --> 00:37:38,925
Looks delicious.

445
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:41,125
Wow, you guys.

446
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,525
See the steam?

447
00:37:41,725 --> 00:37:44,335
Looks hot?????
I can finish it in two bites

448
00:37:43,735 --> 00:37:47,235
Wow, the smell is amazing.

449
00:37:44,335 --> 00:37:44,935
I'm getting dizzy

450
00:37:59,145 --> 00:38:02,145
Soon-gyu

451
00:38:07,055 --> 00:38:09,555
I make black-bean-sauce noodles often at home.

452
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:11,855
But it tastes a lot better

453
00:38:11,495 --> 00:38:12,395
Another eating show... I'm going to watch Dalnim
She's not eating with gusto.

454
00:38:12,395 --> 00:38:13,395
People are leaving.
I might be the only one watching.

455
00:38:12,495 --> 00:38:13,865
than what I make.

456
00:38:13,865 --> 00:38:17,235
But not better than my mom's...

457
00:38:19,095 --> 00:38:21,765
Why can't I ever get through to him?

458
00:38:22,465 --> 00:38:24,135
Did his phone break or something?

459
00:38:32,245 --> 00:38:34,015
I don't want to go in by myself...

460
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,385
Woo-nam

461
00:38:51,135 --> 00:38:52,995
What others cook for you always tastes better

462
00:38:52,995 --> 00:38:55,665
than what you make yourself.

463
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:59,235
Min-jeong's Live Broadcast "Living at an Internet Café for a Week"

464
00:39:02,155 --> 00:39:03,175
Huh?

465
00:39:07,335 --> 00:39:10,455
KRW 1,000 has been sponsored.
KRW 2,000 has been sponsored.

466
00:39:07,415 --> 00:39:08,415
No way.

467
00:39:18,325 --> 00:39:20,605
Thank you so much.

468
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:22,765
Oh, my. Thank you!

469
00:39:29,135 --> 00:39:30,335
You don't know.

470
00:39:32,075 --> 00:39:34,445
You don't know what a scary world it is

471
00:39:34,445 --> 00:39:36,875
for a child to live without his parents.

472
00:39:38,745 --> 00:39:39,975
Kim Yoon-sun.

473
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:42,415
What's with you?

474
00:39:42,845 --> 00:39:46,515
Can't you see how scary it is?

475
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:48,185
Soon-gyu

476
00:39:48,325 --> 00:39:51,495
So you will never beat me.

477
00:39:53,295 --> 00:39:55,125
Can I be honest?

478
00:39:53,595 --> 00:39:55,395
Soon-gyu

479
00:40:00,135 --> 00:40:04,075
Your call cannot be connected...

480
00:40:04,075 --> 00:40:07,575
You ever cried after sending your kid away?

481
00:40:09,945 --> 00:40:12,845
Woo-nam
I will get back to you soon.

482
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:16,645
Soon when?

483
00:40:48,415 --> 00:40:50,415
It's been a long time since we went together.

484
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:54,785
It's been over a year.

485
00:40:55,355 --> 00:40:57,025
Really?

486
00:40:57,595 --> 00:40:59,195
It's been that long?

487
00:40:59,895 --> 00:41:01,575
It's your fault.

488
00:41:02,825 --> 00:41:03,825
Me?

489
00:41:04,165 --> 00:41:07,035
I didn't come with you after your affair.

490
00:41:07,035 --> 00:41:08,315
I was mortified.

491
00:41:12,035 --> 00:41:13,035
How

492
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:15,945
can you say that?

493
00:41:15,945 --> 00:41:17,545
That's uncalled for.

494
00:41:22,185 --> 00:41:25,055
I'm calling it as it is. What's wrong with that?

495
00:41:55,345 --> 00:41:56,345
Take it.

496
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:57,715
Okay.

497
00:41:59,655 --> 00:42:00,685
Oh.

498
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,985
She's calling me back.

499
00:42:02,985 --> 00:42:03,985
It's Mom.

500
00:42:04,995 --> 00:42:06,455
I didn't ask.

501
00:42:06,455 --> 00:42:08,665
I'm just telling you.

502
00:42:08,665 --> 00:42:10,965
Should I go in first?

503
00:42:10,965 --> 00:42:12,035
Yes.

504
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:19,035
Dad, I'm here.

505
00:42:19,035 --> 00:42:20,005
Hi. What about Jeong-su?

506
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:21,805
He'll be in after taking a call outside.

507
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,075
Father, I'm here.

508
00:42:23,075 --> 00:42:24,245
I'll go inside after I finish this call.

509
00:42:24,245 --> 00:42:26,245
Oh, no, it's okay. Take your time.

510
00:42:26,245 --> 00:42:27,285
Go on inside, Father.

511
00:42:27,285 --> 00:42:29,245
It's cold.

512
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:33,215
Hello?

513
00:42:33,415 --> 00:42:34,455
Hi, Mom.

514
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:37,735
I'll ask you something real quick and hang up.

515
00:42:38,825 --> 00:42:40,395
Umm...

516
00:42:41,065 --> 00:42:42,165
Mom?

517
00:42:42,965 --> 00:42:43,995
What's wrong?

518
00:42:44,665 --> 00:42:45,665
Mom!

519
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,435
Stop calling me.

520
00:42:50,105 --> 00:42:51,675
I'm not dead.

521
00:42:52,175 --> 00:42:53,705
I'm working out.

522
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:55,605
So?

523
00:42:55,605 --> 00:42:59,215
What did you want to ask that you called first?

524
00:42:59,215 --> 00:43:00,815
Did you call

525
00:43:00,815 --> 00:43:03,115
Bu-jeong's workplace recently?

526
00:43:07,225 --> 00:43:08,455
I don't know.

527
00:43:09,485 --> 00:43:10,955
Did I

528
00:43:12,455 --> 00:43:14,225
call her workplace?

529
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:17,895
Why do you ask?

530
00:43:18,435 --> 00:43:20,635
Seeing you talk slowly,

531
00:43:20,635 --> 00:43:22,035
I guess it really was you.

532
00:43:22,035 --> 00:43:25,205
What are you talking about?

533
00:43:25,205 --> 00:43:28,145
I went to Bu-jeong's workplace today.

534
00:43:28,745 --> 00:43:30,815
Her coworker told me

535
00:43:30,815 --> 00:43:33,015
that an elderly lady called

536
00:43:34,215 --> 00:43:36,045
and asked a bunch of questions.

537
00:43:36,385 --> 00:43:38,155
Why did you go to there?

538
00:43:40,255 --> 00:43:42,025
I just went.

539
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,525
You called because of that?

540
00:43:46,995 --> 00:43:47,995
Yes.

541
00:43:52,435 --> 00:43:54,305
Did you talk to Bu-jeong?

542
00:43:54,935 --> 00:43:57,375
No, not yet.

543
00:43:59,105 --> 00:44:00,375
Mom?

544
00:44:01,645 --> 00:44:03,045
Speak.

545
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:08,245
You know Father? My father-in-law?

546
00:44:08,885 --> 00:44:12,555
What about him?

547
00:44:14,325 --> 00:44:18,725
Don't ever tell him.

548
00:44:22,725 --> 00:44:23,965
Okay?

549
00:44:56,865 --> 00:44:58,565
To Father,

550
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,835
Bu-jeong is his whole world.

551
00:45:30,015 --> 00:45:35,815
Deposit KRW 300,000
Jeong Mi-sun

552
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:35,835
I always have no money.

553
00:45:41,045 --> 00:45:43,745
Just like how I'm your whole world.

554
00:45:55,155 --> 00:45:56,155
Hello?

555
00:45:58,455 --> 00:45:59,455
Yeah?

556
00:46:01,865 --> 00:46:03,125
Are you crying?

557
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:06,395
No, I'm not crying.

558
00:46:08,905 --> 00:46:10,165
Mom, you didn't

559
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:13,175
already tell him, did you?

560
00:46:13,975 --> 00:46:15,655
I didn't, you bastard.

561
00:46:16,075 --> 00:46:18,845
Good. You did well, Mom.

562
00:46:19,245 --> 00:46:20,675
Alright then.

563
00:46:20,675 --> 00:46:21,795
Get some rest.

564
00:46:31,225 --> 00:46:32,925
What's got him acting this way?

565
00:46:33,555 --> 00:46:36,155
Why is he being so sweet and making me feel bad?

566
00:46:39,095 --> 00:46:40,565
Bastard.

567
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,815
Oh, you're home.

568
00:49:10,485 --> 00:49:12,685
I went by the pharmacy.

569
00:49:15,755 --> 00:49:17,795
I was worried because you weren't there.

570
00:49:22,695 --> 00:49:24,065
Is this yours?

571
00:49:26,895 --> 00:49:28,365
Does it belong to you two?

572
00:49:30,165 --> 00:49:32,075
Oh, I'm sorry.

573
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:33,375
Earlier...

574
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:37,105
We were cleaning up and broke it.

575
00:49:39,415 --> 00:49:40,645
I'm sorry.

576
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,145
Is this your house?

577
00:49:44,585 --> 00:49:46,185
Is this house yours?

578
00:49:49,485 --> 00:49:51,955
You clean up and throw this away

579
00:49:55,825 --> 00:49:57,635
as if all of this belongs to you.

580
00:50:03,035 --> 00:50:05,035
It was wrong of me to do that.

581
00:50:09,245 --> 00:50:10,975
What am I to you two?

582
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:18,785
You include me and exclude me as you wish.

583
00:50:23,055 --> 00:50:24,755
Am I yours?

584
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:33,265
I'm not yours.

585
00:50:35,405 --> 00:50:37,635
I may like you.

586
00:50:39,575 --> 00:50:42,105
And you might have no interest in me.

587
00:50:46,015 --> 00:50:47,785
But I'm mine.

588
00:51:52,315 --> 00:51:53,215
We'll be going now.

589
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:55,285
- Okay.
- Yes, yes.

590
00:51:57,015 --> 00:51:57,885
Stay inside.

591
00:51:57,885 --> 00:51:59,155
Go back inside.

592
00:51:59,155 --> 00:52:00,755
Go on ahead.

593
00:52:00,755 --> 00:52:01,885
You'll catch a cold.

594
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:03,285
Go ahead.

595
00:52:03,885 --> 00:52:07,255
I'll see you to the elevator, then go inside.

596
00:52:07,255 --> 00:52:08,895
I can't go inside before then.

597
00:52:13,895 --> 00:52:15,135
We can take the elevator now.

598
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:17,405
- Go inside.
- I'll see you go down.

599
00:52:21,745 --> 00:52:24,275
Young man in the last unit down the hall, right?

600
00:52:26,675 --> 00:52:27,685
Yes.

601
00:52:28,015 --> 00:52:30,215
Oh, I was right.

602
00:52:30,545 --> 00:52:31,825
Are you...

603
00:52:33,085 --> 00:52:34,455
Are you going somewhere?

604
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:36,655
I'm going home.

605
00:52:36,985 --> 00:52:38,825
Your home is there.

606
00:52:39,095 --> 00:52:40,625
You have another home?

607
00:52:40,895 --> 00:52:42,595
No, my mom's...

608
00:52:42,595 --> 00:52:43,795
My parents' house.

609
00:52:43,795 --> 00:52:47,095
Oh, you have parents.

610
00:52:47,095 --> 00:52:50,065
Dad! He might misunderstand you.

611
00:52:50,065 --> 00:52:50,935
Why?

612
00:52:50,935 --> 00:52:53,175
It was a compliment.

613
00:52:54,305 --> 00:52:56,745
I meant it in a good way. Don't get me wrong.

614
00:52:56,745 --> 00:52:57,745
Okay.

615
00:52:58,245 --> 00:52:59,975
We'll be going now, Father.

616
00:52:59,975 --> 00:53:00,815
We'll go safely.

617
00:53:00,815 --> 00:53:02,585
Okay, well.

618
00:53:02,585 --> 00:53:04,085
- Drive safely.
- Okay.

619
00:53:04,085 --> 00:53:06,415
I'll be careful with my new shoes.

620
00:53:06,415 --> 00:53:08,255
Don't be careful. Wear them however you like.

621
00:53:08,255 --> 00:53:09,855
I'll buy you another pair.

622
00:53:09,855 --> 00:53:11,325
Okay. Thanks.

623
00:53:13,055 --> 00:53:14,225
Okay then.

624
00:53:14,695 --> 00:53:15,495
Go inside, Father.

625
00:53:15,495 --> 00:53:16,495
Okay.

626
00:53:16,725 --> 00:53:17,695
Get in.

627
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,865
- Bye, Dad.
- Okay.

628
00:53:19,865 --> 00:53:21,335
- Good night, Father.
- Good night.

629
00:53:21,335 --> 00:53:22,705
Go on.

630
00:53:42,785 --> 00:53:45,425
What can I say?

631
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:53,535
What words do you need?

632
00:53:59,505 --> 00:54:01,905
I wonder if Father is okay.

633
00:54:02,445 --> 00:54:03,575
About what?

634
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:06,145
It's just...

635
00:54:07,175 --> 00:54:09,615
He seems different.

636
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,585
Let's talk at home.

637
00:54:19,725 --> 00:54:20,725
Okay.

638
00:54:23,095 --> 00:54:25,295
Akira Manager Seo Jong-hoon

639
00:54:27,295 --> 00:54:29,965
The hell you'll still be experiencing...

640
00:54:41,415 --> 00:54:43,085
I also don't know anything about that

641
00:54:46,115 --> 00:54:48,385
nor can I be of any help.

642
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:50,355
I think I've seen him before.

643
00:54:56,825 --> 00:54:59,065
The man who just left.

644
00:55:00,295 --> 00:55:02,035
You must've seen him here.

645
00:55:03,235 --> 00:55:05,905
Since he lives in the last unit down the hall.

646
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:09,875
I guess.

647
00:55:10,575 --> 00:55:14,645
I don't know how I can forgive you.

648
00:55:25,925 --> 00:55:27,255
Oh, right.

649
00:55:33,035 --> 00:55:37,135
I left my employee card in the shoe bag.

650
00:55:37,135 --> 00:55:38,735
The bag you gave Dad?

651
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:39,735
Yes.

652
00:55:41,035 --> 00:55:42,925
Then should we go back?

653
00:55:46,075 --> 00:55:47,645
I'll come back another time.

654
00:55:48,815 --> 00:55:51,285
If it's important, we can go back up.

655
00:55:52,955 --> 00:55:55,025
It's not that important but...

656
00:55:57,325 --> 00:55:59,325
He won't throw it away, right?

657
00:55:59,695 --> 00:56:02,665
He won't, but I'll give him a call.

658
00:56:04,025 --> 00:56:05,565
It's okay. Let's just go.

659
00:56:30,955 --> 00:56:33,155
Does sadness have a shape?

660
00:56:35,065 --> 00:56:36,745
Why isn't he picking up?

661
00:56:38,435 --> 00:56:39,795
He's not picking up?

662
00:56:39,795 --> 00:56:40,995
No.

663
00:56:42,505 --> 00:56:44,675
Does agony have a size?

664
00:56:45,175 --> 00:56:47,575
Stop the car when you get to the entrance.

665
00:56:47,575 --> 00:56:48,605
Okay.

666
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,115
Want me to come with you?

667
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:00,985
No. Stay here, just in case.

668
00:57:00,985 --> 00:57:02,505
I'll be right back.

669
00:57:02,625 --> 00:57:04,085
I'll be here.

670
00:57:14,665 --> 00:57:19,235
It's hardly possible that pain can be defined.

671
00:57:28,185 --> 00:57:29,785
No matter how small,

672
00:57:42,555 --> 00:57:44,695
nothing hurts more than one's own pain.

673
00:58:03,115 --> 00:58:05,515
Nothing is more difficult than one's own.

674
00:58:06,455 --> 00:58:07,455
Dad.

675
00:58:15,275 --> 00:58:16,315
What's wrong?

676
00:58:16,665 --> 00:58:18,605
Did you forget your code?

677
00:58:31,315 --> 00:58:33,185
If it gets locked like this,

678
00:58:35,015 --> 00:58:37,185
it works a whole lot later.

679
00:58:39,185 --> 00:58:41,645
I have to wait more than ten minutes.

680
00:58:43,505 --> 00:58:47,565
Still, you shouldn't sit here. It's cold.

681
00:58:48,105 --> 00:58:49,355
It's not cold.

682
00:58:50,155 --> 00:58:51,905
It's spring now.

683
00:58:56,725 --> 00:59:00,465
Nothing is more precious than one's own.

684
00:59:11,485 --> 00:59:12,685
What about now?

685
00:59:13,525 --> 00:59:14,875
Do you remember it?

686
00:59:18,135 --> 00:59:19,135
I put it

687
00:59:20,885 --> 00:59:23,085
in my vest and jacket.

688
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:27,565
But they're all in the house.

689
00:59:29,715 --> 00:59:32,385
You wrote it on a paper and put it in your pockets?

690
00:59:34,035 --> 00:59:36,155
And also in my shoes.

691
00:59:37,525 --> 00:59:39,855
But I'm wearing slippers right now.

692
00:59:40,265 --> 00:59:42,135
You're a pro.

693
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:47,075
What about Jeong-su?

694
00:59:47,425 --> 00:59:48,425
Not again.

695
00:59:49,315 --> 00:59:51,065
He left.

696
00:59:52,515 --> 00:59:55,715
I told him to go. I'm going to sleep here tonight.

697
00:59:57,135 --> 01:00:00,035
He can't have his wifey sleep out all the time.

698
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:03,285
Wifey? That's cheesy.

699
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:05,615
A wifey is a wife.

700
01:00:05,695 --> 01:00:09,165
Go on home. I'll sleep here tonight.
Dad's okay.

701
01:00:14,965 --> 01:00:16,565
Is it your birthday?

702
01:00:19,815 --> 01:00:20,855
The code.

703
01:00:21,685 --> 01:00:22,745
No.

704
01:00:23,855 --> 01:00:26,465
You said it can't be my birthday, so I changed it.

705
01:00:26,675 --> 01:00:27,675
Right.

706
01:00:29,175 --> 01:00:31,525
Then you'll think of it in no time.

707
01:00:33,685 --> 01:00:36,415
We have a lot of time, so think carefully

708
01:00:36,565 --> 01:00:38,245
what the code is.

709
01:00:41,185 --> 01:00:42,585
Let's see.

710
01:00:52,995 --> 01:00:54,375
You remember?

711
01:00:56,665 --> 01:00:58,185
It's your birthday.

712
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:00,615
You're a genius.

713
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:07,705
Come on. Let's sit here and talk some more.

714
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:10,005
It's not good to sit there. It's cold.

715
01:01:11,215 --> 01:01:12,765
You said it's spring.

716
01:01:30,735 --> 01:01:32,095
Was today

717
01:01:33,725 --> 01:01:37,225
another day full of deathly agony?

718
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:45,655
I spent a day as long as death today.

719
01:02:15,885 --> 01:02:16,885
Oh, hey.

720
01:02:17,005 --> 01:02:19,575
What are you doing? People will complain.

721
01:02:19,665 --> 01:02:21,745
We have to clean because you're coming.

722
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:23,295
Honey, your son is here.

723
01:02:23,775 --> 01:02:24,815
- Already?
- Yeah.

724
01:02:27,675 --> 01:02:29,525
You said you'll come and you did.

725
01:02:30,155 --> 01:02:31,925
Of course I did. Would I not?

726
01:02:32,155 --> 01:02:33,275
You might not.

727
01:02:33,915 --> 01:02:35,455
I didn't get my hopes up.

728
01:02:36,265 --> 01:02:37,245
But you came.

729
01:02:40,225 --> 01:02:41,675
Why are you squatting there?

730
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:42,555
Come in.

731
01:02:42,555 --> 01:02:43,875
Did you cook something?

732
01:02:45,165 --> 01:02:46,825
He has a keen sense of smell.

733
01:02:46,825 --> 01:02:48,455
He takes after you.

734
01:02:48,935 --> 01:02:50,745
I can't believe you cooked.

735
01:02:51,555 --> 01:02:52,635
What did you cook?

736
01:02:53,055 --> 01:02:55,195
If it's something good, I'll go inside.

737
01:02:56,125 --> 01:02:58,295
If it's not, then I'll leave.

738
01:03:00,085 --> 01:03:02,985
It's just rice.

739
01:03:05,315 --> 01:03:06,315
Rice.

740
01:03:07,895 --> 01:03:08,895
And?

741
01:03:10,835 --> 01:03:11,835
Soup.

742
01:03:13,505 --> 01:03:14,505
And?

743
01:03:19,805 --> 01:03:20,705
Kim...

744
01:03:21,435 --> 01:03:22,695
Kimchi.

745
01:03:35,245 --> 01:03:36,405
Sausage.

746
01:03:45,695 --> 01:03:47,155
It was short notice.

747
01:03:48,385 --> 01:03:49,465
We don't

748
01:03:50,325 --> 01:03:51,805
have anything else.

749
01:03:56,695 --> 01:03:58,005
What's wrong?

750
01:03:59,855 --> 01:04:01,055
Is it not good?

751
01:04:14,055 --> 01:04:15,655
Is he leaving?

752
01:04:16,985 --> 01:04:19,515
He's gone to buy coffee-flavored milk.

753
01:04:19,525 --> 01:04:20,805
How do you know?

754
01:04:24,645 --> 01:04:26,505
Because he's my son.

755
01:04:35,675 --> 01:04:37,945
It was a day when nothing happened

756
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:43,565
and it felt like tomorrow would not come.

757
01:04:51,405 --> 01:04:53,865
In a dark room where no one came,

758
01:05:02,685 --> 01:05:05,695
I faced the fact that nothing was mine,

759
01:05:07,525 --> 01:05:08,805
and I became lonely.

760
01:05:21,575 --> 01:05:24,475
I don't know if it's right to say this but...

761
01:05:27,365 --> 01:05:28,365
I'm sorry.

762
01:06:30,465 --> 01:06:33,555
Lost

763
01:06:34,435 --> 01:06:37,515
The woman you asked about in the car.

764
01:06:37,515 --> 01:06:38,515
Is it her?

765
01:06:38,545 --> 01:06:40,345
Why? Do you have something?

766
01:06:41,585 --> 01:06:44,085
Who is it? You put a tail on me?

767
01:06:45,695 --> 01:06:48,165
Shutting this down at this point

768
01:06:48,165 --> 01:06:49,925
is good for all of us, isn't it?

769
01:06:49,925 --> 01:06:51,035
Let me go.

770
01:06:51,035 --> 01:06:53,215
It's not a crime to be at the reservoir at night.

771
01:06:53,215 --> 01:06:54,825
I'm not a minor.

772
01:06:54,975 --> 01:06:57,185
Since you're here, run some tables.

773
01:06:57,295 --> 01:06:59,195
I'll give you double the basic wage.

774
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:02,605
We need someone who can safely take you home.

775
01:07:02,865 --> 01:07:04,265
There's really no one?

776
01:07:04,705 --> 01:07:06,635
So what do you want?

777
01:07:07,575 --> 01:07:09,295
Don't see her from now on.
