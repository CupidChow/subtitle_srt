You're asking that now?

You know what instant noodles he eats.

99
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,560

the first time a few days ago.

00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,770

I didn't know you were bothered by that.

103
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,610
I didn't give him a lot
because I don't like him.

104
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,210
I cut off a tiny piece at the corner.

105
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,570
Why give him a tiny piece?

106
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,910

108
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,360

not a total stranger.

109
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,310
Why are you so selfish?

110
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,550
What do you mean?

111
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,840
He seemed happy to
receive a piece of cake.

112
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,790
I don't care. My child comes first.

113
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,430
I wondered who I took
after in being so mean.

114
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,480
I'm mean because I take after you.

115
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,400
I'm passable.

116
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,470
You're passable, too.

117
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,430
Huh?

118
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,100
I thought you'd say,

119
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,900
"I'm mean, but you're not."

120
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,110

122
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,980
Yeah. I got that vibe.

123
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,520
So when you run into him,

124
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,780
act confidently.

125
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,720
What do you mean?

126
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,760
You don't have to feel intimidated.

127
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,030
If he ignores me again,

128
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,960
what will you give him then?

129
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960

I was startled.

144
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,900
The TV was on when there's no one here.

145
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,330
No one's there?

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,200

147
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,480
Hasn't Writer Lee gotten off work yet?

148
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,440
Her daughter-in-law is a writer.

149
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,910
Writer Lee? That's gross.

150
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,250
Where are you? Outside?

151
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,350
Yes. I'm at Julie's.

152
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,190
I ran out of cotton pads
<i>and came to get some.</i>

153
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,790
<i>Coincidentally, Jeong Ah-ran</i> was on TV.

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,500

157
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,780
This is salty.

158
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,650
Why is it so salty?

159
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,950
It's salty because
you're eating it for free.

160
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,920
While we're on the subject...

161
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,160
Don't come here without calling first.

00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,760

177
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,930

178
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,940
<i>that he bought it with his own money.</i>

179
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,170
<i>When you didn't even ask him that?</i>

180
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,140
<i>That's right.</i>

181
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,710
<i>I just asked him what it was,</i>

182
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,280
<i>not whose money he bought it with.</i>

183
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,740
<i>- You're right.
- Weird, right?</i>

184
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,580
<i>I bought it with my own money.</i>

185
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,180
<i>Also, we're a married couple.</i>

186
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,320
<i>There's no such thing
as splitting ownership.</i>

187
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,720
<i>Do you agree, Ms. Jeong?</i>

188
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,750
<i>Am I getting attacked?</i>

189
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,920
<i>I said that in case she was curious.</i>

190
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,520
<i>There's no splitting
ownership with couples.</i>

191
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:22,670
<i>Huh?</i>

192
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,380
<i>But Jin-seop is very careful
about what's his.</i>

193
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,900
When did you get in?

194
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,270
Just now.

195
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,770
<i>The two of you are so cute...</i>

196
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,840
Why did you turn it off?

197
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,540
I was watching it. It's fun.

198
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,380
You weren't watching it,
but now you say it's fun.

199
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,250
What are you talking about?

200
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,210
I had to go to the toilet
but I was watching it.

201
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,620
Turn it on.

202
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,750
Huh?

203
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,400
How can a writer be so violent?

204
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,140
She talked about other stuff until now.

205
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,340
She's now talking about her book.

206
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,080
Come and watch with me.

207
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,880
<i>I realized that what I write
can have a small</i>

208
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,390
<i>but good influence.</i>

209
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,150
<i>I read both books.</i>

210
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,890
Why don't you give me the book?

211
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,790
You don't read. Why ask for it?

212
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,860
I don't read, but I see it all.

213
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,770
<i>For instance, about animals...</i>

214
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,670
Watch something else or turn it off.

215
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,870
My head aches. It's loud.

216
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,810
Other channels are loud as well.

217
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,110
Huh?

218
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,690
What is it?

219
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,790
You were so close to her.

220
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,100
Did you two fight?

221
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,590
Have some of this.

222
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,430
I left some for you.

223
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,500
You went to Father's house?

224
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,770
For a bit.

225
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,960
What's this?

226
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,000
What bakery is this from?

227
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,430
You got to hand it to her...

228
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,910
You didn't eat?

229
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,180
No.

230
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,450
If you're not eating it,
put it in the fridge.

231
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,190
The fridge is full.

232
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,460
I brought kimchi from Mom's house.

233
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,030
How can you buy
that kind of cake for Father?

234
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,430
There are a lot of
high quality cakes nowadays.

235
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,870
Your husband works at
the Food Hall of a mall.

236
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,840
Didn't you buy that at
a convenience store?

237
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,510
You didn't?

238
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,820
Is that why you're not eating it?

239
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,250
You know I'm picky about these things.

240
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,160
That's all a huge chunk of shortening.

241
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,490
Father has high blood
pressure and illness.

242
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,330
That's bad for the brain and memory.

243
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,130
You didn't have dinner?

244
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,610
Huh?

245
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,890
I did.

246
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,490
Then why are you suddenly eating that?

247
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,530
You said you won't eat it.

248
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,670
Still, why eat that all of a sudden?

249
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,470
Do you know what cake this is?

250
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,310
A cake is a cake.

251
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,710
Why?

252
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,800
Did I do something wrong?

253
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,120
How

254
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,540
can you say that?

255
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,890
What if my dad had bought this for you?

256
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,630
What if he had bought this
with the money

257
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,860
he saved up collecting boxes
night and day?

258
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,730
How can you say that

259
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,270
not knowing what cake this is?

260
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:03,070
I naturally thought you bought it.

261
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,140
Then you should've told me sooner.

262
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,980
You always do this.
You don't say anything.

263
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,610
Then, you shame me.

264
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,530
I'm sorry.

265
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,100
I didn't know Father had bought it.

266
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Huh?

267
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,030
Stop eating that.

268
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,370
I'll eat it.

269
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,070
I'm sorry.

270
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,540
You don't have to be.

271
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,140
Dad didn't buy it,
so you don't have to be.

272
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,810
<i>Hello, ma'am.</i>

273
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,580

00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,760

284
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,930

00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,260
Yes?

363
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,170
Want to commit suicide together?

364
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,080
Huh?

365
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,740
No.

366
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,520
My goal

367
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,850
in life is to live a long

368
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,320
and mediocre life.

369
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,560
You're lucky you can be so honest.

370
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,880
Ms. Mi-sun.

371
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,790
Mom.

372
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,590
Mom.

373
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,740
Did you just get here?

374
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,740
Yes.

375
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,510
You're already asleep?

376
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,980
He leaves for work early.

377
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,720
You'll come in, right?

378
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,990
<i>(Cup Rice)
(Seaweed Soup Rice)</i>

379
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,930
You should've told me not to come.

380
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,240
You invited me,
but there's nothing to eat.

381
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,160
I was going to order takeout

382
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,380
if you came during the day.

383
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,110
I didn't know you'd come at night.

384
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,990
What's that?

385
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,720
How long has it been in there?

386
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,390
Only a week.

387
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,460
Are you sure?

388
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,800
See? It's fine.

389
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,300
He goes to bed early.

390
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,560
A caregiver is hard work.

391
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,330
He's busy learning something nowadays.

392
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,830
Learn what?

393
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,270
Acupressure or massage.

394
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,900
You said you were partying.

395
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,300
Did you come after it was over?

396
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,510
Yeah, you could say that.

397
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,980
Where did you party?

398
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,110
At home?

399
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,250
Who has a birthday party
at home these days?

400
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,950
Even grade school kids don't do that.

401
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,120
It was in Gangnam.

402
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,380
A club.

403
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,050
A new place.

404
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,460
Anyway.

405
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,390
Is it a place you dance?

406
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,960
You dance if you want,

407
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,060
and drink if you want.

408
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,000
Was Just with you?

409
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,770
Just?

410
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:49,770
Yeah.

411
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,570
You know,

412
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,210
Just...

413
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,310
I like him.

414
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,240
He's good-hearted

415
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,980
and sweet.

416
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,620
Oh, Just

417
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,120
doesn't know my real birthday.

418
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,060
He thinks we have the same birthday.

419
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,100
- Why?
- Long ago,

420
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,930
in grade school when we became friends,

421
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,570
I was invited to his birthday party.

422
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,230
But I wasn't able to buy a gift.

423
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,940
I couldn't or didn't.

424
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,620
I don't remember. Anyway.

425
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,210
So I told him

426
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,180
that we have the same birthday

427
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,780
so we'll call it even.

428
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,250
So,

429
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,580
from then on,

430
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,990
that day became my birthday to Just.

431
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,220
Then do you still

432
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,020
not exchange gifts even now?

433
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,020
Yes.

434
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,110
When is Just's birthday?

435
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,960
July.

436
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,840
There's no chance you'll meet him,

437
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,410
but if you do, don't ever tell him this.

438
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,040
He's really

439
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,410
like a glass bead.

440
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,150
Yeah, like a glass bead.

441
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,180
He'll be traumatized.

442
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,250
Then you stopped by your place.

443
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,520
My place?

444
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,490
Why?

445
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,130
No reason.

446
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,570
I was just asking.

447
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,910
Why ask while doing something

448
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,610
you normally don't do?

449
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,540
No reason.

450
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,520
Because I felt happy.

451
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,410
I was reminded of the old days.

452
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,520
I mean

453
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,560
why were you reminded of the old days?

454
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,230
When you stepped inside,

455
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,130
I could smell it.

456
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,440
When we used to live together,

457
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,340
I really liked it.

458
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:06,010
The smell of soap after you washed.

459
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,910
It was like that since you were a kid.

460
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,580
Your dad, you and I

461
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:16,250
would all use the same soap.

462
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,960
But strangely the smell
only came from you.

463
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,580
That fresh smell.

464
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,110
You look like you're regretting

465
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,460
asking me that.

466
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,080
Do you not like talking
about these things

467
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,620
with me?

468
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,120
No. It's creepy.

469
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,980
Who bought you the cake?

470
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,010
Your girlfriend?

471
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,850
Just a neighborhood friend.

472
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,420
So

473
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,190
is that neighborhood friend

474
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,990
a girl or a boy?

475
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,030
Just a person.

476
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,480
<i>Are you asleep?</i>

477
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,050
Don't sleep there. Sleep in our room.

478
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,690
I'll sleep in the living room.

Oh, my. What's with your face?

00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,490
Why?

504
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,380
Am I too sexy for
another person's wedding?

505
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,910
Sexy?

506
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,110
I haven't been to
a wedding in a long time.

507
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,050
What do you think?

508
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,220
With makeup...

509
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,220
Yeah?

510
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,990
You look like my aunt.

511
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:44,890
Jeez.

512
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,730
Hey.

513
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:49,730
Why are you going to this wedding?

514
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,600
It's Sunday. Get some sleep.

515
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,800
This is my neighborhood now.

516
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,970
I probably meet your landlady
more often than you.

517
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,140
I was the one who got the invitation.

518
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,620
Giving it to you is the same
as giving it to me.

519
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,780
All the elders in our neighborhood think

520
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,580
you and I sleep together.

521
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,780
If they knew we weren't

522
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,790
sleeping with each other at all...

523
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,520
Why close the door?

524
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,590
You're scaring me.

525
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,890
What if Soon-ju hears?

526
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,560
You're crazy.

527
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,430
He's old enough.

528
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,530
Why make a fuss?

529
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:22,010
He's probably bonking
more than us right now.

530
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:22,790
Be quiet.

531
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,450
Stop it, seriously.

532
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,300
How dare you
compare yourself to Soon-ju?

533
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,840
Why? How are we different?

534
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,470
You're completely different.

535
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:35,380
But the main difference
is the size of your souls.

536
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,810
Size?

537
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,010
You better watch your words.

538
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,980
What you just said was

539
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,720
sexual harassment.

540
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,990
You're so dumb, we can't talk

541
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,120
let alone fight.

542
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,160
Move.

543
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,100
Hey, be careful.

544
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,200
About what?

545
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,600
I am

546
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,300
traumatized by the word "dumb."

547
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,940
Oh, and your Just, I mean

548
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,940
your Soon-ju whose "size"
is different from mine

549
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,450
has already left.

550
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:12,410
When?

551
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,650
When did he leave?

552
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,800
When you were showering.

553
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,190
He took his book bag and left.

554
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,860
See?

555
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,990
He's different.

556
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,200
He only goes to school,
the library and home.

557
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,260
Jeez.

558
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,370
Go away.

559
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,290
What's with you?

560
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:53,650
Don't make a fuss and be still.

561
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,460
It's my first time riding this.

562
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,660
Who did I call this expensive cab for?

563
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:08,340
We're like celebrities right now.

564
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,070
Right?

565
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,070
Huh?

566
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,710
Right.

567
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:17,910
Why?

568
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,350
Don't the idol singers
you do business with

569
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,780
let you ride in their cars?

570
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,190
Five or six of them ride in one car.

571
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,870
There's no room for me.

572
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,630
Let's take a picture.

573
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,660
It's been a long time
since we dressed up.

574
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,000
Look over here.

575
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,230
No. Put that away.

576
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:38,630
Hmph.

577
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,870
Can't I take a picture?

578
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,210
Oh, it's okay with me.

579
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:48,710
One, two, three.

580
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,380
Be prudent.

581
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,590
If you keep indulging her,

582
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,720
you might unknowingly
become a married man

583
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,410
on the internet one day.

584
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,160
Why? Does that bother you?

585
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,260
No.

586
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:11,270
By the way,

587
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,800
are we appearing

588
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,040
on TV or something?

589
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,600
Like a walk-on?

590
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,270
I don't know. I didn't get this job.

591
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:20,310
Ask her.

592
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:22,110
I just came because I got paid.

593
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,150
We're going to eat at a buffet.

594
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,010
A buffet?

595
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,370
A wedding buffet.

596
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,020
Whose wedding is it?

597
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:34,860
I don't know.

598
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:37,090
All we have to do is
sit at the friends' table,

599
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,330
act friendly,

600
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,730
laugh and cry,

601
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:43,200
then eat at the buffet and leave.

602
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:47,900
You heard her.

603
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,880
Yeah?

604
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,510
I'm on my way to pick up Mom.

605
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,790
But you said you were free this morning.

606
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,450
Mom's going to go berserk.

607
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:09,390
I can't help it
that urgent business came up.

608
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:13,590
I'll get there as soon
as I take care of it.

609
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,760
<i>You won't be late, right?</i>

610
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,030
Should I go pick you up?

611
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,100
No.

612
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,640
<i>(Restriction Notice of
Non-residents Using Facilities)</i>

613
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,000
I can take a cab.

614
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,780
It's going to be a short talk.
Don't worry.

615
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,300
Mom's excited because

616
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,460
it's a family outing in a long time.

617
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,480
<i>I know.</i>

618
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,550
I'll be there soon.

619
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,390
<i>If you're late, Mom will pass out.</i>

620
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:43,260
If I'm late, I'm late.

621
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,890
It's because I'll be the one suffering.

622
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,300
Hello?

623
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,870
What a temper.

624
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:57,470
<i>Here's your order, ma'am.</i>

625
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,510
<i>(Thick Immune Red Ginseng Stick)</i>

626
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,540
Thank you.

627
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:24,170
It has to be here today.

628
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,870
I have to find it today!

629
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:26,530
I'm sorry.

630
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:28,600
How do you hire people?

631
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,100
I'm sorry, ma'am.

632
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,340
I put it right here.

633
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,110
Before that lady cleaned,

634
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,410
it was right here!

635
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:37,080
She said she'll be here in 5 minutes.

636
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,280
5 minutes? I have to go out.

637
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,280
Bae Da-som.

638
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,020
Shouldn't you call her
at a time like this?

639
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,450
Yes, ma'am.

640
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:45,959
It was right here!

641
00:45:45,959 --> 00:45:47,629
She said she'll be here in 5 minutes.

642
00:45:47,629 --> 00:45:49,829
5 minutes? I have to go out.

643
00:45:49,829 --> 00:45:50,829
Bae Da-som.

644
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:52,569
Shouldn't you call her
at a time like this?

645
00:45:52,569 --> 00:45:53,999
Yes, ma'am.

646
00:45:53,999 --> 00:45:55,339
Oh, she's here.

647
00:45:55,639 --> 00:45:57,159
This is her, right?

648
00:46:02,279 --> 00:46:04,279
Yes, this is her.

649
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:22,289
No way.

650
00:47:22,419 --> 00:47:24,389
You came to work on a Sunday?

651
00:47:24,389 --> 00:47:25,789
Yeah, well.

652
00:47:27,029 --> 00:47:28,259
Are you getting a cab?

653
00:47:28,259 --> 00:47:29,259
Yes.

654
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:32,669
I needed some stuff
before going to the hospital.

655
00:47:33,169 --> 00:47:34,369
I see.

656
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:37,599
I don't believe this.

657
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:46,309
Get in. I'll drive you.

658
00:48:06,429 --> 00:48:07,869
Is that for your husband?

659
00:48:10,399 --> 00:48:12,869
You've never been to the ICU, huh?

660
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:17,839
My husband can't eat things like this.

661
00:48:19,009 --> 00:48:22,549
He can only have water
through a tube in his nose.

662
00:48:22,549 --> 00:48:24,149
He can't eat this.

663
00:48:27,289 --> 00:48:28,189
It's mine.

664
00:48:28,189 --> 00:48:29,859
So I can get energy.

665
00:48:30,959 --> 00:48:33,429
- Oh.
- Oh.

666
00:48:36,629 --> 00:48:38,569
- What?
- What?

667
00:48:38,569 --> 00:48:40,129
What are you doing?

668
00:48:40,429 --> 00:48:41,969
What are you doing?

669
00:48:42,469 --> 00:48:44,599
- Jeez.
- Jeez.

670
00:48:51,479 --> 00:48:53,409
It's fun being with you.

671
00:48:53,409 --> 00:48:54,849
Like the old days.

672
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:59,149
You're not sick or anything, right?

673
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:01,489
Me?

674
00:49:02,259 --> 00:49:03,289
Yeah.

675
00:49:04,789 --> 00:49:06,089
What if I am?

676
00:49:08,129 --> 00:49:09,859
Will you worry about me?

677
00:49:12,269 --> 00:49:13,269
Huh?

678
00:49:13,699 --> 00:49:15,399
You're really...

679
00:49:31,179 --> 00:49:32,389
Get out.

680
00:49:34,219 --> 00:49:35,559
I'm really what?

681
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,229
You're a problem.

682
00:50:16,899 --> 00:50:18,059
You're right.

683
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:20,029
I'm the problem.

684
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:24,169
Bye.

685
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:48,299
Yeah, Mom.

686
00:50:48,399 --> 00:50:49,959
You waited for a long time, right?

687
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:51,869
I'll be there right now.

688
00:50:57,699 --> 00:50:59,239
If it disappeared,
she should look for it.

689
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:01,539
Why do they always suspect us first?

690
00:51:01,909 --> 00:51:03,479
I looked at

691
00:51:04,139 --> 00:51:06,509
the purse for a while.

692
00:51:09,979 --> 00:51:11,649
It looked like a gift.

693
00:51:11,649 --> 00:51:14,049
The tiny thing was so expensive

694
00:51:14,619 --> 00:51:16,159
that I thought, 'Why buy this?'

695
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:18,659
'Cash would've been better.'

696
00:51:19,389 --> 00:51:21,629
Then I remembered that I used to

697
00:51:21,629 --> 00:51:23,499
like these kind of things, too.

698
00:51:23,499 --> 00:51:24,699
Yeah.

699
00:51:24,699 --> 00:51:26,769
It's been a while for me, too.

700
00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:29,539
Thinking, 'All the pretty
trinkets are useless.'

701
00:51:29,539 --> 00:51:31,469
'Give me cash.'

702
00:51:32,369 --> 00:51:35,779
It's because you lost
the shape of your heart.

703
00:51:35,779 --> 00:51:37,219
Shape of my heart?

704
00:51:37,439 --> 00:51:39,879
Your heart has to be
the shape of a heart.

705
00:51:39,879 --> 00:51:43,079
But it changed into the shape of money.

706
00:51:48,459 --> 00:51:50,189
Looks like she was
in a soap opera, right?

707
00:51:50,189 --> 00:51:51,959
I think I've seen her.

708
00:51:52,589 --> 00:51:55,129
I don't know.

709
00:51:55,129 --> 00:51:56,359
Who could the man be?

710
00:51:56,359 --> 00:51:58,429
It'd be fun if he was a famous person.

711
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:02,799
It seemed like he had quite a temper.

712
00:52:02,999 --> 00:52:05,439
I wonder if he hit her.

713
00:52:05,439 --> 00:52:06,709
Why?

714
00:52:10,109 --> 00:52:12,849
Seems like the man
bought her the missing purse.

715
00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:15,249
But in the past,
the girl had sold a gift

716
00:52:15,249 --> 00:52:17,049
the man had given her.

717
00:52:17,049 --> 00:52:18,279
On the phone on my way here,

718
00:52:18,279 --> 00:52:20,789
he was yelling like crazy behind her.

719
00:52:22,089 --> 00:52:24,619
When I got here,
it seemed like she had cried.

720
00:52:24,619 --> 00:52:26,129
Her face was all puffy

721
00:52:26,129 --> 00:52:28,429
and her hair was all messed up.

722
00:52:31,629 --> 00:52:34,529
The man seemed quite old.

723
00:52:34,529 --> 00:52:35,899
Did you see his face?

724
00:52:35,899 --> 00:52:37,299
No.

725
00:52:37,569 --> 00:52:38,639
Just

726
00:52:39,009 --> 00:52:40,739
for a second.

727
00:53:06,899 --> 00:53:07,899
Huh?

728
00:53:07,999 --> 00:53:09,239
I found it!

729
00:53:10,999 --> 00:53:12,309
This is it, right?

730
00:53:17,009 --> 00:53:18,009
Yes.

731
00:53:18,449 --> 00:53:21,209
She must've put it here to sell,
then forgot.

732
00:53:33,729 --> 00:53:35,599
When you clean,

733
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:37,959
pick it up, wipe the surface

734
00:53:37,959 --> 00:53:39,999
and put it back in its spot.

735
00:53:39,999 --> 00:53:42,069
Why move it?

736
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:43,869
You're right.

737
00:53:43,869 --> 00:53:46,139
We'll be more careful from now on.

738
00:53:48,339 --> 00:53:49,939
<i>You do such a good job.</i>

739
00:53:51,549 --> 00:53:52,509
<i>Thank you.</i>

740
00:53:52,509 --> 00:53:55,249
<i>If she had put it back,
you wouldn't be here.</i>

741
00:53:55,249 --> 00:53:56,849
<i>- Right?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

742
00:53:57,179 --> 00:53:59,049
<i>No biggie since nothing
has gone missing.</i>

743
00:53:59,449 --> 00:54:00,619
<i>I'm glad.</i>

744
00:54:01,349 --> 00:54:02,189
<i>I mean</i>

745
00:54:02,189 --> 00:54:03,559
<i>why put that there?</i>

746
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:04,599
<i>You're right.</i>

747
00:54:08,399 --> 00:54:09,720
<i>(Seo Jin-seop)</i>

748
00:54:09,729 --> 00:54:12,429
<i>Thanks for saying you'll
be careful from now on.</i>

749
00:54:12,799 --> 00:54:14,899
Then I'll report that
there was no problem

750
00:54:14,899 --> 00:54:15,899
and that our manager

751
00:54:15,899 --> 00:54:19,009
<i>will continue to work
for you twice a week.</i>

752
00:54:24,039 --> 00:54:25,949
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

753
00:54:35,489 --> 00:54:37,259
<i>She doesn't mix well.</i>

754
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:40,189
Is this kind of event
once-a-week or once-a-month?

755
00:54:40,189 --> 00:54:43,129
It's barely once a year.
She doesn't even call.

756
00:54:43,829 --> 00:54:45,799
Give me a break.

757
00:54:45,799 --> 00:54:47,329
Your voice will get hoarse.

758
00:54:47,499 --> 00:54:49,069
That's not the problem.

759
00:54:49,069 --> 00:54:50,139
I'm so angry.

760
00:54:50,139 --> 00:54:52,599
So stop it since you're getting angry.

761
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:53,559
Alright?

762
00:54:53,669 --> 00:54:56,079
Your lipstick smeared here.

763
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:56,909
It smeared?

764
00:54:56,909 --> 00:54:57,609
Yes.

765
00:54:57,609 --> 00:54:58,649
Let me see.

766
00:54:59,709 --> 00:55:02,149
She must be busy
because of the new book.

767
00:55:02,479 --> 00:55:04,619
I feel sorry for her these days.

768
00:55:05,089 --> 00:55:08,189
She was already tiny,
and now she's getting tinier.

769
00:55:08,619 --> 00:55:09,739
What about me?

770
00:55:09,919 --> 00:55:12,229
Your mother is tinier, you fool!

771
00:55:12,229 --> 00:55:13,759
Seriously, Mom.

772
00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:15,929
Why are you talking about yourself now?

773
00:55:16,259 --> 00:55:17,229
Jeez.

774
00:55:17,229 --> 00:55:19,269
You're tiny because you're old.

775
00:55:19,269 --> 00:55:20,599
Bu-jeong is tiny

776
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:21,999
because she's working hard.

777
00:55:21,999 --> 00:55:23,399
- Hey!
- Jeez!

778
00:55:23,569 --> 00:55:24,699
You startled me.

779
00:55:24,699 --> 00:55:26,169
Why are you yelling?

780
00:55:26,169 --> 00:55:28,979
You're my son, but you're so mean.

781
00:55:28,979 --> 00:55:30,109
You know that?

782
00:55:30,109 --> 00:55:32,179
I made kimchi for you
until my back bent.

783
00:55:32,179 --> 00:55:35,419
You munched on it like a pig,
but said it's salty.

784
00:55:35,919 --> 00:55:36,919
I did?

785
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:38,649
When?

786
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:41,089
I think I said it was good.

787
00:55:41,919 --> 00:55:43,989
This bastard is killing me again.

788
00:55:43,989 --> 00:55:46,489
I should record you next time.

789
00:55:46,829 --> 00:55:49,159
But I think I said it was good.

790
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,159
It's good. For real.

791
00:55:51,159 --> 00:55:52,669
Unbelievable.

792
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:59,509
The only daughter-in-law
I have is so unsociable.

793
00:55:59,509 --> 00:56:02,779
The thing I hate the most
is how she locks

794
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:04,609
the second lock on the front door.

795
00:56:04,609 --> 00:56:06,749
She goes in whenever she wants
with the password.

796
00:56:06,749 --> 00:56:08,009
But we have to ring the bell

797
00:56:08,009 --> 00:56:10,249
and go in only when she lets us.

798
00:56:10,479 --> 00:56:11,949
Does she live alone there?

799
00:56:11,949 --> 00:56:14,289
Everyone has their own lifestyle.

800
00:56:14,289 --> 00:56:17,289
I said it was fine.
Why are you making a fuss?

801
00:56:17,289 --> 00:56:20,329
She doesn't call
even once in her whole life.

802
00:56:20,829 --> 00:56:23,129
So don't expect her to do it.

803
00:56:23,229 --> 00:56:25,929
We promised to each be
good to our own parents

804
00:56:25,929 --> 00:56:28,129
before we got married.

805
00:56:28,899 --> 00:56:31,199
Then you should be good to me.

806
00:56:33,469 --> 00:56:34,809
Right.

807
00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:37,779
I'm the problem. Me.

808
00:56:43,449 --> 00:56:44,649
What are you doing?

809
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:48,419
What's this scent I've been smelling?

810
00:56:49,759 --> 00:56:51,289
Is it perfume?

811
00:56:51,289 --> 00:56:52,289
Huh?

812
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:55,629
Did you give someone a ride?

813
00:56:57,259 --> 00:56:58,259
Me?

814
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,529
Who would I give a ride to?

815
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:07,109
Huh?

816
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:08,309
There's your friend.

817
00:57:08,309 --> 00:57:09,739
Go on ahead, Mom.

818
00:57:09,739 --> 00:57:12,049
Call Bu-jeong!

819
00:57:12,049 --> 00:57:13,279
Okay.

820
00:57:16,889 --> 00:57:17,979
Nam-yeong!

821
00:57:17,979 --> 00:57:20,649
You're here!

822
00:57:28,329 --> 00:57:29,729
What a keen sense of smell!

823
00:57:29,729 --> 00:57:31,399
How's your knee after surgery?

824
00:57:31,399 --> 00:57:33,099
It's fine.

825
00:57:34,029 --> 00:57:35,269
Where are your son and daughter-in-law?

826
00:57:35,269 --> 00:57:37,099
My son is here.

827
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:40,039
My daughter-in-law, Writer Lee, is busy.

828
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,409
You know the actress
Jeong Ah-ran, right?

829
00:57:41,409 --> 00:57:43,009
Of course I know her.

830
00:57:43,009 --> 00:57:46,779
My daughter-in-law made her book.

831
00:57:46,779 --> 00:57:48,149
- Really?
- Yes.

832
00:57:48,149 --> 00:57:50,279
That's great.

833
00:57:50,279 --> 00:57:51,719
Actually,

834
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:54,519
my daughter-in-law
practically wrote it all.

835
00:58:04,659 --> 00:58:05,659
Sir?

836
00:58:07,169 --> 00:58:08,199
Mr. Jin!

837
00:58:09,739 --> 00:58:10,739
Huh?

838
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:13,009
What are you doing here?

839
00:58:13,609 --> 00:58:15,739
My cousin is getting married.

840
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:16,639
What about you?

841
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:17,779
My friend's getting married.

842
00:58:17,779 --> 00:58:19,749
A neighborhood friend. A family friend.

843
00:58:20,249 --> 00:58:21,149
Is it the same wedding?

844
00:58:21,149 --> 00:58:22,719
Mine is on the first floor.

845
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:24,159
Mine's on the second.

846
00:58:24,349 --> 00:58:26,419
Then it's not the same wedding.

847
00:58:26,689 --> 00:58:28,089
Hey, I'm sorry,

848
00:58:28,089 --> 00:58:29,689
but do you have a bill?

849
00:58:29,689 --> 00:58:32,029
I think I left my wallet in the car.

850
00:58:32,029 --> 00:58:33,459
Of course. Just a second.

851
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:37,239
I barely recognized you.

852
00:58:37,629 --> 00:58:38,929
Since you're out here.

853
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:40,799
I totally recognized you.

854
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:41,999
Even though you're out here.

855
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,099
Right?

856
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:49,579
Excuse me.

857
00:58:50,879 --> 00:58:52,149
Please do your best.

858
00:58:52,479 --> 00:58:53,579
I will.

859
00:59:04,189 --> 00:59:05,489
Your girlfriend?

860
00:59:05,489 --> 00:59:07,529
Oh, no. Nothing like that.

861
00:59:08,329 --> 00:59:11,799
Her face is small.
She looks like a celebrity.

862
00:59:12,629 --> 00:59:14,229
She used to be a trainee.

863
00:59:14,869 --> 00:59:15,999
Trainee?

864
00:59:16,969 --> 00:59:19,239
Then she's almost a celebrity.

865
00:59:19,609 --> 00:59:20,839
Good for you, Jun-hyuk.

866
00:59:20,839 --> 00:59:22,309
There are over
1 million celebrities now.

867
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:24,039
A celebrity is no big deal.

868
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:28,009
Is it like that nowadays?

869
00:59:28,379 --> 00:59:29,379
But really,

870
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:31,949
where do you meet people like her?

871
00:59:32,989 --> 00:59:34,889
I met her online.

872
00:59:35,319 --> 00:59:37,159
I saw her in person
for the first time today.

873
00:59:37,159 --> 00:59:38,319
Online?

874
00:59:39,759 --> 00:59:40,989
It's best you not know.

875
00:59:52,099 --> 00:59:53,439
Yeah, where are you?

876
00:59:53,439 --> 00:59:54,609
Are you here?

877
00:59:54,609 --> 00:59:56,679
I am.

878
00:59:57,179 --> 01:00:00,209
But I want to go home. Can't I?

879
01:00:00,909 --> 01:00:03,119
I'm in bad shape.
My makeup has worn off.

880
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:04,879
I'm a mess.

881
01:00:04,879 --> 01:00:06,819
What nonsense are you talking about?

882
01:00:06,819 --> 01:00:09,219
Mom is waiting so anxiously for you.

883
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:13,629
I saw Mother on my way here.

884
01:00:14,229 --> 01:00:15,899
She was surrounded by so many people

885
01:00:15,899 --> 01:00:18,159
that she didn't even see me.

886
01:00:18,529 --> 01:00:21,059
Anyway. I got it. See you at the hall.

887
01:00:21,969 --> 01:00:23,339
I'm going as a mess.

888
01:00:23,339 --> 01:00:24,399
Bye.

889
01:00:40,919 --> 01:00:42,359
Hello.

890
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,159
Do you recognize me?

891
01:00:47,589 --> 01:00:50,359
I run a pharmacy at
your mother-in-law's building.

892
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:52,799
Oh, right.

893
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:53,869
I wore

894
01:00:53,869 --> 01:00:55,969
too much makeup today.

895
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,309
Would you like to use this?

896
01:01:01,309 --> 01:01:03,679
It's a bit too red, but still.

897
01:01:05,949 --> 01:01:07,709
This won't do, right?

898
01:01:07,709 --> 01:01:09,379
It'd be better to wear makeup

899
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,279
than not.

900
01:01:12,649 --> 01:01:13,649
Here.

901
01:01:13,919 --> 01:01:15,049
Thank you.

902
01:01:20,959 --> 01:01:22,959
I heard you're very busy these days.

903
01:01:23,829 --> 01:01:24,829
Yes.

904
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:28,569
Your mother-in-law waited for you.

905
01:01:28,569 --> 01:01:30,369
She bragged about you, too.

906
01:01:31,339 --> 01:01:33,309
She's probably bragging now.

907
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:37,309
That you're pretty and intelligent...

908
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:44,919
I'm sorry.

909
01:01:45,649 --> 01:01:48,989
I'm awkward with small talk.

910
01:01:51,759 --> 01:01:53,259
Me, too.

911
01:01:55,729 --> 01:01:57,959
Then I'll go now.

912
01:01:58,429 --> 01:01:59,729
Take your time.

913
01:02:22,919 --> 01:02:24,569
You said all we had to do was eat.

914
01:02:24,569 --> 01:02:25,799
Why are you making us work?

915
01:02:26,589 --> 01:02:28,699
That's why I got more money.

916
01:02:28,699 --> 01:02:30,559
You have to give that back
as a money gift.

917
01:02:32,569 --> 01:02:35,269
300,000 won is for us
to use as a money gift.

918
01:02:35,269 --> 01:02:37,639
The remaining 200,000 won is for us.

919
01:02:38,699 --> 01:02:40,809
Sticking a few flowers

920
01:02:40,809 --> 01:02:42,379
and balloons on the car

921
01:02:42,579 --> 01:02:44,539
and getting 200,000 won is good.

922
01:02:46,509 --> 01:02:49,379
I'm starving. When are we eating?

923
01:02:49,819 --> 01:02:53,289
I think I need to buy more decorations.

924
01:02:53,389 --> 01:02:55,249
This is enough. Why do more?

925
01:02:55,249 --> 01:02:58,119
We have money left over
from buying flowers.

926
01:02:58,219 --> 01:02:59,429
You only get married once.

927
01:02:59,429 --> 01:03:01,089
It's good to make it well.

928
01:03:01,659 --> 01:03:03,829
You don't know
if it will be once or twice.

929
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:07,069
Seriously.

930
01:03:07,469 --> 01:03:10,539
The more I know you,
the more I realize you're mean.

931
01:03:11,369 --> 01:03:13,009
I'll be right back.

932
01:03:14,409 --> 01:03:16,909
Hurry back. I don't want
to be alone with her.

933
01:03:25,789 --> 01:03:26,949
Seriously.

934
01:03:27,319 --> 01:03:29,489
You're good at saying things
you don't mean.

935
01:03:29,489 --> 01:03:31,169
Think however you like.

936
01:03:36,759 --> 01:03:38,159
So what's going on?

937
01:03:38,329 --> 01:03:39,329
What?

938
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:41,269
The job.

939
01:03:43,869 --> 01:03:46,869
The job you said had
nothing to do with you.

940
01:03:49,809 --> 01:03:51,209
What is it to you?

941
01:03:52,349 --> 01:03:54,979
I was just asking.

942
01:03:55,649 --> 01:03:56,979
In case

943
01:03:57,279 --> 01:03:59,749
there comes a time you need me.

944
01:04:03,489 --> 01:04:04,719
There won't be.

945
01:04:10,399 --> 01:04:11,829
Then never mind.

946
01:04:19,409 --> 01:04:20,339
Where are you going?

947
01:04:20,339 --> 01:04:22,169
None of your business.

948
01:04:22,879 --> 01:04:24,839
You're not going home, are you?

949
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:26,949
I really want to go home.

950
01:04:43,099 --> 01:04:44,099
Huh?

951
01:04:46,229 --> 01:04:47,229
Huh?

952
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:50,239
Hey.

953
01:04:52,839 --> 01:04:53,839
Huh?

954
01:04:55,729 --> 01:04:56,449
Why...

955
01:04:56,479 --> 01:04:58,209
Why are you here?

956
01:04:58,479 --> 01:04:59,979
What's with the clothes?

957
01:05:00,649 --> 01:05:01,809
Where's your book bag?

958
01:05:02,379 --> 01:05:03,419
What?

959
01:05:04,879 --> 01:05:06,849
Weren't you going to the library?

960
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,159
Wasn't he going to the library?

961
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:11,159
Huh?

962
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:12,529
A wedding.

963
01:05:12,529 --> 01:05:14,389
He said he was going to a wedding.

964
01:05:14,589 --> 01:05:16,859
I said I was going to a wedding.

965
01:05:18,099 --> 01:05:20,029
You mistook "wedding" for "library"?

966
01:05:20,029 --> 01:05:21,529
I must've heard wrong.

967
01:05:25,069 --> 01:05:26,569
He got confused.

968
01:06:16,219 --> 01:06:17,689
Hello?

969
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,429
There are a lot of weddings.
You might get lost.

970
01:06:26,529 --> 01:06:28,629
I even met two people I know.

971
01:06:29,499 --> 01:06:30,699
<i>Hey, Jeong-su!</i>

972
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:31,969
- Hi!
- <i>I've stepped out.</i>

973
01:06:31,969 --> 01:06:33,639
I'll find it soon enough. Bye.

974
01:06:33,639 --> 01:06:35,369
<i>Be careful, okay?</i>

975
01:07:12,649 --> 01:07:15,709
<i>I appreciate what you did that day, too.</i>

976
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:19,219
<i>I received the item you returned well.</i>

977
01:07:22,449 --> 01:07:23,659
<i>Thanks to you,</i>

978
01:07:23,659 --> 01:07:25,119
<i>I had a really good birthday</i>

979
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:27,329
<i>for the first time in a long time.</i>

980
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:31,464
♫ <i>As if it never happened from the beginning</i> ♫

981
01:07:32,232 --> 01:07:42,008
♫ <i>Like a dream that disappeared</i> ♫

982
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:47,480
♫ <i>On that rainy day,</i> ♫

983
01:07:47,509 --> 01:07:48,669
What are you doing?

984
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:52,686
♫ <i>I had nowhere to lean</i> ♫

985
01:07:52,709 --> 01:07:54,209
Let's go in.

986
01:07:54,200 --> 01:08:02,140
♫ <i>I hoped someone would be by my side</i> ♫

987
01:08:02,149 --> 01:08:04,399
<i>Since you said I didn't have to reply,</i>

988
01:08:06,869 --> 01:08:08,729
<i>I won't.</i>

989
01:08:09,169 --> 01:08:12,399
<i>I wish you good health.</i>

990
01:08:14,769 --> 01:08:16,379
Wait.

991
01:08:17,829 --> 01:08:19,409
I left something

992
01:08:19,949 --> 01:08:21,449
in the restroom.

993
01:08:21,539 --> 01:08:22,769
The restroom?

994
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:24,169
I'll be right back.

995
01:08:24,169 --> 01:08:25,279
Bu-jeong!

996
01:08:25,539 --> 01:08:26,649
Son!

997
01:08:26,919 --> 01:08:27,649
Over here!

998
01:08:27,649 --> 01:08:28,689
Okay, Mom!

999
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:39,699
♫ <i>If I keep walking to find those memories</i> ♫

1000
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:50,076
♫ <i>I am left alone in this cold place</i> ♫

1001
01:09:17,971 --> 01:09:27,781
♫ <i>As I talk to myself, walking on the street</i> ♫

1002
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:39,592
♫ <i>On this path of my life
that is spread out like a dream</i> ♫

1003
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:50,437
♫ <i>All of these times before me</i> ♫

1004
01:09:50,437 --> 01:09:59,345
♫ <i>I can't distinguish from love or farewell</i> ♫

1005
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:02,959
<i>(Lost)</i>

1006
01:10:03,619 --> 01:10:05,649
<i>Have you heard about a stand-in service?</i>

1007
01:10:06,189 --> 01:10:08,859
<i>If kids like them come at you,</i>

1008
01:10:08,859 --> 01:10:11,159
<i>people like us will sway and fall.</i>

1009
01:10:11,159 --> 01:10:12,759
<i>Are people like us...</i>

1010
01:10:12,759 --> 01:10:13,529
<i>...me?</i>

1011
01:10:13,529 --> 01:10:16,199
<i>If I ask you to be with me for one hour,</i>

1012
01:10:16,199 --> 01:10:17,659
<i>how much is that?</i>

1013
01:10:17,659 --> 01:10:19,029
<i>It's about Jin-seop.</i>

1014
01:10:19,029 --> 01:10:21,029
<i>Are there any rumors about</i>

1015
01:10:21,029 --> 01:10:22,029
<i>who he's seeing nowadays?</i>

1016
01:10:22,029 --> 01:10:23,969
<i>I like Gyeong-eun.</i>

1017
01:10:24,169 --> 01:10:26,809
<i>If she had accepted me...</i>

1018
01:10:26,809 --> 01:10:28,209
<i>If you think about it,</i>

1019
01:10:28,209 --> 01:10:30,609
<i>youth is so lonesome</i>

1020
01:10:30,609 --> 01:10:32,979
<i>without a particular reason.</i>

1021
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:36,349
<i>It's harder than growing old.</i>

1022
01:10:37,419 --> 01:10:39,989
<i>What am I so afraid of?</i>
