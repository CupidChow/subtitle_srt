The next shift worker is running late

00:02:51,556 --> 00:02:53,356

Yeah, go on.

26
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:35,986
A customer left his phone here
and came back

27
00:03:35,986 --> 00:03:38,256

of something.

No.

54
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:31,156
Should we get a dryer?

55
00:06:31,756 --> 00:06:34,986
Seeing it rain, I feel like we need one.

56
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:37,746
Why a dryer all of a sudden?

57
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:42,886
Laundry in the living room
makes you uneasy.

58
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:46,046
You said it feels like a temporary camp

59
00:06:46,446 --> 00:06:48,246
and like we've become poor.

60
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:53,176
I didn't realize when we moved in,

61
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,886
but the fridge

62
00:06:55,056 --> 00:06:57,986
and kimchi fridge are
too big for the small room.

63
00:06:58,146 --> 00:07:00,346
We bought the washing
machine in the balcony

64
00:07:00,346 --> 00:07:02,806
because my mom thought it was better.

65
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:10,536
Let's see.

67
00:07:14,206 --> 00:07:16,996
If I get an employee discount
on top of that...

68
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:23,086
Should we change everything?

69
00:07:23,536 --> 00:07:24,246
Huh?

70
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:27,016
It'll be cheaper
if we buy them all at once.

71
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:28,856
If we get a newly-wed deal discount

72
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:31,166
and an installment plan of 60 months,

73
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:33,666
we'll be paying about
130,000 won a month.

74
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:37,266
What?

75
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:40,316
What about what we already have?

76
00:07:40,736 --> 00:07:41,576
Throw them away?

77
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:43,296
Why throw them away?

78
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:45,466
We can give it away.

79
00:07:45,956 --> 00:07:48,466
Oh! Should we put it in Mom's house?

80
00:07:49,476 --> 00:07:50,916
I noticed that her house

81
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,386
looked empty because we took everything.

82
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:56,536
Why? Did Mother tell you
to put them all back?

83
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:57,896
No.

84
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:01,586
I swear she didn't say that.

85
00:08:02,276 --> 00:08:04,606
Then why change perfectly good things?

86
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:08,046
They worked fine for 5 years.
Better than us.

87
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:13,036
Why are you being so on edge again?

88
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:17,246
It was a suggestion
because you're working hard.

89
00:08:17,526 --> 00:08:19,196
We paid it all off last month.

90
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:20,886
Paid what?

91
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:22,306
The installment.

92
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:27,476
We bought these 5 years ago
on a newly-wed deal.

93
00:08:27,476 --> 00:08:29,016

121
00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:39,506
How did you find out so soon?

122
00:13:39,506 --> 00:13:41,946
I only told you she works
at a publishing house.

123
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,186
Is that important?

124
00:13:43,306 --> 00:13:45,346
What's important is that
you tried to feel me out.

125
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:47,786
I wasn't feeling you out.

126
00:13:48,076 --> 00:13:50,056

128
00:14:08,086 --> 00:14:08,896
Yeah.

129
00:14:12,176 --> 00:14:14,816
I should study up on the VIP.

130
00:14:14,816 --> 00:14:17,076
I need information to pull it off.

131
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,906
It doesn't look like you bought it.

132
00:14:19,906 --> 00:14:21,446
How can you tell?

133
00:14:21,796 --> 00:14:24,426
It says, "Not for sale,"
so of course I can tell.

134
00:14:25,946 --> 00:14:27,546
Did you go to the publishing house?

135
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:29,896
No, not exactly.

136
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,336
Then where?

137
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,746
Just...

138
00:14:34,176 --> 00:14:35,786

00:14:39,056 --> 00:14:40,816
You don't know her.

142

You've grown a lot, Gang-jae.

144
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:48,526
You know a woman I don't.

145
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:52,086
It's been three years since I left here.

146
00:14:52,816 --> 00:14:53,816
Right.

147
00:14:57,786 --> 00:14:58,646
So?

148
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,746
How much do you know?

149
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:04,926
I know enough.

150
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:11,466
I'm not hiding info

151
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,766
because I don't trust you or anything.

152
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:17,146
The world these days

153
00:15:17,306 --> 00:15:19,186
is different from what it used to be.

154
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:20,086
Oh, really?

155
00:15:21,016 --> 00:15:22,056
To be honest,

156
00:15:22,636 --> 00:15:24,566
people worship a celebrity or whatever

157
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:26,186
if they think they're nice,

158
00:15:26,186 --> 00:15:28,466
saying they're "woke"
and have good character,

159
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:30,566
and put them on a pedestal.

160
00:15:30,826 --> 00:15:32,106
But if they find one small fault,

161
00:15:32,106 --> 00:15:35,376
they clobber them and ruin their lives.

162
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:38,776
She was a supporting role all her life,

163
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:40,726
but with the success of the book,

164
00:15:40,726 --> 00:15:42,146
she rose to stardom

165
00:15:42,146 --> 00:15:44,086
with an image of a truly "woke" adult.

166
00:15:44,386 --> 00:15:46,276
If a tiny scandal erupts,

167
00:15:47,176 --> 00:15:48,356
her life will be over.

168
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:51,956
So you're burning
with a sense of loyalty?

169
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:53,726
Loyalty, my foot.

170
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:55,486
It's just...

171
00:15:56,536 --> 00:15:57,936
I feel pity for how

172
00:15:58,386 --> 00:15:59,766
she struggles to survive.

173
00:16:04,846 --> 00:16:07,476
So what do you want from me exactly?

174
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:10,866
Well...

175
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:11,946
First,

176
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:13,966
why don't you

177
00:16:16,086 --> 00:16:17,116
sleep with her?

178
00:16:22,156 --> 00:16:24,746
We'll think about what's next later.

179
00:16:25,746 --> 00:16:28,566
If you get close,
it'll be easier to monitor her.

180
00:16:28,896 --> 00:16:31,696
For women like her,
meeting a guy like you

181
00:16:31,696 --> 00:16:33,276
is a weakness in itself.

182
00:16:35,386 --> 00:16:36,496
A guy like me?

183
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,496
Why are you being so sensitive?

184
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:44,676
Okay, my bad.

185
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:47,076
Not you.

186
00:16:47,076 --> 00:16:48,226
Us.

187
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,496
Guys like us.

188
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,566
Guys like us, my foot.

189
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:53,746
Jeez.

190
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:09,786
See you tomorrow.

191
00:17:10,226 --> 00:17:12,226
You should re-stock the wet wipes.

192
00:17:12,336 --> 00:17:13,376
Okay. Bye.

193
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:50,736
Bus No. 7728 will arrive shortly.

194
00:18:01,936 --> 00:18:06,276
<i>(Current information:
Last bus will arrive in 8 minutes)</i>

195
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:28,896
You asleep?

196
00:19:32,646 --> 00:19:33,646
I thought

197
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:37,216
you'd like to drink this
since you couldn't earlier.

198
00:19:39,806 --> 00:19:41,486
Sorry. Go back to sleep.

199
00:19:42,486 --> 00:19:44,586
If you want to buy it, then go ahead.

200
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:50,746
A dryer.

201
00:19:54,926 --> 00:19:57,826
If you want a new fridge,
then get one, too.

202
00:20:00,526 --> 00:20:02,126
I'm not angry.

203
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:08,496
It's true that these don't fit.

204
00:20:10,706 --> 00:20:12,536
I frustrate you, right?

205
00:20:14,536 --> 00:20:15,896
What do you mean?

206
00:20:17,356 --> 00:20:19,206
I was just thinking.

207
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:22,906
It's just the two of us at home.

208
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:25,056
But I'm slow-witted

209
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:28,576
and say frustrating things all the time.

210
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,766
You're a smart person.

211
00:20:32,476 --> 00:20:34,296
So I thought

212
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,446
you'd be so frustrated with me.

213
00:20:38,606 --> 00:20:40,286
Are you being sarcastic?

214
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,416
No.

215
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:47,346
I mean it.

216
00:20:54,936 --> 00:20:55,936
Good night.

217
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:32,166
What in the?

218
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:34,266
What's going on?

219
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:37,606
Is squatting in the hallway
becoming a trend?

220
00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:41,736
Hey, what's with you?

221
00:21:43,246 --> 00:21:44,956
Huh? It's Gang-jae.

222
00:21:44,956 --> 00:21:46,446
- Gang-jae!
- Be quiet.

223
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,066
Why did you drink so much?

224
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:49,406
You're soaking wet.

225
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:50,736
No, don't come near me.

226
00:21:50,736 --> 00:21:54,006
Why did you change your password?

227
00:21:54,016 --> 00:21:55,836
- Hey. Huh?
- What do you mean?

228
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:56,676
I didn't.

229
00:21:56,856 --> 00:21:58,406
It's 12345678.

230
00:21:58,406 --> 00:21:59,346
Really?

231
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:01,396
I went all the way up to 9.

232
00:22:01,396 --> 00:22:03,196
You should've called.

233
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,636
Sorry. I was out of batteries.

234
00:22:04,636 --> 00:22:06,006
I'm using the toilet!

235
00:22:11,226 --> 00:22:12,666
He must be insane.

236
00:22:16,186 --> 00:22:17,986
Hey, did you call Soon-gyu?

237
00:23:15,556 --> 00:23:17,886
I bet there's no housemaid like me.

238
00:23:18,546 --> 00:23:20,996
I go sell medicine at the break of dawn.

239
00:23:20,996 --> 00:23:23,216
I stop by during meal times to cook.

240
00:23:24,496 --> 00:23:26,976
But no one is grateful.

241
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,616
No one pays me.

242
00:23:30,396 --> 00:23:32,996
I'm getting pissed off all of a sudden.

243
00:23:33,796 --> 00:23:34,846
Are those potatoes?

244
00:23:39,226 --> 00:23:41,096
I asked if they're potatoes.

245
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:45,116
Yes! They're potatoes!

246
00:23:45,116 --> 00:23:46,376
Potatoes!

247
00:23:46,566 --> 00:23:47,816
Can't you tell?

248
00:23:48,946 --> 00:23:51,616
Jeez. Why are you yelling?

249
00:23:51,636 --> 00:23:52,596
Is there a fire?

250
00:23:52,596 --> 00:23:54,366
It's not fire. It's potatoes.

251
00:23:55,236 --> 00:23:57,076
What's wrong with you?

252
00:23:58,346 --> 00:24:01,346
You should be more responsible
with smaller tasks.

253
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:02,786
They're all burnt.

254
00:24:03,246 --> 00:24:04,486
All burnt.

255
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:05,396
That won't do.

256
00:24:05,396 --> 00:24:06,926
When did you get here?

257
00:24:08,016 --> 00:24:10,286
Oh, hi. Early in the morning.

258
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:13,156
Are you okay? Huh?

259
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:16,246
Hey!

260
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:22,956
They're not potatoes?

261
00:24:36,616 --> 00:24:38,916
This is all because of stress.

262
00:24:39,136 --> 00:24:40,306
How old are you?

263
00:24:40,306 --> 00:24:41,276
Forty?

264
00:24:41,726 --> 00:24:42,726
Oh, no.

265
00:24:43,226 --> 00:24:44,396
She's thirty-six.

266
00:24:44,396 --> 00:24:45,756
Same as me.

267
00:24:48,026 --> 00:24:49,326
You're kidding, right?

268
00:24:49,726 --> 00:24:51,326
You two are the same age?

269
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:53,846
Oh, hey, I guess

270
00:24:53,846 --> 00:24:56,816
you're good at housekeeping
since you live alone.

271
00:24:56,816 --> 00:24:58,546
You're a good cook, right?

272
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:02,756
No, I consider myself a bad cook.

273
00:25:04,816 --> 00:25:06,646
Like this.

274
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:08,256
I cook like this.

275
00:25:08,636 --> 00:25:11,386
Oh, why did my brother-in-law
drink so much?

276
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:12,526
You two drank together?

277
00:25:12,736 --> 00:25:14,766
I hardly drank.

278
00:25:14,766 --> 00:25:15,766
He bought

279
00:25:16,336 --> 00:25:20,016
a 2-liter bottle of beer
and drank all of it.

280
00:25:21,326 --> 00:25:23,866
He must be stressed out, too.

281
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:25,986
Oh, yeah, right.

282
00:25:25,986 --> 00:25:27,126
I guess studying

283
00:25:27,506 --> 00:25:28,706
is tough.

284
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:31,766
Yeah, right.

285
00:25:34,336 --> 00:25:36,196
I bet he was quietly working

286
00:25:36,356 --> 00:25:37,856
when you coaxed him to your escort club

287
00:25:37,856 --> 00:25:39,686
and made him drink to increase sales.

288
00:25:41,226 --> 00:25:43,126
How can you say that?

289
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:45,996
What's wrong with you?

290
00:25:45,996 --> 00:25:47,556
I'm the one that's offended.

291
00:25:47,556 --> 00:25:48,766
Oh, sorry, sorry.

292
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:52,056
Did Just say that I worked
at an escort club?

293
00:25:52,056 --> 00:25:54,506
No one has to tell me. I can tell.

294
00:25:57,026 --> 00:25:58,026
Jeez.

295
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,096
Seriously.

296
00:26:00,896 --> 00:26:01,896
What?

297
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:03,376
Because I'm sexy.

298
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:06,196
Because I'm good-looking.
That's the problem.

299
00:26:07,156 --> 00:26:08,156
Hey.

300
00:26:08,186 --> 00:26:10,596
Do you still make jokes like that?

301
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,566
Soon-ju is the good-looking one.

302
00:26:13,566 --> 00:26:16,366
You're a long way from
looking remotely like him.

303
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:18,346
You're crossing the line.

304
00:26:18,756 --> 00:26:21,086
You can't compare me to him.

305
00:26:21,086 --> 00:26:22,096
That's enough.

306
00:26:22,096 --> 00:26:24,536
Calm down.
Let's not attack each other's looks.

307
00:26:24,536 --> 00:26:25,776
Since we're all on the same level.

308
00:26:25,776 --> 00:26:26,946
Same level?

309
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:28,536
Better watch what you say.

310
00:26:28,896 --> 00:26:30,446
He and I are on the same level?

311
00:26:32,146 --> 00:26:32,876
Soon-gyu.

312
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:35,686
You should be grateful to Woo-nam.

313
00:26:40,336 --> 00:26:41,166
What?

314
00:26:45,056 --> 00:26:47,436
Let's eat in peace and quiet.

315
00:26:47,436 --> 00:26:48,126
Okay.

316
00:26:49,706 --> 00:26:50,746
Explain this.

317
00:26:54,566 --> 00:26:55,566
Seriously.

318
00:26:56,096 --> 00:26:58,416
Why did you go through my pockets?

319
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,016
I said explain this.

320
00:27:00,656 --> 00:27:02,756
Just suddenly barges
into my house at night,

321
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:05,196
crying and fussing about
wanting to see his sister,

322
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:08,526
so I took an expensive cab
and brought him home,

323
00:27:08,536 --> 00:27:10,216
but you go through my pockets?

324
00:27:10,216 --> 00:27:12,436
It was floating around
in the washing machine.

325
00:27:12,436 --> 00:27:15,186
But let's say I went
through your pockets.

326
00:27:15,756 --> 00:27:17,386
So explain this.

327
00:27:17,586 --> 00:27:19,646
It's obviously a business card.

328
00:27:22,156 --> 00:27:23,516
Is that your job?

329
00:27:25,306 --> 00:27:27,066
Do I have to tell you everything?

330
00:27:27,066 --> 00:27:29,026
Yes. Speak.

331
00:27:35,026 --> 00:27:36,686
Umm...

332
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:38,456
Well...

333
00:27:46,576 --> 00:27:47,536
Okay.

334
00:27:52,086 --> 00:27:54,396
What are the top 3 hardships
of the 21st century?

335
00:27:55,086 --> 00:27:56,526
- Beats me.
- What?

336
00:27:56,866 --> 00:27:58,826
See? This is serious.

337
00:27:58,996 --> 00:27:59,946
Listen up.

338
00:28:00,976 --> 00:28:02,726
First is pollution.

339
00:28:02,836 --> 00:28:03,736
Fine dust.

340
00:28:04,606 --> 00:28:06,356
Glaciers melting. You know, right?

341
00:28:06,356 --> 00:28:08,546
Second is the gap
between the rich and poor.

342
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,006
Noblesse oblige.

343
00:28:10,006 --> 00:28:11,126
Lastly, third.

344
00:28:11,326 --> 00:28:12,956
Relationships.

345
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:19,316
For the first two,

346
00:28:19,606 --> 00:28:21,286
there's nothing I can do.

347
00:28:21,726 --> 00:28:22,906
Recycle.

348
00:28:23,556 --> 00:28:25,996
Stop using straws.
Don't use straws, okay?

349
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,756
And when I have money,

350
00:28:27,976 --> 00:28:29,656
donate. That's about it.

351
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,346
But with relationships,

352
00:28:32,676 --> 00:28:33,676
there's a lot

353
00:28:34,136 --> 00:28:35,726
that I can do

354
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,306
for that.

355
00:28:39,556 --> 00:28:40,386
Okay.

356
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,166
What kind of stand-in service
do you offer?

357
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:44,046
You're getting interested, right?

358
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:45,356
This is

359
00:28:45,526 --> 00:28:48,716
becoming family to
people without a family

360
00:28:49,076 --> 00:28:52,046
and being a friend to people
who have no friends.

361
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:53,966
It's like that.

362
00:28:54,536 --> 00:28:55,576
- Hey.
- Huh?

363
00:28:56,386 --> 00:28:57,246
Eat.

364
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:58,176
Okay.

365
00:28:59,076 --> 00:28:59,586
Woo-nam.

366
00:28:59,586 --> 00:29:03,506
You got married and divorced,
so you must know.

367
00:29:03,506 --> 00:29:04,376
Know what?

369

live normally like others?

Oh, no.

557
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,940

558
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,010

565

566
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,780
<i>Father,</i>

00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:17,250
<i>for over forty years' time,</i>

568
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:23,890

00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,370
<i>during that time of
not becoming anything,</i>

571
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,110
<i>I think I've disappeared somewhere.</i>

572
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,290
<i>I don't want to tell you what happened</i>

574

<i>Actually, I can't tell you.</i>

575
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,940
<i>Because, to be honest,</i>

576
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,040
<i>I'm not even sure what made me</i>

577
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:19,810
<i>like this.</i>

578
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,250
<i>She's not the baby mama.</i>

579
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:24,930
<i>Then who is she?</i>

580
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:27,420
<i>She's a woman I know.</i>

581
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:30,390
<i>We might die together.</i>

582
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:38,930
<i>If someone were to hear what it was,</i>

583
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,540
<i>they might get angry or sneer at me</i>

584

<i>That kind of small and common thing</i>

586
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,220
<i>happened to me, too.</i>

587
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:00,990
<i>It's not a great reason</i>

588
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:07,130
<i>that everyone would nod their heads to.</i>

589
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:10,930
<i>I'm sorry about that.</i>

590
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,170
<i>(I appreciate what you did that day.)</i>

591
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:23,280
<i>I couldn't save myself.</i>

592
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,950
<i>I couldn't protect myself.</i>

593
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:32,450

<i>(Last Unit)</i>

595
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:00,510
<i>Actually,</i>

596
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:03,520
<i>my job allows people</i>

597
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:07,560

<i>in a situation where you need someone,</i>

600
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,760
<i>please contact me.</i>

601
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:39,620
I thought

602
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:42,520
it was strange
she didn't give me a book.

603
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,330
I called the publishing house earlier

604
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:47,830
but I couldn't believe them.

605
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,670
Are you okay?

606
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:53,670
Huh?

607
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,000
Oh, yes.

608
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:58,310
She must have her reasons.

609
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,550
Nowadays, you can't fire someone easily.

610
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:06,350
So if you endure,

611
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:08,480
then things work out.

612
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,320
But she quit again.

613
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:16,320
Is it true that Bu-jeong quit?

614
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:17,890
Yes.

615
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,800
A few months ago,

616
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,800
she resigned out of the blue.

617
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,330
She has such a temper.

618
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,940
She's over forty.
She should know how to endure.

619
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:33,670
Then that's fine.

620
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,480
What's fine?

621
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:39,850
Chang-suk.

622
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:42,950
It's difficult for even
young people to get a job.

623
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,890
If she didn't hear

624
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:48,720
her superiors say, "Leave" or "Quit,"

625
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,320
then that's fine.

626
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,960
Since she was 19,

627
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,000
she worked at a part-time job.

628
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,500
She worked without rest
for over 20 years.

629
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,570
She should now rest.

630
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,240
I'm just

631
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,140
sorry toward Jeong-su.

632
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,680
I don't know what to say to him.

633
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,020
Right.

634
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:20,450
- Min-ja.
- Yes?

635
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,860
For now, don't tell Bu-jeong...

636
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:27,930
I can't say anything outright.

637
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,900
She'll hurl insults at me.

638
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:32,070
You don't know

639
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:34,470
how nasty she can be.

640
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,400
Right.

641
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:39,040
I'm sorry.

642
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:41,240
And I'm grateful.

643
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:46,480
How is your health?

644
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:49,150
Oh, well,

645
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,320
it gets better, then it gets worse.

646
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:01,560
Take one. You'll get an energy boost.

647
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:02,860
It's new.

648
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,370
It's okay. You take it.

649
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:07,600
I'll be going now.

650
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,770
Oh, dear.

651
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:37,600
<i>Lee Bu-jeong: If you're free tonight,</i>

652
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,500
<i>I'd like to book you.</i>

653
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:10,890
<i>(7 PM... Should I...)</i>

654
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:20,400
<i>(7 PM... Should I get a room at
a motel near the studio apartment?)</i>

655
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,030
<i>That's fine.</i>

656
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:59,310
You should sell products you know.

657
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:01,380
How can you sell something
you don't know?

658
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,780
Aren't I right?

659
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:07,410
It hasn't been long
since she was assigned here.

660
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:08,820
I'm sorry.

661
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:12,020
While you continue to shop,

662
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,690
please contact me if there
are any inconveniences.

663
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,220
I'll always help out.

664
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:19,960
Goodbye, ma'am.

665
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:59,970
<i>(Wife: I might be late tonight.)</i>

666
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:03,370
<i>(If it's too late,
I'll spend the night at Dad's.)</i>

667
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,320
What's gotten you all serious?

668
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:20,390
Oh, my wife

669
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:21,990
says she'll be a little late.

670
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:24,120
That's good news.

671
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,990
Right.

672
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:28,930
Give me one, too.

673
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:34,270
There's nothing like
gummy bears to relieve stress.

674
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:36,240
Right.

675
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,040
But is it

676
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,140
okay to not ask why she'll be late?

677
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:47,250
She works.

678
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:50,380
So she can be late sometimes.

679
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,320
Right?

680
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,360
Of course.

681
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:59,090
Wouldn't it be weirder
if you suddenly asked?

682
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,530
Right.

683
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,990
<i>When I become forty one day,</i>

684
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,000
<i>I'd have a high-rise apartment

685
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,430
<i>the entire city.</i>

686
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:17,340
<i>A smart wife who is
different from me in every way.</i>

687
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,170
<i>A kid who is clean and pure</i>

688
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:22,760
<i>like he just got out of the bath.</i>

689
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:29,680
<i>A restaurant in Gangnam to my name</i>

690

<i>When I become forty one day,</i>

692
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:54,980
<i>and I've failed to achieve

693
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,700
<i>And I still</i>

694
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:06,920
<i>must live like this,</i>

695
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,190
<i>like my mom and Father,</i>

<i>then</i>

<i>I might become someone

<i>(Last Unit:

<i>However,</i>

00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,030

<i>I don't understand at all.</i>

708
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:32,240
