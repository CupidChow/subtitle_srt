<i>(Episode 7: Broken Hallelujah)</i>

3
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:30,916
I went to 4 different hotels,
but they had none.

4
00:00:31,526 --> 00:00:33,426
It's not even Christmas.

5
00:00:34,756 --> 00:00:36,926
I can't believe this is
happening on a weekday.

6
00:00:36,926 --> 00:00:39,196
- See you tomorrow.
- Good job today.

7
00:00:39,766 --> 00:00:42,356
It's almost closing time.

8
00:00:42,356 --> 00:00:43,536
So did you buy one?

9
00:00:43,536 --> 00:00:46,636
I called you because I didn't.

10
00:00:46,636 --> 00:00:48,766
<i>If I did, I wouldn't have called</i>

11
00:00:49,576 --> 00:00:52,046
<i>someone who doesn't answer my texts.</i>

12
00:00:55,546 --> 00:00:57,016
What's it for?

13
00:00:57,446 --> 00:00:59,746
It's not for something.

14
00:00:59,746 --> 00:01:01,656
I think it's for show.

15
00:01:01,656 --> 00:01:02,816
<i>You think?</i>

16
00:01:02,816 --> 00:01:04,926
Yeah, you know.

17
00:01:05,076 --> 00:01:06,756
Adequately big.

18
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:09,356
Very fancy <i>but also very simple.</i>

19
00:01:09,456 --> 00:01:11,396
<i>Something that looks expensive.</i>

20
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:13,396
<i>You know my mom's taste.</i>

21
00:01:13,396 --> 00:01:16,036
<i>Something that has
a Cheongdam-dong vibe.</i>

22
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:22,236
Then you should've gone there,
why come here?

23
00:01:33,076 --> 00:01:34,516
Where are you now?

24
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,536
Aren't you hot?

25
00:01:50,696 --> 00:01:51,896
Well.

26
00:01:51,896 --> 00:01:53,666
I guess I am.

27
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:55,606
It's 15°C outside.

28
00:01:55,606 --> 00:01:57,176
Or 16°C.

29
00:01:58,346 --> 00:01:59,676
Is it?

30
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:03,116
Oh, are you going to Cheongdam-dong?

31
00:02:03,116 --> 00:02:03,946
Huh?

32
00:02:05,286 --> 00:02:06,646
No. Why?

33
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,086
No reason.

34
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:12,356
I was going to ask you
to give me a ride.

35
00:02:12,456 --> 00:02:13,626
But I guess you're not going.

36
00:02:14,496 --> 00:02:15,456
Right.

37
00:02:16,426 --> 00:02:17,696
I'm not.

38
00:02:24,906 --> 00:02:26,236
Then where are you going?

39
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:28,536
Me?

40
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:34,076
I'm going...

41
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,416
home.

42
00:02:36,546 --> 00:02:37,746
I'm going home.

43
00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:33,636
Right on time.

44
00:03:33,636 --> 00:03:34,406
Huh?

45
00:03:34,806 --> 00:03:35,606
Yeah.

46
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:37,536
Look at me.

47
00:03:39,646 --> 00:03:41,466
I look different, right?

48
00:03:42,076 --> 00:03:44,776
Beats me. I don't know.

49
00:03:45,086 --> 00:03:46,766
Did you cut your hair?

50
00:03:48,586 --> 00:03:49,856
You can't tell?

51
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:52,326
No.

52
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:56,156
I got some work done on my eye wrinkles.

53
00:03:56,496 --> 00:03:57,696
Some work?

54
00:03:59,626 --> 00:04:00,626
Yeah.

55
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,836
It hurts.

56
00:04:03,596 --> 00:04:05,636
After it hurts, you become pretty.

57
00:04:40,076 --> 00:04:42,476

58
00:04:42,476 --> 00:04:45,206
<i>(Min-jeong)</i>

59
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:24,746
Open your eyes.

60
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:26,566
I saw you closing them.

61
00:05:30,856 --> 00:05:32,756
Jeez.

62
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:35,526
You're a lightweight.
Why did you drink so much?

63
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:37,596
No wonder you got sick.

64
00:05:41,936 --> 00:05:43,996
I was super drunk, right?

65
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:46,606
I don't remember.

66
00:05:48,036 --> 00:05:49,906
Gang-jae carried you home.

67
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:51,876
I thought you were okay.

68
00:05:51,876 --> 00:05:54,616
But the moment
you came here, you vomited.

69
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:58,146
I did laundry twice during the night.

70
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:00,446
Sorry.

71
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:02,186
I'm so sorry.

72
00:06:03,956 --> 00:06:05,426
I made some dried pollack soup.

73
00:06:05,426 --> 00:06:07,256
Eat up and do the dishes.

74
00:06:07,756 --> 00:06:08,656
Okay.

75
00:06:09,126 --> 00:06:10,396
Are you going to work now?

76
00:06:10,596 --> 00:06:11,596
Yeah.

77
00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:16,996
Oh, right.

78
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:21,006
Come pick me up at about
11:30 at the pharmacy.

79
00:06:22,136 --> 00:06:23,726
What about Woo-nam?

80
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:28,516
Woo-nam is...

81
00:06:28,616 --> 00:06:29,736
Is he working?

82
00:06:31,946 --> 00:06:33,586
No, that's not it...

83
00:06:37,956 --> 00:06:39,756
I don't know when he'll be back.

84
00:06:39,756 --> 00:06:41,396
So come pick me up, okay?

85
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,026
Okay.

86
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:45,566
Bye.

87
00:06:45,826 --> 00:06:46,926
Oh.

88
00:06:47,196 --> 00:06:48,876
What Gang-jae does...

89
00:06:48,996 --> 00:06:51,196
You're not doing that, too, are you?

90
00:06:52,806 --> 00:06:54,736
What Gang-jae does? What's that?

91
00:06:58,106 --> 00:06:59,576
Oh.

92
00:07:00,506 --> 00:07:01,546
Don't worry.

93
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,476
I'm not qualified to do it.

94
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:05,866
That's a relief.

95
00:07:09,086 --> 00:07:10,086
Wait.

96
00:07:10,086 --> 00:07:12,186
Come to think of it, that's upsetting.

97
00:07:12,186 --> 00:07:14,026
What's wrong with you?

98
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:17,256
Gang-jae has nothing on you.

99
00:07:17,496 --> 00:07:19,766
I'm just saying.

100
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:22,366
- You're just saying, right?
- Right.

101
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:24,936
You're the one who rejected them.

102
00:07:24,936 --> 00:07:26,006
Got that?

103
00:07:26,006 --> 00:07:27,236
Got it. I rejected them.

104
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:28,936
Get to work.

105
00:07:28,936 --> 00:07:30,906
Ridiculous.

106
00:08:19,826 --> 00:08:20,826
<i>Oh, hi.</i>

107
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:24,656
<i>You remember Min-jeong, right?</i>

108
00:08:24,896 --> 00:08:26,566
<i>I took her there a few times.</i>

109
00:08:27,226 --> 00:08:28,166
<i>Right.</i>

110
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,096
<i>The really mean one</i>

111
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:31,966
<i>who looks a bit sad.</i>

112
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:33,666
<i>Right, right.</i>

113
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:36,736
<i>We were talking on the phone</i>

114
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:38,576
<i>when she got cut off.</i>

115
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:41,546
<i>I called again but she's not picking up.</i>

116
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:45,916
<i>It's probably nothing.</i>

117
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:48,916
<i>But still.</i>

118
00:08:50,016 --> 00:08:52,026
<i>You know how</i>

119
00:08:52,026 --> 00:08:53,356
<i>the mind wonders.</i>

120
00:08:53,586 --> 00:08:54,856
<i>You never know.</i>

121
00:08:55,396 --> 00:08:58,326
<i>I heard she's working near your store.</i>

122
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:01,836
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>

123
00:09:02,296 --> 00:09:04,536
<i>I heard she was with some older men.</i>

124
00:09:04,906 --> 00:09:07,336
<i>If she comes to your store,
please call me.</i>

125
00:09:07,336 --> 00:09:10,506
<i>I'm circling this area in a cab.</i>

126
00:09:13,276 --> 00:09:14,506
<i>You think I'm crazy?</i>

127
00:09:14,506 --> 00:09:16,846
<i>Why would I date her? I'm not insane.</i>

128
00:09:18,716 --> 00:09:19,716
<i>Right.</i>

129
00:09:19,716 --> 00:09:21,546
<i>Okay, please give me a call.</i>

130
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:22,486
<i>Bye.</i>

131
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:27,056
<i>He'll call me.</i>

132
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:29,826
<i>Or we'll run into her.</i>

133
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:32,156
<i>Okay.</i>

134
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:36,066
<i>Why are you calm all of a sudden?</i>

135
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:37,466
<i>A moment ago,</i>

136
00:09:37,636 --> 00:09:39,406
<i>you made a fuss like
something bad happened.</i>

137
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:42,176
<i>You made me worry, too.</i>

138
00:09:43,936 --> 00:09:45,706
<i>Seeing all these people,</i>

139
00:09:47,976 --> 00:09:49,116
<i>it hit me.</i>

140
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:51,716
<i>Everyone is</i>

141

<i>enjoying themselves.</i>

142
00:09:54,116 --> 00:09:55,186
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

143
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:58,056
<i>I think she's enjoying
herself somewhere.</i>

144
00:09:58,756 --> 00:10:01,456
<i>That's what I said a million times.</i>

145
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:03,656
<i>That she's probably
enjoying herself somewhere.</i>

146
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:06,366
<i>You...</i>

147
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:08,266
<i>You suddenly develop a drinking habit?</i>

148
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:10,666
<i>Is that funny?</i>

149
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:14,036
<i>I'm being played by
your drinking habit, right?</i>

150
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:16,576
<i>Oh, man.</i>

151
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:18,306
<i>You can't even hold your liquor</i>

152
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:20,276
<i>yet you drank a whole 2-liter bottle.</i>

153
00:10:20,856 --> 00:10:23,446
<i>You should've bought a few pretty cans</i>

154
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:24,966
<i>and drank modestly.</i>

155
00:10:25,846 --> 00:10:27,046
<i>The bottle's cheaper.</i>

156
00:10:27,046 --> 00:10:29,256

00:13:12,846 --> 00:13:14,416
<i>We found her.</i>

187
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:17,756
<i>Where?</i>

188
00:13:19,086 --> 00:13:20,056
<i>Oh, well.</i>

189
00:13:20,056 --> 00:13:21,156
<i>At the crossroads.</i>

190
00:13:23,126 --> 00:13:25,596
<i>She has a weird headband on.</i>

191
00:13:26,496 --> 00:13:28,166
<i>Seriously.</i>

192
00:13:28,536 --> 00:13:29,736
<i>That's a relief.</i>

193
00:13:29,736 --> 00:13:30,866
<i>A relief...</i>

194
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,266
<i>Can you go faster, sir?</i>

195
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:35,606
<i>Jeez.</i>

196
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,046
<i>Sorry, sir.</i>

197
00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:44,076
<i>That's a relief.</i>

198
00:13:45,016 --> 00:13:46,286
<i>That's a relief.</i>

199
00:13:46,946 --> 00:13:48,556
<i>Yeah. It's such a relief.</i>

200
00:13:48,556 --> 00:13:49,786
<i>Smile.</i>

201
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:51,316
<i>One, two, three.</i>

202
00:13:53,086 --> 00:13:54,686
<i>One, two, three.</i>

203
00:13:55,896 --> 00:13:57,556
<i>One, two, three.</i>

204
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:40,196
<i>(Just has invited you to the chatroom)</i>

205
00:14:42,536 --> 00:14:43,606
<i>(Sound)</i>

206
00:17:00,346 --> 00:17:02,246
I was thirsty.

207
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:06,816
But it's past its expiration date.

208
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:08,386
If it's the 10th...

209
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:12,726
It's over a week old. I hope it's okay.

210
00:17:18,596 --> 00:17:20,566
You know you can sit.

211
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:59,036
You shouldn't drink it...

212
00:18:00,306 --> 00:18:02,436
I don't think you should drink it.

213
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:04,336
Because it's tomato juice.

214
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:10,716
Oh, because it's tomato juice.

215
00:18:14,646 --> 00:18:16,786
I guess tomato goes bad easily.

216
00:18:17,786 --> 00:18:19,556
Not that.

217
00:18:21,386 --> 00:18:24,296
It's hard to tell
if it's gone bad or not.

218
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:27,896
I'm not sure,

219
00:18:28,836 --> 00:18:31,096
but the taste is sour anyway.

220
00:18:36,936 --> 00:18:38,336
Because it's sour...

221
00:18:46,986 --> 00:18:48,786
You can have this.

222
00:18:51,056 --> 00:18:52,786
Since you said you're thirsty.

223
00:19:27,026 --> 00:19:28,326
So, this...

224
00:19:28,326 --> 00:19:29,756
is that tangerine.

225
00:19:30,156 --> 00:19:31,556
From earlier.

226
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:39,336
You only have one?

227
00:19:53,386 --> 00:19:54,786
How many do you have?

228
00:19:55,146 --> 00:19:57,456
One more. I have one more.

229
00:20:20,106 --> 00:20:21,176
What?

230
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,516
Nothing.

231
00:20:30,116 --> 00:20:31,016
Well.

232
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,386
Tangerines are sour, too.

233
00:20:35,456 --> 00:20:36,396
But

234
00:20:38,796 --> 00:20:40,796
this is too sour.

235
00:20:55,206 --> 00:20:56,566
What about yours?

236
00:21:00,116 --> 00:21:01,246
It's sweet.

237
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:53,466
What did you want to do with me?

238
00:21:59,746 --> 00:22:01,346
What do you want to do?

239
00:22:12,686 --> 00:22:15,026
I just wanted to sit.

240
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,496
In a place that wasn't home.

241
00:22:37,516 --> 00:22:39,086
<i>Sitting in a place that's not home</i>

242
00:22:39,086 --> 00:22:41,316
<i>with someone who isn't family,</i>

243
00:22:54,226 --> 00:22:56,936
<i>doing nothing, just being still.</i>

244
00:22:56,936 --> 00:22:58,566
<i>I sometimes want to do that.</i>

245
00:23:09,476 --> 00:23:10,276
It's 3,000 won.

246
00:23:10,276 --> 00:23:11,516
- Okay.
- Here.

247
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:13,366
- Good job.
- Thanks.

248
00:23:23,096 --> 00:23:25,056
<i>I don't have to say anything.</i>

249
00:23:29,466 --> 00:23:31,566
<i>I don't have to think anything.</i>

250
00:23:37,006 --> 00:23:39,106
<i>I don't have to worry.</i>

251
00:24:05,766 --> 00:24:06,766
<i>With</i>

252
00:24:07,136 --> 00:24:10,436
<i>someone who you
have no expectations for.</i>

253
00:24:30,526 --> 00:24:32,900
<i>(Seoul, Korea - 7:51 PM)
(Ottawa, Canada - 5:51 AM)</i>

254
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:35,936
<i>I want to be with someone like that.</i>

255
00:24:41,036 --> 00:24:43,076
<i>I want to be still.</i>

256
00:25:09,566 --> 00:25:11,466
<i>(Mrs. Jeong: Almost there.
See you at the back door.)</i>

257
00:25:55,046 --> 00:25:56,876
<i>(Where are you?)</i>

258
00:25:57,976 --> 00:26:00,516
<i>I want to do nothing</i>

259
00:26:02,246 --> 00:26:04,956
<i>and just lie down.</i>

260
00:26:12,126 --> 00:26:13,296
Want to lie down?

261
00:26:15,296 --> 00:26:16,296
Lie down.

262
00:26:16,736 --> 00:26:18,296
You said you wanted to lie down.

263
00:26:20,206 --> 00:26:21,666
Doing nothing.

264
00:26:22,906 --> 00:26:23,936
Together.

265
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,286
This is the first time I'm saying this,

266
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:41,226
but listening to you,
I was reminded of something.

267
00:26:43,196 --> 00:26:45,096
I was the exact opposite.

268
00:26:45,556 --> 00:26:46,556
But

269
00:26:47,696 --> 00:26:50,166
I think, in the end,
it's the same thing.

270
00:26:57,706 --> 00:26:58,706
I

271
00:27:00,006 --> 00:27:02,676
wanted to go home even when I was home.

272
00:27:08,216 --> 00:27:10,256
When I was very young,

273
00:27:12,156 --> 00:27:15,126
if I lay still in my room

274
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,626
at home when the sun was setting,

275
00:27:20,566 --> 00:27:21,896
strangely,

276
00:27:23,736 --> 00:27:26,236
a stream would trickle to my heart.

277
00:27:27,906 --> 00:27:28,906
Then,

278
00:27:29,236 --> 00:27:31,436
even when I just ate,

279
00:27:31,736 --> 00:27:34,506
I'd strangely feel hungry.

280
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:37,746
Even if I was with my family

281
00:27:38,716 --> 00:27:39,756
and my mom...

282
00:27:42,216 --> 00:27:44,516
I was clearly with my mom,

283
00:27:46,326 --> 00:27:49,356
but I'd miss her so much
I couldn't stand it.

284
00:27:55,396 --> 00:27:57,266
But I was already home,

285
00:27:57,996 --> 00:27:59,766
so I couldn't go home.

286
00:28:00,036 --> 00:28:01,936
And I was with my mom,

287
00:28:01,936 --> 00:28:04,076
so I couldn't go see her.

288
00:28:04,506 --> 00:28:06,236
I thought I was going mad.

289
00:28:06,406 --> 00:28:08,806
There was nothing I could do.

290
00:28:11,546 --> 00:28:14,016
But listening to you,

291
00:28:16,116 --> 00:28:18,386
I think that

292
00:28:19,086 --> 00:28:20,726
that was this.

293
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:30,796
Lying still

294
00:28:31,796 --> 00:28:33,806
with someone

295
00:28:37,236 --> 00:28:39,106
and doing nothing.

296
00:28:40,006 --> 00:28:41,106
Together.

297
00:30:23,546 --> 00:30:24,576
So...

298
00:30:27,186 --> 00:30:28,986
why the tangerine?

299
00:30:30,216 --> 00:30:32,456
Why three when your bag is so small?

300
00:30:35,356 --> 00:30:37,296
I don't want to talk about it.

301
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:44,296
Okay.

302
00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:46,136
I'll be quiet.

303
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:01,046
It's been so long.

304
00:31:03,856 --> 00:31:06,626
It's been so long
since I had an engagement

305
00:31:09,156 --> 00:31:11,726
that I didn't know what to bring.

306
00:31:12,526 --> 00:31:13,826
So I just brought them.

307
00:31:13,826 --> 00:31:15,426
They were on the table.

308
00:31:16,596 --> 00:31:19,066
This is like a picnic to you then.

309
00:31:19,736 --> 00:31:21,736
Not a picnic.

310
00:31:25,036 --> 00:31:26,176
I just

311
00:31:27,076 --> 00:31:29,576
felt like disappearing.

312
00:31:34,086 --> 00:31:37,456
Sometimes, I hate myself so much

313
00:31:39,056 --> 00:31:42,286
that I wish I could just disappear.

314
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,396
The sun went down.

315
00:31:52,906 --> 00:31:56,306
I was hungry,
but I didn't want to do anything.

316
00:31:59,176 --> 00:32:01,306
And that thought occurred to me.

317
00:32:05,576 --> 00:32:06,746
I want

318
00:32:08,786 --> 00:32:11,916
to die like I'm floating away somewhere.

319
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:24,596
But on my way here,

320
00:32:26,036 --> 00:32:27,606
I felt good.

321
00:32:31,976 --> 00:32:35,076
I thought, 'Why did I bring tangerines?'

322
00:32:36,646 --> 00:32:38,446
But the tangerine was sweet.

323
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:45,886
I thought,
'Why did I wear ill-fitting shoes?'

324
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:50,626
But it felt great taking them off.

325
00:32:51,496 --> 00:32:53,626
The bathroom was large.

326
00:32:55,066 --> 00:32:56,796
I was sitting,

327
00:32:58,166 --> 00:32:59,766
and now I'm lying down.

328
00:33:03,706 --> 00:33:05,806
I also want to go home.

329
00:33:07,646 --> 00:33:09,746
I want to see my dad.

330
00:33:13,716 --> 00:33:15,446
I think I know

331
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:19,926
what you mean about a stream

332
00:33:22,356 --> 00:33:24,656
trickling from your heart.

333
00:33:27,796 --> 00:33:29,666
Although I can't explain it.

334
00:33:40,606 --> 00:33:41,726
If, by chance,

335
00:33:42,806 --> 00:33:44,576
we meet again coincidentally,

336
00:33:45,206 --> 00:33:47,516
but not like today,

337
00:33:50,516 --> 00:33:52,416
do you want to die with me?

338
00:34:13,746 --> 00:34:15,446
Did you just scoff at me?

339
00:34:18,246 --> 00:34:19,416
No.

340
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:30,226
I'll lie here for just 30 minutes.

341
00:34:32,726 --> 00:34:34,566
If I fall asleep,

342
00:34:36,466 --> 00:34:37,896
you can leave.

343
00:35:12,466 --> 00:35:15,466
<i>(Woo-nam)</i>

344
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:23,746
Hello.

345
00:35:24,016 --> 00:35:26,116
Give me that, please.

346
00:35:26,846 --> 00:35:27,846
Oh, that.

347
00:35:27,846 --> 00:35:29,016
Yes, that.

348
00:35:32,586 --> 00:35:34,156
Here you go.

349
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:38,926
You were like this last time.

350
00:35:38,926 --> 00:35:40,226
Drink slowly.

351
00:35:40,226 --> 00:35:43,096
You might get sick drinking a digestive.

352
00:35:45,336 --> 00:35:48,866
You're the only one who cares about me.

353
00:35:51,706 --> 00:35:54,306
Did something bad happen?

354
00:35:55,976 --> 00:35:57,376
You know that story?

355
00:35:57,616 --> 00:35:58,896
A long time ago,

356
00:35:59,076 --> 00:36:00,746
the king's ears got so big...

357
00:36:00,746 --> 00:36:02,216
Yes.

358
00:36:02,216 --> 00:36:03,956
"The King with Donkey Ears."

359
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:05,456
Yes, that one.

360
00:36:05,686 --> 00:36:08,326
I'm those donkey ears right now.

361
00:36:08,486 --> 00:36:09,486
Why?

362
00:36:10,856 --> 00:36:12,096
Can I trust you?

363
00:36:12,096 --> 00:36:14,066
To not tell anyone?

364
00:36:14,066 --> 00:36:15,126
Come on.

365
00:36:15,296 --> 00:36:16,296
What is it?

366
00:36:20,606 --> 00:36:21,836
Well.

367
00:36:22,136 --> 00:36:23,876
You know my daughter-in-law?

368
00:36:24,006 --> 00:36:25,336
Your daughter-in-law?

369
00:36:25,336 --> 00:36:28,206
Oh, earlier during the day...

370
00:36:29,406 --> 00:36:30,646
During the day?

371
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:33,286
Oh, no. Forget it.

372
00:36:33,286 --> 00:36:35,086
I got confused.

373
00:36:35,246 --> 00:36:36,786
So what about her?

374
00:36:37,786 --> 00:36:40,386
Do you have soju?

375
00:36:40,586 --> 00:36:41,526
Soju?

376
00:36:41,526 --> 00:36:42,526
Yeah.

377
00:36:44,656 --> 00:36:45,696
Oh, dear.

378
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,196
I don't have soju.

379
00:36:48,226 --> 00:36:49,326
Oh, no.

380
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,836
I'm here for some medicine for Julie.

381
00:36:51,836 --> 00:36:52,996
Hi, Julie.

382
00:36:52,996 --> 00:36:54,676
- Eye drops?
- Yes.

383
00:36:55,236 --> 00:36:58,276
Oh! There you are!

384
00:36:58,476 --> 00:37:00,776
Oh, hi, Julie!

385
00:37:00,776 --> 00:37:02,546
You should go to the vet.

386
00:37:02,546 --> 00:37:04,776
Why come to a human
drugstore for eye drops?

387
00:37:04,776 --> 00:37:07,586
What if something happens to you?

388
00:37:07,586 --> 00:37:09,546
Eye drops are all the same.

389
00:37:09,546 --> 00:37:10,256
Right?

390
00:37:10,256 --> 00:37:11,086
Of course.

391
00:37:11,086 --> 00:37:13,056
But Julie is a grandma.

392
00:37:13,056 --> 00:37:14,526
Right, Julie?

393
00:37:16,956 --> 00:37:18,126
Oh, wait.

394
00:37:18,496 --> 00:37:19,156
Is this soju?

395
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:21,136
Oh, why? Why? Why? Why?

396
00:37:21,266 --> 00:37:23,026
Why? Why? Why?

397
00:37:23,026 --> 00:37:23,996
Sell one bottle to me.

398
00:37:23,996 --> 00:37:25,766
No, no.

399
00:37:25,766 --> 00:37:27,536
My sister and I must drink
2 bottles each to sleep.

400
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,936
- Give that to me.
- <i>(Woo-nam: I can't come home tonight.)</i>

401
00:37:28,936 --> 00:37:31,276
- You're an alcoholic. Why drink two bottles?
- <i>(Woo-nam: Ji-yeon is sick. Call you later.)</i>

402
00:37:31,276 --> 00:37:33,506
- Sell me one bottle.
- Give it here. I can't sell it.

403
00:37:33,506 --> 00:37:34,576
I'll give you money.

404
00:37:34,576 --> 00:37:37,276
No. It's hard enough carrying her home.

405
00:37:37,276 --> 00:37:38,246
Give it here.

406
00:37:38,246 --> 00:37:38,846
Just give it to me.

407
00:37:38,846 --> 00:37:39,716
Seriously.

408
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:40,946
Come on. Give it to me.

409
00:37:40,946 --> 00:37:42,146
I'll pay you.

410
00:37:42,146 --> 00:37:43,916
Give me double.

411
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:45,816
Here you go.

412
00:37:48,386 --> 00:37:50,596
So then, how many glasses

413
00:37:50,796 --> 00:37:51,996
should I bring out?

414
00:37:51,996 --> 00:37:54,396
I'm leaving. Just bring out two.

415
00:37:54,596 --> 00:37:56,186
I'll pay you later. Thank you!

416
00:37:56,186 --> 00:37:57,836
Two, two.

417
00:38:00,366 --> 00:38:03,606
It's the same this year
as well as last year.

418
00:38:03,606 --> 00:38:04,636
What is?

419
00:38:07,206 --> 00:38:08,706
That jacket.

420
00:38:09,906 --> 00:38:12,376
From when it's a bit warm

421
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:14,486
until it's a bit cold,

422
00:38:14,686 --> 00:38:16,546
you wear that all winter.

423
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:17,856
Do you like it?

424
00:38:19,386 --> 00:38:21,556
Winter clothes are all the same.

425
00:38:21,556 --> 00:38:23,596
It has nothing to do
with liking it or not.

426
00:38:23,726 --> 00:38:26,056
Who wears different
jackets all the time?

427
00:38:26,556 --> 00:38:30,296
People like you who like
to dress up, maybe.

428
00:38:30,296 --> 00:38:31,596
Not me!

429
00:38:31,596 --> 00:38:33,836
You can't say you don't.

430
00:38:33,836 --> 00:38:35,436
Just admit it.

431
00:38:35,436 --> 00:38:38,236
Compared to kids these days, I'm normal.

432
00:38:38,436 --> 00:38:39,276
Hey.

433
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:42,376
You remind me of my mom's rich friends.

434
00:38:42,376 --> 00:38:45,546
You're being unreasonable.

435
00:38:46,316 --> 00:38:48,186
I guess I looked pretty today, right?

436
00:38:48,186 --> 00:38:49,846
Think however you like.

437
00:38:57,196 --> 00:38:58,996
Did your wife buy you that?

438
00:39:02,196 --> 00:39:03,766
She did, huh?

439
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:08,936
Father bought it for me.

440
00:39:10,706 --> 00:39:12,066
My father-in-law.

441
00:39:19,746 --> 00:39:22,696
You wore clothes
your father-in-law bought you

442
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:25,456
whenever you met me?

443
00:39:29,086 --> 00:39:30,096
You've nothing to say, right?

444
00:39:30,096 --> 00:39:31,626
You feel like trash.

445
00:39:34,096 --> 00:39:35,216
Why are you scoffing?

446
00:39:36,736 --> 00:39:37,936
Because

447
00:39:38,196 --> 00:39:40,206
you're being ridiculous.

448
00:39:47,406 --> 00:39:49,146
It's actually great.

449
00:39:51,546 --> 00:39:53,446
If you married me,

450
00:39:54,516 --> 00:39:57,786
my mother might have killed you by now.

451
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:01,426
But you get a warm jacket

452
00:40:01,426 --> 00:40:02,786
and get loved.

453
00:40:03,356 --> 00:40:05,296
How can you say

454
00:40:05,896 --> 00:40:08,626
such an awful thing like it's nothing?

455
00:40:09,596 --> 00:40:12,336
You used to get beaten up by my mom.

456
00:40:13,296 --> 00:40:14,666
You were dragged by your hair

457
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:16,206
and slapped in the face.

458
00:40:16,506 --> 00:40:19,476
It was you who got beaten, not me.

459
00:40:21,006 --> 00:40:22,306
It was?

460
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:26,746
I got beaten?

461
00:40:35,026 --> 00:40:36,856
It must've been upsetting for you.

462
00:40:41,196 --> 00:40:43,696
My mom thinks I'm still rich.

463
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:47,536
She'd know if she just thought a little.

464
00:40:48,666 --> 00:40:50,406
He wasn't from a conglomerate.

465
00:40:51,276 --> 00:40:53,006
He ran a small business.

466
00:40:53,006 --> 00:40:56,246
If the CEO collapses, the company falls.

467
00:40:57,816 --> 00:40:59,746
How can she not know that?

468
00:41:09,756 --> 00:41:11,426
Are you the only one that knows?

469
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:16,566
Huh?

470
00:41:19,196 --> 00:41:20,306
I don't know.

471
00:41:44,396 --> 00:41:45,796
Pick up.

472
00:41:46,326 --> 00:41:47,566
Pick up. Pick up.

473
00:41:47,566 --> 00:41:49,266
Huh? You picked up.

474
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:51,636
I thought you weren't going to pick up.

475
00:41:51,636 --> 00:41:54,036
<i>My phone</i> was ringing, so...

476
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:56,166
<i>I'm glad you picked up.</i>

477
00:41:56,336 --> 00:41:59,776
I hate people who ignore you
after they sober up.

478
00:42:00,246 --> 00:42:01,376
But

479
00:42:01,806 --> 00:42:03,876
I'm glad you're not

480
00:42:03,876 --> 00:42:05,146
<i>that kind of person.</i>

481
00:42:05,446 --> 00:42:06,946
Oh, right.

482
00:42:13,016 --> 00:42:14,356
Where are you?

483
00:42:14,356 --> 00:42:15,556
Outside?

484
00:42:19,126 --> 00:42:21,296
I'm at the gym above the PC room.

485
00:42:21,726 --> 00:42:24,536
I work here part time
for two hours every day.

486
00:42:24,536 --> 00:42:26,766
What kind of work?

487
00:42:29,306 --> 00:42:30,706
I heighten the standard here.

488
00:42:31,206 --> 00:42:33,336
Oh, the standard.

489
00:42:33,606 --> 00:42:34,906
I'm done now.

490
00:42:35,546 --> 00:42:37,646
I'm going to wash up and go back down.

491
00:42:39,246 --> 00:42:40,316
You know,

492
00:42:40,586 --> 00:42:42,616
the locker is my closet.

493
00:42:42,616 --> 00:42:45,216
<i>I'm using four right now.</i>

494
00:42:45,586 --> 00:42:47,456
<i>I might get to use one more.</i>

495
00:42:48,356 --> 00:42:49,786
I see.

496
00:42:52,156 --> 00:42:53,156
Oh, right.

497
00:42:53,326 --> 00:42:54,966
I heard you were sick.

498
00:42:55,066 --> 00:42:56,266
Is it bad?

499
00:42:56,266 --> 00:42:56,966
What?

500
00:42:57,596 --> 00:42:59,766
The other part-timer
said you couldn't come

501
00:42:59,766 --> 00:43:02,036
since you were sick. <i>He was annoyed.</i>

502
00:43:02,036 --> 00:43:03,206
Oh.

503
00:43:04,836 --> 00:43:07,276
I'm not sick. <i>Just exhausted.</i>

504
00:43:07,276 --> 00:43:08,276
Bye.

505
00:43:08,466 --> 00:43:09,676
Two hours.

506
00:43:10,276 --> 00:43:13,046
Oh, I know what that feels like.

507
00:43:13,046 --> 00:43:15,346
Being <i>out of energy.</i>

508
00:43:16,516 --> 00:43:18,516
Oh, you do?

509
00:43:19,686 --> 00:43:23,326
<i>I heard your name</i> wasn't Just,
but Soon-ju.

510
00:43:23,326 --> 00:43:24,556
Lee Soon-ju.

511
00:43:24,556 --> 00:43:25,656
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

512
00:43:25,656 --> 00:43:27,026
That's so cute.

513
00:43:29,926 --> 00:43:31,066
Well,

514
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,346
<i>I thought "Just"</i>

515
00:43:32,496 --> 00:43:34,006
<i>wasn't a person's name,</i>

516
00:43:34,006 --> 00:43:35,906
<i>but a dog's name or something.</i>

517
00:43:40,236 --> 00:43:43,846
Then I'll call you Soon-ju from now on.

518
00:43:44,546 --> 00:43:46,946
Oh, okay.

519
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,716
Soon-ju.

520
00:43:52,386 --> 00:43:53,256
Yes?

521
00:43:54,086 --> 00:43:55,356
Soon-ju.

522
00:43:58,496 --> 00:43:59,426
Yes?

523
00:44:00,026 --> 00:44:02,296
<i>Have you talked to Gang-jae today?</i>

524
00:44:06,336 --> 00:44:07,836
Ga... Gang-jae?

525
00:44:07,836 --> 00:44:08,836
Yes.

526
00:44:08,836 --> 00:44:11,606
I can't reach him all day.
Did he go somewhere?

527
00:44:13,436 --> 00:44:14,576
Oh.

528
00:44:15,546 --> 00:44:17,616
Umm, I don't know...

529
00:44:19,716 --> 00:44:22,486
<i>I invited him</i> to a chatroom,
but he didn't reply.

530
00:44:23,016 --> 00:44:24,416
<i>What could he be doing?</i>

531
00:44:27,986 --> 00:44:30,856
What if he's doing
something bad, Soon-ju?

532
00:44:32,296 --> 00:44:34,126
He could be.

533
00:44:34,266 --> 00:44:35,296
Right?

534
00:44:35,626 --> 00:44:37,396
I knew that you, Just...

535
00:44:37,396 --> 00:44:38,396
I mean,

536
00:44:38,536 --> 00:44:41,036
Soon-ju you and I are
<i>on the same wavelength.</i>

537
00:44:44,936 --> 00:44:47,706
<i>If you get ahold of him, let me know.</i>

538
00:44:54,416 --> 00:44:55,486
<i>Hello?</i>

539
00:44:56,216 --> 00:44:57,456
Soon-ju?

540
00:44:57,856 --> 00:44:59,016
Soon-ju?

541
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:01,326
Oh, yes.

542
00:45:01,556 --> 00:45:02,626
Okay.

543
00:47:04,686 --> 00:47:08,396
<i>(Call me.)</i>

544
00:47:15,806 --> 00:47:22,616
<i>(Did you meet her?)</i>

545
00:47:52,616 --> 00:47:56,466
<i>(Did you meet her?)</i>

546
00:49:49,276 --> 00:49:50,246
<i>Hello, Father?</i>

547
00:49:50,246 --> 00:49:51,716
<i>Did you go out?</i>

548
00:49:52,746 --> 00:49:53,716
<i>Hello?</i>

549
00:49:54,246 --> 00:49:55,586
<i>Can you not hear me?</i>

550
00:49:55,586 --> 00:49:57,086
I can hear you.

551
00:49:57,756 --> 00:50:01,026
I just got <i>confused on my way home.</i>

552
00:50:01,226 --> 00:50:03,186
You got lost?

553
00:50:03,686 --> 00:50:05,426
Where are you now?

554
00:50:05,426 --> 00:50:07,596
<i>Oh, I'm not lost now.</i>

555
00:50:07,766 --> 00:50:09,366
I'm in the neighborhood.

556
00:50:09,366 --> 00:50:11,366
I know <i>this place.</i>

557
00:50:11,366 --> 00:50:14,236
<i>I forgot earlier</i>

558
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:16,136
<i>for a bit.</i>

559
00:50:16,136 --> 00:50:18,336
<i>But I'm fine now.</i>

560
00:50:18,706 --> 00:50:22,176
I'm in front of your place.

561
00:50:22,346 --> 00:50:24,446
Do you know where you are?

562
00:50:24,446 --> 00:50:27,316
I'm out of the underground pathway

563
00:50:28,186 --> 00:50:30,186
and in that alley.

564
00:50:30,316 --> 00:50:32,816
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

565
00:50:32,816 --> 00:50:35,086
<i>It's cold. Don't come here.</i>

566
00:50:35,086 --> 00:50:36,556
<i>I'll be there soon.</i>

567
00:50:36,556 --> 00:50:38,056
Get inside.

568
00:50:38,226 --> 00:50:40,296
I'll tell you my password.

569
00:50:40,296 --> 00:50:41,896
Hold on.

570
00:50:42,966 --> 00:50:45,766
<i>Father, I'm in the elevator.</i>

571
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:01,546
<i>Jeong-su, just stay there.</i>

572
00:51:01,546 --> 00:51:03,186
I found the password.

573
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:04,616
The password is...

574
00:51:04,616 --> 00:51:06,356
Father, I'm already downstairs.

575
00:51:06,356 --> 00:51:07,186
I'll be right there.

576
00:51:07,186 --> 00:51:09,186
Don't move and stay right there.

577
00:51:17,266 --> 00:51:18,266
Oh, dear.

578
00:51:20,366 --> 00:51:21,606
Both of them

579
00:51:21,906 --> 00:51:23,366
are so stubborn.

580
00:51:24,066 --> 00:51:26,076
It's cold. Why come out?

581
00:51:26,176 --> 00:51:27,236
It's cold.

582
00:51:52,036 --> 00:51:53,266
Father!

583
00:51:56,366 --> 00:51:57,406
Are you alright?

584
00:51:59,836 --> 00:52:01,376
I told you not to come.

585
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:04,976
The two of you are so stubborn.

586
00:52:05,516 --> 00:52:06,516
So...

587
00:52:06,716 --> 00:52:07,986
where is Bu-jeong?

588
00:52:07,986 --> 00:52:09,116
I came alone.

589
00:52:09,116 --> 00:52:11,956
She'll be late because
she has a lot of work.

590
00:52:12,656 --> 00:52:14,126
Work?

591
00:52:14,626 --> 00:52:17,056
They're busy because of the new book.

592
00:52:21,296 --> 00:52:22,166
Did you have dinner?

593
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:23,896
Yes, I grabbed something light at work.

594
00:52:23,896 --> 00:52:26,236
Really? That's good.

595
00:52:26,236 --> 00:52:27,766
You'll come up?

596
00:52:27,906 --> 00:52:29,666
I have to go.

597
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:31,706
I stopped by on my way home.

598
00:52:31,836 --> 00:52:33,636
To give you this.

599
00:52:34,006 --> 00:52:35,246
Go on, Father. I'll pull this.

600
00:52:35,246 --> 00:52:35,846
It's okay.

601
00:52:35,846 --> 00:52:36,646
No, just go.

602
00:52:36,646 --> 00:52:37,446
It's okay. It's okay.

603
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:38,446
Go on ahead.

604
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:40,076
Is this for me?

605
00:52:41,236 --> 00:52:41,756
You know,

606
00:52:41,786 --> 00:52:43,916
I had cake a few days ago.

607
00:52:44,556 --> 00:52:46,816
The one Bu-jeong got as a gift.

608
00:52:48,286 --> 00:52:50,086
- I heard you ate it, too.
- Huh?

609
00:52:50,386 --> 00:52:51,426
Right.

610
00:52:51,896 --> 00:52:53,556
Why did you buy this?

611
00:52:53,826 --> 00:52:56,326
I only need to eat cake
once or twice a year.

612
00:52:57,336 --> 00:52:58,436
It's expensive, right?

613
00:52:58,436 --> 00:53:00,836
No, it's not expensive at all.

614
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,366
And later,

615
00:53:02,366 --> 00:53:04,506
Bu-jeong will be coming here.

616
00:53:04,506 --> 00:53:05,736
She'll spend the night.

617
00:53:05,736 --> 00:53:07,376
Your daughter.

618
00:53:08,276 --> 00:53:09,846
Bu-jeong said that?

619
00:53:09,846 --> 00:53:11,846
She's coming here after work?

620
00:53:11,846 --> 00:53:12,546
Yes.

621
00:53:12,546 --> 00:53:15,786
She's coming here after work
to spend the night.

622
00:53:15,786 --> 00:53:17,386
She texted me earlier.

623
00:53:36,566 --> 00:53:37,706
Father, what's this?

624
00:53:37,706 --> 00:53:38,836
It's money.

625
00:53:38,836 --> 00:53:39,836
What?

626
00:53:40,036 --> 00:53:41,346
I don't need money.

627
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:42,976
I can't even give you an allowance.

628
00:53:43,676 --> 00:53:44,616
Oh, Father.

629
00:53:44,616 --> 00:53:45,616
No.

630
00:53:45,616 --> 00:53:47,446
It's just 20,000 won.

631
00:53:47,446 --> 00:53:49,086
Use it for gas.

632
00:53:51,056 --> 00:53:52,216
If you do this,

633
00:53:52,216 --> 00:53:53,756
I'll never come visit you.

634
00:53:53,756 --> 00:53:54,886
Don't come.

635
00:53:54,886 --> 00:53:56,256
I'm not afraid.

636
00:53:57,056 --> 00:53:58,656
I can't accept this.

637
00:53:58,796 --> 00:54:00,826
Of course you can.

638
00:54:05,566 --> 00:54:07,036
Please look

639
00:54:07,566 --> 00:54:08,836
at Bu-jeong.

640
00:54:09,136 --> 00:54:10,536
Come on, Father.

641
00:54:10,836 --> 00:54:13,006
Bu-jeong is the one who's tolerating me.

642
00:54:13,336 --> 00:54:16,346
Please look at her carefully.

643
00:54:20,446 --> 00:54:21,446
To see if

644
00:54:22,186 --> 00:54:23,886
there's something the matter

645
00:54:24,616 --> 00:54:26,756
or if she's sick.

646
00:54:28,126 --> 00:54:30,386
Okay. I'm sorry.

647
00:54:30,586 --> 00:54:32,456
No, no. You don't have to be sorry.

648
00:54:32,456 --> 00:54:33,926
I'm sorry.

649
00:54:35,166 --> 00:54:37,366
Are you okay?

650
00:54:40,066 --> 00:54:40,836
Me?

651
00:54:40,836 --> 00:54:41,836
Yes.

652
00:54:43,636 --> 00:54:45,506
I'm fine, Father.

653
00:54:45,976 --> 00:54:47,976
You're not sick?

654
00:54:47,976 --> 00:54:49,276
Of course not.

655
00:54:50,046 --> 00:54:51,176
Then that's great.

656
00:54:51,176 --> 00:54:53,746
It's great that you're not sick.

657
00:55:56,606 --> 00:55:57,946
Are you home?

658
00:56:02,086 --> 00:56:03,146
Bu-jeong!

659
00:56:04,756 --> 00:56:05,856
Lee Bu-jeong!

660
00:57:28,266 --> 00:57:29,336
Yeah, what?

661
00:57:29,566 --> 00:57:31,476
What? You bastard.

662
00:57:31,706 --> 00:57:35,346
A mother doesn't need
<i>an excuse to call her child.</i>

663
00:57:35,576 --> 00:57:37,256
Have you been drinking?

664
00:57:37,846 --> 00:57:39,746
Oh, my! He can tell.

665
00:57:40,146 --> 00:57:43,316
<i>Why are you drinking alone?</i>

666
00:57:43,616 --> 00:57:45,256
I'm not alone, you bastard.

667
00:57:45,256 --> 00:57:46,486
I have friends, too.

668
00:57:46,486 --> 00:57:50,286
<i>How much did you drink?</i>
Your voice is loud.

669
00:57:50,286 --> 00:57:52,456
<i>Two of us drank</i> one bottle.

670
00:57:52,456 --> 00:57:53,856
But it wasn't enough

671
00:57:53,856 --> 00:57:55,596
so I'm out to buy two more.

672
00:57:55,766 --> 00:57:57,796
Good for you, Mom.

673
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,696
Who are you drinking with?

674
00:57:59,696 --> 00:58:01,706
You don't need to know, bastard.

675
00:58:03,766 --> 00:58:05,676
I don't need a plastic bag.

676
00:58:05,676 --> 00:58:07,676
<i>I'll carry them in my pocket.</i>

677
00:58:07,946 --> 00:58:09,046
Oh, Mom!

678
00:58:09,806 --> 00:58:10,776
What?

679
00:58:11,246 --> 00:58:14,416
<i>You said you called
Bu-jeong's office, right?</i>

680
00:58:15,216 --> 00:58:15,946
Huh?

681
00:58:15,946 --> 00:58:17,786
Bu-jeong's office.

682
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:20,686
You called,
but the number <i>was out of service.</i>

683
00:58:20,986 --> 00:58:22,126
I don't know.

684
00:58:22,926 --> 00:58:23,956
Did I say that?

685
00:58:23,956 --> 00:58:26,156
Do you have Alzheimer's?

686
00:58:26,156 --> 00:58:28,666
Hey, I'm busy so hang up.

687
00:58:28,666 --> 00:58:29,496
Call me later.

688
00:58:29,496 --> 00:58:32,396
<i>You called me and
you're telling me to hang up?</i>

689
00:58:32,796 --> 00:58:34,806
<i>Why?</i> Is your drinking buddy

690
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:35,536
your boyfriend?

691
00:58:35,536 --> 00:58:38,136
<i>Yeah, he's my boyfriend, you bastard!</i>

692
00:58:38,136 --> 00:58:39,206
Hang up!

693
00:58:39,206 --> 00:58:41,546
- <i>Yikes.</i>
- I'm sorry.

694
00:58:41,546 --> 00:58:43,976
Why do you always yell?

695
00:58:44,076 --> 00:58:45,246
Yeah.

696
00:58:45,246 --> 00:58:46,816
Your mother has Alzheimer's

697
00:58:47,116 --> 00:58:50,046
and runs alcohol errands
<i>for her boyfriend.</i>

698
00:58:50,046 --> 00:58:51,046
<i>Hang up!</i>

699
01:00:14,766 --> 01:00:15,886
<i>If, by chance,</i>

700
01:00:16,536 --> 01:00:18,116
<i>we meet again coincidentally,</i>

701
01:00:18,116 --> 01:00:20,076

01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:22,406
