3
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,390
This tent

4
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,530
looks like a pumpkin, right?

5
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,210
When the sun comes up,

6
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,400
and the morning comes,

7
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,570
everything will disappear,
like a pumpkin carriage.

8
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,680
This place. This time.

9
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,480
Everything.

10
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,050
Are we going to the sea?

11
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,020
I don't know.

12
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,080
Want to make a bet?

13
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,150
50,000 won.

14
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,870
I'll bet on not going.

15
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,860
You bet on us going.

16
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,140
Are you asleep?

17
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,210
Good night.

18
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,600
Can I touch your face?

19
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,030
Of course.

20
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,440
<i>I feel better after some sleep.</i>

21
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,970
<i>What time is your lecture?</i>

22
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,640
<i>If I hurry after the sunrise,
I won't be late.</i>

23
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,270
<i>We'll be just in time to go to work.</i>

24
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,080
<i>Let's hurry.</i>

25
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,750
<i>Will we be able to see
the sunrise? It's cloudy.</i>

26
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,910
<i>We'll see it.</i>

27
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,690
Why are you so sad?

28
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,530
Every time

29
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,230
I see you, you're always sad.

30
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,600
Even now.

31
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,640
What are you thinking about?

32
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,450
That I'm actually sad.

33
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,250
Not angry.

34
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,720
That's what I thought.

35
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,660
I always

36
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,030
thought I was angry.

37
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,710
People around me
always treat me that way.

38
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,300
"She's always angry, so be careful."

39
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,170
Who's like that?

40
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,540
Everyone who knows me.

41
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,880
Your father's not like that.

42
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,720
Neither am I.

43
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,700
I was scared.

44
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,870
Why?

45
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,740
You said this will all
disappear in the morning.

46
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,380
This place, this time, everything.

47
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,320
So...

48
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,160
I wanted to touch your face.

49
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,830
Before everything really disappeared.

50
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,800
But...

51
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,970
I got scared because
you said yes so easily.

52
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,840
When did I last touch someone's face?

53
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,680
I wasn't sure I could.

54
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,620
Thank you.

55
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,020
For saying I'm sad.

56
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,370
I'll be outside for a moment.

57
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,990
<i>(Dongdaemun Blankets Dawn)</i>

58
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,020
No place is open, huh?

59
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,750
I just

60
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,350
searched Dongdaemun Market for now.

61
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,990
Just give up.

62
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,260
You're right that
most places are open 24/7.

63
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,430
But not bedding stores.

64
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,960
I'll search Namdaemun Market.

65
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,600
They only sell blankets during the day.

66
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,200
Not early morning.

67
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,170
How do you know that?

68
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,510
You didn't even look it up.

69
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,280
I know since I've been to
many markets at dawn.

70
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,380
At dawn?

71
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,790
Why?

72
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,960
For work.

73
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,140
Then why did you come with me?

74
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,870
You should've stayed back there.

75
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,610
I was curious.

76
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,150
You were curious about me?

77
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,960
I was curious about

78
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,590
where a good and honest person goes

79
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,100
at dawn with his girlfriend.

80
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,700
You wouldn't be able to buy a blanket.

81
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,270
But you can't stay on the streets.

82
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,510
So a pub or a karaoke room

83
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,710
or a dry sauna?

84
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,680
You're probably sick of internet cafÃ©s.

85
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,720
If not all those,

86
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,980
then a motel?

87
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,790
What?

88
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,900
But that's not it because
you would left Gang-jae's.

89
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,970
I think you'd treat me like

90
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,040
I was something so precious.

91
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,810
Make me feel valuable.

92
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,080
But...

93
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,610
I've never experienced that

94
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,320
so I can't imagine what it'd be like.

95
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,170
Excuse me, sir.

96
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,350
Instead of Dongdaemun Market,

97
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,550
can you go back the way we came?

98
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,680
Okay.

99
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,850
Thank you.

100
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,480
Hey.

101
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,380
You scared me.

102
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,890
You just got in?

103
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,020
No, I haven't come home yet.

104
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,820
What do you mean?

105
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,660
I'm going out again.

106
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,950
You're going to buy the same thing?

107
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,890
Well,

108
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,320
since I broke it, I should replace it.

109
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,540
Was it really you?

110
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,530
Of course it was me.

111
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,670
Didn't your ex-wife

112
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,770
see how well you were living here,

113
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,970
got mad and threw it at the wall?

114
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,940
Oh, no.

115
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,210
It was me.

116
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,870
I picked it up and it slipped.

117
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,010
It bounced down here and broke.

118
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,450
Woo-nam.

119
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,640
You should know it
bounced off the ceiling and

120
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,060
picture frame, leaving marks everywhere.

121
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,860
It splattered all the way there?

122
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,790
Woo-nam.

123
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,160
I wiped it all off.

124
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,360
I didn't want Soon-gyu to get upset.

125
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,070
Thanks.

126
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,830
And you won't

127
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,900
be able to find this.

128
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,940
Why? You bought it on
the shopping channel.

129
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,810
That was a long time ago.

130
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,510
I'll take care of this.

131
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,540
Get her a nice, new set.

132
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,410
Okay.

133
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,410
Are you going somewhere?

134
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,280
I said I was going out again.

135
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,050
Where are you going?

136
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,820
Out.

137
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,120
With who?

138
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,160
You're so...

139
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,360
assertive today.

140
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,930
- Woo-nam.
- Yeah?

141
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,510
Is something wrong?

142
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,460
Well...

143
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,190
Yeah?

144
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,680
Can you go to Soon-gyu's room
and get blankets?

145
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,480
Blankets?

146
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,320
Good luck.

147
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,720
<i>(Lee Soon-ju)</i>

148
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,260
I'll be down soon.

149
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,280
You're bolder than I thought.

150
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,010
Bringing a girl home at this hour.

151
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,220
Taking blankets for some reason.

152
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,850
It's dangerous.
I can't leave her on the street.

153
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,060
Then you should've invited her inside.

154
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,230
My room's a mess. I can't invite her in.

155
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,160
You love her a lot, huh?

156
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,200
She looks familiar,
like I've seen her before.

157
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,500
You've never seen her.

158
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,120
Oh, I haven't seen her before.

159
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,790
She just reminds me of someone.

160
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,060
Who does she look like?

161
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,560
Soon-gyu.

162
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,300
Your sister.

163
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,770
Woo-nam.

164
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,470
You've been so stressed out

165
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,840
that you've gone mad, huh?

166
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,010
What?

167
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,540
No, take a good look.

168
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,380
I don't know if it's because it's dark,

169
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,950
but the silhouette and everything

170
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,520
is just like her.

171
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,020
She's tall,

172
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,120
has long legs,

173
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,630
a slender face,

174
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,260
big eyes and a sharp nose.

175
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,230
The hairstyle is different.

176
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,030
If she cuts her hair, she's Soon-gyu.

177
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,640
You know,

178
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,240
of all the things I've heard
in the past 27 years,

179
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,110
what you just said was
the greatest nonsense.

180
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,310
No, it's not.

181
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,580
Take a good look.

182
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,580
Hey...

183
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,580
I understand.

184
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,480
You want a woman

185
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,920
that has your sister's qualities.

186
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,630
You're leaving?

187
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,600
With her?

188
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,530
Yes.

189
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,130
When will you be back?

190
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,930
I don't know.

191
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,630
It might be right away.

192
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,440
Or it could take a while.

193
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,640
Take care of Soon-gyu for me.

194
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,020
I'll carry that.

195
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,030
It's heavy.

196
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,690
It's okay.

197
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,820
I was actually regretting

198
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,420
leaving that behind.

199
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,690
I thought so.

200
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,430
It's so windy.

201
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,150
I went up that way earlier.

202
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,250
People were taking pictures

203
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,720
of the stars and the moon.

204
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,320
I saw the pictures.

205
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,230
They were awesome.

206
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,090
I wanted to get the photos

207
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,560
so we exchanged numbers.

208
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,570
Oh, you're out.

209
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,300
Watch the sunrise before you go.

210
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,600
Okay.

211
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,210
Those people thought

212
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,750
we were fast asleep in
the tent a moment ago.

213
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,230
So they worried about

214
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,120
how they'd wake us.

215
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,990
Because they needed the tent back.

216
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,190
Remember what they said earlier?

217
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,430
That if they hurried
after watching the sun rise,

218
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,870
they could make it to work

219
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,570
and make it to their first lecture.

220
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,170
They all have work.

221
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,900
My work.

222
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,440
My job.

223
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,710
While doing my job,

224
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,780
almost every day,

225
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,750
no, many times a day,

226
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,090
I ride the pumpkin carriage.

227
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,790
<i>During the time reserved,</i>

228
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,550
<i>I become someone's friend,</i>

229
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,190

232

233
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,520
<i>the other person goes back to reality,</i>

234
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,120
<i>but I stay in that fantasy.</i>

235
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,830
<i>Have you ever thought of quitting?</i>

236
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,400
<i>Quitting?</i>

237
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,740
<i>Sometimes.</i>

238
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,770
<i>When I choose something I shouldn't,</i>

239
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,250
<i>when I must get off
although I don't want to...</i>

240
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,230
<i>Then,</i>

241
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,560
<i>once again,</i>

242
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,630
<i>I get on a different carriage.</i>

243
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,540
<i>I do it because I want to make money</i>

244
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,910
<i>and there's nothing else to do.</i>

245
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,350
<i>Also because I'm lonely.</i>

246
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,820
It's too late for me

247
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:22,960
to go to school
or work at a regular job.

248
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,590
Why?

249
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,900
You're still young.
Why do you think that?

250
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,730
Because...

251
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,810
I don't want to lose.

252
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,080
I don't want to compete with strangers.

253
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,390
I don't want to fight.

254
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,420
I know I'll lose.

255
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,330
I'm a coward.

256
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,330
Wasting my life like this.

257
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,340
Can you...

258
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,780
Can you become friends

259
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,710
with a person like me?

260
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,450
Instead of staying a client?

266
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:16,160
Yes. Mr. Kim hasn't come to work yet.

267
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,200
Oh.

268
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:18,900
Umm...

269
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,300
Did you want something?

270
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,270
You came in late with
a chauffeur yesterday.

271
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,600
Yes.

272
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,270
Then you should take
a cab or bus to work.

273
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,680
You'll get arrested for drunk driving.

274
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,110
I heard there's police
at the crossroads.

275
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,180
I could've been in big trouble.

276
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,080
I'll organize some stuff in the car

277
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,650
and take the bus to work.

278
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,490
Okay, you do that.

279
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,020
Thank you.

280
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,790
No need for thanks.

281
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,360
Be safe.

282
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,860

Did Gang-jae text you?

294
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,700
No.

295
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:49,970
He still hasn't?

296
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,670
I texted him last night

297
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,110
and didn't text him again.

298
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,480
You're curious?

299
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,420
Well...

300
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,560
Not so much curious,

301
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,090
but more like I think it's strange.

302
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,560
It's his place,
but he leaves and doesn't call.

303
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,730
What could he be doing?

304
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:51,630
I'll call him.

305
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,150
You don't have to.

306
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:19,060
If I was really curious about Gang-jae,

307
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,990
I could call him myself.

308
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,260
I'm his friend, too, you know.

309
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,240
I asked because I was wondering

310
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,180
if you were curious,
but weren't calling him

311
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,440
because of me.

312
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,320
Since

313
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,420
you think I like him.

314
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,670
You feel conflicted, right?

315
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,470
So do I.

316
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,710
Since you two are soulmates.

317
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:57,420
There was a direction board near here.

318
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,690
On the board,

319
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,890
it said not to scatter ashes

320
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:02,330
without permission.

321
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,600
But we had come to scatter remains.

322
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,630
There were other things on it, too.

323
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,370
No cooking.

324
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,070
No feeding wild animals.

325
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,880
No this, no that.
They didn't let you do anything.

326
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,810
But among all that,
I could see it below.

327
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,110
No scattering ashes

332
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,100
<i>What did you do with his ashes?</i>

333
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,770
<i>With his ashes?</i>

334
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,310
<i>We were</i>

335
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:57,380
<i>thinking of secretly
scattering him here.</i>

336
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,690
<i>But we couldn't.</i>

337
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,900
<i>My mom and I.</i>

338
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,720
<i>We're both chicken.</i>

339
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,230
My mom, dad and I

340
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,330
are like that.

341
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,300
You know people whose hearts pound

342
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,440
when they do something they shouldn't?

343
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,140
So then we went to the sea.

344
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,610
You can scatter ashes
in the sea, you know.

345
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,210
If you go about 3km out by boat.

346
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,550
You didn't know, right?

347
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,350
Hey.

348
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,350
I like this.

349
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,360

350
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,330
Come to think of it,

351
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,400
I heard it somewhere.

352
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,600
Do you normally hate losing?

353
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,210
It's true.

354
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,190
Don't believe me then.

355
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,250

<i>Why I didn't just go home.</i>

366
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,690
<i>Why I went to the mountain and the sea.</i>

367
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,690
<i>Or...</i>

368
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,720

<i>You're the first to say you were glad.</i>

370
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,130
<i>I wondered what you meant by that.</i>

371
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,840

376
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,910

377
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:46,720
<i>But...</i>

378
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,460

00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,340
<i>Not everyone wants to go back home.</i>

00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,450

00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,290
I'm sorry.

397
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:31,790
We checked everything.

398
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:36,930
But that book was
translated and published

399
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:38,630
at the same time as your book

400
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,270
so we weren't able to find it before.

401
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,270
Turn that off.
It's giving me a headache.

402
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,450
There's no news article on it, right?

403
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,750
Right. It didn't come from a reporter

404
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,450
but a book review website.

405
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,390
We had the post removed.

406
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:05,020
But it was up there

407
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,530
for a week.

408
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:09,560
So we don't know
how many people re-posted it.

409
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,500
It wasn't Writer Lee?

410
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:16,470
We checked.

411
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:19,470
It wasn't her. It was a common reader.

412
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,640
So?

413
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:23,340
What did Lee Bu-jeong copy?

414
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:27,080
An essay book by a Russian writer.

415
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,680
She was translating it
herself to publish it,

416
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,620
but she quit suddenly

417
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:37,520
and the credit went to another writer.

418
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,170
It's half a page so it's not long.

419
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:51,070
But the part about animal ethics
is exactly the same

420
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:54,840
and it was used continuously
in our PR direction.

421
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,110
This is insane.

422
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:04,550
What?

423
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,750
A staff member is outside.

424
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,690
Let him in.

425
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,060
Ma'am.

426
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,630
I came to tell you

427
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:22,100
that today's shoot might be canceled.

428
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,170
We wanted to inform you in advance.

429
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,640
Canceled?

430
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:27,770
Why?

431
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:35,880
Is it

432
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,150
because of me?

433
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,550
No, it isn't.

434
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:48,390
Ji-na is hurt.

435
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:50,730
She has to be hospitalized.

436
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,800
How hurt is she?

437
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,300
Is it serious?

438
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,570
She has cracked ribs

439
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,910
and some psychological issues...

440
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:05,210
Her ribs...? Why?

441
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:10,210
Is it

442
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:13,850
because of Jin-seop?

443
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,390
Is it?

444
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:01,370
Thank you.

445
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:19,550
Four Things a Sexless Couple Must Know

446
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,320
Oh, well...

447
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,360
I'm not reading this
because I have problems.

448
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,890
I didn't say anything.

449
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:31,960
And it's okay to have problems
with your sex life.

450
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:33,460
Right.

451
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:36,430
I'm just saying, I wasn't reading it

452
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:37,770
because I actually needed to.

453
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:39,840
Alright, alright.

454
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,610
You're both young. You'll be fine.

455
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:43,240
No, no.

456
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,740
It's nothing like that, we don't...

457
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,150
Julie.

458
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,180
Do something about my eyebrows.

459
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,220
It must be because I
didn't sleep well last night.

460
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,120
I drew it with a ruler

461
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,720
but it's still crooked.

462
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,260
Sit down.

463
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,890
You said you're going to brunch.

464
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:03,430
Aren't you late?

465
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:04,800
No.

466
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,370
Hello, ma'am.

467
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:10,400
Oh!

468
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:12,900
Huh?

469
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,070
You're getting your hair done.

470
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:15,170
Yes.

471
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:16,910
What's the occasion?

472
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:20,210
I just wanted a change.

473
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:23,910
So you're going to brunch.

474
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,820
I know, right?

475
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,290
My hometown friends all died

476
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:30,490
and only the four of us are left.

477
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,360
It's just 30,000 won.

478
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,390
I'll consider it as condolence money

479
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:36,730
and just go to brunch.

480
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,360
That's great.

481
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,870
You should enjoy life.

482
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:43,700
I heard they called some club people.

483
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,500
Club people?

484
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,400
Yes.

485
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,340
Then I should make you extra pretty.

486
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,270
You never know. You might meet someone.

487
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:52,540
Jeez. Stop that nonsense.

488
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,580
I'm disturbed as it is
with my bad dream.

489
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,010
Oh.

490
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:58,750
Don't use black.

491
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:00,990
Let's do dark brown. For a classy look.

492
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:03,150
- Dark brown.
- Yes.

493
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:51,900
My shoes and my bag...

494
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,610
I bought them all at my son's mall.

495
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:57,370
I only buy things from there.

496
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:58,810
So my son can save face.

497
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,410
The restaurant's supposed
to be around here.

498
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,710
Maybe we passed it.

499
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,880
Is it that way?

500
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,700
Hey.

501
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:22,470
Why? Do you know him?

502
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:25,140
Huh? No.

503
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:27,300
He'll hear you.

504
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,040
How could she know him?

505
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:32,440
I'm sorry. We're lost.

506
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,410
Okay.

507
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:37,920
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

508
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,790
Why touch that? We're going to eat!

509
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:43,190
But you knocked it down.

510
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,720
It's okay, right?

511
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,590
We're in a hurry.

512
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:48,690
Yes, of course.

513
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,890
Just leave it there.

514
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,430
He said it's okay.

515
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:53,430
Let's go.

516
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:08,480
<i>Did you know what
Bu-jeong's father does?</i>

517
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,110
What are you talking about?

518
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:12,350
I'm busy as it is.

519
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,980
Sir, I'll pick it up.

520
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:14,920
Take your call.

521
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:16,390
<i>Huh?</i>

522
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,220
Are you okay?

523
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,720
What does Father do?

524
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,130
He'll do better than you.

525
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:24,500
I'm not in the mood to joke.

526
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:29,100
Did you know Bu-jeong's
father collects boxes?

527
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,830
Oh, that...

528
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:32,040
<i>You knew?</i>

529
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,500
Mom,

530
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,810
he's not doing that for money.

531
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:37,210
<i>He's doing it for exercise.</i>

532
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:38,540
Exercise?

533
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,210
It's true, Mom.

534
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:42,710
He's only doing it for exercise.

535
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:44,780
Exercise, my foot.

536
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:48,890
Do you give him an allowance or not?

537
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:50,090
Allowance?

538
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:51,890
<i>Answer me.</i>

539
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:57,460
We each give allowance
to our own parent.

540
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:00,400
Bu-jeong would've given him...

541
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:03,400
<i>Think of Bu-jeong's situation.</i>
How can she?

542
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:05,270
She has no paycheck.

543
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,570
So she couldn't have given him money.

544
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,380
That thought didn't occur to me.

545
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,310
You should've told me about Bu-jeong

546
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:17,110
<i>when you found out.</i>

547
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:19,850
Right. It's all my fault.

548
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:22,290
It's my fault Bu-jeong got fired.

549
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:24,560
It's my fault she had a miscarriage.

550
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,020
And it's my fault

551
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,890
Bu-jeong's father is collecting boxes.

552
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:31,360
Why are you getting worked up?

553
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,330
<i>By the way, how did you know..</i>

554
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,620
How did she know?

555
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:11,370
What kind of dressing is this?

556
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:12,270
It's ranch.

557
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:14,070
- Looks great.
- Bon appetit.

558
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:17,780
- Help yourselves.
- Eat up.

559
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:19,480
Excuse me.

560
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,280
Yes?

561
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,810
Can I get a doggy bag?

562
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:23,810
What?

563
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,450
Can I take it to go?

564
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,480
Oh...

565
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,920
Oh, my!

566
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:10,330
Darn it.

567
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,320
Sir!

568
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:33,750
Yes?

569
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:37,320
Did you see where the old man
with the cart went?

570
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,590
He was here a second ago.

571
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:41,730
Oh, the old man collecting boxes?

572
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:44,830
He went that way.

573
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,120
Excuse me.

574
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,550
We're here.

575
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:09,550
Okay.

We're here.

577
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,900
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

578

Goodbye.

579
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:23,130

now

585
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:56,530
What crossroads?

586
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,510
Do we go to the sea or do we go home?

587
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:07,080
There are only two routes here.

588
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,010
Chuncheon or Seoul.

589
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,720
I'm thinking of going to the sea

590
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,320
in Chuncheon to see my dad.

591
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,390
Want to come with me?

592
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,340
Hold on.

601

No.

602
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:38,800
It's just a place to
get on and off a bus.

603
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:42,470
The milk and bread
your mother left on the bus...

604
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,770
If you had come here,
you might've found them.

605
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:47,870
How regrettable.

606
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:51,780
It's someone else's,
but it's regrettable to you?

607
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,940
Weird, right?

608
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,910
But seeing all these things here,

609
00:58:57,810 --> 00:58:59,520
it's strangely regrettable.
