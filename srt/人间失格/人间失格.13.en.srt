Excuse me.

Oh, yes.

10
00:01:32,346 --> 00:01:33,176
Oh...

11
00:01:33,976 --> 00:01:35,816
Hello. It's been a long time.

12
00:01:35,816 --> 00:01:36,646
Yes.

13
00:01:46,696 --> 00:01:48,496
You're going to the ICU?

14
00:01:48,496 --> 00:01:49,466
Yes.

15
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:50,466
Let me help.

16
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:52,736
- Thank you.
- It's heavy.

17
00:01:58,926 --> 00:02:00,906
I can take that now.

18
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:03,306
Thank you.

19
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,416
You're here.

20
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:09,816
Hey...

21
00:02:11,286 --> 00:02:15,056
Did the patient that was here
move somewhere?

22
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:16,586
Oh, no.

23
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:19,696
He passed away last night.

24
00:02:22,596 --> 00:02:25,496
You know his guardian?
She came every day.

25
00:02:26,236 --> 00:02:28,036
Of course I know her.

26
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,936
She didn't see him pass away.

27
00:02:35,306 --> 00:02:38,076
Why? She was always with him.

28
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:39,616
I know.

29
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:43,116
She came every day without fail.

30
00:02:43,116 --> 00:02:44,986
But of all days, yesterday afternoon,

31
00:02:44,986 --> 00:02:47,856
she left early because of a cold.

32
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:05,506
One, two, three.

33
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:32,496
<i>They came here 2 years ago
when he got worse.</i>

34
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:35,466
<i>If you add the time before that,
it'll be longer.</i>

35
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:44,776
<i>But she still came
at every visiting hour.</i>

36
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:48,716
- <i>(Susung Convalescent Hospital)</i>
- Coming in.

37
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,715
Thank you.

38
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,436
<i>She sometimes came at dawn.</i>

39
00:04:18,816 --> 00:04:20,246
It's hot, right?

40
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:23,346
I saw on the news.

41
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:26,216
Today's the hottest day of the year.

42
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:33,726
This year's no good.

43
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:37,096
Let's go to the sea next year.

44
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:42,066
Let's watch the sunrise

45
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:44,936
and eat delicious food.

46
00:04:53,746 --> 00:04:55,086
Is it cool?

47
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:02,086
See you tomorrow.

48
00:05:02,086 --> 00:05:02,626
- Good job today.
- Good work.

49
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:03,756
Thanks.

50
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:06,896
Have a great meal.

51
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:11,066
<i>Even after visiting hours, she'd stay</i>

52
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:12,466
- Goodbye.
- See you tomorrow.

53
00:05:13,036 --> 00:05:16,106
<i>in the waiting room a few more hours.</i>

54
00:05:37,926 --> 00:05:39,196
Sir.

55
00:05:41,496 --> 00:05:42,596
Sir.

56
00:05:42,696 --> 00:05:45,226
You should see your son before you go.

57
00:05:45,936 --> 00:05:47,566
Hold on just a little, sir.

58
00:05:54,906 --> 00:05:56,476
Are you sad?

59
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,146
He'll like it.

60
00:06:21,196 --> 00:06:22,806
Because we're sad for him.

61
00:06:27,076 --> 00:06:32,546
<i>He miraculously held on
when she was there.</i>

62
00:06:34,076 --> 00:06:37,846
<i>Perhaps her grief was
too hard for him to see</i>

63
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,756
<i>so he passed away when he was alone.</i>

64
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:44,226
<i>Or...</i>

65
00:06:45,496 --> 00:06:50,996
<i>Perhaps he wanted to
be remembered longer.</i>

66
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:24,066
I just asked for some samples.
What's all this?

67
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:25,736
It's fit for a night out on the town.

68
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,466
Do I look like I'm about to party?

69
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:29,636
You complain even
when I did as you asked.

70
00:07:30,906 --> 00:07:32,966
What did you do with the store?

71
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:35,276
I thought you'd come in the evening.

72
00:07:36,946 --> 00:07:38,446
You're going to put that on?

73
00:07:38,446 --> 00:07:41,446
I already offered my condolences.
I'm leaving.

74
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:47,286
Don't go around bare faced.
It's so drab.

75
00:07:47,286 --> 00:07:49,456
Put on some makeup.

76
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:53,296
Mom.

77
00:07:54,156 --> 00:07:55,896
I'm in mourning.

78
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:00,526
Good for you.

79
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:09,476
Don't be downcast because
you didn't see him go.

80
00:08:09,476 --> 00:08:10,946
He had several crises.

81
00:08:11,646 --> 00:08:14,016
You can say you saw him
go several times.

82
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:15,916
Stop it. Someone might hear.

83
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,046
Who?

84
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:23,156
If you walk on eggshells,

85
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:24,826
you'll age.

86
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:26,196
You

87
00:08:26,726 --> 00:08:28,426
have aged 10 years

88
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,726
for the past year.

89
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:35,506
You're the worst.

90
00:08:36,306 --> 00:08:37,536
Is that

91
00:08:38,736 --> 00:08:41,676
all you can say to me
at a time like this?

92
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:45,616
It's because you're so pretty.

93
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:48,416
Your beauty is going to waste.

94
00:08:55,086 --> 00:08:57,756
If I was born as pretty as you,

95
00:08:57,756 --> 00:09:00,226
I wouldn't live such a mediocre life.

96
00:09:00,226 --> 00:09:01,966
I'd be more brazen.

97
00:09:09,736 --> 00:09:12,606
This is the thanks I get...

98
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:19,746
Don't act like your life is over.

99
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:21,916
You're not even forty.

100
00:09:30,756 --> 00:09:32,726
I hate this.

101
00:09:51,246 --> 00:09:52,346
Sir.

102
00:09:52,546 --> 00:09:53,476
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

103
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:55,546
Have you seen the old man
collecting boxes?

104
00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:56,616
Oh, that old man?

105
00:09:56,616 --> 00:09:57,346
Yes.

106
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,316
He went that way.

107
00:09:59,316 --> 00:10:00,556
You should go that way.

108
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:01,986
Thank you.

109
00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:17,766
Hello, sir.

110
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:18,906
Oh!

111
00:10:18,906 --> 00:10:19,876
I have some boxes.

112
00:10:19,876 --> 00:10:20,636
Thank you.

113
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:22,276
- Keep up the good work.
- Okay.

114
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:30,246
Huh?

115
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:32,856
What brings you here?

116
00:10:33,016 --> 00:10:35,356
I've been looking for you all over.

117
00:10:36,696 --> 00:10:37,586
Oh.

118
00:10:37,726 --> 00:10:38,896
Min-ja...

119
00:10:39,326 --> 00:10:41,796
I thought you might be hungry.

120
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,626
If you haven't had lunch,

121
00:10:45,036 --> 00:10:47,796
let's eat together.

122
00:10:52,476 --> 00:10:53,836
My pregnancy with Jeong-su

123
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:57,446
was very difficult.

124
00:10:58,246 --> 00:11:00,576
I had four miscarriages before him,

125
00:11:00,846 --> 00:11:02,316
so I lay still

126
00:11:02,316 --> 00:11:04,486
for ten months.

127
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:07,216
The baby grew big.

128
00:11:09,326 --> 00:11:10,186
Oh.

129
00:11:10,186 --> 00:11:13,596
I haven't shown you the picture, huh?

130
00:11:13,696 --> 00:11:15,366
Picture?

131
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:19,796
He was in my hometown's newspaper.

132
00:11:21,636 --> 00:11:24,106
A friend of Jeong-su's father
was a reporter.

133
00:11:24,236 --> 00:11:26,506
He said such a big baby was rare.

134
00:11:26,606 --> 00:11:27,206
Here.

135
00:11:27,206 --> 00:11:29,006
Thank you.

136
00:11:33,816 --> 00:11:36,616
Put glasses on this face

137
00:11:36,616 --> 00:11:38,416
and it's Jeong-su's face now.

138
00:11:38,716 --> 00:11:41,286
He's very handsome.

139
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:46,226
He looks just like his father.

140
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:49,996
- I sometimes get startled.
- <i>(A big baby weighing 5.02kg born in Icheon)</i>

141
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:52,366
I bet your husband

142
00:11:52,996 --> 00:11:54,866
was handsome.

143
00:11:56,706 --> 00:11:59,206
He died of an accident.

144
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:04,206
He operated heavy equipment.

145
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:05,576
I see.

146
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:08,946
He had broad shoulders.

147
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:11,386
He was very good-looking.

148
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:15,726
But after he suddenly passed away,

149
00:12:16,286 --> 00:12:18,826
I was beside myself.

150
00:12:19,726 --> 00:12:21,656
They said I preyed on my husband,

151
00:12:22,296 --> 00:12:25,236
and didn't give me a penny
of the compensation.

152
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,666
They divided it among themselves.

153
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:29,766
I couldn't say anything.

154
00:12:30,206 --> 00:12:32,236
I didn't know anything.

155
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:36,376
It was like that in the past.

156
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:38,076
Yes.

157
00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:40,776
Here.

158
00:12:42,816 --> 00:12:46,256
I was living with my in-laws
without my husband.

159
00:12:46,556 --> 00:12:48,316
Then, one day,

160
00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:50,326
I suddenly got angry.

161
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,726
Jeong-su was seven at the time.

162
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:55,296
I was weeding my sister-in-law's field

163
00:12:55,396 --> 00:12:58,466
Jeong-su was going out
to catch dragonflies.

164
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:01,666
I just carried him
and ran away to Seoul.

165
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:05,676
I did everything I could.

166
00:13:06,376 --> 00:13:07,936
I worked at a restaurant,

167
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:09,376
cleaned motels,

168
00:13:09,646 --> 00:13:11,506
babysat, nursed patients,

169
00:13:12,246 --> 00:13:13,876
delivered rice soup,

170
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,146
<i>and made door-to-door sales.</i>

171
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,756
<i>Jeong-su only knows</i>

172
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,626
that I sold gimbap later.

173
00:13:22,956 --> 00:13:25,756
He doesn't know what I did before that.

174
00:13:26,526 --> 00:13:28,256
<i>I didn't tell him.</i>

175
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:32,036
<i>You barely make ends meet.
Don't be cheeky.</i>

176
00:13:32,036 --> 00:13:34,966
<i>30,000 won is 20 rolls of gimbap.</i>

177
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:36,966
<i>It's been a long time
since you sold gimbap,</i>

178
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:38,536
<i>but you're still talking about it.</i>

179
00:13:39,106 --> 00:13:41,336
I also sold gold teeth.

180
00:13:41,746 --> 00:13:44,376
When I first got to Seoul,

181
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:48,486
I didn't know where to go to earn money.

182
00:13:48,546 --> 00:13:50,186
I was desperate.

183
00:13:50,716 --> 00:13:52,686
What little money I had

184
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:55,626
went towards the safety deposit
for a small house.

185
00:13:56,186 --> 00:13:58,956
So I had no money to spend.

186
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:02,396
After having Jeong-su,
my teeth got ruined

187
00:14:02,796 --> 00:14:05,266
so I suffered for years.

188
00:14:05,436 --> 00:14:08,036
My husband saved up
his allowance in secret

189
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:11,066
so my in-laws wouldn't know.

190
00:14:11,336 --> 00:14:13,406
I got gold crowns for two of my molars.

191
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,006
He was sweet.

192
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:21,446
But

193
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,016
do you know what the funny thing was?

194
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:28,986
He did that for me as a sweet gesture,

195
00:14:32,126 --> 00:14:34,096
but when I sold them for money,

196
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:36,866
I was more grateful to him.

197
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:41,366
Darn that money...

198
00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:59,916
Isn't this work hard?

199
00:15:00,786 --> 00:15:05,026
I heard you're doing it for exercise.

200
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:07,156
Jeong-su...

201
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:10,226
Jeong-su is my son

202
00:15:11,096 --> 00:15:13,636
but he only takes
after his father in looks.

203
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:15,606
He's inattentive.

204
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:17,966
<i>Father!</i>

205
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:20,706
<i>Are you alright?</i>

206
00:15:22,606 --> 00:15:24,206
<i>I told you not to come.</i>

207
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:27,746
<i>You two are so stubborn.</i>

208
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,786
<i>You should think of your age.</i>

209
00:15:34,356 --> 00:15:36,426
<i>I should quit soon.</i>

210
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:40,256
I wasn't telling you to quit.

211
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:41,126
I am

212
00:15:41,696 --> 00:15:43,626
not good with words.

213
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:45,596
I know.

214
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,436
I know how you feel

215
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:51,106
and I know

216
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,276
what you want to say.

217
00:16:00,946 --> 00:16:02,986
This place called Seoul...

218
00:16:05,116 --> 00:16:06,786
I haven't lived here

219
00:16:08,586 --> 00:16:10,326
for very long

220
00:16:12,126 --> 00:16:13,626
but this place

221
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:16,926
makes you greedy.

222
00:16:19,136 --> 00:16:20,866
Back in my hometown,

223
00:16:22,206 --> 00:16:24,206
at 9 o'clock in the morning,

224
00:16:25,206 --> 00:16:28,376
I'd think, 'My Bu-jeong
must have gone to work.'

225
00:16:30,046 --> 00:16:31,906
At dinner time,

226
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:37,046
I'd think, 'She must be going home now.'

227
00:16:38,986 --> 00:16:40,916
'She must've worked hard.'

228
00:16:43,826 --> 00:16:44,826
'Still,'

229
00:16:47,296 --> 00:16:49,396
'she said she's healthy.'

230
00:16:49,396 --> 00:16:52,396
'I'm sure everything's okay
with her life.'

231
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,606
That's all I thought.

232
00:16:57,536 --> 00:16:58,836
But when I

233
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,446
actually came to Seoul,

234
00:17:03,406 --> 00:17:07,446
I regretted not coming here sooner.

235
00:17:08,846 --> 00:17:10,986
It would've been good

236
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:13,916
if I had money to pass on to our kids

237
00:17:15,156 --> 00:17:16,946
<i>or help them out sometimes,</i>

238
00:17:16,946 --> 00:17:18,226
<i>like you do.</i>

239
00:17:26,536 --> 00:17:29,436
<i>Could I have done that?</i>

240
00:17:35,476 --> 00:17:37,706
The place I'm living

241
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,916
was a place Bu-jeong received

242
00:17:42,816 --> 00:17:44,316
a monthly rent from

243
00:17:45,316 --> 00:17:47,086
to pay the bank loan

244
00:17:47,556 --> 00:17:49,386
and interest.

245
00:17:52,426 --> 00:17:54,956
I think it was two months
after I moved in.

246
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:03,066
The only thing I had to do
was see the doctor.

247
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:06,606
When I passed a real estate agency,

248
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,436
I found out

249
00:18:09,476 --> 00:18:13,076
that room's monthly rent
was 600,000 won.

250
00:18:15,786 --> 00:18:17,446
<i>I was shocked.</i>

251
00:18:18,816 --> 00:18:20,586
<i>I felt I was going to black out.</i>

252
00:18:21,716 --> 00:18:23,186
<i>After that day,</i>

253
00:18:23,656 --> 00:18:27,856
<i>I kept thinking it was 20,000 won a day.</i>

254
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,296
<i>So I couldn't sit still.</i>

255
00:18:31,396 --> 00:18:34,366
<i>I went out to earn at least 1/4 of that.</i>

256
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:37,036
- It's 3,000 won.
- Thank you.

257
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:39,236
- Good job.
- Thank you.

260
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:53,986
my greed.

Hi.

00:24:37,426 --> 00:24:38,826
You're coming from piano lessons?

Yes.

like strawberries?

00:24:45,106 --> 00:24:48,136
I think I saw you eat

I don't like them, but I do eat them.

00:24:51,046 --> 00:24:54,546

So random.

352
00:28:02,296 --> 00:28:05,206
My cousin got married a few months ago.

353

We met at the wedding hall, remember?

354
00:28:09,546 --> 00:28:12,176
Oh, the one who used
that stand-in service

355
00:28:12,176 --> 00:28:13,946
and hired someone to read a letter?

356
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,716
Why do you only remember that?

357
00:28:16,716 --> 00:28:17,746
So negative.

358
00:28:17,746 --> 00:28:19,586
It's not negative.

359
00:28:19,716 --> 00:28:21,256

360
00:28:22,016 --> 00:28:23,626
Anyway, that cousin

361
00:28:23,626 --> 00:28:26,596
got married, threatening
to die if she couldn't.

362
00:28:26,596 --> 00:28:28,296
But now they're fighting,

363
00:28:28,296 --> 00:28:31,066
threatening to file for an annulment.

364
00:28:31,766 --> 00:28:32,766
Why?

365
00:28:33,766 --> 00:28:35,696
I don't know the details.

366
00:28:36,106 --> 00:28:38,736
But she learned that
her husband is a huge liar,

367
00:28:38,736 --> 00:28:40,936
and that his story doesn't add up.

368
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:42,036
Thank you.

369
00:28:42,276 --> 00:28:43,506
Thanks for the food.

370
00:28:43,776 --> 00:28:45,776
How much does it not add up

371
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,476
that she's suing him?

372
00:28:47,746 --> 00:28:49,816
It doesn't add up at all.

373
00:28:50,686 --> 00:28:52,756
They dated for 3 years and a half,

374
00:28:52,756 --> 00:28:54,716
so she thought she knew him
and got married.

375
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:57,256
But it turns out,

376
00:28:57,586 --> 00:28:59,456
he was almost a stranger.

377
00:29:00,696 --> 00:29:02,126
Even if you're married,

378
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:04,466
you can't know all about each other.

379
00:29:04,466 --> 00:29:06,936
Some things you know,
other things you don't.

380
00:29:06,936 --> 00:29:09,266
Some things you thought
you knew but don't.

381
00:29:09,566 --> 00:29:10,766
It's like that.

382
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:12,066
Hey,

383
00:29:12,536 --> 00:29:14,506
didn't your cousin lie, too?

384
00:29:15,176 --> 00:29:16,846
She hired fake friends.

385
00:29:16,846 --> 00:29:18,846
He's worse than that, so she sued him.

386
00:29:18,846 --> 00:29:21,076
Sir, this is a problem.

387
00:29:21,076 --> 00:29:22,816
The caliber of your mind

388
00:29:23,186 --> 00:29:24,586
is too small.

389
00:29:25,816 --> 00:29:27,116
I'm too small?

390
00:29:27,986 --> 00:29:29,556
You're not big.

391
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,466
What is it?

392
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:47,576
Is something wrong at home again?

393
00:29:48,376 --> 00:29:49,806
Again?

394
00:29:49,806 --> 00:29:51,706
Nothing ever happened at home.

395
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,576
The scale is small,

396
00:29:53,576 --> 00:29:55,346
but something is always happening.

397
00:29:56,486 --> 00:29:57,606
What happened?

398
00:29:57,846 --> 00:29:59,206
What do you know?

399
00:30:01,856 --> 00:30:03,026
First...

400
00:30:03,026 --> 00:30:05,456
Weariness because of
your mom and wife's discord.

401
00:30:05,456 --> 00:30:06,596
Your wife's menopause.

402
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,056
Your wife's work problems.

403
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,596
Your father-in-law's dementia.

404
00:30:09,596 --> 00:30:11,666
Your mama's boy issue.

405
00:30:12,426 --> 00:30:13,366
And it seems

406
00:30:13,366 --> 00:30:15,436
you're occasionally
meeting your first love.

407
00:30:15,766 --> 00:30:16,936
And

408
00:30:17,606 --> 00:30:19,006
being sexless.

409
00:30:21,106 --> 00:30:23,676
Did I tell you all that?

410
00:30:24,476 --> 00:30:26,476
You don't have to say it in words.

411
00:30:27,446 --> 00:30:28,516
And...

412
00:30:28,516 --> 00:30:29,686
Stop.

413
00:30:31,016 --> 00:30:32,186
Should I stop?

414
00:30:39,426 --> 00:30:40,526
And what?

415
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:45,726
A secret between  you two.

416
00:30:48,366 --> 00:30:49,296
Who?

417
00:30:49,296 --> 00:30:50,536
One of you.

418
00:30:50,736 --> 00:30:51,766
What kind of secret?

419
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:56,846
Beats me. I don't know what kind yet.

420
00:30:57,006 --> 00:30:59,376
But it'll be trivial.
This is you we're talking about.

421
00:31:02,546 --> 00:31:03,886
Anyway...

422
00:31:04,586 --> 00:31:05,816
It's small, right?

423
00:31:05,816 --> 00:31:06,886
Yes.

424
00:31:10,756 --> 00:31:11,786
Take a look at this.

425
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:14,826
This is my cousin's
social media account.

426
00:31:15,356 --> 00:31:17,726
Do they look like they're in a lawsuit?

427
00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:20,536

428
00:31:39,756 --> 00:31:40,786

430

431
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:49,566

were they sent to you?

00:32:18,056 --> 00:32:20,126
Where did Jin-seop get them?

437
00:32:22,426 --> 00:32:23,826
Bastard.

438

He told the injured girl
to take those pictures?

439

Get sued or not, it's his mess,

440
00:32:30,636 --> 00:32:32,336

Since you're not saying,
"I'm hanging up,"

468
00:36:57,206 --> 00:36:58,166

00:49:10,036 --> 00:49:11,266
Why isn't this loosening?

551
00:49:11,266 --> 00:49:14,536
Come here and
open the container you brought.

552
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:16,606
Huh? I'm busy.

553
00:49:16,606 --> 00:49:18,946
I can't go now. I'm doing this.

554
00:49:18,946 --> 00:49:21,376
My hands are like this.

555
00:49:23,816 --> 00:49:25,886
How frustrating!

556
00:49:25,886 --> 00:49:26,886
What?

557
00:49:26,886 --> 00:49:29,656
I might not live to
see that light turn on.

558
00:49:29,656 --> 00:49:32,386
What's the use of
being tall and handsome?

559
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,596
It takes all day for you to fix a light.

560
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,456
Is that a compliment or what?

561
00:49:36,456 --> 00:49:39,026
I'm here on a weekend
without even resting.

562
00:49:39,026 --> 00:49:40,696
You should be thanking me.

563
00:49:40,696 --> 00:49:42,636
Okay, thanks a lot.

564
00:49:42,636 --> 00:49:43,496
I won't do it.

565
00:49:43,496 --> 00:49:44,536
What?

566
00:49:44,536 --> 00:49:45,836
What a cheap move!

567
00:49:45,836 --> 00:49:46,866
Then don't, you bastard!

568
00:49:46,866 --> 00:49:48,076
I really won't do it, Mom.

569
00:49:48,076 --> 00:49:49,076
Don't do it!

570
00:49:52,546 --> 00:49:55,046
I strain myself to make kimchi for them.

571
00:49:55,046 --> 00:49:57,386
But my daughter-in-law
doesn't even show up.

572
00:50:02,186 --> 00:50:03,016
Huh?

573
00:50:03,586 --> 00:50:05,656
Why is this so heavy?

574
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,226
I must've given them so much.

575
00:50:17,436 --> 00:50:20,806
Putting a gift in an empty bowl
is basic manners.

576
00:50:20,806 --> 00:50:23,076
He has no etiquette.

577
00:50:25,546 --> 00:50:27,076
Who can I blame?

578
00:50:27,546 --> 00:50:29,976
It's my fault that I didn't teach him.

579
00:50:30,176 --> 00:50:31,046
Huh?

580
00:50:31,046 --> 00:50:32,747
<i>(Hogwanwon Premium)</i>

581
00:50:34,716 --> 00:50:38,056
He should've told me he brought a gift.

582
00:50:38,056 --> 00:50:39,326
Jeez.

583
00:50:39,726 --> 00:50:41,256
Who does he take after?

584
00:50:45,526 --> 00:50:47,436
In the end, it's my son

585
00:50:47,866 --> 00:50:49,866
who thinks about his old mother.

586
00:50:49,866 --> 00:50:52,006
Even if I nag him all the time,

587
00:50:52,566 --> 00:50:55,876
it was worth it to give birth to him.

588
00:50:55,976 --> 00:50:58,146
What are you mumbling about?

589
00:50:58,146 --> 00:50:59,906
Like you got caught in rain.

590
00:50:59,906 --> 00:51:02,076
- Mom!
- Yikes!

591
00:51:02,176 --> 00:51:03,816
Why did you get startled?

592
00:51:03,816 --> 00:51:06,516
You were nagging me
to open the container.

593
00:51:06,516 --> 00:51:07,886
Son.

594
00:51:08,086 --> 00:51:09,116
I am

595
00:51:09,586 --> 00:51:11,526
so moved.

596
00:51:12,386 --> 00:51:15,426
What's with you?
You're giving me the chills.

597
00:51:15,726 --> 00:51:19,826
You should've told me
you brought a gift.

598
00:51:19,896 --> 00:51:20,896
A gift?

599
00:51:21,936 --> 00:51:23,566
Oh, this?

600
00:51:23,566 --> 00:51:25,146
I bought it last month.

601
00:51:25,146 --> 00:51:27,296
I meant to give it to you earlier.

602
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:29,346
But I kept forgetting
so I put it in here.

603
00:51:29,346 --> 00:51:31,086
Then this really is for me, right?

604
00:51:31,086 --> 00:51:32,606
Of course, Mom.

605
00:51:32,806 --> 00:51:36,446
You said your knees hurt,
so I bought it.

606
00:51:36,696 --> 00:51:38,486
I was late in giving it to you.

607
00:51:39,066 --> 00:51:40,066
Try it.

608
00:51:42,526 --> 00:51:44,206
It goes down easy, huh?

609
00:51:46,986 --> 00:51:48,596
Since there are two boxes,

610
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:50,696
give your father-in-law one

611
00:51:50,696 --> 00:51:52,296
when you give him kimchi.

612
00:51:53,966 --> 00:51:56,966
Why are you so considerate
of him these days?

613
00:51:57,316 --> 00:51:58,316
You're not

614
00:51:58,486 --> 00:52:00,586
pitying him because

615
00:52:01,146 --> 00:52:02,946
he collects boxes, are you?

616
00:52:03,106 --> 00:52:04,106
What, you bastard?

617
00:52:04,106 --> 00:52:05,446
It's weird.

618
00:52:05,506 --> 00:52:06,046
Think.

619
00:52:06,046 --> 00:52:09,086
You call me to tell me
to take care of him.

620
00:52:09,246 --> 00:52:12,846
You share nutritional
supplements you love.

621
00:52:13,126 --> 00:52:14,566
- Why you!
- Ow!

622
00:52:14,816 --> 00:52:16,756
Your smack is painful.

623
00:52:16,756 --> 00:52:18,276
You don't need these vitamins.

624
00:52:18,346 --> 00:52:21,076
I ate you and gave birth
to seaweed soup.

625
00:52:21,636 --> 00:52:22,636
What?

626
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:24,376
You mean you gave birth to me

627
00:52:24,376 --> 00:52:25,766
and ate seaweed soup.

628
00:52:29,236 --> 00:52:30,916
Wow, this looks good.

629
00:52:34,016 --> 00:52:34,986
It's so salty.

630
00:52:37,746 --> 00:52:39,646
That really hurts.

631
00:52:40,106 --> 00:52:42,366
How can you smack me so painfully?

632
00:52:56,926 --> 00:52:58,756
Over here, ma'am.

633
00:53:01,966 --> 00:53:03,416
I'm so sorry I'm late.

634
00:53:03,416 --> 00:53:04,606
It's okay.

635
00:53:05,076 --> 00:53:08,376
But you need the training
so I'll be quick.

636
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:09,236
Okay.

637
00:53:09,956 --> 00:53:11,726
Wasn't it hard to find?

638
00:53:12,346 --> 00:53:15,116
She picked a hospital like herself.

639
00:53:15,356 --> 00:53:16,796
Far and congested.

640
00:53:18,116 --> 00:53:20,516
I got treated at this hospital, too.

641
00:53:20,736 --> 00:53:22,826
Oh, I see.

642
00:53:24,396 --> 00:53:26,226
You have good judgment.

643
00:53:29,176 --> 00:53:31,326
Were you drinking just coffee?

644
00:53:32,836 --> 00:53:35,706
There won't be much
to eat at the hospital.

645
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:40,106
A toast called

646
00:53:40,106 --> 00:53:42,536

647
00:53:42,536 --> 00:53:43,486
Want some?

648
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:45,346

649
00:53:45,346 --> 00:53:46,076
Jeez.

650
00:53:46,206 --> 00:53:48,346
I had lunch, too.

651
00:54:00,026 --> 00:54:01,556
To be brief,

652
00:54:01,786 --> 00:54:04,306
we're not a professional
caregiving service,

653
00:54:04,306 --> 00:54:06,156
but for our VIP clients,

654
00:54:06,186 --> 00:54:09,346
we accompany them
when they get admitted.

655
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:11,246

656
00:54:12,036 --> 00:54:14,166
sift through this,
you'll know everything.

657
00:54:17,436 --> 00:54:20,646
I'll stay for the first 20-30 minutes.

658
00:54:21,146 --> 00:54:24,546
If you have questions, ask any time.

659
00:54:25,276 --> 00:54:26,276
Okay.

Though I'm sure you won't.

661
00:54:31,876 --> 00:54:34,806
It tastes... just like Singapore.

662
00:54:35,626 --> 00:54:36,626
Does it?

663
00:54:37,436 --> 00:54:38,666
The coffee fragrance is good.

664
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:39,486

665
00:54:39,486 --> 00:54:40,766
- They do?
- Yes.

666
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:00,716

01:02:12,596 --> 01:02:15,516
I bet that person isn't that famous.

734
01:02:16,086 --> 01:02:17,816
Being a diva is incurable.

735
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:21,236
The VIP rooms are over there.

736
01:02:21,236 --> 01:02:22,236
Okay.

737
01:02:23,286 --> 01:02:25,866
I have another appointment.

738
01:02:25,866 --> 01:02:27,966
So I can't stay for
the first 30 minutes.

739
01:02:27,966 --> 01:02:30,066
It's okay. I understand.

740
01:02:33,146 --> 01:02:34,566
By the way,

741
01:02:36,426 --> 01:02:39,676
did you go on a trip?

742
01:02:39,836 --> 01:02:40,836
What?

743
01:02:41,046 --> 01:02:43,416
I got a glimpse of your photos.

744
01:02:43,916 --> 01:02:45,596
Was it a family trip?

745
01:02:45,986 --> 01:02:46,986
Oh.

746
01:02:47,946 --> 01:02:48,986
No, it's not.

747
01:02:49,656 --> 01:02:51,336
A friend sent them to me.

Jun-seong, is the script out?

751
01:04:38,866 --> 01:04:40,696
It's supposed to be out by today,

752
01:04:40,696 --> 01:04:42,196
but I haven't heard anything.

753
01:04:42,476 --> 01:04:44,876
They always say "by today."
