Part 10 Back Where I Was

3
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,120
When I bought this place...

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,020
Huh?

5
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,030
You always say you bought it.

6
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,760
Of course I bought it. Did you?

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,460
I chipped in.

8
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,560
KRW 5 mil.

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,670
If she chipped in KRW 5 mil. for a 70 mil. place,

10
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,140
doesn't that mean I bought it?

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,700
You always say it's KRW 70 mil.

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,640
It's KRW 66.6 mil.

13
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,469
Isn't the price

14
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:49,110
such an unlucky number?

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,750
Three sixes in a row.

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,480
What's wrong with six?

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,020
In China, six is the best number after eight.

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,050
Is that so?

19
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,820
If it's that good, why always say KRW 70 mil.?

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,060
Be exact and say KRW 66.6 mil.

21
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,090
Isn't that too long?

22
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,090
Long?

23
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,130
It's not long?

24
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:06,790
66.6 mil.

25
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,930
66.6 mil.

26
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,960
See? Huh?

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,960
I said it twice and it didn't take even a second.

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,600
It's long?

29
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,640
You do it so well.

30
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,340
Akira Manager Seo Jong-hoon

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,280
I will get back to you soon.

32
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,330
So?

33
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,530
Huh?

34
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,700
You bought this place.

35
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,830
Then what?

36
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,500
There must be an end to this story.

37
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,500
End?

38
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,140
There isn't.

39
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,910
Huh? Then 666 is the end?

40
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,280
No, there is an end.

41
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,480
Your mom keeps interrupting.

42
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,020
What is it?

43
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,850
The most stressful end of all.

44
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,860
Someone else making money.

45
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,590
Who made money?

46
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,990
When I bought this house with KRW 70 mil...

47
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,270
Don't interrupt.

48
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,330
My friend bought a 50 square yard apartment

49
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,240
in Goyang for just KRW 9 mil. more.

50
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,340
I already have a bad feeling about this.

51
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,510
I did whatever I could to buy it.

52
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,810
But in the end, I couldn't.

53
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,380
Because your mom was against it.

54
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,710
What?

55
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,550
I wasn't against it.

56
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,480
I just

57
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,680
made a few comments.

58
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,990
What did you say?

59
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,720
That we have to live in Seoul no matter what.

60
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,220
Even if you're poor, you have to stay in Seoul.

61
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,460
If you leave, you'll never get back in.

62
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,560
She was strongly against it.

63
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
So?

64
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,370
How much did the apartment price rise?

65
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,040
KRW 400 mil.

66
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:03,130
KRW 400 mil...

67
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,509
KRW 400 mil.?

68
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:06,009
Don't go overboard.

69
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:07,690
It wasn't KRW 400 mil.

70
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,280
It was a little over KRW 300 mil.

71
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,390
What are you talking about?

72
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,920
You're saying that because it's not your money.

73
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,890
Where's my phone?

74
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,430
We can look it up on the real estate website.

75
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,500
Don't look it up. I'll lose my appetite.

76
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Jeez.

77
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,100
I don't even watch the news. It's stressful.

78
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,000
Seriously.

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,200
KRW 400 mil. for real?

80
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,900
No, it's not KRW 400 mil. I tell you!

81
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,010
Oh, and

82
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,840
the price of this place rose, too.

83
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,580
How much?

84
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,580
KRW 80 mil.

85
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,750
Wow, he says KRW 80 mil.

86
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,180
It's KRW 90 mil.

87
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:45,449
See?

88
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,990
The selling price is KRW 380 mil. Almost 400 mil.

89
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,790
If it's KRW 380 mil., then the price rose 300 mil.

90
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,530
Not 400 mil.

91
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,900
This is enough to feel seriously deprived.

92
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,970
You understand.

93
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,900
So I practically have no will to live.

94
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,940
Then don't look at the prices.

95
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,870
Give it.

96
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,310
Jeez.

97
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,350
If we don't look, will the price fall?

98
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,880
Be quiet. I'm losing my appetite.

99
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,390
Gang-jae
I will get back to you soon.

100
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,050
I can never get through to him.

101
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,390
He's so hard to reach.

102
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,560
Just (Gang-jae's friend)

103
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,180
Akira Manager Seo Jong-hoon

104
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,440
Akira Manager Seo Jong-hoon?

105
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,690
Huh?

106
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,760
You doing another job?

107
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
What?

108
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,460
Oh.

109
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,430
Of course not.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,630
It's the first time in my life

111
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,740
getting a call from him.

112
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,170
Then shouldn't you take it?

113
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,070
Since it's the first time.

114
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,780
Well, it's not exactly the first time.

115
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,420
Someone that must not be defiled, my foot.

116
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,550
You're a pro.

117
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,060
And good at lying.

118
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,720
Me? I didn't lie.

119
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,130
Did you work the rooms, too?

120
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,630
The rooms? No.

121
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,500
You know Jeong-woo, right?

122
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,370
We all went to get money from his sister.

123
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,600
I know him.

124
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,940
He suddenly missed work one time,

125
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,610
so Gang-jae asked me to stand in for him.

126
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,610
I helped him just that once.

127
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,920
Unbelievable.

128
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,310
Why? It's not unbelievable.

129
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,350
He asked a favor, so I...

130
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,750
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

131
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,230
What?

132
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,080
How could you?

133
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,790
What?

134
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,890
After that,

135
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,890
I never went there again.

136
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,030
I'll drink this since I'm so annoyed.

137
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,330
Okay.

138
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,100
Want me to open that for you?

139
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,370
No. I'll do it.

140
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,740
I guess you opened drinks for people, too.

141
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,740
I guess so.

142
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,250
Hold on a sec.

143
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,990
Min-jeong, look.

144
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,260
Seo Jong-hoon
Long time no see.

145
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,230
See?

146
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,860
He's looking for Gang-jae, not me.

147
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,360
I can't get a hold of Gang-jae.
Call me.

148
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,900
Read all of it.

149
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,030
"All of it"? It's only one line.

150
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,200
Did you read "Long time no see"? Right here.

151
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,480
You'll get in trouble if you go just anywhere.

152
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,110
Right.

153
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:34,880
Aren't you going to open it?

154
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,020
Oh.

155
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,180
I will.

156
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,820
Here.

157
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,040
Go make the call.

158
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,810
I want to know why he's looking for Gang-jae.

159
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:03,080
Gang...Gang-jae?

160
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:05,570
As his business partner,

161
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,589
I want to know his situation.

162
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,790
If the job regarding Lee Bu-jeong is going well,

163
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,390
if he isn't doing anything illegal...

164
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,730
It'll be bad

165
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,590
if he gets arrested.

166
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,330
Right.

167
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,670
Then...

168
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,800
I'll be watching the counter.

169
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Okay.

170
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,490
You're so pretty. You're my type.
Do you have a boyfriend?

171
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,560
Whoa, we locked eyes.

172
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,470
Did you see?

173
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,700
It's the end of the world.

174
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,210
The guy working the counter is my boyfriend.

175
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,010
Get going into the room.

176
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,620
Hey, Just.

177
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,490
It's been a while.

178
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,590
How's school?

179
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,530
You already graduated?

180
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,160
You have a job?

181
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,900
No, not yet.

182
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,160
So why are you looking for Gang-jae?

183
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,870
Oh, well.

184
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,140
No reason in particular.

185
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,140
The club is full of customers for once.

186
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,180
There are two groups from activity clubs.

187
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,550
We need more players.

188
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,810
And I need to ask him something.

189
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,750
Are you with him?

190
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,180
Oh, no.

191
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,580
I was with him until this afternoon.

192
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,220
He's probably at home right now.

193
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,960
Then why isn't he picking up?

194
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,460
Is he avoiding me?

195
00:09:59,130 --> 00:09:59,990
Avoid you?

196
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,590
No way.

197
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,730
He's working a job for you.

198
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,670
Why would he suddenly avoid you?

199
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,340
Did Gang-jae tell you he's working

200
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,100
a job for me?

201
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,570
Oh...

202
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,510
Gang-jae...

203
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,210
He didn't tell me himself.

204
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,550
Then how do you know?

205
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,620
I just came to know.

206
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,450
But really,

207
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,360
he never said anything to me.

208
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,620
I'm telling the truth.

209
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,260
It's okay, Just.

210
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,930
I'm not interrogating you, I'm just asking.

211
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,970
And what does it matter if he did tell you?

212
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,970
It's not a huge secret or anything.

213
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,240
Gang-jae must be embarrassed because you're clean.

214
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,840
And I think that'll be shut down.

215
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,580
Jeong-woo dragged it out too long.

216
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,590
Huh? Hello?

217
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,430
Yes, I'm listening.

218
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,250
Okay.

219
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,120
So.

220
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,660
Hello.

221
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,890
How's Gang-jae doing these days?

222
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,800
Is he making a lot of money?

223
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Is he seeing anyone?

224
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,600
I don't know...

225
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,600
He said you're soulmates.

226
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,300
If you don't know, who will?

227
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,770
Anyway.

228
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,710
If you get a hold of him, tell him to help me out.

229
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,180
If you have time, you should come, too.

230
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,650
They're not a tough bunch.

231
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,620
Okay.

232
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,420
I'm so grateful for your offer,

233
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,350
but I'm working right now.

234
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,260
Oh, right. Go on ahead.

235
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,700
Drop by some time.

236
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,030
I'll stop by some time.

237
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,530
Okay. Bye.

238
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,660
How do you receive customers?

239
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,800
Cu...customers?

240
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,710
What about customers?

241
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,670
I don't receive customers.

242
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,740
The guys who just came in.

243
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,680
I can cook instant noodles,

244
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,180
but I can't register info into the system.

245
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,290
Oh, uh...

246
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,510
Oh.

247
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,860
Stop by some time? No way.

248
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,490
You must be insane.

249
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,600
I didn't mean right this instant.

250
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,470
Manager Ahn

251
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,010
What's going on, Gang-jae?

252
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,840
CEO Jeong

253
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,280
Yes, Ma'am?

254
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,450
You said you're going to a fitting.

255
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,820
I am. I suddenly thought of something.

256
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,160
What?

257
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,530
The woman you asked about in the car.

258
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,530
Is it her?

259
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,430
Why? Do you have something?

260
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,840
Oh, well.

261
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,910
Nothing in particular yet.

262
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,680
Yeah?

263
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,910
Yes.

264
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,750
She really is a goody two shoes.

265
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,120
There's nothing,

266
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,730
even when I've hired a tail.

267
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,090
Hey.

268
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,460
Don't nag the tail too much.

269
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,460
It might be because she's been to the police,

270
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,990
but she's not writing stuff about me anymore.

271
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,990
I don't want to cause trouble

272
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,740
and make things worse.

273
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,570
Right.

274
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,170
Then

275
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,900
what should I do?

276
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,370
What do you mean?

277
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,040
Play it by ear, taking cues from her.

278
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,620
Cause and prevention of Alzheimer's

279
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,930
"Jeong A-ran's Notes on Life"

280
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,600
I wronged her.

281
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,370
But while working with me,

282
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,670
she probably did something wrong, too.

283
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,040
If you find something in the meantime,

284
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,850
I'll keep that in my arsenal for later.

285
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,150
Okay.

286
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,150
Best 5 foods good for Alzheimer's

287
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,860
Dad.

288
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,230
Drink some water.

289
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,110
I always get like this at night...

290
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,430
Maybe it's the changing weather.

291
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,850
I'll pat your back.

292
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,750
It's okay.

293
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,820
After a while,

294
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,760
I'm completely fine again.

295
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,410
Why weren't you sleeping?

296
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,300
I was looking at something.

297
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,200
You'll ruin your eyes.

298
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,870
Why see things in the dark?

299
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,270
Turn the lights on.

300
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,910
I was looking at my phone. No need for lights.

301
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
You know,

302
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,610
you were always like that.

303
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,150
I hated books.

304
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,550
They made me tired.

305
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,790
I don't know who you take after.

306
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,820
But day and night, all the time,

307
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,030
you sat with a book and peered into it.

308
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,880
You must be old since you are

309
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,570
talking about the past.

310
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,300
Of course I'm old.

311
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,970
Jeong-su must've been shocked.

312
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,510
What about me?

313
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,610
You think Jeong-su was shocked?

314
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,080
Your daughter was shocked even more.

315
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,780
Why were you shocked?

316
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,720
When you're old, this is natural.

317
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,650
Death can happen

318
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,290
regardless of the order of birth.

319
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,230
But aging happens in the order of birth.

320
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:10,830
So,

321
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,730
if something happens to me again,

322
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,300
don't be so shocked, okay?

323
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,600
Jeez.

324
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,010
Okay?

325
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,980
I'm not answering that.

326
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,310
Leave the dishes.

327
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,150
It's my exercise.

328
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,650
I said leave it.

329
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,820
Just
Where are you?

330
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,590
Jong-hoon contacted me.
He's looking for you.

331
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,300
Why? I'm at my mom's place.

332
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,640
What is it?

333
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,110
You can't sleep?

334
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,980
No.

335
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,750
Since I usually sleep late.

336
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
I see.

337
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,790
The fluorescent light keep doing that.

338
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,780
The light?

339
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,390
Yes.

340
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,560
It flickers a lot.

341
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,100
If I hit it, it's okay.

342
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,240
Sometimes, it's fine for days.

343
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,010
I went to three convenience stores.

344
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,840
They didn't sell fluorescent tubes.

345
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,610
They only had light bulbs.

346
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,420
That's why you took so long?

347
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,460
You were looking for fluorescent tubes?

348
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,060
We thought

349
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,230
something happened.

350
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,600
We were scared.

351
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,740
Why?

352
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,110
Well...

353
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:42,750
You seemed different.

354
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,920
So I was worried.

355
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,760
Why are you suddenly acting like a mom? It's weird.

356
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,230
Alright.

357
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,000
I won't.

358
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,910
You're okay, right?

359
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,820
Huh?

360
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,920
Yeah.

361
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,080
When I look at you,

362
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,700
you remind me of your father. It's frustrating.

363
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,230
His eyes were always looking

364
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,670
far away.

365
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,070
No matter how close I peered into them,

366
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,010
I couldn't tell what he was thinking.

367
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,050
There's nothing to know.

368
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,230
Are you dating someone?

369
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,200
Are you crazy?

370
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,640
Are you waiting for a call?

371
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,140
That's why I asked.

372
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,380
You don't use phones just to call.

373
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,350
You're right.

374
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,120
Just
He said there are a lot of customers today.

375
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,620
I think I said something I shouldn’t have.
Call me when you can.

376
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,700
It's Just.

377
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,030
Oh, it's Just?

378
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
What is it?

379
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,260
I'm leaving.

380
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,730
I'll stop talking.

381
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,530
Spend the night.

382
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,870
I can't sleep.

383
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,210
I'm bothered that Jang-gyu is sleeping outside.

384
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,910
What's to be bothered? He always sleeps there.

385
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,950
Don't lie.

386
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,590
Okay, then.

387
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,920
Wait.

388
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,490
I'll pack you some food.

389
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,660
It's okay.

390
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,260
I'll come next time and eat it.

391
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,900
Next time when?

392
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,470
Next month?

393
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,900
I don't know. I'll come when I come.

394
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,800
Next month is Dad's memorial day.

395
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,780
I know.

396
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,910
Don't come out.

397
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,350
Be careful!

398
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,150
What?

399
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,620
He's leaving?

400
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,830
Did you two fight?

401
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,730
No.

402
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,730
Sleep.

403
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,500
Can I come in the room?

404
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,010
Hi, Gang-jae.

405
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,110
What is it?

406
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,050
What did you say to him?

407
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,420
Oh, well.

408
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,290
It's not that I messed up big time.

409
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,160
Excuse me.

410
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,360
Yes! Hold on.

411
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,590
Yes?

412
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,930
I don't know how to recharge.

413
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:50,130
Oh, is this your first time here?

414
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:50,760
Yes.

415
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,700
Then I'll help you log in as a non-member.

416
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,310
You can choose the price and charge.

417
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,070
Thank you.

418
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,540
Okay, I'm back.

419
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,880
What is it?

420
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,980
You know,

421
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,080
the job Jong-hoon asked you to do.

422
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,580
The job that has nothing to do with you.

423
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,790
Hello?

424
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,310
What about it?

425
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,230
I somehow talked about it.

426
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,460
What do you mean, "somehow"?

427
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,730
I was just talking with Jong-hoon about you

428
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:30,100
and I brought that up unintentionally.

429
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,900
By the way,

430
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,780
was it something Jeong-woo did?

431
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,310
Jong-hoon said that?

432
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,210
No.

433
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,220
Not exactly.

434
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,220
But he said Jeong-woo dragged it out

435
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,790
and so on.

436
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,660
What's "so on"?

437
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,090
He's going to shut it down.

438
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,200
I said

439
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,030
you didn't tell me anything.

440
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,270
I kept explaining that.

441
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,600
And it's true.

442
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,940
But I don't think he believed me.

443
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:09,080
You look like a sleepy bear without a clue when really

444
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,940
you're very sharp, and yet people think I'm a blabbermouth.

445
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,380
Who'd believe you? I wouldn't.

446
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,810
Right?

447
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,450
Maybe it's because I had to be sharp all my life.

448
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,720
I should've been careful.

449
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,590
But earlier,

450
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,030
I didn't have time to think.

451
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,730
He didn't say anything else?

452
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,360
No.

453
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,830
he asked if you're making a lot of money

454
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,330
and if you're seeing someone.

455
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,940
What did you say?

456
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,220
I said I didn't know.

457
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,610
Because I really don't know.

458
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:46,910
That's it?

459
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,210
Oh.

460
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,720
He asked you to come to his club.

461
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,850
Hey, Gang-jae.

462
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,190
I heard

463
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,060
you told him

464
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,060
you and I were soulmates.

465
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,260
What the...

466
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,330
You're all crazy.

467
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:08,030
Aw, don't be bashful.

468
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,670
I think we're soulmates, too.

469
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:10,670
My Gang-jae.

470
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,070
I'm hanging up.

471
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,940
Then is my Gang-jae

472
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,910
spending the night at his mom's?

473
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,310
I'm hanging up for real.

474
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,580
Okay.

475
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:42,940
Hello.

476
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,940
Hi.

477
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,680
Gang-jae!

478
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,420
What the...

479
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,760
Your timing is impeccable.

480
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,190
I was thinking about you.

481
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,390
What the...

482
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,090
You said we need to talk.

483
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,130
You're already drunk?

484
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,560
You...

485
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,700
You don't take my calls.

486
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,100
But you take Just's. Come here, you.

487
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,930
Do you know how many times I called you?

488
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,180
Where have you been?

489
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,080
Oh, right!

490
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,120
I have something to show you.

491
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,900
Take a look. That was me.

492
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,860
Who is it?

493
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,060
You put a tail on me?

494
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,400
It's Manager Ahn.

495
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,830
He worked with Jeong-woo. You don't know him.

496
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,570
Oh, right!

497
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,670
I got another photo just now.

498
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,790
Let's go inside.

499
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,050
I heard that's where Jeong-woo lived.

500
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,290
That study room.

501
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,060
A woman he met on a suicide website

502
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,420
had a sick kid.

503
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:25,130
So he came here a lot to borrow money after he quit.

504
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:31,740
I did my best to Jeong-woo.

505
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,370
I gave him a lot of jobs.

506
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,210
Why are you talking about him all of a sudden?

507
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,350
I was thinking.

508
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,290
There's no way you'd betray me.

509
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,620
So I thought hard,

510
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,260
and realized you must've misunderstood me.

511
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,360
If you have something to say, spit it out.

512
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,400
Don't beat around the bush.

513
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,170
I hate complicated things.

514
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,240
I hate complicated things, too.

515
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,950
To be honest, Gang-jae,

516
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:16,520
I can just hand over those pictures.

517
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,380
A woman with a graduate degree

518
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,950
and a husband working for a major company

519
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,980
goes to a motel

520
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,170
with a young guy who is her dad's neighbor.

521
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,930
You don't have to give me more.

522
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,360
I have enough.

523
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,030
But

524
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,030
I'm going to shut it down.

525
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,950
I thought about it.

526
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,820
Shutting this down at this point

527
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,790
is good for all of us, isn't it?

528
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,960
Jeong A-ran won't be doing anything bad.

529
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,060
That woman won't have her weakness exposed.

530
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,930
Jeong-woo got his money.

531
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,330
I don't have to get pestered by this anymore.

532
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,330
You...

533
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,770
You

534
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,770
would rather die than swindle old women,

535
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:18,080
so you don't have to do what you hate.

536
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,150
So what do you want?

537
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,290
I want two things.

538
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
One,

539
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,900
I want to know why you're obsessed with Jeong-woo.

540
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,960
And the other one?

541
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,830
Don't see her from now on.

542
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,670
I don't care if it's for real or a swindle.

543
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,110
Is that so important to you?

544
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,810
Of course.

545
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,310
Why?

546
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,780
Because it confuses me.

547
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,960
Can you do that?

548
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,930
I have no choice.

549
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,350
Okay.

550
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,050
Since you're here, run some tables.

551
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,560
I'll give you double the basic wage.

552
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
Hey.

553
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,630
Just this once,

554
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,030
lose to me completely.

555
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,200
If I were to work for double the wage,

556
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,870
I'd cross-stitch my grandma's socks and sell them.

557
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,240
Triple.

558
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,510
Okay.

559
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:04,120
Triple the wage and what you've done so far.

560
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,550
How much is that?

561
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,720
You'll know when you get it.

562
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,730
I'll come for you in a minute.

563
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:16,800
Check yourself in the mirror.

564
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
Why?

565
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,320
I know I look good.

566
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,270
No doubt you're my bloodline.

567
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:25,000
Sorry for muddying up the bloodline,

568
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,740
but this is really my last time.

569
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,940
There are clothes in that locker.

570
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,340
Wear anything you want.

571
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,050
Oh, and Jeong-woo.

572
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,290
Why do you want to know about him?

573
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:46,760
Do I have to say it?

574
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,030
It'd be helpful.

575
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,030
I want to know

576
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,070
how he lived.

577
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,100
So.

578
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,400
You find what you were looking for?

579
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,110
No.

580
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,440
Jeong Jeong-woo

581
00:33:51,819 --> 00:33:55,520
What words can I give to comfort you...
What can I do...

582
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,860
Will you leave the chat?

583
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,560
Hello, Father.

584
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,830
If you leave, all contents will be deleted.

585
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,630

587
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,480
Will you delete?
The other person will not be informed

588
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,420
Are you doing well?

589
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,040
As you can see,

590
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,300
Gang-jae!

591
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,560
I am still

592
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:47,810
Gang-jae! Gang-jae! Gang-jae! Gang-jae!

593
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,170
just a complete

594
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,280
mess.

595
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:38,190
Lee A-ri (Cheongdam. Age 34)
In need of boyfriend at hike and gathering

596
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:47,530
If you deposit the down payment,
your reservation will be complete.

597
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,700
For the first time in a long time,

598
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,810
If you deposit the down payment,
your reservation will be complete.

599
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,620
for no reason,

600
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:11,060
Lee Bu-jeong
It's Room 503 at Hotel SHEEM.

601
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:16,430
If you're free tonight,
I'd like to book you.

602
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,470
I followed something other than money.

603
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,470
It wasn't money.

604
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,420
It wasn't about winning or losing.

605
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,340
It was a small and strange flutter in my heart.

606
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:03,340
I followed it and went to a new world.

607
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,310
Will you leave the chat?
If you leave, all the content will be deleted.

608
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,820
What did I want to become?

609
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,380
Dad, I...

610
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,690
I didn't become anything.

611
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,660
But I don't know how to make an effort.

612
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,400
Thank you.

613
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,270
What expectations did I have?

614
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,970
If, by chance,

615
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,880
we meet again coincidentally,

616
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,890
but not like today,

617
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,620
do you want to die with me?

618
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:30,500
Will you leave the chat?
Check

619
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,700
When did I take a wrong turn?

620
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,140
What are you doing?

621
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,370
Come on.

622
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:01,120
I followed my heart and walked to the other side.

623
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,560
But in the end,

624
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,410
I am back where I was.

625
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:32,720
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

626
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,480
I'll send it to you. Check it later.

630
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,060
I didn't get a step closer.

631
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:05,570
Myungwoon Hair Salon

632
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,750
And I didn't get a step farther.

633
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:42,670
I came back to the place

634
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,600
where I started.

635
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,800
What?

636
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,570
Wow.

637
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,080
That's retro what?

638
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,010
Retro modernism, Min-jeong.

639
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:03,110
It's not a hard word. Why can't you remember it?

640
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,820
You've asked so many times.

641
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,720
It's not hard. I just don't see it.

642
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,080
Retro what?

643
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:10,560
No way.

644
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,060
Why can't you see it?

645
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,400
What's wrong with you?

646
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,870
Look who's talking.

647
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,970
Now I see your hair had been doing all the work.

648
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,670
Be honest.

649
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:31,880
You said you were sick for weeks and stayed in.

650
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:35,480
But you were actually waiting for your hair to grow.

651
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:37,750
I'm right, huh?

652
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:42,790
Yeah, right.

653
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:45,320
I know that feeling.

654
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,690
But after I got a haircut,

655
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:50,760
I'm getting explosive responses.

656
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,960
I'm getting booked in Cheongdam-dong a lot.

657
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,570
I go to Gangbuk for a second to sleep.

658
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:01,510
I see your hair isn't the only problem.

659
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:03,540
What do you mean?

660
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,280
Cheongdam-dong is so old news now.

661
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,640
What a loser.

662
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,620
I'm advising you as a business partner.

663
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,650
Update your Intel.

664
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:14,850
At this rate, you'll become an old man in no time.

665
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,120
Give me that dog and go home.

666
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,760
You can watch overseas Korean twins alone?

667
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,830
They only understand English.

668
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:26,760
Ailey is done. It's Billy's turn now.

669
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:37,840
Take her.

670
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:44,870
I got her.

671
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,260
Compliment her.

672
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,360
It's all in the paycheck.

673
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,460
Good.

674
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:59,530
Pretty.

675
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:01,070
Ughh, give her here.

676
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:04,440
Be sincere.

677
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,180
Let's say hi to this old man.

678
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,840
Hi, Old Man.

679
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:16,150
What?

680
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,550
You're shameless.

681
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:20,020
That's English?

682
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,960
Speaking a language is all about being confident.

683
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,290
Right?

684
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,790
You'll help me move today, right?

685
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,260
You're moving?

686
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,270
You're so heartless.

687
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:38,070
I've been telling you since last week.

688
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:40,500
Just is coming, so you come, too.

689
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,470
I'll pay you.

690
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:44,440
You must be planning to work us hard.

691
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,180
You have to go with me to buy stuff I need,

692
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,750
and move my things to the new place.

693
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:53,230
If there are items you're not using,

694
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:54,500
sell them to me.

695
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,650
I'll give you more than the going price for used goods.

696
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,160
I guess your video business is doing well.

697
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,530
Since you're moving.

698
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:04,030
It's not doing well.

699
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:07,100
But people are crowding into the internet café.

700
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,870
So I'm moving into any study room.

701
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,570
You searched for a place with Just?

702
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:14,510
Yes.

703
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,270
He called me yesterday, too.

704
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:18,880
He wants to go on a spring picnic.

705
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:22,040
A spring picnic at a time like this?

706
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:27,290
That's what I said.

707
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,530
Gang-jae went out for the first time in a month?

708
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,130
What about the lady?

709
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:38,090
Substitute homemaker?

710
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,400
Jeong-woo?

711
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,680
What about him?

712
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,480
You know Seo Jin-seop's lover he was tailing

713
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,550
per your request?

714
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:54,380
The one in the same soap opera?

715
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,940
She goes to her place twice a week to clean.

716
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,340
It's been six months.

717
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:17,540
Who is it?

718
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,070
You said there was no one!

719
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:28,490
Are you crazy?

720
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,020
I said stay still!

721
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:34,730
Stay still!

722
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:48,430
Who is it?

723
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,250
I'm your manager.

724
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,150
Just leave today and come back next time.

725
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:58,230
- Today...
- Hold on.

726
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,830
If you don't open the door,

727
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:04,440
I'll call the police.

728
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,910
I'll also notify security downstairs.

729
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:12,170
Hold on a second.

730
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:18,940
If you go to the other side of the hallway,

731
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:21,750
I'll open the door.

732
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:32,770
Did you

733
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:34,900
call the police?

734
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:46,670
I'll count today as complete.

735
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,920
So you can leave.

736
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:52,550
Are you okay?

737
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:05,230
I didn't break any bones.

738
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,060
So don't worry.

739
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:15,380
Excuse me.

740
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:20,310
If something happens,

741
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,950
you can call me on my private number.

742
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:28,000
I'll help in any way I can.

743
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:38,660
You are friends

744
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,660
with the woman who used to work here, right?

745
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:45,870
Yes.

746
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:48,290
Why do you ask?

747
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:51,190
No reason.

748
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:56,910
I was thinking who introduced you to me.

749
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:04,600
You can't tell anyone about this.

750
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:11,530
Please.

751
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:58,940
(Unknown)

752
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:06,630
7 PM… Should I get a room at a motel
near the studio apartment?

753
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,650
It's Room 503 at Hotel SHEEM.

754
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:23,510
Hello?

755
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:26,660
Hello, Manager Lee. Long time no see!

756
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,130
Yes, hello.

757
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:29,860
What's the occasion?

758
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,220
Oh, the usual.

759
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:35,210
I heard from the purse lady just now

760
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:37,510
that you left without cleaning today.

761
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:38,690
Oh.

762
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:42,160
Yes, but she said she'd count it as done.

763
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,890
That's right. She wasn't complaining.

764
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:47,900
She just wanted to know your service points

765
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:51,270
and how you came to work here.

766
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,950
It's common in the VIP Team,

767
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:55,360
so don't worry.

768
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,680
Okay. Thank you.

769
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:00,020
So

770
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,080
you have nothing else scheduled for today?

771
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:04,100
Yes.

772
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,820
Why are you asking?

773
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,140
I am

774
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:10,440
at a VVIP's Namyangju summer house

775
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,720
because of her child's birthday.

776
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:15,870
Two managers canceled on short notice.

777
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,680
Can you come as a replacement?

778
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,540
I lack experience. Will I be of help?

779
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:25,670
You'll be of great help.

780
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:29,370
Young mothers here only want learned people.

781
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:30,940
You'll be more than enough help.

782
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:34,270
Just dress neatly.

783
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:36,320
Okay.

784
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:50,990
Seriously...

785
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:52,370
What?

786
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,320
You said it was acting as a friend.

787
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:56,170
While they're shopping,

788
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:58,090
we're watching their dogs.

789
00:58:58,090 --> 00:58:59,620
What's this for over two hours?

790
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,350
Is this a friend nowadays?

791
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,230
How can people all live the same way?

792
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,840
Think, 'Those people call this being friends.'

793
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,130
'I'm so glad they're not my friends.'

794
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:10,430
And let it go.

795
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:15,850
You've gotten better with words.

796
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:17,430
Are you getting private lessons?

797
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:18,910
Why'd I do that?

798
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:22,410
I learned at Lee Gang-jae School for free.

799
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,040
So cute.

800
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,130
You win.

801
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:28,450
You can graduate now.

802
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:37,000
He'll come to your place after work.

803
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,700
To get some stuff and move it to my study room.

804
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:40,930
Who?

805
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:42,710
Just, of course.

806
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:45,500
What's wrong?

807
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:48,730
I guess I took a break for too long.

808
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,320
Happy Birthday, Ohn-yoo!

809
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:05,620
All kids must have swallowed loudspeakers.

810
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,340
I'm so fed up.

811
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:11,520
But you call your son all day long.

812
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:15,690
I miss him.

813
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,570
Thank you for visiting Central Department Store.

814
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:36,470
You can use the cashier there.

815
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:37,730
Okay. This way.

816
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:38,770
Okay.

817
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:39,780
Hee-Chang?

818
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:40,400
Yes?

819
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,260
Can you ring her up? Thanks.

820
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,800
Have a good day.

821
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,680
We value your business with us.

822
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:52,200
It is now time for us to close.

823
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:51,020
Gyeong-eun

824
01:00:53,710 --> 01:01:00,200
Please continue to shop at our store.

825
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,860
Good job today. Bye.

826
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:27,350
Club friend Choi Min-gu

827
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:31,230
Schoolmate Lee Gyeong-eun's husband passed away today.

828
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,810
Condolences
Seora University Alumni Association

829
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,110
Ma'am.

830
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:18,440
Where should I put the wreath?

831
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:23,960
Put them over there, please.

832
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:09,600
Are you okay?

833
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:14,060
I'm sorry I missed your call.

834
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:20,420
Gyeong-eun!

835
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:21,960
Where are you?

836
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:23,760
Coming!

837
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:27,990
Yuwon Fishing Spot

838
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:52,820
Sir.

839
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:53,790
Yes?

840
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:57,280
Can you stop the car here for a second?

841
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,480
Here?

842
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:00,990
Yes.

843
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:02,160
Okay.

844
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,810
I'll get off here.

845
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:27,450
Yuwon Fishing Spot

846
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:03,210
Be still.

847
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:04,060
Ow, that stings.

848
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,930
It stings. It hurts.

849
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:09,880
This happens when you play outside after dark.

850
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,020
That's why I said let's go home.

851
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:15,050
Take this. Here.

852
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,450
What time is it now?

853
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,770
Nine o'clock.

854
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:21,100
It's almost nine.

855
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:22,520
Did you have dinner?

856
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,840
- Yes.
- No.

857
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:24,870
Huh?

858
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:26,260
Some ate and others didn't?

859
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:27,310
I ate!

860
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:28,110
Me, too!

861
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:29,730
What did you eat?

862
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:30,990
- Cup tteokbokki.
- Cup tteokbokki.

863
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:34,120
Cup tteokbokki isn't a meal. You should have rice.

864
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,920
What did you have?

865
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:39,610
I'm not eating dinner.

866
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:42,080
Because I ate tteokbokki.

867
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:45,080
Jaeyoung Tteokbokki

868
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:45,370
Are you married?

869
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:46,110
What?

870
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:46,840
Married.

871
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Married?

872
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:50,520
Is something going on inside?

873
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:51,850
Yikes.

874
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:53,250
Why aren't you going in?

875
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,030
She came, didn't she?

876
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:58,900
Huh?

877
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:01,450
The rumor spread all the way to Julie's salon.

878
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:03,660
I heard your ex-wife came to see you.

879
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:06,230
Oh, well.

880
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:07,230
Yes.

881
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:10,300
You're better than I thought.

882
01:07:10,670 --> 01:07:11,870
So how'd it go?

883
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:14,050
Did you fight?

884
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,840
Go home now.

885
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,620
Goodbye.

886
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:19,170
Bye. Come again.

887
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:20,540
Okay.

888
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,570
- Go quick.
- Let's go.

889
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:24,410
Hello.

890
01:07:25,530 --> 01:07:26,660
You did your hair.

891
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:27,660
- My hair?
- Yes.

892
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:29,340
Oh, my.

893
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:30,740
What's wrong with me?

894
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:34,080
I came to get painkillers for Julie and forgot.

895
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,380
Come on in.

896
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,450
Okay.

897
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:43,090
I got this on my way from work.

898
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:15,320
If I clean this up, I could live here.

899
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,820
Right, Soon-ju?

900
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:22,060
It's a shame to use this place as a storage room.

901
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:24,430
Should I cancel the study room and live here?

902
01:08:25,659 --> 01:08:26,560
What?

903
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:27,730
Here.

904
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:31,430
This is a good background for my video.

905
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:36,709
I don't think living together is a good idea.

906
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:40,740
Why are you responding to that?

907
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,409
Let it go in one ear and out the other.

908
01:08:46,619 --> 01:08:49,520
You've been in Lee Gang-jae School for years.

909
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:52,289
Why fidget at what a girl like her says?

910
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:53,920
A girl like her?

911
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,230
Don't say that.

912
01:08:56,329 --> 01:08:57,760
Right.

913
01:09:00,829 --> 01:09:02,030
Hey, think carefully.

914
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:03,430
- She's...
- Stop.

915
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:05,440
I can take care of myself.

916
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,740
Right.

917
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,180
Huh?

918
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:15,810
How'd you just know and just get up?

919
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:17,249
What do you mean just get up?

920
01:09:17,249 --> 01:09:20,190
You knew we needed instant noodles and got up.

921
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:23,950
You're telling me to go buy some?

922
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:25,390
Hey, Hair.

923
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:28,360
You should go. We're guests.

924
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:28,280
If it's difficult to call your family,

925
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:30,920
you can call a relative or friend.

926
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,390
We need someone who can safely take you home.

927
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:38,060
Let me go.

928
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:42,570
It's not a crime to be at the reservoir at night.

929
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:44,170
I'm not even a minor.

930
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:46,640
I understand what you're saying.

931
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,300
But we went because someone called it in.

932
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:50,810
It's not your first time being called in for this.

933
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:52,640
And at this reservoir,

934
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,380
many unfortunate things happen.

935
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:56,750
So we have to transfer you to a guardian

936
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,280
to close this properly.

937
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:01,180
There's no one?

938
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:07,390
There's really no one?

939
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:10,460
No.

940
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:13,260
Let go.

941
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:15,670
You're not that older than me!

942
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:18,570
If there's really no one,

943
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:21,040
we have no choice but to call a women's shelter.

944
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,110
We're just following procedure.

945
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:26,110
You can sit there to think. Please let me know.

946
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:28,340
Be quiet!

947
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:34,950
If a person is hurt, we should go to the hospital.

948
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:35,950
Come this way.

949
01:11:35,950 --> 01:11:37,120
Seriously.

950
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,760
Be quiet!

951
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,090
Come this way.

952
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:41,160
What in the world?

953
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,690
Show me your ID.

954
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,450
Hello.

955
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:15,830
I got hit a lot more.

956
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:16,960
This is unfair.

957
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,660
Okay, okay. I got it, so...

958
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:23,600
When Jae-pyeong drinks, he becomes a wacko.

959
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,200
Okay, okay. So Lee Jae-pyeong...

960
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,170
Yes.

961
01:12:27,170 --> 01:12:29,310
Lee Jae-pyeong...

962
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:30,170
Yes.

963
01:12:30,170 --> 01:12:33,740
...drank alcohol and hit Yoon Bong-geon. Like this.

964
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:36,280
- I'll be the one to write that.
- Okay.

965
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:38,280
What time did you start drinking?

966
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:39,850
(Unknown)

967
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,250
Noon.

968
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:41,920
Noon...

969
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:31,430
Detail: Acting to confirm identification
Place: Namyangju Police Station

970
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:33,340
Acting role: Friend

971
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,930
Detail: Acting to confirm identification
Place: Namyangju Police Station

972
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:15,930
Acting role: Friend

973
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:13,370
Lost

974
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,910
Did you know that she was reported

975
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:20,510
for a similar thing in the same reservoir before?

976
01:15:21,210 --> 01:15:23,850
What was Gyeong-eun's husband suffering from?

977
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:27,250
Thank you for coming.

978
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,250
What did you save me as?

979
01:15:30,890 --> 01:15:32,360
Is there somewhere

980
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:34,460
you want to go besides home?

981
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:37,190
Then...

982
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:39,160
Want to go to the mountain,

983
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,800
then to the sea,

984
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:42,570
then home?

985
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:45,170
If you'll be staying longer,

986
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:47,340
want a spare tent?

987
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:51,170
Can I touch your face?
