00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:05,480
(Episode 12, Trusting Him Part 1)

2
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,449
Yes, sir. How may I help you?

3
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:17,960
We're guests staying in Sapphire Villa.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,460
I don't know what went wrong, but...

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,530
Call the general manager.

6
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:22,629
What's the matter?

7
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:24,929
Tell him Shin Dong Hyuk wants
to meet him right now.

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,629
If there's anything
you find uncomfortable, please tell us.

9
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:29,000
We'll deal with it immediately.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,769
- No...
- Are you the general manager?

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,200
I'm not,

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,439
but if you tell us...

13
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:36,170
Tell General Manager Han Tae Jun...

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,509
that this hotel might shut down.

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,350
Yes, Han Tae Jun speaking.

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,250
What? The guests got kicked out?

17
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,020
Who did that?

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,759
Okay, I'll be there soon.

19
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,899
- Yes.
- Hey.

20
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:03,030
What happened?

21
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,569
Come here.

22
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,439
Oh Hyung Man caused trouble.

23
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,069
How could he kick out a guest?
Who did he kick out?

24
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,310
That guest in Sapphire Villa.

25
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:13,140
- Shin Dong Hyuk?
- Yes.

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,980
I would like to kick him out too,

27
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,109
but we can't do that.

28
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,150
We can't.

29
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,019
If he finds out
that we have his documents,

30
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:20,689
he'll sue us right away,
and things will get out of hand.

31
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:22,489
Maybe he already knows everything.

32
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:26,930
Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism
keeps calling us to check if it's true.

33
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,359
It's bad if the media gets wind of it.
What should we do?

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,599
Is he inside?

35
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,280
I heard what happened on the way.

36
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,920
Our employees must've
misunderstood something...

37
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,950
and made a mistake.

38
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,319
It was neither a misunderstanding
nor a mistake in my opinion.

39
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,689
Your deputy general manager
came himself...

40
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,420
and kicked us out...

41
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,189
without getting our consent.

42
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,000
You know the legal responsibilities
for a mistake and a deliberate action...

43
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,269
are very different, right?

44
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,370
I sincerely apologize.

45
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,599
I'm not here for your apology.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,240
We'll deal with that issue quickly.

47
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,110
- Don't worry about it.
- "Don't worry about it?"

48
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:24,849
Do you have the ability
to recollect spilled milk?

49
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,789
I already paid the three-month worth
of the room charge in advance.

50
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:32,520
Since I paid for it,
that villa is my personal space.

51
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,530
The hotel employees who are supposed
to protect the guests' rights...

52
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,030
laid their hands on my personal belongings
without permission...

53
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,770
and even took the room key with them.

54
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,069
I really have nothing to say.

55
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,710
As the general manager,
I sincerely apologize...

56
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,469
about such a mishap.

57
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,740
Let me emphasize again.

58
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:53,550
I'm not here
for your apologies nor excuses.

59
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,580
If you want compensation,

60
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,050
we can refund you the room charges
for the remaining duration,

61
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,520
free meals, or...

62
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,819
It seems that you don't know well
about the law,

63
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:04,090
so don't speak sloppily...

64
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,289
and listen carefully
to what my lawyer says.

65
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,159
Leo.

66
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,159
If some of the documents
we were working on are leaked,

67
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,759
the damage will be huge.

68
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:16,129
I drew out the compensation amount
in case the project fails...

69
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,740
in case the information was leaked.

70
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,810
The project is worth
about 300 million dollars,

71
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,710
and the cash that's handled directly
is 12 million dollars.

72
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,479
We're talking about the compensation...

73
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,909
regarding our employee's mistake.

74
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:30,979
Isn't that too much?

75
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:32,020
Continue.

76
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,490
The trial could be held in the court
in New York...

77
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,719
as requested by the plaintiff
who has US citizenship.

78
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,159
According to my research,
the total amount of assets...

79
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,090
that Seoul Hotel holds is
about 300 million dollars.

80
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:47,629
We could take measures like seizing
the amount of 110 million dollars,

81
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:50,129
which is the real value of the hotel
excluding liabilities.

82
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:52,969
Very promptly, at that.

83
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,639
Stop beating around the bush
and tell us what you want.

84
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,439
For you, who still don't get it,

85
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,009
let me explain one more thing.

86
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,349
If legal measures such as seizure
or trial gets delayed,

87
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:07,419
I could use my connections...

88
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:10,150
and shut this hotel down
for about a month.

89
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:15,289
Seoul Hotel, which is barely hanging on
with the money they get each day,

90
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,000
might practically dead.

91
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,699
If you're going to behave this way,
I have something to say too.

92
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:23,939
The reason you came to our hotel...

93
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:25,040
Ms. Yoon.

94
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:33,540
Good job, Mr. Han.

95
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:37,220
Ms. Yoon.

96
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
If you make a slip of the tongue
in this situation,

97
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,019
it could be used against you later.

98
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,329
Let me give you a word of advice
before we leave.

99
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,899
You better hire the most talented lawyers
in Korea.

100
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:54,500
Maybe about 7 or 8 of them.

101
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,800
It still won't be enough, though.

102
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,779
I think they were dead serious.

103
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,209
Why is such a young person so cold?

104
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:11,720
Don't worry about it too much.

105
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:13,550
They're just scaring us.

106
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,490
How can I not worry, Mr. Han?

107
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,060
Let's talk, Mr. Oh.

108
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,529
Sure thing.

109
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:28,170
What's wrong?

110
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,439
Deputy General Manager Oh Hyung Man
of Seoul Hotel.

111
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,370
Don't you have anything to report to me?

112
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,279
Right, that rat in Sapphire Villa.

113
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,279
I kicked him out.

114
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,980
You seemed to be scared of him,

115
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:44,779
so I carried the ball.
Are you unhappy about it?

116
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,480
Ms. Yoon and I met those guests...

117
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,290
and begged pardon just now.

118
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,149
What should I do, Mr. Oh?

119
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,389
Why treat people who came
to eat up our hotel...

120
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:53,889
as our guests?

121
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:55,829
You should kick them out, obviously.

122
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:57,430
I told you not to cause trouble.

123
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,569
What's wrong about kicking out thieves
from your house?

124
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,500
Can you not tell thieves and guests apart?

125
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,069
You steal hard liquor from the wine cellar
but don't know what a thief is?

126
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,410
You punk.

127
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,649
- Stop, Mr. Oh!
- Stop!

128
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:16,680
- Don't do this.
- What's wrong?

129
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,920
- Stop this.
- Move back!

130
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,920
- Stop.
- How dare you?

131
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,620
Hyung Man, please stop.

132
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,259
You throw your fists around
because you have nothing to say?

133
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,060
You want to fight, is it?

134
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,790
Hyung Man, please don't.

135
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,699
I'm sorry about punching you,

136
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:36,769
but that doesn't mean
you shouldn't take responsibility.

137
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,699
Once this issue is solved, you and I
will take half the responsibility each.

138
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,939
If not, let's settle this with a fight,
be it a fist fight or whatever.

139
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,279
Do as you like.

140
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,879
Just decide the time and place.

141
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,120
Don't play dirty and punch me
in a small office barehanded.

142
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,500
Hyun Chul,
did you move their things into the villa?

143
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,600
I already moved their things into the room
and gave them the key,

144
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,430
but it looks like they will check out
after checking their stuff.

145
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:13,199
It will be bad
if they just leave like this.

146
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,410
Prepare amenities.

147
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,680
Champagne and a bouquet.
I'll bring them up myself.

148
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,860
What are you going to do, boss?

149
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,459
Are you really going to check out?

150
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,430
Boss.

151
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,269
Who is it?

152
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:51,709
Hello, I'm General Manager Han.

153
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,319
Boss, the general manager is here.

154
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,750
Once again, I deeply apologize
for the mistake my employee made.

155
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,379
This won't happen ever again.

156
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,350
I'm sorry, sir.

157
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,990
Take the fruits...

158
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,899
and give them to your employees
who worked hard carrying my stuff out.

159
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,899
Take them out now.

160
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:56,769
I apologize again, sir.

161
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,899
Mr. Han, I clearly told you.

162
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,340
If you want to go against me,
you better be well-prepared.

163
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,809
If you're going to turn this
into a child's play, it won't be fun.

164
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,309
I apologize, sir.

165
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,090
Please calm down
and forgive the hotel's mistake.

166
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,460
Tell Manager Seo...

167
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,789
to come here.

168
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,269
If you want to be forgiven,
tell Manager Seo to come here.

169
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,070
Just her without you.

170
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,529
What about the fruit basket?

171
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:33,200
I gave it
to the employees working outside.

172
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
It really happened as he said.

173
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:50,779
How did he work on something so hard
for 30 years?

174
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,419
He never frowned once either.

175
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,590
He was always nice to the guests.

176
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,759
He joked with the employees
and worked happily.

177
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,330
I still have a long way to go.

178
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:11,399
I wanted to punch that guy earlier.

179
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,570
Good job holding yourself back, Mr. Han.

180
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,980
By the way, what should we do?

181
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,009
I don't know.

182
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,549
Let's think about it tomorrow morning.

183
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:26,580
I'm too tired to think now.

184
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,990
Okay. Rest well.

185
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:39,759
Mr. Han is inside.

186
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,899
No, Hyun Chul.
I wanted to know how it went.

187
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,070
Did it not work out well?

188
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,210
Yes. Mr. Han was just humiliated.

189
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:53,240
What did that guy do?

190
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,950
Tell me quickly.
You know I have a quick temper.

191
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:01,789
Mr. Han told me not to tell you.

192
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,509
Are you insane, Jin Young? Go where?

193
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,980
What else can I do?

194
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:26,480
Don't you have pride?

195
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,909
No, I won't allow it.

196
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:29,710
We're hoteliers, not call girls.

197
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,649
We're not people who come and go
at their whim.

198
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,519
Don't go.

199
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:37,450
Then should I just sit back
when the hotel is in danger?

200
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,659
Well, you can't just sit back.

201
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,690
But don't go.

202
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:46,360
If I can solve it by going there,
there's no reason why I can't go.

203
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,669
Jin Young, aren't you afraid?

204
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:49,830
What's there to be afraid?

205
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,470
Two years ago,
So Yeon went to a guest's room...

206
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,309
for room service,
and she came out with her clothes ripped.

207
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,240
He's not someone who would do that.

208
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:01,850
There aren't specific people
who do that for men.

209
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,350
Then I'll just let him do
whatever he wants.

210
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,250
Do you want me to go with you?

211
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,789
He wanted me to come alone.

212
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,360
See? It's very fishy.

213
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:17,289
Don't go, Jin Young.

214
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,009
Even if I'm late, don't tell Mr. Han.

215
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,909
Of course I won't.

216
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,580
How could I say such a thing to him?

217
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:05,710
How did smart Ms. Seo get fooled
like that?

218
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,279
You can't exactly say that she got fooled.

219
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:09,710
If she's not fooled,
are you saying she planned this with him?

220
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,779
I'm not saying that,
but you can't help it...

221
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:14,120
when a man and a woman fall in love.

222
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,860
You don't know about it in detail,
so don't just say such stuff.

223
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,559
Still,
I hope Jin Young doesn't get other ideas.

224
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,029
You seem to know most about it,
so tell us. Let us listen to the story.

225
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:27,259
Hey, stop. That's not important now.

226
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:30,529
The hotel is in a ruckus
because they messed with the VIP guests.

227
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,600
What's so important about romance?

228
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,639
It's fun.

229
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:34,769
You punk.

230
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:37,210
General Manager Han.

231
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:39,240
You're here, Mr. Han.

232
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:42,049
What happened? Did it work out well?

233
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,080
It's not easy.

234
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,750
CEO Yoon was worried sick...

235
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,419
about hiring lawyers.

236
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,289
I should beg again tomorrow morning.

237
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,220
Everything else is nice,
but in moments like this, a hotel...

238
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,429
Why? Do you regret working here?

239
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:59,559
No. I just feel upset.

240
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,769
Things will get better.
Don't worry about it too much.

241
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,769
Chef,

242
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,570
can I have a glass of soju?

243
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,149
I heard...

244
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:28,029
that you wanted to see me.

245
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:32,059
Sir.

246
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:38,100
- Is that what Mr. Han said?
- No.

247
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,940
He doesn't know I'm here.

248
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,679
Tell me what you want, sir.

249
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,889
Have a seat.

250
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:15,839
I sat down, sir.

251
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:33,460
You'll feel better after drinking it.

252
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:03,319
I drank it as you wished, sir.

253
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:06,819
I feel...

254
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,130
the same.

255
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,569
What else do you want, sir?

256
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:22,710
Please don't speak that way.

257
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,680
How do you want me to speak, sir?

258
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,740
We're not a hotelier and a guest.

259
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,609
I want to talk as Dong Hyuk and Jin Young.

260
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,710
Then...

261
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,220
I have nothing more to say, Dong Hyuk.

262
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,319
I do.

263
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,650
I have things left to say,
so sit down, Jin Young.

264
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,089
Why are you so angry?

265
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,289
Are you angry
because your plan was set back...

266
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:43,589
as your identity was revealed too soon?

267
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:47,829
Or is your pride wounded
because I wasn't fooled until the end?

268
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,799
Is that why
you're taking your anger out...

269
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,599
on the hotel?

270
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,779
Nothing will happen to the hotel.

271
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:02,509
You can be assured.

272
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,920
I'm so thankful that I could cry.

273
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,119
Are these what you call...

274
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,319
crocodile tears?

275
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,390
Even if I'm wrong,

276
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,430
I hope you'll understand...

277
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,970
since you're good in English.

278
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,670
Please, Jin Young,
don't drive me up the wall like this.

279
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:29,410
I tried my best to treat you well.

280
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,940
How did you try your best?

281
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:34,039
Expensive restaurants, a necklace,
and presents?

282
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:37,480
Did you think you could buy me with money?

283
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,579
I...

284
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,349
I just wanted to treat you well.

285
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:43,750
I wanted to see you happy.

286
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:47,519
And those were the only ways I knew.

287
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:52,599
If my ways were wrong, I'm sorry.

288
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,029
From your perspective,

289
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,200
they must not have been wrong.

290
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,700
Do you still not believe me?

291
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,339
I'll get going, sir.

292
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:02,970
Do you still not believe that I love you?

293
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,920
Why did we have to meet like this?

294
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,359
We could have met here
with different jobs.

295
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,529
Why, of all things,

296
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:30,170
did you come to kill the hotel
that I love like myself?

297
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,400
I can't understand, Jin Young.

298
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,109
Work is work. It's not us.

299
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,349
Regardless of who gets this hotel,

300
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,480
if you want, you can stay here...

301
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,420
and become the general manager
or the CEO of the hotel.

302
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,890
I don't understand why you're so obsessed
with this hotel.

303
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,519
You don't understand.

304
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:57,630
This hotel doesn't only have rooms
and restaurants.

305
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:01,099
It has the memories and affections
of numerous people I've worked with.

306
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,640
How can I let someone else take that away?

307
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:06,970
Are you doing this because of that guy?

308
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,240
Han Tae Jun.

309
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:13,210
Han Tae Jun or the hotel.

310
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,849
I want to know which of the two
is holding you back.

311
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,329
I don't know. I really don't know.

312
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,599
I want to believe in you. No,

313
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,700
I rather wish that I didn't trust you.

314
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,809
"It was all a lie.
He was using me deliberately."

315
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,539
I wish I could cover it up like that...

316
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,980
and just become a fool...

317
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,319
and feel at ease.

318
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,049
I put down a lot of things...

319
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:56,349
and went to you.

320
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:03,059
I came too far...

321
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:07,700
to let you go like this.

322
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:12,700
Me too.

323
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,509
Why did you have to come like this
and make me suffer?

324
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,690
You can come back.

325
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,509
If you're done talking,

326
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,410
I'll get going, sir.

327
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,940
He's taking this too far.

328
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,170
He's a complete lunatic.

329
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,339
Who is he to call Ms. Seo to his room?

330
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:25,109
Based on what we saw last time,
it might be possible.

331
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,380
What is?

332
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,950
During Ms. Seo's birthday party,
he almost kissed her like a movie.

333
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,549
Gosh, read the room, will you?

334
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:31,880
Then what now?

335
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:34,180
Are you just putting up with it like that?

336
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:37,049
I have no other choice but to wait.

337
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:39,559
I'm sure he'll calm down tomorrow morning.

338
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:41,990
He doesn't seem like an easy person.

339
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,329
I've been looking for you all this time.
You were here.

340
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,500
Ms. Lee, would you like a glass?

341
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,670
I quit drinking.

342
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,470
You should get rid of your hangover.

343
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:53,670
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

344
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,210
What should I do?
Ms. Seo went up to the villa.

345
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,339
I tried to stop her,

346
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,150
but she went up to meet the 300 roses guy.

347
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:34,039
Why did you come here?

348
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,109
Who told you to come here?

349
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:44,420
- Darn it.
- Don't do that.

350
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:46,789
Nothing happened, Tae Jun.

351
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,089
I'm serious. Nothing happened.

352
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm fine. The hotel...

353
00:24:57,369 --> 00:24:58,769
will be fine too.

354
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:13,039
You can go back, Tae Jun. I'm fine.

355
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,180
- Seriously. Nothing happened...
- You don't have to emphasize that.

356
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,490
Don't deal with the hotel business
as you like from now on.

357
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:29,960
Great work today.

358
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,170
(Women's Dressing Room)

359
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,539
(Email)

360
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,710
(Location search)

361
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:23,049
Hey, help me.

362
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,180
- Where to?
- The warehouse.

363
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,720
Why is a bellman playing with his phone
instead of working?

364
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,819
I wasn't playing.

365
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:33,460
Then were you calling the guests?

366
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,829
Whom I call is none of your business.

367
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,400
It must be nice being the CEO's son.

368
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,299
Nobody scolds you
for doing whatever you like.

369
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:43,000
I should improve my skills quickly
and become the best chef.

370
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,240
It won't be easy to scout me
after you become the CEO.

371
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,670
I'm not interested in the CEO position.

372
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:49,640
Young Jae.

373
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,480
Take this.

374
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:02,420
My gosh. Are you crazy?

375
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,990
Are you back to work?
Did your father approve?

376
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:09,730
Yes. I can work without worrying now.

377
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,029
That's great to hear.

378
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:13,329
Did you say hello to others?
What about Mr. Yoo?

379
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,970
Not yet. I'm going to say hello
to the general manager first.

380
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,769
Yes.

381
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,869
Come in. The door's open.

382
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:29,710
You're surprised, right?

383
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,279
What happened?

384
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,519
Aren't you glad to see me?

385
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:34,980
I am, but how did you come here?

386
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,420
I told you I would come back.

387
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:41,019
You didn't give my position
to someone else, right?

388
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,029
I didn't, but...

389
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:45,259
Then can I start working again from today?

390
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:47,660
But is it okay for you to come back?

391
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:50,369
Don't worry.
I already settled it with my father.

392
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,039
Why?

393
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:55,170
Do you feel uncomfortable...

394
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:58,039
because my father is Chairman Kim
of Hangang Logistics?

395
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,609
Do you hate me now because of my father?

396
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:02,980
No, that's not it.

397
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,079
Then it's fine.

398
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,079
I can work hard now without worrying.

399
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,349
Okay. Working hard is great,

400
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:09,890
but I have something to ask you first.

401
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:11,049
What is it?

402
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:14,759
Why are you trying to work hard
at a hotel, and Seoul Hotel, at that?

403
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:16,130
- I mean...
- You're asking...

404
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,559
why I'm desperately
and stubbornly trying to work here...

405
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,029
when I'm from a rich family who doesn't
need to work to earn money, right?

406
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:23,730
- Yes.
- Tae Jun, break this habit now.

407
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,039
- You need to break it.
- Break what?

408
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,670
Beating around the bush
and asking a question...

409
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,440
when we both know the answer.

410
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:33,480
You know that I'm working here
because I'm interested in you.

411
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,049
Isn't it natural
that I want to stay close...

412
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:38,619
to someone that I like and love?

413
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,019
So why do you try to check it constantly?

414
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,250
Are you worried
about how others might see us?

415
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,259
The age difference?

416
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,829
I told you not to worry
about stuff like that.

417
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:51,029
Goodness. Yoon Hee.

418
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:52,859
But I have one more reason.

419
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:54,900
I can ask that
because I really don't know.

420
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:56,299
I'll tell you.

421
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,299
The second reason why I'm working
at a hotel besides you.

422
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,109
I really want to learn
about working at a hotel.

423
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:03,839
I want to learn it and manage a hotel.

424
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:05,940
You want to become a true hotelier?

425
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,680
Yes, so help me.

426
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:09,680
That's good news.

427
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,309
I have a smart junior now.

428
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:13,250
Don't get overjoyed.

429
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,390
You have a strong rival now.

430
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:16,950
Is that so?

431
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:20,259
Anyway, I'm really happy to see you.

432
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,059
Are you keeping the ball I threw
at you well?

433
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:31,500
General Manager Han,
teach me what I should do now.

434
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,039
I'll call Mr. Yoo,

435
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,670
so go down and say hello first.

436
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,509
Okay, Mr. Han.

437
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,950
I really missed you.

438
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,390
Hello.

439
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,859
- Gosh, Yoon Hee!
- How have you been?

440
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:54,990
You're really back.

441
00:30:55,089 --> 00:30:56,589
- I'm glad that you look healthy.
- It's nice to see you.

442
00:30:56,589 --> 00:30:57,890
Thank you for worrying about me.

443
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,400
Mr. Yoo, I'm back.

444
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,329
Yoon Hee, it's nice to see you!

445
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:02,869
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

446
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:05,130
I'll work hard without causing trouble.

447
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,099
You flipped the restaurant upside down.

448
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:08,839
You must've been very shocked.

449
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:10,970
But seeing how you came back brightly,

450
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,680
I guess
the new generation sure is different.

451
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,049
It's not the generation that's different.
It's the world we live in.

452
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,650
What's wrong with you?

453
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,849
Why did you come back?

454
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,750
Sorry?

455
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:22,890
Those guys weren't loan sharks.

456
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,690
They were sent by your father.

457
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:27,819
How great is your father
that they caused such a rampage?

458
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:30,829
If you're a daughter
of such a powerful family,

459
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:32,630
you should stay
in your nice house quietly.

460
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,000
Why would you come here?

461
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:35,369
Ms. An.

462
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,000
You're not in the position to say that.

463
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,839
Mr. Yoo,
why are you suddenly being servile to her?

464
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,210
What? Servile? Watch your mouth.

465
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,039
I love all employees equally.

466
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,049
I don't see equality.

467
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:50,910
Someone here works hard
until their legs swell...

468
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,920
to pay for the living expense
and the younger sibling's school fees.

469
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,420
But someone comes here just to have fun...

470
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,450
and comes and goes as she likes.
How is this equal?

471
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,589
I'm sorry I fooled you, Mi Hee.

472
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:02,559
But I come here
to learn about the work seriously.

473
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,359
I won't come and go as I like.

474
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,529
Forget it, princess.

475
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,660
Because people like you use connection
to get the job,

476
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,529
people who really need the job...

477
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:12,069
can't get one even if they study hard.

478
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,640
Regardless of how I got the job,

479
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,109
since I'm here, I'll work hard.

480
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,309
I'm not a princess
nor a rich girl who came to have fun...

481
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:20,809
like you said.

482
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:22,549
Can't you help me?

483
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:23,710
Of course.

484
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,680
Food and Beverage is one family.

485
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,279
Like a younger sister and an older sister,
and like a dad for me.

486
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,619
We should help and support each other.

487
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:32,420
You be her family.

488
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,259
I don't want a family member
who's full of herself.

489
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:35,690
Mi Hee.

490
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,160
My gosh.

491
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:47,200
What should I do first, Mr. Yoo?

492
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:54,240
Is there anything else you need?

493
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,329
Is there anything you find uncomfortable?

494
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,529
No.

495
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,470
That's not it.

496
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:17,700
Is that your real name?

497
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,069
My name?

498
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:21,599
Yes.

499
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,970
Yes, it is.

500
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,539
Yoon Hee.

501
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,279
Is there anything else you need?

502
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:32,480
No. I don't need anything else.

503
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:35,819
If you need anything, please call me.

504
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,289
Okay.

505
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:42,630
- Thank you.
- Sure.

506
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,269
Stop flirting with a customer
during your work time and work properly.

507
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:51,900
- I was serving him with words.
- Don't talk back.

508
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,539
What's this? Would the customers want
to drink when the pot is so dirty?

509
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,839
Wipe all the silver trays
in the restaurant tonight.

510
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,809
Silver tray...

511
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,950
You don't even know what a silver tray is?

512
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:06,720
- Metal plates.
- Okay.

513
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,679
Don't think of slacking off.

514
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,849
Wipe them until they shine.

515
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,559
I should wipe them all on my own?

516
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,960
If that's hard, call your housekeeper.

517
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:41,949
Here.

518
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,820
Drink this.

519
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,460
I thought you would be thirsty
based on what I heard.

520
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:49,659
What did you hear?

521
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:51,760
You got yourself a big enemy
as soon as you came back.

522
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,630
It seems that Ms. An decided
to single you out.

523
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,900
Did the rumors spread already?

524
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,329
There are a lot of talkers in the hotel.

525
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,340
And people
won't leave a star like you alone.

526
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:03,269
Am I a star? I don't want that.

527
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:05,139
I just want to learn how to work quietly.

528
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,079
In this country,
it becomes a sin if your parents are rich.

529
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:11,480
You and I have to walk on eggshells
to work at a place like this...

530
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,920
than going around wasting money.

531
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,750
I understand
why Mi Hee is acting that way.

532
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,260
They joined the hotel fair and square...

533
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,860
after going through difficult tests,

534
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,960
but I joined for free,
so she must be unhappy.

535
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:24,829
Still, tell me if it gets too far.

536
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,630
Don't do anything stupid, Young Jae.

537
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,570
I wouldn't have come here
in the first place...

538
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,869
if I wanted to stay comfortably
with your help.

539
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,099
I'll learn how to work
and hone my skills on my own...

540
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,969
- and later...
- What will you do later?

541
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:40,079
Learn how to serve
so you can serve your husband well later?

542
00:35:40,409 --> 00:35:42,179
You're so young, but you have no ambition.

543
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:43,179
Ambition?

544
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,780
Gosh, that's harsh.

545
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:47,780
What's your ambition?

546
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,989
Me? I'm going to be a hotel CEO.

547
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:52,150
"A hotel CEO?"

548
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:56,789
Hey. You'll be dead meat if you
look down on me because I'm a woman.

549
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,699
There's something that suits you better...

550
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:02,030
than a hotel CEO.

551
00:36:02,769 --> 00:36:03,769
What is it?

552
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:05,369
The wife of a hotel CEO.

553
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,599
Take this.
I'm not drinking what you gave me.

554
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,070
Yoon Hee, I can be the hotel CEO.

555
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:13,579
Dream on.

556
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,489
Welcome.

557
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:32,059
Ms. Seo, why are you here?

558
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,460
Right.

559
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:39,139
The person in charge went to the infirmary
for a while, so I'm looking after here.

560
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:40,139
But...

561
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,210
did you get back to work?

562
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,739
Yes. I'm working again starting today.

563
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:46,940
I'll be in your care.

564
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,449
What brings you here?

565
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,349
I'm here to print out some documents
for Tae Jun.

566
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:54,519
Tae Jun...

567
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,420
What is it?

568
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,260
He seemed to be very concerned...

569
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,159
about the newly opening Casablanca.

570
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,789
So I looked up the internet
and gathered Mediterranean dishes...

571
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,500
and interior designs.

572
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,099
- The internet?
- Yes.

573
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:11,429
Most of them are restaurants
with live music performances.

574
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:14,269
Amira Restaurant in San Francisco...

575
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:15,570
does belly dancing.

576
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:17,769
You know belly dancing, right?

577
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:20,239
Yes. Belly, yes.

578
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,510
I don't think I'll be of much help,

579
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,510
but I did it
so Tae Jun could cool down his head.

580
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,750
I see. But...

581
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,820
I don't know how to print them.

582
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:34,519
Then I'll come back later.

583
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,630
Or could you just pass him
the floppy disk?

584
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,329
Okay.

585
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:43,369
- Thank you.
- Yoon Hee.

586
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:44,400
Yes?

587
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,570
Wouldn't you be in trouble
for calling Tae Jun by his name...

588
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,909
in the hotel?

589
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,809
Right, I think so.

590
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,179
I call him Mr. Han in front of others.

591
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:58,349
Jin Young...

592
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,420
Since it's you, Ms. Seo,
I called him by his name.

593
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,289
Please pass him the floppy disk.

594
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,280
What are you doing here?

595
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,750
Mr. Han.

596
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:40,590
Why are you here and not in the lobby?

597
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,889
I'm filling in for someone for a while.

598
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:44,389
Right. This.

599
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,099
What is this?

600
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,070
They're information
about Mediterranean dishes...

601
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:52,300
and restaurant interior designs
from the internet.

602
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,469
For my reference?

603
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,210
- Yes.
- What's gotten into you, Jin Young?

604
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,940
Right. After two hours,
I'm going to check Casablanca...

605
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,210
doing its test run with the employees,
so drop by later.

606
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,980
Okay.

607
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,250
You're commendable, Jin Young.

608
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:11,619
I'm not the one who's commendable.
It's your girlfriend.

609
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,719
- What do you mean?
- Kim Yoon Hee.

610
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,090
She told me to pass it to you.

611
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:19,630
I can't use the internet
because my computer broke down.

612
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:24,300
You must be happy
to have a commendable girlfriend.

613
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,469
See you later.

614
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,809
What about other schedules?

615
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,949
Things are settled with Eric.

616
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,750
He'll come here anytime you call him.

617
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,449
What's gotten into him?

618
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,090
I guess he's going to be loyal to you
with all his might.

619
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,360
There must be a reason.

620
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,500
I think he's gay.

621
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:54,900
Gosh, Leo.

622
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,400
- Another glass of martini, please.
- Okay.

623
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,900
What's up with you?
You're drinking a lot today.

624
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,699
Things are complicated.

625
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:03,840
Both my head and my heart.

626
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,010
So it's about Seo Jin Young.

627
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,280
Isn't it over?

628
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,320
She loves me too.

629
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:17,920
Oh, my gosh.

630
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,289
Are you going overtime?

631
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:23,130
She must be having a hard time now.

632
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:29,099
She's going to date you
even after knowing who you are?

633
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,929
No.

634
00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:34,199
She said she couldn't come back.

635
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:37,539
Then it's not overtime. It's a cold game.

636
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:41,179
I...

637
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:45,449
Do you think I'll be able to forget her?

638
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:47,179
Boss.

639
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,489
Love is like liquor.

640
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,559
Strong liquor makes your head ache...

641
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:55,829
and your stomach lurch.

642
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,199
But no matter how strong the liquor is,

643
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:02,099
you'll get over the hangover
after some time.

644
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,570
That woman...

645
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:13,079
might be the only one in my life.

646
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:15,340
You love her that much?

647
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,880
Yes.

648
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,380
I might stay drunk on her
for the rest of my life.

649
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,190
Then you must hold on to her
no matter what.

650
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:26,019
It's not like we can live for centuries.

651
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:28,420
You can't waste the one-and-only chance
in your life.

652
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:33,730
But how will you hold on to her?

653
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:36,969
A deal.

654
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,670
A deal?

655
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:42,340
I want to place my bet one last time.

656
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,110
Your professionalism is showing.

657
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:49,210
You're an expert at making the last deal.

658
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:51,480
So...

659
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,219
Is it the hotel or her?

660
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,900
You guys watched
the movie "Casablanca," right?

661
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,670
- Yes.
- Isn't it featuring that actor?

662
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,000
It's like the James Bond movie.
Have you watched it?

663
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,670
No, it's an old movie.

664
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,539
The male protagonist
is Humphrey something.

665
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:17,170
The movie stars Humphrey Bogart
and Ingrid Bergman.

666
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:20,440
Do you know where the movie took place,
Ms. Seo?

667
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,849
Ms. Seo.

668
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,579
Ms. Seo.

669
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:28,679
Yes?

670
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:31,190
I have a student sleeping
during class time.

671
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:33,889
"Casablanca" which depicted...

672
00:42:33,889 --> 00:42:35,260
a beautiful and sad love story
took place...

673
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,860
in a restaurant in Morocco.

674
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,989
The basic concept of this place...

675
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:41,559
is based on the exotic
and mysterious atmosphere of Morocco.

676
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,099
Let's go down to the first floor. Right.

677
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,599
We're doing the test run
on the first floor,

678
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,699
so there might be customers.

679
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:47,769
Please be quiet.

680
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:48,800
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

681
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,119
Can you come to the cathedral?

682
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:17,090
The cathedral
where I was going to confess to you.

683
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:24,969
I think this is our last chance.

684
00:44:26,769 --> 00:44:29,409
The last chance for you who's always busy
with work and is impatient...

685
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:33,579
to listen to me without any interruption.

686
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:37,980
Come by midnight.

687
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:41,050
I'm not sure if I can.

688
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:42,280
You must come.

689
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:50,630
I'll wait for you.

690
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:21,389
- Did you have fun, Ms. Seo?
- Yes.

691
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:25,860
Yes, mouthkeeping...
It must've become a habit.

692
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,760
This is Lee Soon Jung of housekeeping.

693
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:29,400
It's that person.

694
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:32,429
Hello? Yes, Jin Young...

695
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:33,769
I'll answer it.

696
00:45:34,269 --> 00:45:35,869
came back just now.

697
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:39,739
Hello?

698
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,039
Yes, I just came back.

699
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:44,679
There are times when I get out of it too.

700
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,579
Thank you for your present last time.

701
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,420
Yes, the fountain pen.

702
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:57,059
I want to use it to sign our document
at the cathedral tonight.

703
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,289
I understand.

704
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:01,130
I can't promise you for sure, but...

705
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:05,570
I promise.

706
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,070
Okay.

707
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,039
What is it, Jin Young? Promise what?

708
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,079
Wake up, Jin Young. What did you promise?

709
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,579
I'm going to meet him.

710
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,750
You must be crazy.

711
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,519
You threw away your pride, dignity,
the honor of Seoul Hotel, and everything.

712
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:26,360
You are crazy about a guy.

713
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,090
Yes, I'm not in my right mind. I'm crazy.

714
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:31,190
I also don't know why I'm doing this.
But one thing I'm sure about is...

715
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,260
- What are you sure about?
- I miss him.

716
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:37,769
- What should you do now?
- What should I do now?

717
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:40,800
Don't answer it.

718
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,070
Answer it.

719
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,480
Hello?

720
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:52,650
Sorry, Mr. Han.

721
00:46:53,179 --> 00:46:54,949
I went to the restroom for a while.

722
00:46:56,489 --> 00:46:57,519
Now?

723
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,590
I can't.

724
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:03,159
Ms. Lee has a lot of work to do,

725
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:05,889
so I'm helping her.

726
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,929
Look at you. You're even using me now.

727
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:13,599
Yes. Thank you for your hard work.

728
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:25,710
Do you know how I'm feeling now?

729
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,650
How would I know?

730
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,820
I have no experience.

731
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:52,269
That person isn't going back
even though the restaurant is closed.

732
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:53,639
He keeps staring at you, Yoon Hee.

733
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,079
Is he a stalker?

734
00:47:55,179 --> 00:47:57,010
Go and tell him we're closed.

735
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:59,880
If I tell the customer to leave
before he leaves on his own,

736
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:01,150
I'll get fired.

737
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,219
You coward.
Don't you even have that much courage?

738
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:07,019
- Okay.
- No, I'll go.

739
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:09,260
- Yoon Hee.
- It's okay.

740
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,489
I think he'll leave fast that way.

741
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:14,860
Gosh, Jung Sik.

742
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,530
I was going to go.

743
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,469
How was your meal, sir?

744
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,769
Why didn't you eat?

745
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:26,679
- I wasn't hungry.
- I see.

746
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:30,050
Sir, I'm sorry, but we're closed.

747
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:32,380
I'm so sorry.

748
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,519
It's okay. We're sorry.

749
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:36,420
Should I send the bill to your room?

750
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:39,250
I'll pay here.

751
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,190
Please help him with the payment.

752
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,630
- Come again.
- Okay.

753
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,429
- Sir, please come this way.
- Okay.

754
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:54,199
I think he's an innocent guy.

755
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:56,099
You must be used to men looking at you.

756
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,409
I'm not.

757
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,440
Yoon Hee.

758
00:48:58,539 --> 00:49:01,380
I told you to shine the silver trays.
What are you doing here?

759
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,650
We just closed and are cleaning up.

760
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:04,780
I was going to go down.

761
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,780
Once you're done, come back up...

762
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,079
and check the table settings
before you leave.

763
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:08,650
- What?
- You don't want to?

764
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:10,750
- Mi Hee, what...
- Be quiet.

765
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:14,320
Everyone else, get changed and go out.
We have a get-together.

766
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,389
Okay.

767
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,230
Let's see who wins, that arrogant brat.

768
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,369
What's wrong with you?

769
00:49:26,469 --> 00:49:28,139
She's aggravating.

770
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,800
(I'll wait.)

771
00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:19,570
(I'll wait. Call me.)

772
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,210
Hey, Yoon Hee. How was your sleep?

773
00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:52,969
Good. I fell asleep,

774
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:55,179
and someone wiped all the plates.

775
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,980
Do you know
who did such a commendable deed?

776
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:00,849
Well, I'm not sure.

777
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:06,420
That great guy could take you home too.

778
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:08,590
Right?

779
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:09,760
Okay, I'll go out now.

780
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,159
Wait in front of the employee exit.

781
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,730
No, it will take some time.

782
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,429
Women can't get changed that fast.

783
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:19,630
Excuse me.

784
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,670
Gosh, sir.

785
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:27,940
What brings you here? We're closed.

786
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,070
Is it completely closed?

787
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:32,869
Yes.

788
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:37,210
Then can you go somewhere nice...

789
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:39,250
and have a cup of coffee with me?

790
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:40,849
Pardon?

791
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,789
One hour...
No, just thirty minutes will do.

792
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:48,489
Can you have a cup of coffee with me?

793
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:52,159
I'm sorry. I can't.

794
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,900
Then what about tomorrow?

795
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,670
I do my best to serve the customers
who come to the restaurant,

796
00:55:01,269 --> 00:55:03,469
but I can't spend my personal time
with them.

797
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:04,869
I'm sorry.

798
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:06,369
Wait.

799
00:55:07,409 --> 00:55:08,639
Yoon Hee.

800
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:15,820
My girlfriend's name was Yoon Hee too.

801
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:20,820
I met her in this restaurant
of this hotel.

802
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:22,989
It was fun.

803
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,590
But we broke up a month ago.

804
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,900
I can't forget Yoon Hee,

805
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,599
but she doesn't let me meet her anymore.

806
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:38,570
She won't meet me
because I'm a coward, foolish,

807
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,510
and jobless.

808
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,010
At first, Yoon Hee...

809
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:49,320
That is, you, Kim Yoon Hee...

810
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,789
and my girlfriend Jung Yoon Hee...

811
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:54,190
looked so alike,

812
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:59,730
so I was really shocked. But later,
I found out you had the same name too.

813
00:56:01,059 --> 00:56:05,030
So I thought this was fate.

814
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:06,099
Fate.

815
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,570
Sir.

816
00:56:08,969 --> 00:56:10,340
Don't do this.

817
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,610
Please go on a date with me once.

818
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,539
Just once. Go on a date with me,
pretending to be my girlfriend.

819
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:20,050
Just once. Please?

820
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:22,179
What are you doing?

821
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:27,559
I'm sorry, sir.

822
00:56:27,789 --> 00:56:28,989
Darn it.

823
00:56:28,989 --> 00:56:30,389
Is there anyone?

824
00:56:30,389 --> 00:56:32,389
Is nobody here?

825
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,429
Hey!

826
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:37,829
Why are you running away, Yoon Hee?
