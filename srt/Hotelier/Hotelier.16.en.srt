00:00:01,169 --> 00:00:02,870
(Episode 16, Hero of Their Own)

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,820
("Suspicion on the Source of the Funds
of Seoul Hotel Takeover?")

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,289
("Chairman Kim of Hangang Logistics
Conducts Unreasonable Takeover")

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,789
Do you think Han Tae Jun tipped them off?

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,859
I'm sure of it.

6
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:23,399
Who else knows so well about us?

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,030
Someone around you
or the creditors might have leaked it.

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,269
I have a lot of friends in the press.

9
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:33,039
I know very well
who Han Tae Jun is meeting too.

10
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:35,670
Even so,
you don't need to get so worked up...

11
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:38,140
over this much media manipulation.

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,649
What are you saying, Frank?

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,549
If something goes wrong and we get
investigated by National Tax Service,

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,149
it will be like throwing a wrench
in the works.

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,020
This looks like the newspaper
for tomorrow morning.

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,189
I barely stopped it by threatening them
to cut off all the advertisements...

17
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:54,530
if they published a speculative article
without any evidence.

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,630
We better kick him in the teeth
before he does something odd again.

19
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,229
He's struggling
because he's driven to a corner.

20
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,700
It's better to leave the back street open
for him to run away.

21
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,040
There's no need, Frank.

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,209
Weeds grow
no matter how many times you cut them.

23
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,109
The only way is to plow the whole field.

24
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:15,849
Hello?

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,019
Yes. Hold on.

26
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:22,650
Speaking of the devil.

27
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,519
- Is it Han Tae Jun?
- Yes.

28
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:29,689
Shin Dong Hyuk speaking.

29
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,730
I know.

30
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,170
Aren't there too many spectators
for a game between just us?

31
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,239
The resignation letter?
Did you expect me to leave...

32
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,840
after giving you a postcard?

33
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,939
Of course not.

34
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,950
Sure. We should fight in the ring...

35
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,219
instead of arguing outside.

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,019
Yes, exclusively.

37
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,290
I'll be waiting.

38
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,719
Don't retreat
after listening to him, Frank.

39
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,730
Don't worry about the newspaper.

40
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,629
I'll deal with Han Tae Jun.

41
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:04,629
Chairman Kim,
pretend you don't know anything.

42
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,080
Frank is too soft...

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,210
because he was in the US for too long.

44
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,050
There are some things you can't settle
with words.

45
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,919
I also believe showing through actions...

46
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:28,050
is more direct and effective.

47
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,780
It's me, Dong Hyuk.

48
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,210
Let's meet if you're free.

49
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,479
I have something to give you.

50
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,490
No, it's not a necklace.

51
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,990
A hotel employee left something
in my room.

52
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,030
That's for the concierge to handle,
not me.

53
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,599
Do you need me to send a bellman?

54
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:13,900
No, you don't need to.

55
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,900
I know that,

56
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:20,870
but there wasn't an employee
named Seo Jin Young at the concierge.

57
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:25,680
I need that person's help now.

58
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:29,810
Okay, I'll go there right now.

59
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,349
Where?

60
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:34,889
Okay.

61
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,530
Is someone looking for Hyun Chul?

62
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,229
No, I need to go there myself.

63
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,360
I wondered
whether you could come right away...

64
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:18,800
if I called and said I wanted
to see you because I missed you.

65
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,529
- I'm on duty.
- Because you're on duty.

66
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:34,050
What did the employee leave behind?

67
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,350
What's this?

68
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,560
Mr. Han's resignation letter?

69
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:56,170
Why is this in your room?

70
00:04:57,769 --> 00:04:59,540
Did you make him submit it?

71
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,470
You could say that.

72
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,579
You don't care about others
as long as you get what you want.

73
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,449
I'm scared of this side of you.

74
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:10,750
This hotel is everything to Tae Jun.

75
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,089
Don't you know that telling him
to resign is like telling him to die?

76
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:22,990
If something bad happens to Tae Jun
because of you,

77
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:26,329
I won't be able to see you again
no matter what.

78
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:34,009
Don't do this ever again.

79
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,709
(Letter of Resignation)

80
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,560
I thought you would be resting well
in a quiet place after resigning.

81
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,459
My resignation is not accepted yet.

82
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,529
I heard you did something big outside.

83
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:05,029
You'll be surprised when you read
tomorrow's morning newspaper.

84
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,959
Chairman Kim is quick on his feet,

85
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,430
so it won't be as easy as you think.

86
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,139
We have more documents than you think.

87
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,670
Tomorrow morning's article is
just a snippet.

88
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,439
You must've studied a lot about stocks.

89
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:21,410
You know what our plan is,

90
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,819
and you have
all of our scenarios memorized.

91
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,519
That's not studying.

92
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,019
Anyway, since you have a weapon too,

93
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,220
let's make a deal.

94
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:37,060
- Firstly...
- That's not how you do it.

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,730
When you make a deal,
ask what the other person wants first.

96
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:43,670
I'll do it my way.

97
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:45,300
There are basic ways to do business.

98
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,370
Doing what I feel like doing
is my way of doing business.

99
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,470
If you don't like it,
forget about the deal.

100
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,209
Go ahead.

101
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:58,480
Call off the retrenchment.

102
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,620
What's next?

103
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,189
The press will say you forced me
to resign.

104
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,560
So...

105
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,129
officially return the resignation letter
and apologize to the board of directors.

106
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:10,529
And?

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,230
Promise me that this won't happen again.

108
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,129
Continue.

109
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,540
That's all.

110
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,240
If you agree to my terms,
I won't send more documents to the press.

111
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,240
Fine.

112
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,379
But I can't give you back
the resignation letter.

113
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:30,819
I already ripped it.

114
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,350
As I said over the phone,

115
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,190
play the game only in the ring.

116
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,090
- But...
- I'll send notice to the board.

117
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,460
- Leo.
- I'll get it done by 10 a.m. tomorrow.

118
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,600
If you want to resign again,

119
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:49,769
submit the resignation letter directly
to the CEO of Seoul Hotel.

120
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,000
I don't have the authority to process it.

121
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,539
- You knew.
- When the show is over,

122
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:59,909
bring down the curtains
and enjoy people's applause.

123
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,379
It's too bad...

124
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,149
that someone as intelligent as you
is working with someone dirty...

125
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,490
like Chairman Kim.

126
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:24,470
Good night, sir.

127
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,000
Go back safely, Mr. Han.

128
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,539
You must know who I am.

129
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,909
Did Chairman Kim send you?

130
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:07,450
He told me to bring you safely.

131
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,980
Let's not do this
in the middle of the night.

132
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:12,750
Tell him
to come to the hotel tomorrow morning...

133
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,149
Withdraw now?

134
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:48,649
I even finished the second list.

135
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,090
Do as I say, Mr. Oh.

136
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,990
Let the employees work normally...

137
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,860
and announce that the restructuring
will be reviewed again.

138
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,259
Even Han Tae Jun ran away
with his tail between his legs.

139
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,200
I don't understand what you're scared of
that you're doing this.

140
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,100
You don't have to try and understand.

141
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:09,009
This is to save the hotel.

142
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:12,009
I'm prepared for the pain
of cutting off my own flesh.

143
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,679
Even if I have to give back my salary,

144
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,279
- I'm determined to save the hotel.
- This isn't about your salary.

145
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:18,549
Just do as I say.

146
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,580
Carry it out right away.

147
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,490
There must be someone...

148
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,289
among the employees speaking nonsense
to you.

149
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,129
You shouldn't be so gullible
to carry out a big plan.

150
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:31,860
What do you mean?

151
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,500
You having a scandal...

152
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,029
with Seo Jin Young
in the hotel is none of my business,

153
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,840
but it shouldn't affect your work.

154
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:43,269
Are you teaching me?

155
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,279
It's embarrassing to watch an employee
under me fooling around...

156
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,610
with a guest as is.

157
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,879
But that guest happens
to be the hotel's savior,

158
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,419
so I don't know...

159
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,490
what kind of expression I should put on.

160
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,879
Darn it.

161
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,159
Mr. Han, do you play golf too?

162
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,570
Golf doesn't work the way
you think it will.

163
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,870
But when you try to cajole it,
it just makes you end up frustrated.

164
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,169
So...

165
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,639
I feel relieved when I beat it to death.

166
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,779
It doesn't matter whether the ball falls
into a river or goes out of bounds.

167
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,950
Just...

168
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:01,250
beat it!

169
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,320
I heard about you, Chairman Kim,

170
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,120
but I didn't know
you were someone like this.

171
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,559
Goodness.

172
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,059
People don't know what kind
of person I am at first,

173
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,600
so they occasionally make mistakes.

174
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,799
You seem...

175
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,370
to be quick-witted.

176
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,399
I think you're wasting your time.

177
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,870
Right.

178
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,269
I forgot that I was supposed to drink
with the CEO Lee of Jeil Newspaper.

179
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,080
Since we're both busy,

180
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,679
let's cut to the chase.

181
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,379
How much do you want?

182
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:36,289
Your life's worth salary, bonus,
severance pay, and pride.

183
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,659
How much are they in total?

184
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,429
About 300 million dollars.

185
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,830
You're a pretty good joker.

186
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,500
Listen when I'm still smiling.

187
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:53,299
Don't regret it after monkeying around.

188
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,909
I only have two conditions.

189
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:00,480
Cooperate when Seoul Hotel is passed to me
and stay away from my daughter.

190
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:05,019
If you listen to me,
you'll become the CEO of the hotel.

191
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,320
If not...

192
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,960
I don't want
to kick out a competent person like you,

193
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,230
so I'm giving you a chance.

194
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,200
It would be a waste if only Dong Hyuk gets
the money and goes back to the US, right?

195
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,929
If you buy people with money,

196
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm sure you can get more people
like Dong Hyuk.

197
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:27,299
You're dragging it for too long
with a busy person.

198
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,769
I'll pretend
that I didn't hear what you said today.

199
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,639
Are you not taking me seriously?

200
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,679
Did I sound like...

201
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,580
I was joking?

202
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,419
That's pretty much it.

203
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,190
Mr. Jung.

204
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,820
Yes, sir.

205
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,320
Play with him as you like.

206
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:50,230
Yes, sir.

207
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,110
The air's fresh here,

208
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,340
so if you sleep tight until dawn,

209
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:41,750
your head will clear.

210
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,350
Let's go.

211
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,120
Are you sure, Jenny? Did you see it?

212
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,990
Yes. It was put up in the cafeteria,

213
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,730
and Mr. No knows about it too.

214
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,159
Then will all the people
whose names were on the list...

215
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,500
not get fired...

216
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,799
and work like before, Ms. Seo?

217
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,269
Yes, that's right.

218
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,299
So go back
to your posts starting tomorrow...

219
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,039
and work normally.

220
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:11,210
I'm happy for you, Geum Soon.
Congratulations.

221
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,440
Then there won't be any more retrenchment?

222
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,350
Mr. Han made Shin Dong Hyuk promise...

223
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,580
not to do it ever again.

224
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,149
Why is he still staying in our hotel?

225
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,990
There must be multiple reasons.

226
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,149
It's not common to find hotels
with great views and delicious food...

227
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,360
like ours.

228
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,830
There must be another reason besides that.

229
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,990
Manager Lee Soon Jung.

230
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:31,730
Don't say something unnecessary
and manage Housekeeping now.

231
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,600
I wonder what the reason is.

232
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,570
Ms. Lee, keep your mouth shut now...

233
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,240
and tell us what to do.

234
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,000
Do as you always did.

235
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,309
What's the reason?

236
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,840
Everyone, get back to work.

237
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,279
Lastly, let's clap for Mr. Han...

238
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,710
who saved us!

239
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:53,149
Where did Mr. Han go?

240
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,590
Isn't he in Ms. Yoon's office?

241
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,889
Ms. Yoon got off work.

242
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,990
He couldn't sleep a wink yesterday,

243
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,519
so he must be sleeping in his room.

244
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,860
It's only right for someone...

245
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,029
to go give him some night snacks
as our representative.

246
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,130
- Exactly.
- Food and Beverage will do it.

247
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,559
Hey, can't you read the room?

248
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,799
What?

249
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:13,670
Ms. Seo,
you should go as our representative.

250
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:16,210
Anyone can go.

251
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,180
Just what is the reason?

252
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,319
Tae Jun.

253
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,750
Tae Jun, are you sleeping already?

254
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,690
He's not back yet.

255
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:48,109
What are you doing here, Yoon Hee?

256
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,380
I prepared some night snacks
in case he was tired.

257
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,150
Did you call Tae Jun in advance?

258
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,049
I just heard
that he visited Sapphire Villa.

259
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,859
I haven't heard from him since then.
He wouldn't pick up my call too.

260
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:09,289
I don't know about it in detail,

261
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,599
but I thought
Ms. Yoon had a word with you.

262
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,000
Do you want me...

263
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:21,809
to leave this hotel too?

264
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:24,269
I'm not saying that's what I want.
But that's what Ms. Yoon would want.

265
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,140
Did I do something so wrong?

266
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,650
Is being a daughter
of Chairman Kim such a bad thing...

267
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,079
for you to hate me?

268
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,250
I don't have anything
against you personally.

269
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:38,089
As someone who's worked
at the hotel for a long time,

270
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:40,190
I understand Ms. Yoon,

271
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,460
and I honestly think it's better
for yourself to quit too.

272
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:48,769
I don't have many friends or colleagues...

273
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,440
like you do.

274
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:55,470
I don't have the fortune
of being loved by a lot of people too.

275
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,980
I'm barely holding out...

276
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:02,779
thanks to this hotel and one person
I met here whom I can rely on.

277
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:07,150
I can't get those taken from me.

278
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:17,900
Since you're here, I'll get going.

279
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,170
I made the coffee bland.
You'll probably have to heat it up again.

280
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:12,119
Yes, he did come here. But...

281
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,990
Jin Young,
don't get worked up and speak calmly.

282
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,259
How can I know where Mr. Han is
when he left an hour ago?

283
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,160
He doesn't know?

284
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,329
No.

285
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,640
There's something he doesn't know?

286
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,809
It's been more than an hour since he left.

287
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:39,180
Mr. Han isn't someone
to leave the hotel unattended.

288
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,450
Did something happen?

289
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,410
Maybe...

290
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,279
Maybe what?

291
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,720
A woman?

292
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:49,490
What woman? He doesn't have a woman.

293
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,089
He has a girlfriend
who brings him coffee every night.

294
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:55,589
I said she left his office
and went back home.

295
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,589
Maybe she pretended to go home
but went somewhere else with him.

296
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:59,930
You don't know what men might do.

297
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:17,180
Come here and have a seat.

298
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,019
Did you drink?

299
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,160
I had a call from Ms. Yoon of Seoul Hotel.

300
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,190
Why do I have to listen to her nagging?

301
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,799
I won't feel satisfied enough
even when she kneels in front of me.

302
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,200
Why do I need to hear her telling me
to educate my child properly?

303
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,069
She's saying no...

304
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:41,269
because I'm your daughter.

305
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,670
You can settle things with her well.

306
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,180
That hotel will be mine in one month.

307
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,250
What's there to settle with her?

308
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,150
Everyone working at the hotel
doesn't want you to take over.

309
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:54,650
Do you still need to do it?

310
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,819
They don't want it?

311
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:57,690
The employees don't want it?

312
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:02,859
If you kick them out onto the streets
and make them starve,

313
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:06,160
they won't even be able to say
whether they like it or not.

314
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,200
That's business, and that's competition.

315
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,240
Hello?

316
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:19,039
Yes, Frank.
What brings you to call me so late?

317
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,750
Did you want to drink?

318
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:24,579
There's no news of Han Tae Jun
after he left my room.

319
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:27,450
Do you know anything about it?

320
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,589
Can I take your word for it?

321
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:36,390
Of course. Who else can you trust but me?

322
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:40,599
Tae Jun's disappearance
is none of my business.

323
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:44,299
If you have time to worry about it,
have a drink with me.

324
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:48,640
I really don't know, Frank.

325
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,839
Yes. Goodnight.

326
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,680
You won't be able to find him.

327
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,079
Where is Tae Jun?

328
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,450
Are you copying Frank?

329
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:02,720
Where he is doesn't concern you.

330
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,119
I clearly warned you.

331
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:08,019
Don't meet him ever again.

332
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,089
And...

333
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,859
quit working at Seoul Hotel.

334
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,460
I can't send you there
after getting humiliated...

335
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,500
by Yoon Dong Sook.

336
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,240
No matter what you say about the hotel,
I won't change my mind.

337
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,269
After one month,

338
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,279
you could become the director
or the CEO of the hotel.

339
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:27,079
Quit working as a waitress...

340
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,809
and pouring water.

341
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,789
Chairman Kim, you have a call.

342
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,319
Goodness.

343
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,859
I'm having a conversation
with my successor.

344
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,059
It's an urgent call.

345
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,829
She introduced herself as Madam Kang.

346
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:45,059
Okay.

347
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:54,809
I got it.

348
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:57,339
Treat them well even without me.

349
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,880
I'll take full responsibility.

350
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,009
Take care of that yourself.

351
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:03,049
(I educated Han Tae Jun well.
He'll get back his senses...)

352
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:04,079
No.

353
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,250
I need to leave early in the morning.

354
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,319
(once he gets drenched in the morning dew
at the golf range.)

355
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,480
Don't call my landline from now.

356
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,150
(From Jung)

357
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,720
If my cell phone is on another call,
just wait and try again.

358
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:15,329
Yes.

359
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,460
Where are you going? Yoon Hee!

360
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:23,430
I'm sure.

361
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,440
There's a golf range
under my father's name near Deokso.

362
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,640
His security guards stay there.

363
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,880
Why did Tae Jun go there?

364
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:33,609
What?

365
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:38,950
Is your father that kind of man? Gosh.

366
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,650
Yoon Hee, where are you?

367
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,789
I'm almost there.

368
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:43,349
I'll go to Sapphire Villa.
Let's meet there.

369
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,789
My father won't listen to anyone else.

370
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,559
He won't be able to
go against Shin Dong Hyuk.

371
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:50,289
Okay. I'll be there soon.

372
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,670
I'm really surprised.

373
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,170
That the boyfriend working at Seoul Hotel
that you mentioned was Tae Jun.

374
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,240
Don't get me wrong.

375
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,980
I'm not saying this with any prejudice.

376
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:06,839
It doesn't matter.

377
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,579
If I was afraid of how others might think,
I wouldn't have come here.

378
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:15,289
I just hope he's safe.

379
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,049
Chairman Kim has his status.

380
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,990
He won't hurt others recklessly.

381
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,220
Don't worry.

382
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,029
You can only say that
because you don't know my father well.

383
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,759
If something happens to Tae Jun,

384
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:32,470
I'll have nobody else to rely on.

385
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,940
Dong Hyuk. Did you hear what happened?

386
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,410
Get in quickly. Let's talk on the way.

387
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,940
Yoon Hee, what happened?

388
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,059
Oh, dear.

389
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,599
What happened, Tae Jun?

390
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:44,710
Are you okay?

391
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:48,779
Gosh.

392
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,150
Mr. Han, can you get on my back?

393
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,660
What did the doctor say? Is he fine?

394
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:39,730
It's not as bad as we thought.

395
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,470
He has bruises here and there
and sprained his wrist,

396
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,569
but he can get discharged tomorrow.

397
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,710
It's late. You can go back now.

398
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,279
I want to stay here.

399
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,410
I have to be here
until he gets discharged.

400
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:56,950
You don't have to.
Hyun Chul will come from the hotel.

401
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,480
This happened because of me.

402
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:38,859
Thank you for today.

403
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,130
I'm glad that he's not injured badly.

404
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,960
Kim Bok Man...

405
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:49,299
seems like a really bad guy.

406
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,240
And I'm his partner.

407
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,009
I'm scared
that you might become a bad guy too.

408
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,670
Dong Hyuk.

409
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:28,539
Why did we have to meet this way?

410
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,309
You and I...

411
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:39,880
And Tae Jun and Yoon Hee.

412
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,859
Why did we meet this way?

413
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,480
I'm sorry.

414
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:03,970
What about the economics newspaper?

415
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,039
I checked everything. They're all clean.

416
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:09,640
Han Tae Jun gave up
after just one beating.

417
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:11,940
That's why you don't need a lot of words.

418
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,579
One punch or a kick...

419
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:15,309
is more effective than a hundred words.

420
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:19,420
Then why do you talk so much?

421
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,619
Hey, Frank.

422
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,730
What are you doing after summoning me
so early in the morning?

423
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:34,059
Look at you exercising hard
to live a long life when you're young.

424
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:35,599
Why did you lie?

425
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,970
What?

426
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:40,369
You said you didn't know
where Han Tae Jun was last night.

427
00:31:40,369 --> 00:31:41,400
So?

428
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,140
Aren't you the one who ordered people
to beat him up?

429
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,980
I don't know what you're saying.

430
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,180
The golf range.

431
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:49,950
Isn't it under your name?

432
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,480
Yes.

433
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,490
I taught him a lesson
so he won't do that again.

434
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,190
You just need to turn a blind eye.

435
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,119
This is our work, and my work.

436
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,890
You shouldn't do something like this
behind my back.

437
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,190
Look here, Frank.

438
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:05,559
I wasn't going to say this,

439
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:09,230
but I don't like the way
you work nowadays.

440
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:11,329
You changed your mind
about the retrenchment...

441
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,369
and didn't even report
Han Tae Jun's resignation properly.

442
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:16,240
Chairman Kim.
You must be mistaken about something.

443
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,480
We're bound by contract
for the takeover of Seoul Hotel.

444
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,910
I'm not your employee.

445
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,779
- What?
- If you don't like the way I work,

446
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:26,279
don't waste your time talking
and terminate the contract.

447
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,220
Aren't you going too far?

448
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,819
You're the one who's going too far.

449
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,019
Isn't beating someone
in the middle of the night...

450
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:35,589
like a gangster going too far?

451
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:40,130
I only deal with businessmen.

452
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,799
I don't work with mafias.

453
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,339
If something like this happens again,

454
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:48,039
I'll stop working on this case.

455
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,009
Goodbye.

456
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,480
What a rude jerk.

457
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,049
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Han.

458
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,890
- Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Han.
- Thank you.

459
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,029
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

460
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,359
Welcome back.

461
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,000
Sergeant Han who came back from the war.

462
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,069
You don't seem to be hurt badly.

463
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:20,640
- It's okay.
- Didn't you play hooky...

464
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,170
in the hospital for a day
because you didn't want to work?

465
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,039
Mr. No, how can you hit an injured man?

466
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,609
It's okay.
This is nothing when you're young.

467
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:31,410
Of course, it's not a bad injury.

468
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,650
You should visit Ms. Yoon first. Let's go.

469
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,980
Okay. See you later.

470
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,390
What could I have done?

471
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,289
How can I go against Ms. Yoon...

472
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:43,589
and cover up for Yoon Hee working here?

473
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:44,589
I can't.

474
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:46,730
Mom doesn't come here often.

475
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,130
You can just turn a blind eye.

476
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,930
If Ms. Yoon hears about it,

477
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,230
I'll be fired.

478
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,500
Personally speaking,

479
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,509
my heart is ripped into pieces.

480
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,079
I have a very soft heart.

481
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:03,950
What are you doing here?

482
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,049
I heard Tae Jun was back.

483
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,319
I wanted to go see him with you.

484
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:08,889
He went to his room just now.

485
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,119
- You came with him?
- Yes.

486
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,119
- From the hospital?
- I just arrived...

487
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,289
with Tae Jun.

488
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,860
I see.

489
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:17,659
Let's go together.

490
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:20,030
I'll tell Mr. Yoo and Ms. An.

491
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,300
Don't worry. I told them.

492
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,829
- Really?
- Well...

493
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,139
Actually, it's a lie,
but you shouldn't go in now.

494
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,639
Mom told them not to accept you
and went down just now.

495
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,550
Since Tae Jun is here, we can talk to him.

496
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,849
Mom can't ignore Tae Jun's words.

497
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,789
Sure.

498
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,789
Then let's stop by the bakery.

499
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:46,519
- You're going to buy me bread?
- No.

500
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,119
I'm going to buy chocolate
that Mr. Han likes.

501
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,530
I like chocolate too.

502
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,429
I thought I wouldn't be able
to see you again.

503
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,969
I was so worried
that everything would be over like this.

504
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,940
I'm sorry, Ms. Yoon.

505
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,070
It's okay.

506
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,840
You're having a tough time
because you have an incompetent CEO.

507
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,940
I'm the one who's sorry.

508
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,840
Ms. Seo, you went through a lot too.

509
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:10,349
There are troubles
around Tae Jun all the time,

510
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:12,150
so he needs a fixer like me.

511
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,619
You're right.

512
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,119
So why do you have your eyes
on another guy?

513
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,889
Protect her privacy, Ms. Yoon.

514
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,230
Should I?

515
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,159
Sounds like a scandal progressed
to romance.

516
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,260
Is that it?

517
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:31,730
I'll tell you later.

518
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,269
Shin Dong Hyuk will back down
after this incident, right?

519
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:37,510
He won't.

520
00:35:37,809 --> 00:35:39,639
This was Chairman Kim's doing.

521
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,440
It had nothing to do with Shin Dong Hyuk.

522
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,650
Are you okay? I heard your leg...

523
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:49,550
Ms. Kim.

524
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:53,219
Why are you still in this hotel?

525
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,530
I clearly told you to leave.

526
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,159
Did you think I was joking?

527
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,789
Mom, please don't do that.

528
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,329
This is not for you to interfere.

529
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,570
Mr. Han. I forgot to tell you this,

530
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,099
but process the dismissal
of Kim Yoon Hee of Food and Beverage...

531
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:06,239
as of yesterday.

532
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,260
What's up with you?

533
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,690
What did Yoon Hee do?

534
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,630
Why must we get the brunt
of our fathers' issues?

535
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,099
If you don't know anything, keep quiet.

536
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:35,630
They're the ones who did wrong,
so why are they making us suffer?

537
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,969
Don't say something stupid.

538
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:40,000
If you say the family
of our enemy did no wrong...

539
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,510
Stop it, Young Jae.

540
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,110
Gosh.

541
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:25,579
The last card we have...

542
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,690
is making CEO Yoon give up her shares.

543
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,250
We have no other way.

544
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,889
It pains me to deal with an elderly lady,

545
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,960
but there isn't an alternative plan...

546
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,429
than making her give up
her management rights.

547
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,199
Draw out a detailed plan
and send it to me.

548
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,840
Okay, I will.

549
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,980
Yes.

550
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,750
You have delivery.

551
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:00,150
Thank you.

552
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,199
"Korean name, Shin Dong Hee."

553
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:19,340
"Two and a half years old."

554
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,269
"Adopted in 1982."

555
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:23,539
In the US?

556
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:25,880
Yes. They have contact information too.

557
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,610
The phone number is...

558
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,880
Read it out.

559
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:33,280
- Four, five, zero.
- If the area code is four, five, zero,

560
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,920
is it Florida?

561
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,389
No. This is...

562
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,090
Seoul.

563
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,690
Seoul? She's in Seoul?

564
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,630
Yes, Executive Chef speaking.

565
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:49,869
Who?

566
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,539
There's no one here who goes by that name.

567
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:56,969
We have so many employees,
so I'm not sure about that,

568
00:38:57,409 --> 00:39:00,539
but I'm certain that nobody
with that name works here.

569
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:05,349
This is the Western cuisine kitchen
of Seoul Hotel.

570
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,619
Where are you calling from?

571
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:12,690
Mr. No, I made you some coffee.

572
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:16,030
Gosh. Nobody can beat you...

573
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,860
when it comes to making coffee.

574
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,929
She came from its home country.

575
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,099
When did she return from the US?

576
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:30,469
It says March this year.

577
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:33,710
- Seoul Hotel kitchen, was it?
- Yes.

578
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:38,780
Is there any English name?

579
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:44,150
Here it is. "Jennifer S. Adams."

580
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,630
Jennifer...

581
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,960
I'm Jenny who's living with Jin Young.

582
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,030
Jenny?

583
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:19,159
Excuse me. Let me ask you something.

584
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:22,119
Which way is
to the Western cuisine kitchen?

585
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,730
I don't know.

586
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,110
You only have an hour and a half left.

587
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:47,579
Put extra care into salads today.

588
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,949
We need to prepare for group customers.

589
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:52,349
Assistant Lee,
don't you need more cherry tomatoes?

590
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:53,659
We have enough. Go to Vegetable Room...

591
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,320
and bring one box of potatoes
and one sack of onions.

592
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,530
One box of potatoes
and one sack of onions? Okay.

593
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,590
- Oh, Jenny!
- Yes.

594
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,800
- Bring 6 bell peppers.
- Okay, 6 more bell peppers.

595
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,929
Okay.

596
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,250
My goodness!

597
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:24,750
Again?

598
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:27,489
Jenny, is it your hobby...

599
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:30,090
to drop ingredients and sauces?

600
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,530
- I'm sorry, Mr. No.
- I'll take this.

601
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,559
Give me that.

602
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:46,239
What brings someone of high status here?

603
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:50,909
Are you here to check if there's anyone
to fire from the kitchen?

604
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,380
Not just you but even your grandfather...

605
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,820
can't enter the kitchen
without permission.

606
00:41:54,949 --> 00:41:57,989
Get Mr. No's permission and change
into disinfected clothes before coming in.

607
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,679
"What's the point of dredging up
a nightmare I don't want to think about?"

608
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,289
I thought I should forget about it.

609
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:34,090
Even on my way back
from meeting my father...

610
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,030
Just like turning down
a case I don't like...

611
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,699
Just like ripping a contract,

612
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:46,000
I thought I would be able
to forget everything...

613
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,940
if I ripped my father's picture.

614
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,539
Still, you're related by blood.

615
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,650
People normally say...

616
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,949
blood is thicker than water.

617
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,789
I didn't know what that meant.

618
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:09,630
As I grew up, I never met someone...

619
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,860
who had the same blood as me.

620
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:19,300
What did you feel when you saw Jenny?

621
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,670
Something keeps getting stuck
in my throat.

622
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:31,809
Something hot kept getting in my throat,
so I had trouble standing.

623
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,949
It felt like all the hardships
she was going through were because of me.

624
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:40,590
I felt confused and dizzy.

625
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:43,789
It was hard.

626
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:50,829
Why have you never told me
that you were adopted?

627
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:00,079
Jin Young,
you must not have fixed your computer yet.

628
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:03,150
Goodness, the email?

629
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,349
People in my line of work...

630
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,550
must never reveal their weaknesses.

631
00:44:11,889 --> 00:44:13,519
How is adoption a weakness?

632
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:16,230
It is. It's a big weakness.

633
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:19,030
Being abandoned
by your biological parents...

634
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,559
and living in a foreign land...

635
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:23,329
with a wound that will never get healed.

636
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,139
You could never imagine that.

637
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,409
Still, you made it.

638
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,780
Did I?

639
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,809
You earned money
and made a name for yourself.

640
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,079
That's considered a success.

641
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:46,389
I can't even put a necklace
around the neck of the woman I love.

642
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,489
How is this a success?

643
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:57,670
I'm sorry.
I wasn't going to talk about this.

644
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,869
It's okay for today.

645
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:03,239
Your secret...

646
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:05,769
No.

647
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,780
Should I call it a secret or a weakness?

648
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,019
Anyway,
after listening to the hidden story...

649
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:26,360
You want to say
that you find me more humane, right?

650
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:29,670
No. Rather than that,

651
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:32,570
I find you easier.

652
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,940
- You find me easier?
- Yes.

653
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:39,210
Because there's a place
for me to squeeze in now.

654
00:45:41,179 --> 00:45:42,440
You can see hope.

655
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:45,409
There was hope since I first met you
in the desert.

656
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,449
It's just that your objective is evil.

657
00:45:47,449 --> 00:45:49,019
Let's not talk about work today.

658
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:51,389
Okay, sounds like a good idea.

659
00:45:57,429 --> 00:45:58,489
About Jenny...

660
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:05,130
Wouldn't it be better
for you to meet her and tell her yourself?

661
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:10,809
Honestly, I can't work up the courage.

662
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:12,039
Gosh.

663
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,880
A cold-blooded hunter is saying
he can't work up the courage?

664
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,179
That's considered talking about work too.

665
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,019
Is that so?

666
00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:22,250
Then let's cancel that.

667
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:25,119
Would it be better...

668
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:29,530
for me to meet and talk to Jenny first?

669
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:32,159
I'd be glad if you did.

670
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:44,869
Jenny, are you here? Did anyone see Jenny?

671
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:46,340
Jenny just left.

672
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,039
Less than three seconds ago.

673
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:54,119
Jenny! Hold on!

674
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,449
- Jin Young!
- Wait.

675
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:57,050
What's up? Aren't you on duty today?

676
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,659
Have you had breakfast?
