1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,640
I believe the general managers...

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:05,610
are the symbol of the hotels.

3
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:08,849
So general managers
must have good leadership skills...

4
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,119
to represent the hotel.

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:12,880
He has to be warmhearted.

6
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,390
He has to be able to work long hours.

7
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:18,789
He has to be able to give and serve.

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,629
It is the general manager's job
to welcome the guests of the state...

9
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:25,359
and famous individuals
from all over the world.

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,530
So through this industry,
general managers can contribute...

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,000
to a national business.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,399
As I mentioned, they have to have love...

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,009
for taking care of people.

14
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:39,109
That's what we do.
That's our business simply stated.

15
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:40,810
Trying to make people feel good.

16
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,649
We must create an environment...

17
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,079
that feels like their home...

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,990
and give them the amenities
they can enjoy at home.

19
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:50,990
We also had to import
special pasta for him...

20
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,259
and special water to boil his pasta in,

21
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:56,289
so it was a unique experience
with Pavarotti.

22
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,700
I received the former President
of the United States, Bush,

23
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,770
and the Queen of England.

24
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:08,640
If you're told to smile automatically,
people can see through that.

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,040
If you genuinely smile
and show genuine care and sincerity...

26
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:16,750
through your service,
I think that's a valuable gift to have.

27
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,120
And I think those are the kind of people
that we're looking for.

28
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,689
- Right here?
- Yes. That's a good spot, right?

29
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:22,849
That's good.

30
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,329
All right. In 1, 2, 3.

31
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,500
- Should I start?
- Yes. Go ahead.

32
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:35,370
Okay.

33
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,170
Seoul Hotel...

34
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,510
So to say a bit about Seoul Hotel...

35
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,150
Be quiet.

36
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,519
Hey, where's Manager Seo?

37
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,250
She went to the National Assembly
to invite VIP guests to today's event.

38
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:54,620
She must be here by now.

39
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,090
No need to feel nervous here.

40
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,959
I can't do this.

41
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,120
Hey, call her now.

42
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,590
Call Seo Jin Young to get here now!

43
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:08,800
(Episode 1, People Behind the Curtain)

44
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,580
- Oh, my. I'm sorry about that.
- It's all right.

45
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,710
Are you all right?

46
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:22,409
Okay. Bye.

47
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,020
Good work. Bye.

48
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:28,189
Hello.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,699
- Hello.
- Hello.

50
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:45,069
- Hello.
- Hello.

51
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,009
- Goodness, Eun Jin. Be careful.
- Gosh.

52
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:50,580
- Thank you, Manager Seo.
- Okay.

53
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,680
- You pulled an all-nighter, right?
- Yes.

54
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:56,710
Right. Today's event is very important.

55
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,750
- Think of it as an emergency.
- Okay.

56
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,319
- Good work.
- Okay.

57
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,889
Hello.

58
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:06,620
- The lipstick color looks great on you.
- Really?

59
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,889
- That's a great color on you.
- Thanks.

60
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:15,469
It's so hot.

61
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,770
Manager Seo.

62
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,270
You're wanted at the event site.

63
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,340
Okay. Give me five minutes.

64
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:25,580
You must be here in a minute.

65
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,879
Manager Oh is throwing a fit.

66
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:29,250
Tell him I'm dead.

67
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,219
Hello.

68
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,060
Are you late again, Mi Ae?

69
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,729
The Japanese clients finished at 4 a.m.

70
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:42,259
- So you overslept?
- They wanted something for the hangover.

71
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,330
So I even joined them.

72
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,759
Brush your teeth.
I can smell sundae from you.

73
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,460
Manager Oh is going to kill me.

74
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,729
- Make sure to brush your teeth!
- Okay.

75
00:03:58,409 --> 00:03:59,580
Manager Seo.

76
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,050
Tell him I'm dead.

77
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,180
Mr. Yoo said he would love to see you
one more time before you died.

78
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,889
Okay. I'll be upstairs soon.

79
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:09,389
Tell him his speech moved me,
so I came back to life.

80
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,259
Hello.

81
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:15,460
- Hello. How's your child?
- Good.

82
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,399
Hello.

83
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,230
- Hello.
- Hello.

84
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:23,639
- Hello.
- Hello.

85
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:36,949
I'm sorry.
We don't have that at our hotel.

86
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:40,279
Okay. Please give us 15 minutes.

87
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,050
- Yes. Young Chul.
- Yes.

88
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,189
Go buy a burger.

89
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:44,189
A burger?

90
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:46,959
Gosh. The five-year-old kid
is only asking for the burger.

91
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,189
Go buy the burger. You have ten minutes.

92
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:49,329
Yes, sir.

93
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,899
Room service.

94
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,839
Hey, what happened to the fried egg
for the Japanese guest in Room 1612?

95
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,139
- The gas valve is broken.
- What?

96
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:03,839
Hey, then run to the kitchen! Hurry up!

97
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,339
Which room was it?

98
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,480
- Room 1612!
- Okay.

99
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:10,920
Oh, dear.

100
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,839
- Have a good day.
- Have a good day.

101
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,279
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,480
My hands slipped.

103
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,009
You just ruined the appetizers
for the event.

104
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,649
Ask the inventory to see
how much caviar we have left.

105
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:21,120
We brought everything up earlier.

106
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,689
How much time do we have until the event?

107
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,360
Less than an hour and a half.

108
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:40,100
Check how much mushrooms
and asparagus we have in the fridge.

109
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,170
Yes, chef!

110
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,810
And make the shrimp marinade again.

111
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:46,079
Make the assorted vegetables again.

112
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,680
And...

113
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,819
Okay.

114
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:54,050
We'll use the live salmon
for our appetizers.

115
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,519
Call and order two boxes
of live salmon now.

116
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,689
Yes, chef!

117
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,189
The salmon must be freshly caught
from the South Pacific Ocean.

118
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,689
And we need them here in 30 minutes.

119
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,300
- Yes, chef.
- Tell the inventory that...

120
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,000
this is an emergency
and ask them to help us.

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,129
Yes, chef.

122
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,399
- And Manager Lee.
- Yes.

123
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,240
Get the girl out of the kitchen now.

124
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,180
Hello. Is this the inventory?

125
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,180
- This is the main kitchen.
- Hey. Wait.

126
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,279
- We have an emergency.
- Hey.

127
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,649
Yes.

128
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,180
- What are you doing here?
- What?

129
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,850
- I need fried eggs.
- We need fresh salmon.

130
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,790
The gas stove in the room service kitchen
isn't working.

131
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,790
- So...
- Gosh.

132
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,459
- Unbelievable.
- Okay.

133
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,500
Wait!

134
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,680
This is driving me crazy!

135
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:40,629
Hello, sir.

136
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,970
Hello, sir.

137
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:51,669
Why are you so late?

138
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:56,240
Hello, sir.

139
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,860
The color of your outfit
looks great on you, madam.

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,669
I'm not married yet.

141
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:38,419
Do you want to die?

142
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,649
Do you know what time it is?
Why are you so late?

143
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:42,320
I'm sorry. I was stuck in traffic.

144
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,590
What's wrong with your lipstick color?

145
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,720
Is this a bar?

146
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:48,190
I'm sorry. I'll fix that.

147
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:51,659
You're late and unpresentable.
I'll deduct ten points.

148
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,200
This will be taken into consideration
for your performance assessment.

149
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Get to work.

150
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:03,210
Hey.

151
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,879
This costs 3,000 dollars.

152
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,179
I'll deduct 30 points
for your carelessness.

153
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,200
How long has she been doing that in there?

154
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,309
At least for over 20 minutes.

155
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:37,710
She must be fighting with the mirror.

156
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,379
Right.
She must be going through a breakup.

157
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,110
Goodness. She needs a man first
to go through a breakup.

158
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,679
Don't forget to add four pillows.

159
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,220
This particular guest today
likes to be surrounded by pillows.

160
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,559
Okay. We've already put more pillows here.

161
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:55,629
If you're done making the bed,
clean the floor of the living room again.

162
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:56,889
Make sure to open all the windows.

163
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:58,129
- Okay.
- Okay.

164
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,070
I'm telling you.
She's going through a breakup.

165
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,970
I'm telling you.
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

166
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,940
Are you there,
Manager Lee of Housekeeping?

167
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,009
Yes, this is Lee Soon Jung
from Housekeeping.

168
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:48,379
This is Seo Jin Young.

169
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,210
Yes. What is it?

170
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,379
(No Entrance)

171
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:52,779
This is the sixth complaint so far.

172
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,250
Six in an hour.

173
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,889
- When will you be done?
- I'm almost done.

174
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:58,690
Please hurry,
so the guests can use this path.

175
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,690
- Okay.
- Thanks.

176
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,830
Didn't I give you the notice yesterday?

177
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,490
I told you to pay more attention
to Room 206 on the 6th floor...

178
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,000
because the guest
was infamous for being picky.

179
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,799
- Hello.
- Hello.

180
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,769
The guest is allergic to blankets.

181
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,440
So change them to cotton blankets.
Or at least get thin wool comforters.

182
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,299
Are you there? Manager Lee?

183
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,870
- This is odd.
- Are you there?

184
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,570
- I can't hear you at all.
- Manager Lee?

185
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,840
I can't hear you.

186
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,850
- Can you hear me? I can't hear you.
- You can't hear me?

187
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,610
- I can't hear you. Can you hear me?
- Hello? Manager Lee?

188
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,580
- I can't hear you.
- Answer me, Manager Lee.

189
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,690
If it's that urgent,
you can do it yourself.

190
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,720
Manager Lee.

191
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:31,490
Lee Soon Jung!

192
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,789
Sir, I can take it from here.

193
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,460
No. It's okay. Get back to work.

194
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,169
This is the restroom.

195
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:42,870
I'll wait here...

196
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,870
and walk you to the coffee shop.

197
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,039
I'll meet you out here.

198
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,470
Okay. Thanks.

199
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,570
You're very kind.

200
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:51,779
Do you work in this hotel?

201
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,539
Yes. I do. Please go ahead.

202
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,110
I see. Then you're the hotel boy.

203
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,080
People don't use that term anymore.

204
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,620
You can say I'm a hotel employee.

205
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,049
Right. I'll do my business and come out.

206
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:03,049
Sure.

207
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,159
A hotel boy.

208
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,200
Hello, sir.

209
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,289
Who said it was allowed to smoke indoors?

210
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:44,460
You entered through the main lobby
like guests.

211
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,169
On top of that,
you didn't know when the shift ended...

212
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:49,830
and just strolled around the hotel.

213
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,070
As if it wasn't enough,
you smoked in a non-smoking area.

214
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,809
When will you grow up?

215
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,440
I'm sorry, Dad.

216
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
"Sir!"

217
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,049
Sir.

218
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:06,679
If I find you slacking off again,

219
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,620
I'll cut you off. Forget about
getting a salary or allowance from me.

220
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:33,480
It's crooked!

221
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,850
No, the other side.

222
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,149
Raise it higher. Yes.

223
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,480
Stop. You got it. Perfect.

224
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,820
Turn on the lights.

225
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,190
Mr. Yoo,
please start setting up the tables.

226
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,789
I got it. Okay.

227
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,330
Set up the tables.

228
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,279
Bring them closer.

229
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,480
You'll go home
after you fold 200 napkins today.

230
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,649
Yes, sir.

231
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:49,990
Are you all right?

232
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,789
It's time.

233
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,759
You still haven't changed.
What have you been doing?

234
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,700
This is the tie, right?

235
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,870
What is it? Did something happen?

236
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,169
It's about Young Jae.

237
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,409
I thought he would grow up
once I gave him a job.

238
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:14,850
But he has a long way to go.

239
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:17,309
It's been only three months.

240
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,519
You should try to baby him a bit.

241
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,149
He's our only son.
Don't be so strict with him.

242
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,220
Managing a hotel is tough...

243
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,460
even when you start your career
from the bottom.

244
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,460
You're kind to the employees
as if they're your own children.

245
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,259
Why are you so tough on your own son?

246
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,970
I don't know where his head is at.

247
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:37,230
That's enough, CEO Choi.

248
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,370
It's a good day. Try to smile.

249
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:43,070
Come on. Smile.

250
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:46,909
You told me that anyone working
at a hotel had no choice but to smile.

251
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:50,779
Go to your positions
to receive the guests.

252
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:51,950
(Announcement of Vision 21 to Celebrate
the 30th Anniversary of Seoul Hotel)

253
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,750
Pay special attention in escorting
the guests to their assigned seats.

254
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,990
And if you can, keep Assemblyman Park...

255
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,120
and Chairman Choi of Hando Products
away from each other. Okay?

256
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,159
- I got it.
- Okay.

257
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,460
And we should serve the water
once all the guests are seated.

258
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,930
We poured the water too soon last time.
So the water got lukewarm.

259
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:06,160
I got it.

260
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,529
Is everything ready?
Should we open the doors now?

261
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,369
The food has to come up first.

262
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:11,440
What?

263
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,039
Hurry! Hey, get out of the way!

264
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:19,140
- Move!
- Out of the way!

265
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,410
- Move away!
- Hurry.

266
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,950
- Get out of the way!
- Move!

267
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,549
- Move!
- Hey.

268
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,220
Hurry up!

269
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:49,069
We'll be late.

270
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,440
Oh, no. The event is about to start.
How come nothing is set up?

271
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,509
It's the salmon.

272
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:55,650
- Assistant Lee.
- Yes.

273
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,180
- Shrimps.
- They're ready.

274
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,680
- Vegetables.
- They're ready.

275
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,279
- Refill the sauce.
- It's done.

276
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,349
We only have 25 minutes until the event.

277
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:04,119
The guests will walk in at any minute!

278
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,720
Prepare the lettuce
and get the garnishes ready.

279
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,859
Yes, chef. Let's go.

280
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:09,089
You're not going to put out any food?
We're about to start!

281
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:16,829
Will you keep nagging
when I have food out here?

282
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:17,940
You're spitting on my food!

283
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:27,180
We must receive the guests
after 15 minutes, at the latest.

284
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:29,579
You must finish everything before then.

285
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:30,650
Okay?

286
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,819
You now have 14 minutes, not 15 minutes.

287
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:40,420
You all heard her.
We only have 14 minutes left.

288
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,029
Excluding the time we need to transport
the food, we have ten minutes.

289
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:44,160
Hurry up.

290
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:46,430
This is Manager-in-Charge Seo Jin Young.

291
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,029
- The guests are arriving.
- Okay. I'm going up now.

292
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,589
Hello.

293
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:13,359
What's going on, Manager Seo?
We must open the doors now.

294
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:15,029
The kitchen wants us to wait ten minutes.

295
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,589
The CEO will be here soon.

296
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,029
Where have you been, sir?

297
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:20,500
- I was dealing with a guest.
- Gosh.

298
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,599
CEO Choi is coming in.

299
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,549
- Hello.
- Hey.

300
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,609
Jin Young.

301
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:39,519
Why are you making the guests wait here?
They usually wait inside.

302
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:42,619
The live salmon arrived late.

303
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:44,619
How long is the delay?

304
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,220
Only ten minutes. I'm sure everything
will be ready by then.

305
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,789
What's going on with the kitchen?

306
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:51,259
What is this?
How come the food isn't ready?

307
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:54,029
Come on. It's time to open the doors now.

308
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,630
Wait.

309
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,799
No, it's past the opening time.
What on earth is going on?

310
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:00,500
Ask the salmon.

311
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,309
Hey, who's Salmon?

312
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,880
Get two people on each cart.

313
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,519
We don't have time. Hurry and go upstairs.

314
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:16,049
Be careful when you get in the elevator.

315
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,750
Keep it close, so it doesn't get stuck.

316
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:21,190
What's he doing?

317
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,490
Hey!

318
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,500
Hey! Move!

319
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,769
Chef!

320
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,500
Hey, get the elevator!

321
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,940
Get the elevator!

322
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,210
Are you all right, chef?

323
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,450
I'm all right.
Get him to the infirmary now.

324
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,680
- The rest of you, get the food out.
- Are you okay?

325
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,720
Are you all right?

326
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,789
I'm okay. Transport the food first.

327
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:17,779
Congratulations.

328
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,549
It's already been 30 years.

329
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:25,990
Thank you for coming.

330
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,990
So tell me. How does it feel
to have run an inn for 30 years?

331
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,170
Sorry. It was a joke.

332
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:40,400
Thank you for coming, Yoon Hee.

333
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,539
Yoon Hee got the scholarship
this semester.

334
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,539
She has a long way to go
before she graduates.

335
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:47,940
But we've been getting
a lot of suitors for Yoon Hee.

336
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:50,680
Should I put your son on the list too?

337
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,079
Have a good time.

338
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:06,630
Mr. Yoo!

339
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,170
Open the doors.

340
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:16,740
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

341
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,460
All right.

342
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:12,529
This is a celebratory party
for Seoul Hotel's 30th anniversary.

343
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,730
I sincerely thank all of you...

344
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:21,140
for attending this meaningful occasion.

345
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,140
As you know,

346
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:29,950
Seoul Hotel...

347
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,119
boasts...

348
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:36,549
a picturesque natural environment...

349
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:42,960
where four seasons are pronounced
throughout the year.

350
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:45,700
Thirty years ago,

351
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,069
this place was nothing but a humble hill.

352
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,640
But as for now,

353
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:58,039
our hotel was able to grow...

354
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:02,579
into a luxury hotel that
represents Korea...

355
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,220
thanks to the hard work...

356
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:12,059
our hotel staff has put in over the years.

357
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,329
I can sum up our past 30 years in 3 words.

358
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:21,160
Ambition.
We were passionate about our future.

359
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:26,039
Devotion.
We were committed to helping our guests.

360
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:31,339
Creativity.
We were creative in serving our guests.

361
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:33,039
With these three goals,

362
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,609
our hotel staff...

363
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:39,019
worked hard behind the curtain...

364
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,480
where people couldn't see them.

365
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:43,950
Among them,

366
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,230
my wife, Yoon Dong Sook,

367
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,430
is included as well.

368
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:53,700
However,

369
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:59,240
there are people
whom I'm more grateful to.

370
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,839
I would like to express my gratitude
toward them.

371
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:03,869
Countless guests...

372
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,380
have visited our hotel...

373
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,680
for the past 30 years.

374
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:16,990
I believe they are
the true owners of our hotel.

375
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,930
Don't smile, buddy.

376
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:27,259
Because you bounced,
I ended up working here like a dog.

377
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,970
Chef!

378
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:34,470
What happened?

379
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,369
Is the injury serious?

380
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,240
I'm fine.

381
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:40,579
- Are you sure? Let me see.
- Gosh.

382
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:43,180
I'm all right. I put some doenjang on it.
I'll be fine.

383
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:47,380
Gosh. Facility Maintenance Department
told me that they fixed the steam valves.

384
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,619
They didn't do anything wrong.
My guys messed it up.

385
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:54,019
Why today, of all days?
It made the day even more hectic.

386
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,089
That's life.

387
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:58,299
On hectic days, it gets crazier.
On slow days, nothing happens.

388
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,099
This is a battlefield, to begin with.

389
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,230
How's the event going?

390
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,200
It's going very well.

391
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:15,380
Do you still keep in touch with him?

392
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,980
Does he call you?

393
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,319
Did you hear any news?

394
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,160
Seo Jin Young.

395
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:27,190
What?

396
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:28,690
I'm talking about Han Tae Jun.

397
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:33,529
I should go upstairs.
I'll check on you later.

398
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,970
How much do you want?

399
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,210
How much will you sell this hotel for?

400
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:48,109
I didn't know that you were interested
in the hotel business.

401
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,579
I'm willing to offer...

402
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,589
a five-percent premium
on top of the market price for the hotel.

403
00:26:57,589 --> 00:26:58,720
And...

404
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:01,019
if you want to keep working at the hotel,

405
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,390
I can make you an advisor
for the time being.

406
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,160
This is a happy occasion,

407
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:11,940
so I'll let that slide as an awful joke.

408
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,680
Ms. Kim, where are you going?

409
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,130
Who are you?

410
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:26,069
I'm lost. Can you tell me
how I can get out of here?

411
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,819
This is the path to the downtown area.

412
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:46,920
Where are you going?

413
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:51,230
Why do you ask?
So you can hail a cab for me?

414
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:53,599
What?

415
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:22,059
Hello.

416
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:24,160
Where are you?
How dare you leave without telling me?

417
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,829
What? The school library?

418
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,069
Then you should have told me
that you were leaving.

419
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:35,069
Okay. Finish up quickly and go home early.

420
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,680
The only thing she's interested in
is studying.

421
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,279
I'm glad
she doesn't take after her mother.

422
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:44,710
Do your job right.

423
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:50,450
Play some music.

424
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,289
What?

425
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,750
Is this the library?

426
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,089
Hey. Wait.

427
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,329
Do you want me to pay you for the ride?

428
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,200
No. It's not that.

429
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,559
Then go back to the hotel
and guard the door.

430
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,569
Hey.

431
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,940
People rarely meet like this by chance.
It'd be a shame if we parted like this.

432
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:44,640
My name is Choi Young Jae.
What's your name?

433
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,980
I'm nobody.

434
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,140
So he followed you here?

435
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,470
He didn't follow me. He gave me a ride.

436
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:19,339
Interesting.

437
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,880
Wouldn't a bellboy get fired for this?

438
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:23,309
Quit looking at him.

439
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,009
He's not leaving.

440
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:26,720
He must totally be into you.

441
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,519
Guys like him are so predictable.

442
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,059
Stop looking at him.

443
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:10,390
Deduct a point.

444
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,900
Goodness. Why can't they be cleaner?

445
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:19,799
- Manager Oh.
- Gosh.

446
00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:23,809
What's going on?

447
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:26,539
- I needed to talk to you.
- About what?

448
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:28,509
I'll never be late from now on.

449
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:32,180
Can you not deduct any points
from my tardiness today?

450
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,220
There's a promotion test coming up
for the captain position in two months.

451
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,349
So what?

452
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:38,190
Having a lot of penalty points
won't be favorable for my promotion.

453
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,319
- I'm sure you know that.
- So what?

454
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:42,990
I really need to get promoted
this time around.

455
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,190
You want to get promoted...

456
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,700
to captain over hard-working employees
when you're always late?

457
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:49,099
Please, Manager Oh.

458
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:50,630
Can you please let it slide this once?

459
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,839
What was that?

460
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,440
Hey.

461
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:57,809
A hundred eighty-eight.

462
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:05,210
A hundred eighty-nine.

463
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:11,219
A hundred eighty...

464
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,159
A hundred ninety.

465
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,059
Who's there?

466
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:17,150
Are you done with your library visit?

467
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:18,550
The library visit?

468
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,860
Can you give me one more ride?

469
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,559
Sure. Of course.

470
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,460
- Get in, Eun Joo.
- Okay. Thanks. Bye.

471
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,730
Bye.

472
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:35,440
She's not getting in?

473
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:38,070
Her family will send her a car. Drive.

474
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,909
Let's go.

475
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:47,139
Hello?

476
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:51,409
It's me, Seo Jin Young.

477
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,679
Answer your phone.

478
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,090
Hey, Manager Han. You should call me.

479
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,090
Gosh. You're unbelievable.

480
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:05,190
Are you having a blast
after leaving me here all alone?

481
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,630
Do you like Las Vegas that much?

482
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,230
Answer the phone.

483
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:14,940
Darn it.

484
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:51,099
(Hotelier)

485
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:52,230
Yes, of course.

486
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,900
One blue margarita
and one screaming orgasm.

487
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,570
- Hi, O'neal. Sorry for being late.
- Yes, we can.

488
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,110
That will be about ten minutes. Okay?
Thank you, sir.

489
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,110
Let's go, Jun. You have a new order.

490
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,119
- Outside?
- Yes.

491
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,019
Where am I supposed to take it?

492
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:12,960
The poolside. There's a gentleman
out there who'd like a screaming orgasm.

493
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:14,659
- Orgasm?
- Yes.

494
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:16,789
- Maybe, he's Japanese.
- Exactly.

495
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,909
- Hi, Lola.
- Hi.

496
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,480
Jenny?

497
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:17,349
Jenny. Did you leave the door open...

498
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,829
Three messages. Message One.

499
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,630
It's me, Seo Jin Young.

500
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,869
Answer your phone.

501
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,039
Hey, Manager Han. You should call me.

502
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,309
Gosh. You're unbelievable.

503
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:46,340
Are you having a blast
after leaving me here all alone?

504
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,039
Do you like Las Vegas that much?

505
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,900
Seo Jin Young.

506
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,840
Now they cut my landline also.

507
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,699
Yes, this is the General Manager.

508
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,210
What? He's here?

509
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,610
Where?

510
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:57,809
At the site?

511
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,750
You can see this location...

512
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,579
when you go under the basement.

513
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,920
Sir, you're early.

514
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:09,829
What happened
to the additional loan we applied for?

515
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,659
I applied for a loan at a few banks.

516
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,630
But they must have heard
that we were tight on cash.

517
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,469
They're being quite thorough.

518
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,829
- And...
- What else?

519
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:23,010
I'm not sure if we can pay off
the promissory notes next month.

520
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,110
Go on.

521
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:27,309
Sir, I believe...

522
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,650
we might have bitten off more than
we could chew with this construction.

523
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,179
The construction is already ongoing.

524
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:34,519
Are you telling me to abort this project?

525
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,789
And the construction will be finished
in a couple of days.

526
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:38,849
What are you getting at?

527
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,289
We're struggling financially.

528
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:43,730
The value of my company alone...

529
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:45,760
goes over 300 million dollars.

530
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:49,329
Square your shoulders.
And have pride in your job!

531
00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:52,170
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

532
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,320
Sir.

533
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:15,360
It's okay. Sit down.

534
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,860
All right. I should take a break too.

535
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,929
Manager Seo, do you still
keep in touch with Han Tae Jun?

536
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:28,670
No. It's been a while since we lost touch.

537
00:44:29,469 --> 00:44:33,739
I shouldn't have let him leave like that.

538
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:37,110
I bet he must be very disappointed in me.

539
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,179
I'm sure Tae Jun understands.

540
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,989
That was no one's fault.

541
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:45,150
Tae Jun had no choice but to leave.

542
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:48,820
And you weren't in any position
to stop him from leaving.

543
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:51,630
I should have...

544
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:54,730
pushed forward with Vision 21
just like he planned.

545
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:57,369
But it's going well now.

546
00:44:57,869 --> 00:44:59,539
I need Han Tae Jun.

547
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,809
I need him here
to make things go smoothly.

548
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,179
Will you keep playing hooky here?

549
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:14,050
What?

550
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,050
I'll get back to work.

551
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,420
Chairman Kim Bok Man of Hangang Logistics
is waiting for you in the office.

552
00:45:22,989 --> 00:45:24,960
Have you given my offer...

553
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,829
some thought?
The offer about buying your hotel.

554
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,699
I told you I took it as a joke.

555
00:45:32,269 --> 00:45:34,840
I don't joke about business.

556
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:39,039
Then let me make myself very clear.

557
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:44,050
I will never sell this hotel to anyone.

558
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:50,519
You took out an additional loan
of 2.5 million dollars...

559
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:52,090
for the construction.

560
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,760
I'm sorry to say this,

561
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,889
but no banks...

562
00:45:56,889 --> 00:45:59,090
will lend Seoul Hotel any money now.

563
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:01,500
- What?
- And...

564
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,969
if I wanted to,
I could easily demand my money back.

565
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:11,369
Do you think you can take over my hotel...

566
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,510
with those mere promissory notes?

567
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,079
I will have to put in a bit more work
to get your hotel.

568
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,449
What is this? Are you blackmailing me?

569
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:23,489
What do you think you're doing?

570
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:24,820
How dare you yell at me?

571
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,489
I'm telling you
to give up on your stupid hope...

572
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:29,159
and stay at home
after you retire from the hotel.

573
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:30,789
You jerk!

574
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:34,500
You should have braced yourself for this
when you decided to challenge me.

575
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,599
Don't you agree?

576
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,000
You scumbag.

577
00:46:38,769 --> 00:46:41,440
Call me when you change your mind.

578
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:44,710
But if you take too much time,
it won't be good for you.

579
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:46,010
The clock is ticking.

580
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,539
A multi-resort village...

581
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:23,179
with a wide variety of entertainment
will be built.

582
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,150
This is the 1st stage of completion
in 2003.

583
00:47:30,449 --> 00:47:32,219
Reach 300 million dollars in sales.

584
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:33,920
Reach the ordinary income
of 50 million dollars.

585
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,190
It will transform into a resort
in the heart of a city.

586
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:40,800
We can use the environmental change
as an opportunity to grow...

587
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,829
and reacquire the reputation
of a prestigious hotel from the past.

588
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:47,969
I plan to create a framework that
can exist and improve in the long run.

589
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:51,239
We must come together
to find the right direction...

590
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:53,010
for our future generation,

591
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:54,739
how to achieve that,
and design the future.

592
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:58,079
I summarized my plan
as the vision of Seoul Hotel.

593
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,079
That's why I'm giving you
this presentation today.

594
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:02,380
(Letter of Resignation)

595
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,389
A new business will be launched...

596
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:10,360
based on our know-how.

597
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:14,429
Launching a franchise
for hotels, restaurants,

598
00:48:14,429 --> 00:48:15,929
and resorts.

599
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:19,840
Through e-commerce, you can launch
food distribution businesses...

600
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,309
and e-businesses through operating
the total website for food and beverages.

601
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,429
There you are.

602
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:57,039
I brought pine nut porridge today.

603
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:59,340
You've lost your appetite lately.

604
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:01,179
Is pine nut porridge okay for you?

605
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,480
When will we get to have
a family meal together?

606
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:08,949
Come here, honey.

607
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:11,619
Come on.

608
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:15,260
Are you sleeping?

609
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:11,610
Should I get her for you?

610
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:16,650
This game is over anyway.

611
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:20,889
Yes, sir. It all worked out rather easily.

612
00:50:20,889 --> 00:50:22,190
Perhaps, the universe was on your side.

613
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:25,059
To run a successful business,
you need both skills and luck.

614
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:26,929
Are you ready?

615
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,230
Of course, sir.

616
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:31,599
I will make my move as soon as
you give me your word.

617
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:33,369
Do it after three days.

618
00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:34,840
As soon as their mourning period is over.

619
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:36,199
Yes, sir.

620
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:59,900
Chef No, shouldn't we
at least wear black ribbons?

621
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,599
Right. Yes.

622
00:51:04,469 --> 00:51:05,670
I know this is a hotel,

623
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:08,599
but he was like a father and a big brother
to us. And he's gone.

624
00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:11,309
We must show our respect.

625
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,210
Who was that?

626
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:16,949
Who told the staff to wear black ribbons
on their uniform?

627
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:19,510
Lee Gab Soo, have you gone mad?

628
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:22,380
Who gave you permission to do so?

629
00:51:23,389 --> 00:51:25,289
Wait. Manager Oh.

630
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:29,289
We're all mourning for his death.
We were like children to him.

631
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:31,460
So he was like a father to you.
But was he an enemy to me?

632
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,630
This is a hotel!

633
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:35,829
Go to the front.

634
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,469
All the bellmen are wearing black ribbons.

635
00:51:38,469 --> 00:51:41,670
The guests are checking in, but they're
seeing mourning ribbons at the hotel.

636
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:43,039
Who would like to stay
at a hotel like this?

637
00:51:43,369 --> 00:51:45,969
No, it depends on what you make of it.

638
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:47,380
The guests can also...

639
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:49,380
How does that depend on
what you make of it?

640
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,750
Hey.

641
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:53,750
He was our leader. Why can't we show
that we're mourning for our leader?

642
00:51:54,019 --> 00:51:55,349
Don't wear it if you don't want to.

643
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:56,719
What did you say, you jerk?

644
00:51:56,719 --> 00:51:58,190
Don't call me that.

645
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:00,360
- Why are you hitting me?
- Hey.

646
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,519
- Hey.
- Come on. Stop it.

647
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:05,260
- That's enough. Stop it!
- Why did you hit me? Darn it.

648
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,260
- Mr. Oh Hyung Man! Stop it!
- You jerk.

649
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:08,760
Stop it!

650
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:17,070
I understand where you're coming from,
Manager Oh.

651
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:20,039
But you didn't have to make
a violent scene.

652
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:23,039
We're all heartbroken that he's gone.

653
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,880
We can't start picking fights
against each other.

654
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,050
What are you doing?

655
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,449
Lee Gab Soo, you'd better be careful.

656
00:52:27,449 --> 00:52:29,480
Suit yourself. Do whatever you want.

657
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,550
Assistant Lee.

658
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:33,090
Manager Oh.

659
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:35,559
Assistant Lee has a point, though.

660
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:38,030
Listen to me. This is my call to make!

661
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:43,929
I'm the Deputy General Manager.
Whatever I say goes!

662
00:52:45,369 --> 00:52:47,940
Don't you look down on me.

663
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:58,280
We have a VIP guest from Japan.
The guest is only asking for you.

664
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:00,079
Okay.

665
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,590
I got it. You should go down
to the second floor.

666
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:04,690
- Okay.
- Okay.

667
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:16,829
Hello, Mr. Yamamoto.

668
00:53:29,909 --> 00:53:31,179
I'll take it from here.

669
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:33,679
- This way?
- Yes.

670
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:35,320
(Letter of Resignation)

671
00:53:38,789 --> 00:53:39,889
I'm sorry...

672
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,789
to resign so soon
after the death of Mr. Choi.

673
00:53:45,329 --> 00:53:47,699
If you're sorry, take it back.

674
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:49,329
Ma'am.

675
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,429
You can't do this to us.

676
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:53,869
It hasn't even been a few days
since his funeral.

677
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,269
I know that
you're an employee of the hotel.

678
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:00,010
But it's unethical of you to resign now.

679
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:03,579
It's torturing me too, ma'am.

680
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:05,849
I'm truly sorry.

681
00:54:05,949 --> 00:54:07,679
- All right.
- Please come back another time.

682
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:08,920
This isn't a good time to meet her.

683
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,389
No, listen.
This is an urgent matter for us.

684
00:54:11,389 --> 00:54:12,590
- Get out of the way.
- Wait.

685
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:15,059
Let me schedule an appointment.
You can come then.

686
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,929
Sir, please do something.

687
00:54:17,929 --> 00:54:19,059
They are here on behalf of the creditors.

688
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:20,829
I told them to come back another time,
but they are being unreasonable.

689
00:54:20,829 --> 00:54:22,230
Don't stall time.

690
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:24,269
Tell Ms. Yoon to come out.

691
00:54:24,269 --> 00:54:25,929
Sir!

692
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:29,869
I know nothing about managing a company...

693
00:54:29,869 --> 00:54:31,769
or a hotel, for that matter.

694
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:34,940
But there is one thing I do know.

695
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,110
It's...

696
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,679
that...

697
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:42,480
my late husband loved this hotel
more than anyone.

698
00:54:45,219 --> 00:54:46,420
This hotel...

699
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:50,289
was his life.

700
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:54,130
Of course.
I understand how upset you must be.

701
00:54:54,429 --> 00:54:57,130
But you can't run a business
with just sentiments.

702
00:54:59,369 --> 00:55:03,199
First of all, I plan to bring in an expert
who specializes in managing hotels.

703
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:05,840
Who on earth would work here
as a general manager...

704
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,309
when the hotel is going down?

705
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:09,280
Did you even think this through?

706
00:55:10,409 --> 00:55:12,510
Who said our hotel was going down?

707
00:55:16,889 --> 00:55:18,849
Our hotel is doing well.

708
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:24,159
For the time being,
I will take the CEO position...

709
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,630
and honor his aspiration.

710
00:55:38,809 --> 00:55:40,710
You've never seen me smoke, right?

711
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:46,010
I tried to quit multiple times.
But I just couldn't.

712
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,980
I even promised my husband that
I would quit smoking.

713
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,519
But I always smoked in hiding.

714
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,889
Now, there's no need to hide to smoke.

715
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,400
Open it.

716
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,130
(Employee Personal Card)

717
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:08,440
This was on his desk
right before he passed away.

718
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:12,539
My husband must have remembered him
in his last moment.

719
00:56:13,539 --> 00:56:17,050
That's understandable. They got along well
as if they were a father and a son.

720
00:56:18,579 --> 00:56:21,650
It's not easy to find employees
as distinguished and diligent as him.

721
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:26,960
Which brings me to my question.

722
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,059
Can you go and look for him?

723
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:34,030
The banks and creditors...

724
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,130
can't wait to tear this place apart.

725
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:40,699
The shareholders are on my back
to sell off the hotel.

726
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:43,570
I can't hold out for long by myself.

727
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:47,039
But...

728
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:49,610
I know that it's awkward between you two.

729
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,980
Think of it as the late CEO's last wish.

730
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,949
Can you go and bring Han Tae Jun back?

731
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,389
Where did it go? Is it out?

732
00:57:06,429 --> 00:57:08,000
Yes. It's out of bounds, sir.

733
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,099
One more.

734
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,070
I'm sorry, sir.

735
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:16,840
So she didn't listen to your threats?

736
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:19,739
She knows nothing about the industry
or how business works.

737
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:20,840
But what?

738
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,440
That's why our threats
aren't working on her at all.

739
00:57:23,949 --> 00:57:26,150
We were happy that Mr. Choi was gone.

740
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:27,619
But we may have
a bigger problem on our hands.

741
00:57:27,619 --> 00:57:30,449
The general manager even quit.

742
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:32,349
What does she think she can do?

743
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,730
This is the sixth time.

744
00:57:38,929 --> 00:57:40,429
One more mulligan.

745
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:44,030
Do you know anything about that,
General Manager?

746
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:49,199
Well, I heard she was planning
to hire someone.

747
00:57:51,139 --> 00:57:52,170
What?

748
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,510
- Good shot.
- Good shot.

749
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:03,719
Hey, go find the balls.

750
00:58:03,989 --> 00:58:05,320
All seven of them.

751
00:58:06,619 --> 00:58:07,690
What?

752
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:09,989
It's not easy
because of the foreign capital.

753
00:58:09,989 --> 00:58:12,260
Gosh, this is going to give us a headache.

754
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,659
So what's our plan?

755
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,059
We need an expert from abroad
who has experience in M&A.

756
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,269
Great. Get an expert then.

757
00:58:18,269 --> 00:58:19,969
I don't mind how much it costs me.

758
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:21,599
Here. I put together a file.

759
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:24,440
He successfully led nine M&A cases...

760
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,070
in the last three years.

761
00:58:26,309 --> 00:58:28,880
And half of the cases
went over millions of dollars.

762
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,980
He specializes in mergers and acquisitions
in the hotel industry.

763
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:35,849
He's a Harvard Law graduate
and worked at a law firm on Wall Street.

764
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:38,719
He has connections
and is good at what he does.

765
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:40,989
On top of that, he's Korean.

766
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:43,630
Where is he right now?

767
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:47,230
He's working on an M&A case
of a hotel in Las Vegas.

768
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,670
Las Vegas?

769
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:53,800
Are you still hung up
on what happened three years ago?

770
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,760
- That was an accident!
- Yes, it was!

771
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,829
Goodness.

772
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:58,800
Jenny, get in!

773
01:00:00,869 --> 01:00:02,400
There's only so much I can put up with.

774
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,269
How can you put this on the table?
It's dangerous.

775
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:06,739
Here's your coffee now.

776
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,210
I'm fine.

777
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:10,510
Gosh. What is he doing?

778
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:12,010
What's wrong with you guys?

779
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:13,010
Sir.

780
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:14,079
Don't touch her!

781
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,949
Mister!

782
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:17,349
Mister! Help!

783
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:20,789
- Stop the car.
- What are you going to do...

784
01:00:20,789 --> 01:00:22,159
in the middle of a desert?

785
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:24,190
Stop the car right now, you stupid coward!

786
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,789
Fine. Suit yourself!

787
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:31,070
Hey, give me my bag!
