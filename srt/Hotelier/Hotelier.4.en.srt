1
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:07,480
Do you like the room, sir?

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,419
Not bad. Not bad at all.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,320
Hold on. Is there a system
on the phone to prevent any wiretapping?

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,390
- Pardon?
- Is this a satellite phone?

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,820
- We don't have...
- The window doesn't seem bulletproof.

6
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:20,289
That's enough, Leo.

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,129
I was joking.

8
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:25,530
- Let me ask you a question.
- Yes, sir.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,129
Is there someone named Seo Jin Young?

10
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,199
I heard she worked here
as a duty assistant manager.

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,439
You mean Manager Seo Jin Young?

12
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,740
Is she working tonight?

13
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,969
Probably.

14
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,409
She's usually at the hotel
unless she's sleeping.

15
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:40,880
Can you give her a note?

16
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,450
We don't accept tips at our hotel.

17
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,719
- Are you telling a guest what to do?
- No, sir.

18
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,890
- Is 20 dollars not enough?
- No, sir.

19
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,590
I'm tipping you, so we have
a comfortable stay. Take it and leave.

20
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,659
- Get out of here. Out.
- But...

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,060
Gosh.

22
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:03,939
By the way,

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,909
are you talking about the lady
we met in Vegas?

24
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,370
Yes.

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,780
Don't get any weird ideas.
It's not what you think.

26
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,709
What if this is what I think it is?

27
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:17,519
Boss. You see, these women
who work at hotels...

28
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,549
Given my time in Manhattan...

29
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:21,390
Talk to me when I ask you for advice.

30
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,629
Sorry, boss.

31
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,230
I'll be late.

32
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:36,230
Unpack our stuff
and get the Internet working here.

33
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:37,969
Yes, sir.

34
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,000
Nice.

35
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,150
(Episode 4, When They Meet)

36
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:48,509
Hello.

37
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,840
This is the Sapphire Villa.

38
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,639
I can't rest because of the people
in the next room. They're so loud.

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,439
Get them to shut up and go to sleep.

40
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,409
Or get me a shotgun.
I'm going to shoot them all.

41
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:58,479
Please.

42
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,189
I don't know a lot of constellations.

43
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,030
Is that Orion?

44
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,060
Yes.

45
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:13,129
And that one in the back
is the Big Dipper.

46
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,969
That's Cassiopeia.

47
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,539
Do you see the long streak of stars?
That's Scorpius.

48
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:22,710
What's your constellation?

49
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:24,280
You know, the birth constellation.

50
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,539
Mine is Scorpius.

51
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,310
Aries.

52
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,080
I see. Aries.

53
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,090
What's your blood type? Is it O?

54
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,090
A.

55
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,189
Mine is B.

56
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,330
Do you like movies?

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,300
- Yes.
- What kind of movie do you like?

58
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,370
Tell me about a recent film you liked.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,300
"Dancer in the Dark."

60
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,240
I like sad movies.

61
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,370
What about you?

62
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:59,139
I like "Mission: Impossible."

63
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,250
I like action movies
where people fight and break things.

64
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:09,819
We don't have anything in common.

65
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:14,030
But at least
both of us like movies. Right?

66
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,530
No one hates movies.

67
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,800
Right.

68
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,199
So your father owns this hotel?

69
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,870
Yes.

70
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,240
Actually,

71
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,750
my father passed away recently.

72
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:43,389
My mom passed away when I was young.

73
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,860
Is that so?

74
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,959
But when my dad was alive,

75
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:55,230
we didn't get along.

76
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:58,170
Why?

77
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,139
Did you not like him?
Or did he not like you?

78
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:03,839
Both.

79
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,939
We didn't like each other.

80
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,620
Now that he's gone,

81
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,050
I miss him a lot.

82
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:17,620
Do you feel the same way?

83
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:18,990
Stop talking about your father.

84
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:29,970
Hey, are you sure?

85
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,040
Of course. This drink will knock them out.

86
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:34,769
Hey, I think Eun Joo is already drunk.

87
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:36,740
Hey, we should stop giving her drinks.

88
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,310
But the other girl didn't drink.

89
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,610
She's so stubborn.

90
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,480
Don't mix them up.
It's the ones with the oranges.

91
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,649
Okay.

92
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,449
Hey, what are you two doing?

93
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:50,889
- Are you two dating?
- We made cocktails.

94
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,920
Everyone, come inside. Let's drink.

95
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,189
Young Jae, come inside.

96
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,959
What cocktail? What is it called?

97
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,399
Happy Birthday to You.

98
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,129
We put oranges for the ladies.

99
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:02,170
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

100
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:17,180
This is amazing. Give me another one.

101
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,819
Enjoy, sir.

102
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,029
I'm sorry, ma'am.

103
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,439
The hotel will fully compensate you
for the lost clothes.

104
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,839
Do you think my clothes are cheap?

105
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,110
A famous designer personally worked on it.
Did you know that?

106
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:48,279
We will compensate you
for the full amount.

107
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,819
You should run background checks
on the people...

108
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,149
who take care of laundry here.

109
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,350
They might be pocketing expensive clothes
on purpose...

110
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,990
to make money on the side.

111
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,459
I get it. Seeing such expensive clothes...

112
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,829
must have made those poor people
want to steal them.

113
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:04,430
I'll send you the receipt. You can go now.

114
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,930
My goodness. This feels so awful.

115
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,339
How rich could she be?

116
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:18,439
Does she think wearing
expensive clothes makes her classy?

117
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,379
How dare she try to look down on us?

118
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,209
Gosh! If I could, I would have...

119
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,819
- What happened?
- I think it will be resolved well.

120
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:30,689
Well, I'm really sorry.

121
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:33,420
Gosh, you see piles of clothes every day.

122
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,660
Clothes go missing once in a while.
Things like that happen.

123
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,959
Don't worry about that.

124
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,100
I'll pay for the clothes I lost.

125
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,300
You can deduct some money
from my monthly paychecks.

126
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,800
Gosh, it's all right.
The guest understood.

127
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,439
And the general manager said
the hotel would pay for it.

128
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,410
But still.
I can't let the hotel take responsibility.

129
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,139
Don't worry. Get back to work.

130
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,149
- Thank you.
- Sure.

131
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,649
Then...

132
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,620
(Device Name: 3rd Boiler)

133
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,679
- Hey, no more?
- Come on.

134
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,090
Hey.

135
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:43,289
Eun Joo.

136
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,629
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Guys. Come on.

137
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:56,909
Those punks.

138
00:08:56,909 --> 00:08:58,080
- Come here.
- Hey.

139
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,210
- Don't come near us.
- Hey. Go away.

140
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,350
Hey.

141
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:05,279
What? You're leaving already?

142
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:07,820
I have a headache. I need to get going.

143
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,250
- Gosh.
- Okay. Let me give you a ride.

144
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,289
Wait here.

145
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,960
Move.

146
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,960
Didn't you hear Young Jae?
He told you to wait a bit.

147
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:21,370
I'm leaving. Move.

148
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,000
Gosh. Don't be like that.
We all had fun tonight.

149
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,039
You should stay until the party is over.
Don't you think?

150
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,210
Come on.

151
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,809
Seriously? You must have known
what you were walking into...

152
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,120
when you came here.

153
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:41,490
Don't play hard-to-get
just because you have a pretty face.

154
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:46,320
I'll kill you if you lay a finger on me.

155
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,830
You'll kill me? Fine.
Let's see if you can do that.

156
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:58,970
What are you doing? Get your hands off me!

157
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:24,860
Who gave them the key
when they didn't even check in properly?

158
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm not sure.

159
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,100
- Who's the duty assistant manager?
- Manager Seo.

160
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,240
- Yoon Hee! Get your hands off me.
- Be quiet.

161
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,049
Yoon Hee!

162
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,350
- Stop it.
- Let go of me.

163
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,549
- Come here.
- Yoon Hee.

164
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:50,320
Mister, help. My friend is locked inside.

165
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,389
Who are you?

166
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,830
Stop it. What are you doing?

167
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:00,830
- Get away from me!
- What are you doing?

168
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,700
- Gosh.
- Help me.

169
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,570
Please help me get out of here.

170
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:15,950
Are you all right, Yoon Hee?

171
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,279
Hey, who are you?

172
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:22,549
Can a hotel employee assault a guest?

173
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,289
Do you want to lose your job?

174
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,059
Young Jae. You...

175
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,700
Are they your friends?

176
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:35,970
You can explain this later.

177
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,200
Don't go anywhere until I come back.

178
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,570
Yoon Hee.

179
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,039
Yoon Hee.

180
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,809
- Find a room for her.
- Okay.

181
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,049
No.

182
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,919
Don't tell anyone
about what happened today.

183
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,490
Please promise me that
no one will find out about this.

184
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,320
No one can find out.

185
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:22,379
What happened?

186
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:24,850
What did you do to Yoon Hee?

187
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,820
Not you too.

188
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:29,519
Come on, this isn't our first rodeo.

189
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,360
She drank with us
and had fun in a hotel room.

190
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:34,330
Isn't it obvious what comes next?

191
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,230
Don't act like you didn't know.

192
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,340
Don't you dare lay a finger on her.

193
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:49,269
Got that?

194
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,820
Get the blanket.

195
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,649
- Are you on duty today?
- Yes.

196
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,960
Don't tell anyone about this
until I handle this.

197
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,120
Yes, sir.

198
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:42,559
When she wakes up,
get her name and phone number.

199
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:45,600
Okay. But are you all right?

200
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,799
You just came back.
You didn't even get to take a breather.

201
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:48,830
I'm all right.

202
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:38,580
Gosh. You're still here.

203
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,950
- Yes, I am. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

204
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,789
- Did you finish?
- Yes.

205
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:45,389
Shouldn't you be going home?

206
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:47,860
- Okay.
- Bye.

207
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,090
This was such a busy day.

208
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,929
Gosh. I'm so tired.

209
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,509
(Manager Seo,
you got a lot of calls from Star Light.)

210
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:06,879
(And you also have a note too.
From Kyung Hwa)

211
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:15,720
(Shin Dong Hyuk)

212
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,230
Thank you, sir.

213
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:47,620
"Frank." Who's Frank?

214
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,450
Frank?

215
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,059
Frank!

216
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:12,879
Yes, this is the cocktail bar.

217
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:17,950
Can you check if there's a guest
named Frank Shin or Shin Dong Hyuk?

218
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,190
I see. He's not there? Okay.

219
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,409
Is this the front desk?
This is Seo Jin Young.

220
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:49,909
Can you see if a guest named
Shin Dong Hyuk checked in today?

221
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,120
Yes. Which room is he staying in?

222
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:57,180
"How do you do?" No. That's not it.

223
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,519
"How are you, Mr. Shin?"

224
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,829
"Nice to meet you, Frank. Welcome to..."

225
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,799
"Hello, welcome to our hotel."

226
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,769
It's nice to see you too.

227
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:23,569
Gosh.

228
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,410
Hello.

229
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
Well,

230
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:33,150
I read your note. But I thought
it was too late at night to say hello.

231
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,019
I was going to come back tomorrow.

232
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,789
I guess you were out.

233
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:42,930
Yes.

234
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,460
I was waiting for someone for an hour,
but I got stood up.

235
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,740
It's nice to see you again.

236
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,109
Yes.

237
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:27,200
What is this? What happened, Young Jae?

238
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,640
My friends were being stupid.
They were pretty drunk.

239
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:34,809
You know
what this hotel represents, right?

240
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,680
Do you want this to be a cheap hotel
for rich kids to drink and fool around?

241
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:40,150
I got it. That's enough.

242
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,490
How come you haven't changed
at all from three years ago?

243
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,059
Right. I didn't change at all.

244
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,730
- Your father passed away only...
- Don't bring up my father.

245
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:52,829
You don't have any right
to talk about my family matters.

246
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,130
- What's gotten into you?
- What is that supposed to mean?

247
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,099
I'm living my life. Why are you meddling?

248
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,640
Besides, if this becomes a problem,

249
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,140
you can talk to my mom and get me fired.

250
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,210
Sit down, you punk!

251
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:10,549
Young Jae. Listen to me.

252
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,779
If you want to get everything you want
and live your life the way you want,

253
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,349
you have to be better.

254
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:20,619
You'd better work hard if you want
to be successful at this hotel.

255
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,230
Being Ms. Yoon's son
won't help you in any way.

256
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,730
Once I become the general manager
of the hotel, you'll forever be a bellman.

257
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,069
Or like you said,

258
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,230
I'll fire you before that.

259
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,599
Keep that in mind.

260
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:05,769
Hello.

261
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:11,410
Yes.

262
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,950
No. It's okay. Go ahead.

263
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,319
It's about the new general manager.
Yes, Han Tae Jun.

264
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,750
Find out about him.

265
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,650
Find out about his birth, family,
work experience, and everything about him.

266
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,349
I want the report by tomorrow.

267
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:25,859
Okay.

268
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,700
What time is it?

269
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:36,430
It's 2 a.m. right now!

270
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:40,140
Goodness. He never sleeps.

271
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,940
Seriously.

272
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,339
Gosh.

273
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,690
Good morning.

274
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,890
Good morning, my foot. That's so loud.

275
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:46,240
Gosh. It's food.

276
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:48,309
What did you cook, Jenny?

277
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,039
Gosh.

278
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,539
It's tasty.

279
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,980
I made a few dishes
with the ingredients in the fridge.

280
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,079
Is it good?

281
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,119
You cooked everything here?

282
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:02,650
Goodness. Jenny, you're a good cook.

283
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,559
Thanks. You know, I like to cook.

284
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:07,160
Jenny, that's amazing.

285
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,230
Jenny. Do you want to work...

286
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,000
in the kitchen at our hotel?

287
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,170
You can learn how to cook
and earn money by working there.

288
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:20,000
Well, our executive chef
can be a bit grumpy.

289
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,839
But deep down, he's considerate and nice.
What do you think? Are you interested?

290
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:25,339
Oh, my gosh. This is wonderful.

291
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:27,539
Great. I'll talk to him today.

292
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:31,109
Hey, do you have any leftovers?

293
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,230
Tae Jun.

294
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,099
Han Tae Jun.

295
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,089
Wake up, Tae Jun.

296
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,930
You must be jet-lagged.

297
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:54,500
I brought you a boxed meal.

298
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:58,029
Wake up now. You need to start working.

299
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:03,039
I'll tickle you. Okay?

300
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,309
Wake up.

301
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,140
Gosh.

302
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,650
Who are you?

303
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,019
What...

304
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,990
Who are you?

305
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,859
I'm sorry.

306
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:26,529
I must have gotten the wrong room.
I'm sorry.

307
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,970
No, it's the right room.

308
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:42,480
This is the general manager's room.
How did you get in here?

309
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,720
Well,

310
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,890
I don't know.

311
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,289
- Good day.
- Bye.

312
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:57,359
Okay.

313
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,930
My goodness. Oh, no.

314
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,099
Did I hurt you? Goodness.

315
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:06,670
I'm sorry about that.

316
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:31,960
Gosh.

317
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:38,000
- What's that?
- A boxed meal.

318
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,539
Jenny cooked.

319
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:43,309
Really? That's great.

320
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:45,680
Who's that woman?

321
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,710
- "Woman?"
- The woman...

322
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,049
who's sleeping on your bed in your room
with your shirt on.

323
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,849
- Oh, her.
- "Oh, her?"

324
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:55,619
Don't worry about her. Let's just eat.

325
00:26:56,619 --> 00:26:58,250
What were you thinking?

326
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,059
Don't you remember what happened?
You got mixed up with a woman again.

327
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:02,289
I had my reasons.

328
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,029
There are 623 rooms in this hotel.

329
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:05,930
And 422 rooms are occupied.

330
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,200
- But the remaining 200 rooms are vacant.
- It's 201.

331
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,369
Yes, there are 201 rooms.
I get that you had your reasons.

332
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:12,099
How could you let her sleep in your room?

333
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,170
Forget it. That's enough.

334
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,440
What if other employees saw her
in your room?

335
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,710
Aren't you sick of people
talking about you behind your back?

336
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,809
Yes, I'm sick of it!

337
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:22,680
So stop talking to me about women!

338
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,460
Don't you want the food?

339
00:27:39,829 --> 00:27:40,930
Gosh.

340
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,079
- General Manager Han.
- Hey.

341
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,680
This is what you asked for.

342
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:00,720
Okay. Thank you.

343
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,049
Don't tell anyone what happened yesterday.

344
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,490
- Okay.
- You can go now.

345
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,309
Did you get a good night's sleep?

346
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:24,809
Yes. Thank you for helping me yesterday.

347
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,039
You lost consciousness,
so I brought you to my room.

348
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,109
If I had been to put you in a hotel room,
people would have seen you.

349
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,319
So it might inconvenience you.

350
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,779
Okay.

351
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:37,750
I haven't called the police yet.

352
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:41,559
What do you want me to do?
If you want, I can call them now.

353
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:43,990
No, don't.

354
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,029
You don't have to.

355
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,259
They didn't do it on purpose.

356
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:50,529
This happened because everyone was drunk.

357
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:52,599
I don't want to cause any trouble
because of that.

358
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,740
Nothing happened last night.

359
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,779
Nothing.

360
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,819
Right. Here.

361
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:10,619
I bought a simple shirt and jeans.

362
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:12,059
I thought you might need some clothes.

363
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,029
Thank you.

364
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,369
Get home safely.

365
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,519
What are you doing right now?

366
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,789
Hey, Ms. Lee.

367
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,430
Are you spying on someone?

368
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,799
Hey. I'm not spying on anyone.
Watch your mouth.

369
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,930
Look, Manager Oh.

370
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:57,230
You can try all you want,

371
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,900
but Mr. Han will be the general manager.

372
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,009
Game over. What's done is done.

373
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,480
Given the situation,
you should accept the result...

374
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,940
and let go of your resentment.

375
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,710
I won't accept anything.

376
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:12,750
Goodness. You know nothing.

377
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,450
What don't I know?

378
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,779
That's what I'm talking about.

379
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:49,990
This is the real face of Han Tae Jun.

380
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
Do you get it now?

381
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,009
Did you look into him?

382
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,049
Yes. It turns out he's good at his job.

383
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,920
I asked a few of the hotel employees.

384
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,190
Other than 1 or 2 employees,
everyone likes him.

385
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,220
The scandal three years ago
is the only bad reputation he has.

386
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,329
But that must have been
a deadly blow to his career.

387
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,930
Because of what happened,
he had to resign from his position.

388
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:11,430
Goodness. It's universal that
women are always the problem.

389
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,900
These are sleeping pills.

390
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,420
Gosh. What on earth happened?
You rarely spend the night out.

391
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,180
Do you know how furious your father was?

392
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,519
I had never seen him so furious like that.

393
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:40,559
I bet he couldn't sleep at all last night.

394
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,230
- You think so? I doubt that.
- Gosh.

395
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,299
Gosh, young lady.

396
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,630
It's fine.

397
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:18,090
The jeans are big.

398
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,269
Two hundred dollars...

399
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,780
Hello. Is that you, Eun Joo?

400
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,480
Who is this?

401
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,449
Hey, this is Choi Young Jae.

402
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,949
The guy from the birthday party.

403
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:48,659
The bellboy who gave me
the worst birthday party?

404
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:53,130
What? You want to apologize?

405
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,699
Is making an apology that easy for you?

406
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:58,940
Do you think an apology will make
everything you did go away?

407
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,539
Forget it. I don't need your apology.

408
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:04,670
Don't call me ever again.

409
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:06,980
Hello? Are you there?

410
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:15,820
(Phone number)

411
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,010
What? Is something wrong?

412
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:43,309
What? No. It's nothing.

413
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:46,920
Tae Jun came by earlier
and sat there for a while.

414
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,449
Is it your turn now? What's going on?

415
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:50,019
Did you two fight again?

416
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:51,420
No.

417
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,360
How's the food? Do you like it?

418
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,059
Yes. It's cold, but it's pretty good.

419
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,630
Do you want to meet with my friend
who made that?

420
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:05,400
This friend of mine has never had
any culinary training.

421
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,239
But my friend seemed pretty talented.

422
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:10,139
- How old is your friend?
- Twenty-two.

423
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:11,840
Twenty-three in Korean age, though.

424
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:13,909
Did he serve in the military?

425
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:15,309
It's a girl.

426
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:20,119
- No.
- What?

427
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:21,619
No women.

428
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,190
You can't turn her down because of
her gender. Not in this day and age.

429
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,460
Kitchen is like the military.

430
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,230
Women and men can't be equal.

431
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,659
Gosh. But still.
Can you at least meet with her?

432
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:33,300
Stop hassling me. Don't talk to me.

433
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,800
- Goodness.
- Manager Seo. Please pick up.

434
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:38,099
Yes, this is Manager Seo Jin Young.

435
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,900
Manager Seo, an item went missing.

436
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,969
What?

437
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:44,639
- I'm serious.
- What's going on?

438
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:48,239
She said she lost her watch and ring.

439
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,849
Wait. Are you the general manager?

440
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:52,210
I'm the duty assistant manager.

441
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,690
I don't care what your title says.

442
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,150
Get me the general manager.

443
00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:00,059
Ma'am, it is in our manual that
I must be the first one...

444
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:01,690
to handle any incidents
that take place in the hotel.

445
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:02,889
Please tell me what happened.

446
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,190
Listen.

447
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:08,300
After these ladies left
after cleaning the room,

448
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:11,000
I can't find my watch and ring.

449
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,599
I asked them if they had seen
my watch and ring.

450
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,570
They said they had not seen any of it.

451
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,110
We really didn't see anything.

452
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,539
We don't touch any valuables in the rooms.

453
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,280
I saw the ring only an hour ago.

454
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,280
Why would they disappear all of a sudden?

455
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,519
Where could they have gone
if you didn't take them?

456
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,619
Do they have feet?
Did they run away on their own?

457
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,719
Ma'am, please calm down.

458
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:36,389
We will do our best
to find the missing items.

459
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:40,199
However, we are not responsible
for any items you lost.

460
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,670
What on earth?
How could a hotel be this inhospitable?

461
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:48,199
How could the hotel not be responsible
for items that went missing in the hotel?

462
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,909
How unreasonable can you be?

463
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,679
That is the hotel policy, ma'am.

464
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,550
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- I don't care what the policy says.

465
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,610
Go and find my ring.

466
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,079
Where on earth did they go?

467
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,449
This is crazy.

468
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,190
Goodness.

469
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,730
Did you also check
behind the dressing table and the bed?

470
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:14,860
We even checked the bathroom
and the trash bin too.

471
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,329
Gosh. This is going to be a problem.

472
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:18,829
She didn't seem like the type
to let this go.

473
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:23,510
By the way, where did Ms. Lee go?
Why isn't she here?

474
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,610
This is a betrayal.

475
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,449
I waited for him for three years.

476
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:33,650
How could he do this to me?

477
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,820
How could he?

478
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,030
Ms. Lee!

479
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,460
What are you doing here?

480
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,599
Can't you see? I'm blowing my nose.

481
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:52,570
Items went missing in the room.

482
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,300
You should be trying to resolve
the problem as a manager.

483
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,710
Why are you acting like a loser here?

484
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,280
What? A loser?

485
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,579
You're crying in here.
Only a loser would do that.

486
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,019
Did you just call me a loser?
How dare you?

487
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:08,719
All right. So did you toss your manners...

488
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:10,219
now that you're
the duty assistant manager?

489
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:11,820
- Right now...
- I get that...

490
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,519
one's skill and title
come first in this world.

491
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,159
But given our age and work experience,

492
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:16,590
I'm your senior manager.

493
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,460
Then act like one.

494
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,099
You never follow any instructions.

495
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:21,960
You spread rumors all over the hotel.

496
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,199
You create cliques like some kids
and cause conflicts between departments.

497
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:26,599
And when there's a problem,
you always weasel your way out of it.

498
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:29,210
- You...
- Be honest to yourself and reflect...

499
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,670
how childish and sly you are.

500
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,150
You...

501
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:40,920
Goodness.

502
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,059
- Goodness. What do we do?
- You...

503
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:52,530
- What do you think? We should stop them.
- Get your hands off me.

504
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,460
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

505
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,900
What are you doing?

506
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,199
What's going on, Manager Seo?

507
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:00,900
- You...
- Why are you fighting?

508
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,909
Manager Seo.

509
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,570
You're dead meat.

510
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,309
- I've been patient all this time.
- Gosh.

511
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,510
Seriously.

512
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,940
Gosh. Let go of me.

513
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,980
- I don't care if I get fired today.
- Gosh.

514
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,280
- What are you doing? Stop it.
- Gosh.

515
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,849
You can't do this! You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves for fighting!

516
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:19,389
Hey, do you run this hotel alone?
Are you the only manager here?

517
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:22,159
You're a manager.
Then you'd better act like one!

518
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:23,590
What? How dare you be so rude?

519
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,630
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

520
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,829
Stop it!

521
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,530
You're embarrassing us!

522
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:32,369
You two are unbelievable.
Are you two gangsters?

523
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:34,099
You should be setting an example
for the others.

524
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,199
Let's go.

525
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,469
Let them fight or pull each other's hair.
Let them do whatever they want.

526
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,380
They should know how embarrassing this is.
They're both grown women.

527
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,309
Or are they? Goodness.

528
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,050
How could they seriously fight like that?

529
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,119
If I find you neglecting your duty again,

530
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:55,489
I will report you to the general manager.

531
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,460
Do your job.

532
00:41:05,269 --> 00:41:06,440
She's so mean.

533
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,670
She hit me with her head.

534
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,570
Gosh.

535
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:29,019
Hello.

536
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,170
I'm sorry.

537
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,670
Are you all right?

538
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,710
Hey, what's going on?
What happened to your face?

539
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:21,710
Jin Young.

540
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,550
Manager Seo.

541
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:27,579
Yes, I'm listening.

542
00:42:31,389 --> 00:42:33,019
Sorry for yelling at you earlier.

543
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,590
We had a small accident last night.

544
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,000
But I was trying to handle it
without letting people know. That's why.

545
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,329
And that girl is Young Jae's friend.

546
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:48,940
I don't care.

547
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:01,079
- You're here, Manager Seo.
- Yes. What?

548
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,420
The front desk
was looking for you earlier.

549
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,019
- The front desk?
- Yes.

550
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:07,159
One of the guests was looking for you.

551
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:09,019
He was staying in the villa.

552
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:16,829
Who is it?

553
00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:19,030
This is the duty assistant manager,
Seo Jin Young.

554
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:20,940
Hey, boss.

555
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:27,880
- Come on in.
- Okay.

556
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,010
- Please wait here.
- Okay.

557
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,469
You're late again.

558
00:43:58,139 --> 00:43:59,440
Yes.

559
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:02,139
Something urgent came up in another room.

560
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,710
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

561
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:07,050
I didn't know what you would like,
so I ordered a French meal.

562
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,380
Pardon?

563
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,920
I'm sorry.

564
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,260
I'm not allowed to spend time...

565
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,730
with a guest for personal matters
at the hotel during my shift.

566
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:19,400
Is that so?

567
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:22,800
Then let's go out. Is that okay with you?

568
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,409
This is my lunch break now.

569
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,110
Do you know any good restaurants nearby?

570
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,880
- Ma'am, I asked for more of this.
- Okay.

571
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,980
Okay.

572
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,380
Give me a bowl. Make that fast.

573
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,679
Here you go.

574
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,849
- I want some rice.
- Okay.

575
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:43,449
- Give me more kimchi.
- Okay.

576
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,889
- I want some water.
- Okay.

577
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,000
Aren't you going to eat?

578
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,099
No, I'm going to eat.

579
00:44:57,869 --> 00:44:59,300
You should add...

580
00:44:59,969 --> 00:45:02,500
some of this sauce. It's really good.

581
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,340
It's so much better
than some Italian spaghetti.

582
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,579
What is it? Why are you laughing?

583
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,650
You just make me laugh.

584
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:17,949
Am I that funny?

585
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,099
Isn't it tough to work in a hotel?

586
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:34,239
I'm sure you meet all kinds of people.

587
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:35,969
Of course, it's tough.

588
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:40,010
Do you know how much the suite
you're staying in costs per night?

589
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:43,880
It costs a lot more than
our monthly salary.

590
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,920
When it's our job
to interact with rich guests,

591
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,420
we have four-dollar kalguksu for lunch.

592
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:52,750
No matter how tough our job is,
we can't let the guests see...

593
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,719
how much we hate it.

594
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:57,190
If they need something, we must do
everything we can to get it done.

595
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:02,500
Despite our effort,
they complain more than they thank us.

596
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,969
But it's rewarding
for all of us to work here...

597
00:46:05,969 --> 00:46:07,170
because we're professionals.

598
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,309
Did you ever think it wasn't fair?

599
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,110
When you saw people...

600
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:18,250
spending more than your monthly salary
in one night,

601
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,519
didn't you ever think
that life wasn't fair?

602
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,389
At first, I did. But not anymore.

603
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,619
They have their own lives.

604
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,630
And I have my own.

605
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,260
No matter how rich they are,

606
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:37,829
they can't buy the same happiness
I have in life. Don't you agree?

607
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:03,889
Right. You said this was
your first time in Seoul, right?

608
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:07,400
Our hotel offers a city tour program.
Would you like to try that out?

609
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:09,199
Sure.

610
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,730
I'll get you the brochure for it.

611
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:18,409
Right!

612
00:47:18,409 --> 00:47:20,809
Thank you for buying me kalguksu.

613
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,840
Scotch?

614
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:51,739
Thank you.

615
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:02,650
Leo.

616
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:06,559
What do you think happiness is?

617
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:14,429
A blondie, 36-24-36,

618
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:16,469
and blues eyes.

619
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:18,230
I'm not joking.

620
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:23,639
Happiness. I'm not sure.

621
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:26,309
Having a lot of money, eating good food,

622
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,840
and getting respected in society.

623
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,380
Isn't that a happy life?

624
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,780
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

625
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:35,579
Just because.

626
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:02,679
Go through
the board directors of the hotel...

627
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:05,449
and see who can join our side.

628
00:49:06,449 --> 00:49:08,980
Board directors?

629
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,489
Okay.

630
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:14,960
Someone who can stop Han Tae Jun
from becoming the general manager.

631
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,030
Let me introduce my daughter to you.

632
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:39,510
Let's begin our revenge.

633
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:51,789
- We found it!
- We found it!

634
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:56,199
I will not get up until you forgive me.
