00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:03,879
(Episode 7, Things That Make Me Lonely)

2
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,600
- Yoon Hee.
- Hey, Young Jae.

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,969
You should have called me first.

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,710
I'm not here to see you.

5
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:38,380
Okay.

6
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,380
Give me a second.

7
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,960
You should just go.

8
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:54,630
I have some time left. I'll walk with you.

9
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:56,229
Can a hotel employee play hooky?

10
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:57,229
It's up to me.

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,600
I want to live my life
doing whatever I want.

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,100
Would you have been able to do the same
if you weren't the CEO's son?

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,370
Well, I don't know.

14
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,170
But I hate it
when people meddle in my life.

15
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,969
No one likes that.

16
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,569
Same here.

17
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:12,379
But I must do what I have to
and take responsibility for my action.

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,750
You sound like my mom.

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,379
I'm older than you.

20
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:17,780
But I'm more mature than you.

21
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,849
Address me politely next time.

22
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,519
It's too early for lunch.

23
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,390
You haven't had breakfast yet, right?
I know a great pizzeria nearby.

24
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,390
Let's have that for brunch.

25
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,629
I had breakfast.

26
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:31,760
I'm full. I had a whole bowl
of porridge abalone.

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,969
You should go now.
I'm sure you have to be at the hotel now.

28
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,530
Okay. Then get in.

29
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,700
No. I can walk alone.

30
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,439
I thought you had to see someone
at the hotel.

31
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,510
Well, I'll go by myself. You can just go.

32
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,310
- Is it a man?
- The person I have to see?

33
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,250
- Yes.
- Yes.

34
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,859
Okay.

35
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,390
Did you think about it?

36
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,799
- What?
- What I told you.

37
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,159
I asked if I could like you.

38
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:08,870
Oh, that. To be honest,
I couldn't think about what you said.

39
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,139
But you shouldn't.

40
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:13,770
Because of another man?

41
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,870
Well, that's possible.

42
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,180
Okay. I'm fine with anything.

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,849
But whatever you do or think,

44
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,419
my feelings won't change.

45
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,490
I just hope you know that.

46
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,689
Young Jae.

47
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,159
If you do that,
you'll only be torturing yourself.

48
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:40,370
I don't have any feelings for you.
If you keep having feelings for me,

49
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:42,330
doesn't it mean
you're getting the bad end of the deal?

50
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,569
And it will only make me feel
uncomfortable and bad for you.

51
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,870
You must not know
because you're still young.

52
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,509
That's not what love is.

53
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:51,680
Love isn't some business transaction
where you try to see...

54
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,909
which party had a better end of the deal.

55
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,310
I don't care what people say.
I will do what I want.

56
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,379
And I will follow what my heart tells me.

57
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,150
So don't try to stop me.

58
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,189
Have a good time with your boyfriend.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,099
Young Jae.

60
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:15,669
It's Eun Joo.

61
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,939
I'm meeting up with Eun Joo.

62
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,909
Bye.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,129
Gosh.

64
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:51,900
Eun Joo. You gave me a scare.

65
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,710
That was the point, Ms. Runaway.

66
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,009
How did you get in my room?

67
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,009
I was waiting for you
in front of the door.

68
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:58,810
A handsome hotel employee
opened it for me.

69
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,240
The tall one?

70
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,949
Yes. Was his name Hyun Chul?

71
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:03,210
Yes. That's probably his name.

72
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:05,050
That's mine.

73
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,219
Hey, there are
so many cute guys at the hotel.

74
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,360
Maybe they only hire good-looking ones.

75
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:16,290
This is a service industry.
They can't hire scary-looking people.

76
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:18,300
I brought some underwear too.

77
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,500
Okay. Thanks.

78
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:24,000
Gosh. The view here is amazing.

79
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,500
I can see the river too.

80
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,170
What a view!

81
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,810
You came here because of Young Jae, right?

82
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,449
No.

83
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,550
- Then is it because of that guy?
- Who?

84
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:43,420
The tall bellman.

85
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,319
- Was his name Hyun Chul?
- Are you crazy?

86
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:49,329
Then who is this knight in shining armor
who saved you from the rain?

87
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,399
The general manager.

88
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,529
The general manager?

89
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:56,500
Don't you remember him?

90
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,769
I was in trouble at my birthday party.

91
00:04:58,769 --> 00:04:59,939
Yes. Young Jae helped you.

92
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:02,509
No. The guy who carried me out
when I passed out.

93
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,839
Right. That's the guy I'm talking about.

94
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,740
The tall guy, Hyun Chul.

95
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:09,050
Gosh.

96
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,920
Are you talking about that man?

97
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,120
Yes. He's not that old. He's not married.

98
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Listen to yourself.

99
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:19,019
Anyway, he's older than you.

100
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,730
Young Jae is older than me too.

101
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,699
This is really bad.

102
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,730
You seriously need help.

103
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:27,370
Yes, I do.

104
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,899
You need to
snap out of this delusion first.

105
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,069
No. I want to keep
living in delusion and die.

106
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,660
- You must be upset.
- What?

107
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,430
It doesn't matter
how expensive your lipstick is.

108
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,100
Your lips still look so lifeless.

109
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:01,629
What?

110
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:05,569
Look at my lips.
Red and vibrant just like roses.

111
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:07,310
Beautiful, right?

112
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,480
- By the way, you...
- Okay. I got it.

113
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,509
- Goodness.
- I'm looking for Ms. Seo Jin Young.

114
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:13,709
That's me.

115
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:16,779
Goodness.

116
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,649
Please sign here.

117
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:23,250
- How many roses are there?
- Okay.

118
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,620
There are 300 roses.

119
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,660
Wait.

120
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,759
- Three hundred roses?
- Thank you.

121
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:34,269
Did your date from yesterday
send you these flowers?

122
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,509
Doesn't he live in Seocho-dong?

123
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:44,209
Pardon?

124
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,810
Does he run a flower shop?

125
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,000
Hello. I guess you're not busy today.

126
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,459
How did you know I was here?

127
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,600
As long as you stay at this hotel,
I'll know everything about you.

128
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,899
- What brings you here?
- To return this.

129
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:12,899
Thank you.

130
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,139
Can you put that there?

131
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,240
Sure.

132
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,110
Well, you must be good at pool.

133
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,250
Do you want to play a game?

134
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,079
No. I don't know how to play.

135
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,389
What else are you good at
other than your job?

136
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:34,930
None, I guess.

137
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,000
Spare me some time later. I'll teach you.

138
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:42,699
Well,

139
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,199
it's about the flowers you sent.

140
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,410
Did you like your second room service?

141
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,610
Yes. It was very nice. Thank you.

142
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,449
- But...
- "But?"

143
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,779
you shouldn't send me flowers again.

144
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,750
I have to share the office
with other managers.

145
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,420
Receiving such gifts from guests...

146
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,920
will be frowned upon by other employees.

147
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:07,060
Okay.
I'll send them to your house next time.

148
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,129
Aren't you curious
about your third room service?

149
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,399
As long as you stay here,

150
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,670
I want to give you the best service.

151
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,879
- But...
- That again.

152
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,639
But...

153
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:31,920
if you keep doing this,
it will make me feel uncomfortable.

154
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:34,789
Do I make you uncomfortable?

155
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,259
No. Not you.

156
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:41,029
Receiving presents from you...

157
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:42,190
Room service?

158
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,000
Yes. Room service.

159
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,570
We should be giving you room service.

160
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,039
- But the guest can't...
- The guest?

161
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,210
When we met in Las Vegas,
was I a guest to you?

162
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,779
If you're uncomfortable having me
as a guest, I'll switch hotels.

163
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,220
- No. That's not what I meant.
- Then...

164
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,320
I don't know.

165
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:14,129
I'm not sure what this is.

166
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,889
What aren't you sure about?

167
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:21,070
Are you not sure the flowers you received
from me are roses or lilies?

168
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,399
Or are you not sure if I'm just a guest
at the hotel or a new man in your life?

169
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:31,809
Well,

170
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,149
I...

171
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,789
I should get going.

172
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,320
Thank you for the roses.

173
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:47,960
Jin Young.

174
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:58,039
Be it business or game.

175
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:01,039
I had always chosen the opponent
I could beat.

176
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:05,480
But this time,
I'm not sure how this will turn out.

177
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:10,080
I really can't tell.
But there's nothing I can do.

178
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,289
Because I already started it.

179
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:41,250
Snap out of it.
He was just playing around.

180
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,509
Don't fall for it.

181
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,980
No. Perhaps...

182
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,549
Gosh. This is driving me crazy.

183
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,059
There you were.
I've been looking all over for you.

184
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,259
The bathroom, the restaurant,
and the sauna.

185
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,799
I looked everywhere for you.

186
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,269
I looked into what you had asked before.

187
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,769
It will cost a lot more than we expected.

188
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:41,240
But I told him
to get started on it anyway.

189
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:46,110
Boss, are you not well?

190
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,480
I don't want to talk about work today.

191
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,440
What a surprise.

192
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,269
I can't believe you called me first.

193
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,179
And you came to see me too.

194
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,710
Would you like some drinks?

195
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,509
No. It's fine.

196
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,850
Don't come to my table.

197
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,450
Yes, sir.

198
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,220
What is it? What is this about?

199
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:34,960
I have a favor to ask you.
Will you help me?

200
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,429
Yes. Anything for you.

201
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:37,659
Tell me anything you want.

202
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:39,629
I want to work at this hotel.

203
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:41,100
Can you help me get a job here?

204
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:42,929
What?

205
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:47,340
Actually, I left home.

206
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:49,639
To live on my own, I need to make money.

207
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,080
So I want to work here.

208
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:55,409
Why? Can you not help me?

209
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:57,879
No.

210
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:00,379
Can you wait here for a bit?

211
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,850
I'll take care of this now.

212
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,259
Okay. I have a lot of time.

213
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:05,419
Okay.

214
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,139
Mom.

215
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,419
What? You want me to hire who?

216
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,850
My friend.

217
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:39,519
She needs a place to stay and make money.

218
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,929
She must have no one to turn to but me.

219
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,000
I want her to get a job at our hotel.

220
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,799
It's been a week
since you came to visit me.

221
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,730
And the first thing you ask me
is to give your friend a job?

222
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,470
You probably didn't come to see me
if it hadn't been for your friend.

223
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,539
Right?

224
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,210
But I can't decide that by myself.

225
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,750
Hello, Ms. Yoon. Did you want to see me?

226
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,779
Please sit.

227
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,120
My son asked me for a personal favor.

228
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,389
He wants his friend
to get a job at the hotel.

229
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,759
What do you think we should do?

230
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,429
I'll support your decision.

231
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,200
- Are you close to this friend?
- Yes.

232
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,940
Do you have to help your friend?

233
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,080
I want to.

234
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:36,509
Fine.

235
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,149
But I have a condition.
You will start working at the hotel again.

236
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:45,059
I will deduct all the days you missed
from your paycheck.

237
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:47,889
I will not allow tardiness, skipping work,
or calling in sick no matter what.

238
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:50,789
Until you pass out and have to be
transported to the hospital,

239
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,659
you will come to work.

240
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:56,669
Right. You won't be getting
any days off from now on.

241
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,570
That's your punishment
for skipping work without my permission.

242
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,570
If you violate any of these,

243
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,940
you and your friend will be fired.

244
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,480
What is this?

245
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,480
It's not easy to find a position
for your friend.

246
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,480
You asked us to do your friend a favor.
Then you ought to do something for us.

247
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,649
Isn't that a fair deal?

248
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,620
Fine. I'll do it.

249
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,759
Fine, I'll work here.

250
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:20,820
Bring your friend to my office.

251
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:23,230
You will start working today.

252
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:36,240
Come in.

253
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:40,309
This is my friend.

254
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:43,950
Yoon Hee, say hello.
He's the general manager of our hotel.

255
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,289
Hello. I'm Kim Yoon Hee.

256
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,519
I look forward to working with you.

257
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,429
Hello.

258
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,700
Employees cannot enter through the lobby
unless there's a special reason.

259
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,409
You will be using the paths down here.

260
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:10,039
- Keep that in mind.
- Okay.

261
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,210
This path leads to the kitchen.

262
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,809
There are many paths here,
so it may be a bit confusing.

263
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:14,080
Don't forget that.

264
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,649
She won't have to come to the kitchen.

265
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:16,950
Be quiet.

266
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:18,779
Which department am I going to work in?

267
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,120
- Well...
- Give her a comfy position...

268
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:22,090
where she won't have to be on her feet.

269
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,690
Send her to PR or the front desk.

270
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,919
- Hello.
- Hi.

271
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,519
She can't work at the front desk.

272
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,029
They have to handle money,
so not anyone can work there.

273
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,830
They must be fluent
in English and Japanese.

274
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,830
But that won't be easy, right?

275
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,259
Right. I didn't expect
to get a comfy position from the start.

276
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,629
That's why I may send you
to Food and Beverage.

277
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,039
Gosh. That position will be tough
on Yoon Hee.

278
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,240
She's delicate, to begin with.

279
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,710
Be quiet. And I'm not delicate.

280
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,240
What do people do in Food and Beverage?

281
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,110
Don't you know that
they are waiters and waitresses?

282
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,580
They end at 10 p.m. or 2 a.m.
if their shift runs late.

283
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,649
Gosh.

284
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,950
You can learn the basics
about hotel service in that department.

285
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,120
It may be exhausting,
but you can learn things quickly there.

286
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,990
Who's going to teach me?

287
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,830
The team leader of the department
will train you for three weeks.

288
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,259
For new recruits,

289
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:06,599
they go through three-month training.

290
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,829
But for special recruits,
it's up to the team leader...

291
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:11,029
to put you on the field
after 2 or 3 weeks' of training.

292
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,700
Any other questions?

293
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,640
Is there a dorm for employees?

294
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,009
Working at the hotel...

295
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:20,839
while staying at the villa
doesn't seem right.

296
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,849
The villa?

297
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,309
The villa at our hotel?

298
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,680
Hey, you were staying at the villa?

299
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,990
That might not be appropriate, right?

300
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,349
Yes, you're right.

301
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,390
Did you also know that
she was staying at the villa?

302
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:33,720
You should find a place to stay quickly.

303
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:35,759
I'll only stay at the villa
until I find my own place.

304
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,759
- Is that allowed?
- Of course.

305
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:40,230
- Right?
- Yes, only until you find a place.

306
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,599
It won't be good if other employees
find out that you're staying there...

307
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:44,130
even with that big discount.

308
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:45,640
Okay.

309
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,269
Young Jae, don't tell anyone.

310
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,769
Okay.

311
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,609
- Don't forget the promise you made.
- I said okay, didn't I?

312
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,940
A promise? What did you promise?

313
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,650
- It's just between us.
- It's just between us.

314
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,410
Oh, here it comes, and it tingles

315
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:29,250
And the clock strikes tonight

316
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,980
Keep it clean

317
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,519
Keep it clean

318
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,940
Oh, no.

319
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:04,880
I'm sorry!

320
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,839
It's 9 a.m. on the dot.

321
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:32,710
I'm not late, right?

322
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:36,509
Yes. It is 9 a.m. on the dot.

323
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,349
But you're not ready to receive guests.

324
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:44,089
Go downstairs, wash your face,
comb your hair, wipe off your sweat,

325
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:45,259
and come upstairs.

326
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,930
I will consider the time you're away
as your tardiness.

327
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,660
You should come to work 10 or 20 minutes
before your shift starts tomorrow.

328
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,269
Good going.

329
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,109
Where was your head at?
How could you drop the box?

330
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,210
You might think that
I'm making a huge fuss...

331
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,450
over breaking a box of sauces.
But let me tell you something.

332
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,049
What I'm pointing out to you
is your attitude.

333
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,180
What if the box of sauces belonged to you?

334
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,150
Would you have been that careless
and broke all the bottles?

335
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,859
I'm sorry.

336
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,759
Go and get the box again.

337
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:23,490
Yes, chef.

338
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,559
- Why are you stepping in?
- Pardon?

339
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,670
Make one more mistake. Then you're fired.

340
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,069
Why are you still here?
Go and get the box!

341
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,640
Yes, chef.

342
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,910
- Assistant Lee.
- Yes, chef.

343
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,680
Don't give her any tasks
where she has to touch water.

344
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,750
I noticed that
she has scrapes on her hands.

345
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:51,490
Let's start setting the table
with basic utensils.

346
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,390
Change the tablecloth first.

347
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,289
Place the fork, knife, and water glass.

348
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:57,059
Put the small plate in the middle.

349
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,900
Lastly, put the napkin
on top of the plate.

350
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,829
Tell me how you'd set the table
for a one-course meal.

351
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,799
The order goes from the appetizer,
main dish, and dessert.

352
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,900
Put it between the fork and the knife,
which will be already placed on the table.

353
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,140
Then place the fork and the knife
for the main dish.

354
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,079
Place a coffee spoon closest to the dish.

355
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:13,380
How will you set the table for dinner?

356
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,450
Usually, it's a six-course meal.

357
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,819
The order goes from the appetizer, soup,
sherbert, main dish, dessert, and coffee.

358
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:28,230
Yes. If the guests order wine,
place the wine glasses.

359
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,589
Then place the utensils
from outside to inside...

360
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,660
in the order of the dishes.

361
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,529
You have a good memory.

362
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,269
Let's see if you can execute
as well as you remember.

363
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:39,000
Let's start with the dinner table.

364
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,509
Get ready. Go.

365
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,720
The direction of the blade.

366
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:04,059
The forks for the salad and the main dish
have been switched.

367
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,000
They are too tightly placed.

368
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,799
You don't place forks
that touched the floor back on the table.

369
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,710
These forks go inside our guests' mouths.

370
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,769
Keep that in mind.

371
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:19,680
- Yes.
- "Yes, sir."

372
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,779
Yes, sir.

373
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,410
You need more than your memory
to be a good waitress.

374
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,549
You must learn it
with your body and heart.

375
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:28,019
You must practice until you get it right.

376
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:29,119
Understood?

377
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:30,720
Yes, sir.

378
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:33,990
Don't think you'll have an easy time here
because the general manager hired you.

379
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,490
If you're not competent
or I don't see any potential in you,

380
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,200
I can fire you whenever I want.

381
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,359
I didn't think it'd be easy working here.

382
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,529
"Sir."

383
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:44,769
Sir.

384
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:48,170
Memorize all the dishes on our menu.

385
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:51,210
And you must learn all the types...

386
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,910
and locations of all the utensils
we have here by today.

387
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,980
Understood?

388
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,579
Okay. I mean, yes, sir.

389
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,279
Four bottles of Tabasco.

390
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,990
I bet the executive chef yelled at you
because of me.

391
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:14,400
Sorry.

392
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,299
Ranch.

393
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
All done.

394
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,180
Can you put the box back where it was
and get out of my way?

395
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,380
- I'll carry it for you.
- Put it back.

396
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,750
I haven't seen you around here.
Are you new?

397
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,460
I haven't seen you around here either.
Are you also new?

398
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:41,890
What?

399
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,900
I'm saying this one last time.
Put the box where it was.

400
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,529
If you break them again, I'll get fired.

401
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,470
If I lose my job here, I'll have nowhere
to go or no place to work.

402
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,670
Then will you take responsibility for it?

403
00:23:58,539 --> 00:23:59,680
Hey.

404
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:06,619
Hey!

405
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,420
Hey!

406
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,460
Hey, open up!

407
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,730
Gosh. Darn it.

408
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,799
Stay there for an hour or two.

409
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,460
That will be enough to cool you off.

410
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,670
What? In the freezer?

411
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,529
Okay.

412
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,000
The emergency bell in the freezer rang.

413
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,640
Some idiot got locked up there.

414
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,369
I can just call the kitchen.

415
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,640
The telephone line is under construction.

416
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,680
Right.

417
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,109
- I'll go downstairs.
- Okay.

418
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:37,450
Yes.

419
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:40,019
The swimming pool will be open
until 8 p.m.

420
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:41,079
You can use it now.

421
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,690
The water is warm. I mean, it'll be cool.

422
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,559
I see. I'm not sure. You should call
the swimming pool directly.

423
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,930
No. Why don't I look into that for you?

424
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,130
Yes. Thank you.

425
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:53,759
Who was that?

426
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,769
The guest is asking about the temperature
of the water and how deep it is.

427
00:24:57,099 --> 00:24:58,269
You can call the swimming pool.

428
00:24:58,369 --> 00:24:59,440
I should check it myself.

429
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,099
Besides, I have something
for Ms. Lee at the gym too.

430
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:03,769
Watch out for the water.

431
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:05,440
Watch out for women.

432
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,410
Have a good shift.

433
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,230
I'm sorry.

434
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,079
Gosh.

435
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,279
- I'm sorry to startle you.
- No. It's okay.

436
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,160
Here. You must be a good swimmer.

437
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,799
- What about you?
- I can barely float on the water.

438
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,829
Spare me some time. I can teach you.

439
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:35,470
Gosh. Sure.

440
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,769
- The roses...
- The roses...

441
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,069
You should go first.

442
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,940
- No. You should go first.
- No. You go ahead.

443
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,940
Aren't you curious
why I sent you 300 roses?

444
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,950
Pardon?

445
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,779
Well, I am curious.

446
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,890
Why 300 roses?

447
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,019
Why don't you guess? It's a quiz.

448
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,759
Let me give you a hint.
It has to do with Las Vegas.

449
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,259
Las Vegas?

450
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,339
Three hundred?

451
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,339
I'm a simple woman.
I'm not good at quizzes.

452
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:20,140
Can you just tell me?

453
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,579
The restaurant is called 300 Roses.

454
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,880
The restaurant?

455
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,920
The restaurant where I saw you
for the first time.

456
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:32,720
I see. The one with the tough steak
and awful service.

457
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,589
They spilled coffee on my scarf.

458
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:36,190
That awful restaurant?

459
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,460
The steak was bad.
But I can't forget that restaurant.

460
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:45,200
It's the restaurant where I saw you
for the first time.

461
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,009
I see. That's why you sent me 300 roses.

462
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,910
But I'm glad.

463
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,819
I would've been in big trouble
if it had been called One Million Roses.

464
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,220
Right.

465
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,619
Gosh. That restaurant, 300 Roses.

466
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,730
And my scarf.

467
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:12,029
I wish I could go back there.

468
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:16,269
You live in the US.
You can easily go back.

469
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,029
With you.

470
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
I...

471
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,549
I should get going. Have a good workout.

472
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,650
Will you go with me?

473
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,089
It'd be great if I could go to Vegas.

474
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:42,130
With me.

475
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:47,759
I'm not sure.

476
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,660
Gosh, Manager Seo. What happened?

477
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:00,369
Goodness.

478
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,309
Is it raining outside?

479
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:06,609
No.

480
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:09,750
Then why are you soaked?
You look like a rat that fell into water.

481
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,380
I fell into the swimming pool.

482
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,480
A rat that fell into water.

483
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,720
Wait. Why did you go there?
You can't swim.

484
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,890
I know. Right?

485
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:20,490
You went into the pool
with your clothes on?

486
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,960
What? That's odd.

487
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,000
Gosh. I was careless and fell.

488
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:29,200
Manager Seo.
Duty Assistant Manager, please answer.

489
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,630
Yes, this is Seo Jin Young.

490
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,700
What's this?

491
00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:42,710
Let's have sushi for lunch.

492
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,109
Okay.

493
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,819
I should meet with the people
from the bank next week.

494
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,720
Can you make appointments with the bank
that holds the most Seoul Hotel bonds?

495
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:58,490
And we have a meeting with the Chairman
of Hangang Logistics today, right?

496
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,730
What time is that?

497
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,170
What is it?

498
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,269
I think I just found the person
you were looking for.

499
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,119
I just got this.

500
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,960
Cancel all of my appointments
for this afternoon.

501
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:44,009
(Here's the file you requested.)

502
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:45,309
(Shin Jang Young)

503
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,250
Manager Seo!

504
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,319
- Hey, Mi Hee.
- Hello.

505
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:56,720
Let me help you.

506
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,819
- Thank you.
- Sure.

507
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:02,690
Why did you change your uniform?

508
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:04,990
Oh, this? Something happened.

509
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:08,059
By the way, is it true?

510
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,400
I heard a hotel guest sent you...

511
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,470
three hundred roses.

512
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,769
You heard it from Lee Soon Jung, right?

513
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,509
Gosh. Good for you.

514
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:19,779
He must be smitten with you. Right?

515
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,150
Well, I wouldn't say that.

516
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,950
He wanted to thank me
for giving him a tour of the city.

517
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,920
Gosh. No man would give you 300 roses...

518
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,019
just for showing around the city.

519
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:30,089
That's absurd.

520
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:34,019
Well, I guess
he is a bit interested in me.

521
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,730
It's more than just some interest.

522
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:39,859
I wonder who he is. I'm so curious.

523
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:40,930
Is that so?

524
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,670
Gosh.

525
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:45,740
Excuse me.

526
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,349
Wait! I brought this back.

527
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,390
Is that him?

528
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,519
No, it's not.

529
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,809
(Police)

530
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:38,519
There's no man named Shin Jang Young here.

531
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:40,589
But his address is registered here.

532
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:43,490
Yes, his address is registered here.
But someone else lives here.

533
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,630
What do you mean?

534
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,829
According to
the chief of this fishing village,

535
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:48,630
someone else took over his house.

536
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,630
He's under a livelihood program.

537
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:52,640
He comes and goes.

538
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,569
But he must frequently visit
the restaurant run by Ok Ja over there.

539
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:55,609
He told me to check there.

540
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,470
Ok Ja.

541
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,509
- Hey. Gosh.
- Goodness.

542
00:34:00,509 --> 00:34:02,480
Gosh. It's that nuisance again.

543
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,180
Why did you come here again?

544
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,920
Come on. Stop yelling at me
and give me some gukbap.

545
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,250
- Please wait.
- Gosh.

546
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,619
You're not eating here!

547
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,860
Mom, stop it. Don't you feel bad for him?

548
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,519
Why would I feel bad for him?

549
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,639
Welcome.

550
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,239
Gosh. Welcome.

551
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,750
An out-of-towner at this hour?
Please sit down.

552
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,909
What would you like?

553
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,579
Whatever you have.

554
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,420
Gosh. I can't give you whatever I have.

555
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,989
But my restaurant is famous
for spicy sea raven stew.

556
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:45,559
But if you have sashimi, you get
the spicy seafood stew on the house.

557
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:46,590
Do you want some sashimi?

558
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:51,630
What do you want to eat, sir?

559
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:55,059
Just give me whatever you have.

560
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,769
What about drinks? No drinks?

561
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,800
- I'll take it.
- Okay.

562
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,969
Please wait, then. Sit down.

563
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:11,280
Gosh. How nice.

564
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,650
- Give me one more glass, please.
- Sorry?

565
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,960
Okay.

566
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,030
Sir.

567
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,929
Would you like to have a drink?

568
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:33,800
A drink?

569
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:38,369
Goodness.
I feel awful crashing your meal like this.

570
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:49,650
That hits the spot.

571
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:54,389
Gosh. This washes down the grease
I had for the past ten years.

572
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:58,860
Gosh. Thank you.

573
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,230
What line of work are you in?

574
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,670
Me?

575
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:05,800
Gosh. I'm too old to be working.

576
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,269
I just look after my kids. That's all.

577
00:36:08,269 --> 00:36:10,110
You? As if.

578
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,340
You're a homeless man
who has no place to go.

579
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:14,440
You got lucky today.

580
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,349
You get to drink today thanks to this man
who showed up out of the blue.

581
00:36:17,949 --> 00:36:21,349
There are some good days in life too.
You wench.

582
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,820
Where's my cigarette?

583
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,659
Here.

584
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:32,429
What? Okay. Thank you.

585
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:34,500
Wait.

586
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:37,199
I'll smoke that one later.

587
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,639
Can you light it for me?

588
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:46,579
Do you not have any children?

589
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:48,409
No.

590
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,449
Of course, you do.

591
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,179
It's all in the past.

592
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:56,250
After my wife passed away,

593
00:36:58,019 --> 00:37:00,420
I sent my son to the US for his studies.

594
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,659
Gosh. For his studies?

595
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,460
How does adoption count
as going abroad to study?

596
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,900
He went over there to study.
It's the same thing.

597
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,300
Why do you always have to do that?

598
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,599
Then did your two-year-old daughter
also go abroad...

599
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:13,869
to study?

600
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,280
Goodness.

601
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,179
You gave up your daughter
for adoption too?

602
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,579
He was addicted to gambling then.

603
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:27,719
He didn't have the time or money
to take care of his kids.

604
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:30,889
He heard that Americans adopted orphans.

605
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:33,460
So he thought that was his chance
and sent her away.

606
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:36,960
Hey, I heard kids
didn't starve in the US, at least.

607
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,360
They get to wear nice clothes, have meat,

608
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,300
and study. That's all I can ask for.

609
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:46,940
- Go away. Ok Ja.
- Yes.

610
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,599
Give me another bottle of soju.

611
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,769
Gosh. I should bring
the spicy seafood stew.

612
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,380
Gosh. I should make the stew.

613
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,809
Hurry up.

614
00:37:57,949 --> 00:37:59,050
Okay.

615
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,980
All right. You should have a drink too.

616
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,849
I feel awful, just drinking your liquor.

617
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,389
After sending them away,

618
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:09,059
was there a time you missed your children?

619
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:10,789
Gosh. What's the point?

620
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,099
They were adopted.
They aren't my kids anymore.

621
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,699
But they are biologically your children.

622
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,769
As a father who abandoned his children,

623
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:20,940
you could have felt sorry or guilty.

624
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,039
That won't make any difference.

625
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,110
Both my children and I were unfortunate.

626
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,110
So I had to forget it and move on.

627
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:30,650
Let's stop talking
about this boring stuff.

628
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,710
We should just drink.

629
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,150
How can mere desires be enough
for parents to forget their children?

630
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,289
How is it possible for them to cut ties?

631
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:42,429
Do you even know
how it feels to live in permeant hatred...

632
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:45,829
of your parent because this relationship
you have no control over...

633
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,860
frightens you?

634
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,199
Because of the fact that he was abandoned,

635
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:53,400
he wasn't able to open up to anyone.

636
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,070
He studied like a madman
and worked day and night.

637
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,809
So he's rich and successful.

638
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,579
But what if he never felt happy
even for a moment?

639
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:08,250
Do you still think
talking about your children is pointless?

640
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:26,699
I wanted to see how you had been living...

641
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:29,610
at least once for myself.

642
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,949
That's all.

643
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:38,679
You will never see me again.

644
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:48,820
This is for the meal.

645
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,000
Hey.

646
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:57,829
- Hey.
- Mom.

647
00:39:58,599 --> 00:39:59,699
Hey.

648
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:01,969
(Lighthouse Sashimi)

649
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:04,070
Hey, young man.

650
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:08,880
Hey. Young man. Are you...

651
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,010
Let's go.

652
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:15,480
Gosh. Let me talk to you for a second.
Young man.

653
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,650
Let's go now!

654
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:29,170
Hey. Wait.

655
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,099
Gosh.

656
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,070
My gosh. Here.

657
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,340
Did you see what he left?

658
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:43,949
Do you even know how much this is?
Look at this!

659
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,949
Gosh.

660
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:16,139
(Here's the file you requested.)

661
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,699
(Favorites)

662
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:29,079
(Ms. Seo Jin Young.)

663
00:43:32,949 --> 00:43:36,989
(I'm at the ocean.)

664
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,809
Honey, do you remember...

665
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:38,449
when we were setting things up here?

666
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,550
This is the tree we planted together.

667
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:43,489
Yes. The cherry tree.

668
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,989
I hope that tree...

669
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,989
will grow for centuries and on...

670
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:54,699
with our hotel
and see all of its successes.

671
00:44:56,329 --> 00:44:57,469
Ms. Yoon!

672
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,139
- Are you going home now?
- Yes. You must be on duty today.

673
00:45:02,139 --> 00:45:04,309
Yes. I'm on my way to have dinner.

674
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:06,610
I thought of you. Let's eat together.

675
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,010
Should I? I can take this chance
to look around the cafeteria too.

676
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:15,050
- Enjoy.
- Okay.

677
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:17,050
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

678
00:45:18,289 --> 00:45:20,559
Ma'am, please wait for a bit.
The food will be right out.

679
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:21,690
Okay.

680
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:30,400
Are you not well? You look a bit down.

681
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:34,599
We used to do everything together.

682
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:37,239
And suddenly having to live alone...

683
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:39,780
makes me lonely.

684
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:45,409
Had I known,
I should've relied on and loved him less.

685
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,750
It would've been great
if I had a daughter like you.

686
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:53,420
I always preferred girls over boys.

687
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:57,590
I'm sorry.
I haven't been coming by lately.

688
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,159
How's Young Jae these days?

689
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:02,199
Oh, him?

690
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,070
He's been coming
to work regularly these days.

691
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,539
Unlike other times,
he hasn't been idling at work.

692
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:09,000
He's working hard too.

693
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,639
Is that so?
I guess Tae Jun must have sway over him.

694
00:46:13,409 --> 00:46:15,539
That sounds about right.
He's grumpy on the outside,

695
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:17,280
but he's always been
a bit scared of Tae Jun.

696
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,019
I hope he grows up this time.

697
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,389
I'm sure he will.

698
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:26,159
Okay. I believe in my son too.

699
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:28,789
- Manager Seo.
- Excuse me.

700
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:30,789
Yes, this is
Duty Assistant Manager Seo Jin Young.

701
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,760
- An employee got into a fight...
- Here's your meal.

702
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,860
with a guest. Please hurry.

703
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:37,730
Gosh.

704
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:40,670
Young Jae. Apologize to the guest now.

705
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:42,070
I can't. I didn't do anything wrong.

706
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,840
What? You didn't do anything wrong?

707
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:45,469
Hey, you jerk!

708
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:48,340
I'm the guest here. Do what I say.

709
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,550
You're a mere bellboy.
How dare you talk back?

710
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:54,420
- Am I your servant? Am I your slave?
- Young Jae, calm down.

711
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:57,219
How dare you boss me around
to take your shoes off?

712
00:46:57,219 --> 00:46:59,389
- How dare a bellboy yell at a guest?
- Sir.

713
00:46:59,389 --> 00:47:00,690
- Sir.
- Young Jae, calm down.

714
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:01,889
- Come here!
- Calm down.

715
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:03,389
- Come here.
- Sir, please calm down.

716
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:04,860
- Please calm down.
- Let go of me!

717
00:47:04,929 --> 00:47:06,900
We shouldn't accept a jerk like him
at our hotel.

718
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,829
What? A jerk?

719
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,440
- Did you just call me a jerk?
- Gosh.

720
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,909
You punk. Hey, do you know who I am?

721
00:47:16,909 --> 00:47:18,940
How would I know that, you jerk?

722
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,980
- What? "Jerk?"
- Young Jae.

723
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,139
- Sir.
- Come here.

724
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:23,309
- Young Jae.
- Gosh.

725
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:24,610
- The CEO is here.
- The CEO is here.

726
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,949
I see. You're the CEO.

727
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:29,420
I'm glad you're here.

728
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:31,820
How do you train your employees?

729
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,420
Your employee here is acting like a thug.

730
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,730
- You, come here.
- I'm sorry, sir.

731
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:38,829
- Apologize to him now.
- No.

732
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,260
Apologize to him now!

733
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,570
I can't. No, I won't.

734
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,869
I didn't do anything wrong, Mom.
Why must I apologize?

735
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:47,800
I'll deal with you later.

736
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:51,739
Please accept my apology on his behalf.

737
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:55,179
Please calm down.

738
00:47:55,179 --> 00:47:56,380
Why don't we sit and talk?

739
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:59,050
I will not let this slide
until that jerk apologizes to me.

740
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:02,679
Come here. Apologize to me.

741
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,889
- You jerk. Come here.
- Sir.

742
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:06,920
- Gosh.
- Oh, no.

743
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,260
- Goodness.
- No!

744
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:10,590
- Are you all right?
- You little...

745
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:12,630
Young Jae.

746
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:14,630
What are you doing? Stop it!

747
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,699
He pushed you!
Are you telling me to let that slide?

748
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:19,099
He's a guest at our hotel. Get a grip!

749
00:48:19,099 --> 00:48:20,570
Gosh.

750
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:22,340
Hey. What? Are you scared?

751
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,840
Go ahead. Hit me.

752
00:48:25,309 --> 00:48:26,579
Hit me, you punk.

753
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:30,380
Gosh.

754
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:36,079
Yes. I slapped you. Now what?

755
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:39,519
I see. A hotel employee
is assaulting a guest now?

756
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:40,789
A guest?

757
00:48:40,789 --> 00:48:43,590
If you want to be treated like a guest,
act like one, you jerk!

758
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:45,760
You little...
