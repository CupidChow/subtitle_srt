(Episode 5, And They Smiled)

2
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:18,660
It's okay. Go ahead and eat.

3
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:21,489
By the way,
the garlic and kimchi might smell.

4
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:22,690
- Okay.
- They might smell.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,800
By the way, where's Ms. Lee?

6
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,800
- I don't know.
- She was gone for a while.

7
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,899
- Okay. Enjoy your food.
- Okay.

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,280
(Safety Rules for the Office)

9
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:54,929
What are you doing here?

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,299
Are you looking for the missing ring?

11
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,599
Why do you care
if I'm looking for a ring or a bracelet?

12
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,680
Did you check these?

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,879
No. I checked those.

14
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,829
For your face.

15
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:48,579
Hello?

16
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,150
Yes, Father.

17
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:56,920
Okay.

18
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:00,430
It's okay. I know where that is.

19
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,959
I can get there on my own.
You don't have to send me a car.

20
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,580
You must have
an important meeting tonight.

21
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,150
The chairman called us himself.

22
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,180
He told us to pay special attention
because it was your birthday.

23
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,889
This one looks better. What do you think?

24
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:28,289
I'll take that.

25
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:29,449
Right?

26
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:32,919
Gosh. Don't you think
the chairman would like this more?

27
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,430
He's not an easy man to please.

28
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:37,800
Right. What about this one?

29
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,430
It's spring soon. Don't you like this?

30
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,669
- I'll just buy everything you're holding.
- What?

31
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,300
Since I'm here,
I want to buy a few more outfits.

32
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:49,009
That one over there.
And the one next to that.

33
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:51,310
- And wrap up the dress over there too.
- Ms. Im.

34
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,039
I also want the shirt and the skirt.

35
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:56,150
Tell Father that
they were my birthday presents.

36
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,879
Right. I need a handbag and shoes.

37
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,189
He'll like expensive ones the best.

38
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,189
Get the most expensive and luxurious bag
you have.

39
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,060
Tell him I was very happy
to get a lot of birthday presents.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,430
He will think...

41
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:19,500
the more money I spend, the happier I am.

42
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,780
All right. I see.

43
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,680
Handle the matter with business ethics
as I told you.

44
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:44,729
Go.

45
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:51,840
You're late.

46
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,610
There was a traffic jam.

47
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,379
Did the female owner pick out
the outfit for you?

48
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:00,449
Yes.

49
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,449
I see. She does have good taste.

50
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,590
I'm sorry for missing your birthday.

51
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,919
But do not spend the night
outside ever again...

52
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,060
unless you want to upset me.

53
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,160
We have an important guest joining us.

54
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,199
Behave yourself.

55
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,500
Hello.

56
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,100
You're already here.

57
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:30,009
You're an important guest to me.
I ought to come early.

58
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:31,910
Let me introduce my daughter to you.

59
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,879
Yoon Hee, say hello.

60
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:37,220
He came all the way from the US
to help me with a business deal.

61
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,379
Let's sit down.

62
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,019
Hello. I'm Shin Dong Hyuk.

63
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,750
Hello.

64
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,810
How's the hotel? Is it to your liking?

65
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,810
Yes. It's quiet and clean.

66
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,149
The employees are nice too.

67
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,579
The late owner did put
a lot of effort into the hotel.

68
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,850
Did you know him well?

69
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,250
He and I had a long history.

70
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,819
We were once rivals in college...

71
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,430
when it came to grades, business,

72
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,730
and women as well.

73
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:25,699
We had an odd rivalry going on.

74
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,800
I bet you were always a winner.

75
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,569
Well, most of the time.

76
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:32,199
Except for when it came to women.

77
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:37,180
I shared too much about my past.

78
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,639
Sir, you have a phone call.

79
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,779
Is that so?

80
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:42,649
Hello.

81
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,519
Sir.

82
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,089
Excuse me.

83
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:03,430
I have a favor to ask you.

84
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:10,509
Can you not say anything to my father?

85
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,910
About what?

86
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,750
That I ran into you at the hotel?

87
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,949
Or that you carry
an entire container of sleeping pills?

88
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:22,850
Women who grew up in luxury...

89
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,060
have a weird fantasy about death.

90
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:27,230
I've seen a similar case in the US too.

91
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,399
Right. A few of them
actually tried to end their lives.

92
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,430
Don't worry.

93
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,870
I'm too busy to focus my attention...

94
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,339
to that kind of woman.

95
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:47,579
Well, can I ask you something?

96
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,279
What is it?

97
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:53,620
Actually, I saw a young girl coming out...

98
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,850
of the general manager's room
this morning.

99
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,990
No. I happened to see her
when I was passing by.

100
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,689
I'm serious.

101
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,000
By the way, do you know...

102
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:10,170
who she is?

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,970
Yes. That's Young Jae's friend.

104
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,110
Young Jae? Ms. Yoon's son?

105
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,209
Yes.

106
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,509
He let her sleep in his room
for a good reason.

107
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:21,750
Is that so?

108
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,220
Gosh.

109
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,250
What? You went around
and spread a rumor, didn't you?

110
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,120
No. I didn't have time to do that.

111
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,860
I've been cooped up here after the fight.

112
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,089
It's true.

113
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:38,000
He's already in a tight spot.
Don't make it worse for him. Okay?

114
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,600
I didn't tell anyone.

115
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,800
But what happened to you...

116
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,870
and the general manager?

117
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,170
What do you mean?

118
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:53,949
You guys used to be a thing back then.

119
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,779
Everyone at the hotel knows.

120
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,149
It's in the past now.

121
00:07:57,149 --> 00:08:00,649
We're just colleagues and friends.
That's all.

122
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:03,089
- Really?
- Yes.

123
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,819
Right.

124
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,660
I always thought that
you two didn't make a good couple.

125
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:10,089
You're as tall as him. You know?

126
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,360
There should be...

127
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,800
a visible height difference
between men and women.

128
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:14,829
"Gone with the Wind."

129
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,269
Goodness.

130
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:19,939
But Tae Jun is a great guy
to know as a friend.

131
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:22,839
I really hope you guys
will become great friends.

132
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,639
Gosh, I don't know how to thank you.

133
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,550
Then is Tae Jun seeing anyone?

134
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,009
I don't know.

135
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,579
If you're that curious,
go ask him yourself!

136
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,950
Why are you so grumpy?

137
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,649
- We found it!
- We found it!

138
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:18,799
Did you want to see me?

139
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,299
- Sit down.
- Okay.

140
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,909
I heard the new general manager
was Han Tae Jun.

141
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:29,039
Is that true?

142
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:30,879
Yes. That's true.

143
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,179
Goodness.

144
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,710
That's not the only thing
the hotel should be worried about.

145
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,480
Han Tae Jun
still hasn't learned his lesson.

146
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,350
I saw him fool around with a woman
as soon as he started.

147
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,120
He got fired because of a woman.
He's still doing the same thing?

148
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,820
Are you sure about that?

149
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,460
I saw a woman come out...

150
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,990
from his room with my own eyes.

151
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:52,029
I wasn't the only one who saw that.

152
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,730
You.

153
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:59,970
- Do you think you can find that lady?
- Pardon?

154
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,039
I need evidence that
she came out of his room.

155
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:06,710
With that evidence, I can get him fired...

156
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,649
at the hotel right away.

157
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:15,049
I see. I think I can help you with that.

158
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,029
Yes. There. Rewind that.

159
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,299
Yes. That's it. The girl in jeans.

160
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,970
Right here.

161
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:37,679
Good.

162
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:47,019
(Management Assignments)

163
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:49,149
The occupancy rate
for the past three years...

164
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,649
was under 60 percent.

165
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,490
Our break-even point
is around 70 to 75 percent.

166
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,860
It's much lower than expected.

167
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,929
It's a miracle that the hotel
survived two years in this state.

168
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,299
From what I know, we're making a profit
in other parts of the business.

169
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,070
There's only one part.

170
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,200
Thanks to our talented executive chef,

171
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,240
our loyal patrons
have been visiting the restaurant.

172
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:11,379
We have to pay back the bank next month.
And that's the problem.

173
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,740
Because we're desperate,
we can't take out a private loan.

174
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:16,309
We have a month to fix this.

175
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,519
We should do our best
to increase sales at the hotel.

176
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,620
How can we do that in a month?

177
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,889
The biggest upside
of managing a hotel is...

178
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:24,360
the cash inflow.

179
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:27,360
If we can get the occupancy rate
over 80 percent...

180
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,190
and increase the sales within the hotel
by 20 to 30 percent,

181
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,960
we'll be able to handle
our immediate problems.

182
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,470
After my husband died, a lot of employees
switched to different hotels.

183
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,500
Will we be okay?

184
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,769
We should do our best.

185
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,840
Right. Let's do our best.

186
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,679
I'll count on you, Mr. Han.

187
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Okay.

188
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,950
Right. We have
an extraordinary general meeting tomorrow.

189
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:53,350
We'll have a vote on your appointment.

190
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,049
Brace yourself.

191
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,049
Okay.

192
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,990
- Hello.
- Hello.

193
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,659
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

194
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:07,100
Wait. Manager Han.

195
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,399
- I'm sorry about that, Mr. Kim.
- Gosh, no.

196
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,840
It's been a while.

197
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,299
I heard that you came back.

198
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:13,970
Yes. I'm not officially appointed yet.

199
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,710
So I couldn't say hello
to the whole staff yet.

200
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:18,080
I already saw you on the screen.

201
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,210
Right. I have something to show you.

202
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:26,379
Manager Oh kept pestering me with this.

203
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,750
Camera 16...

204
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,059
So I checked the security camera
in front of your office.

205
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,389
Did he take the tape?

206
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:34,090
Yes. But the protocol...

207
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,090
No one can take the tapes
unless it's related to a criminal case.

208
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:41,070
Right. But is anyone here
capable of stopping Manager Oh?

209
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,500
Right.

210
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,299
I saw something interesting on Camera 33.

211
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,269
Camera 33? The restaurant?

212
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:49,539
Yes.

213
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:09,529
Are you looking for this?

214
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,539
You're stealing
my personal belongings now?

215
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:20,299
The tapes from Hotel Security...

216
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,009
aren't your personal belongings.

217
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:27,750
I'm sure it will critically affect
the vote on my appointment tomorrow.

218
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:31,379
Then I will have no choice but to reveal
the identity of the woman in the tape.

219
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:32,379
Right?

220
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,019
Yes, naturally.

221
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,220
Manager Oh.

222
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,919
Do you really not recognize
who that woman is?

223
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:43,960
You're the one who let Young Jae
take the suite yesterday, right?

224
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,360
She was
with Young Jae's friends yesterday.

225
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,799
You still don't remember her?

226
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,340
Yesterday, there was
an attempted sexual assault in the suite.

227
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,440
The woman in the tape was the victim.

228
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,110
I was going to handle it quietly
for our hotel's reputation.

229
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:59,809
But if I am forced to reveal her identity,
I will have to tell the whole truth.

230
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:02,409
You let him have the suite
without checking him in properly.

231
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:05,750
You sent the champagne and the cake
without accepting payments.

232
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,649
That's your responsibility.

233
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:09,220
Young Jae is Ms. Yoon's son.

234
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,360
Even so, he can't be an exception.

235
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:14,789
If this was business-related,
you should've reported the expenses.

236
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:16,590
I'll settle their tab then.

237
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,460
You know that this isn't just about money.

238
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,899
Why must I take responsibility
for the incident they caused in the room?

239
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,070
Fine. If you want,

240
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,210
submit that tape tomorrow at the meeting.

241
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:36,610
Right. I also found
something interesting on this tape.

242
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,220
Yes, this is Han Tae Jun.

243
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,059
Where?

244
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:47,659
Okay. I'll be right upstairs.

245
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:52,399
Manager Oh, let me just say this.

246
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:54,929
Now that I decided
to come back to this hotel,

247
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,230
I'm not going to quit that easily.

248
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,600
If anyone gets in my way,

249
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,470
I'm ready to fight.

250
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,110
That's only a copy.
If you don't find it interesting,

251
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,309
you can throw that out.

252
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:07,480
But I found it interesting.

253
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,879
That jerk.

254
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,240
This is Han Tae Jun.
I heard you asked for me.

255
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,639
It's a great pleasure to meet you.

256
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,440
I am the chief editor at Jeil Newspaper.
My name is Jang Hee Tae.

257
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,279
Do you remember me?

258
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,379
I stayed in Room 203 on the 6th floor.

259
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:20,320
I almost died from a heart attack.

260
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:23,389
Yes. I do remember you.

261
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:25,059
How's your health now?

262
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,230
Thanks to you, I'm here to say hello.

263
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,360
I'm so happy that you've recovered.

264
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,230
You would've been in a worse state
if my employees found you a second late.

265
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,700
You saved my life.

266
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,440
It's not a lot for what you did,
but I prepared a present for you.

267
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,240
This is the morning paper
Jeil Newspaper will publish tomorrow.

268
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,730
("General Manager Saves a Guest's Life
with His Strong Sense of Duty")

269
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:18,210
(General Manager Han Tae Jun)

270
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:23,779
Copy this and give it out
to the entire staff.

271
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,950
Yes, ma'am.

272
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,359
(General Manager Han's News Article)

273
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:33,160
What are you guys doing?
You should be working.

274
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,559
Chef, did you read the paper?

275
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,259
"General Manager Saves a Guest's Life
with His Strong Sense of Duty."

276
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:40,259
"The guest's heart stopped
for four minutes."

277
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,170
"But the general manager
didn't give up on the guest."

278
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,900
"And he saved the guest
through mouth-to-mouth."

279
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,670
Look. There's a picture of our hotel too.

280
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,769
- So what?
- Pardon?

281
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,180
What does the news article have anything
to do with this bell pepper?

282
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,480
You guys gather around
and chat like some chatterboxes...

283
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,579
whenever you get a chance.

284
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,079
If you have that much time on your hands,
go and organize the storage room.

285
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,519
Or clean the freezer.

286
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,119
- Let's get back to work.
- Okay.

287
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:10,890
Hey, this too.

288
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
I'm going to the bathroom.
Give me the newspaper.

289
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,000
Okay.

290
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:32,250
Yes, this is Oh Hyung Man.

291
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,150
Hey. I read the news article.

292
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,589
Han Tae Jun is a lucky guy.

293
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:40,759
So have you done what I asked?

294
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:44,289
Well...

295
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,400
I'm sorry, sir.

296
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:56,269
I couldn't find any evidence.

297
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,410
What are you talking about?

298
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,240
I believed in you...

299
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,009
and told the other shareholders
to follow my lead.

300
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:03,279
How could you say that now?

301
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,279
Is that how you handle your business?

302
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,750
You're going to make me look like a fool.
What is this nonsense?

303
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,089
Look.

304
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:13,619
We only have ten minutes until the vote.

305
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,990
What do you expect me to do now?

306
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,559
Shut it!

307
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:31,339
- Hey, can you give me the newspaper?
- Yes.

308
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,990
I'll clean the office.
You can clean the room.

309
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,019
No, I'll clean the office.
You take the room.

310
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:46,019
No. I'll clean the office.

311
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,130
Gosh.

312
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,029
We didn't know that
you were in your office.

313
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,799
I'm sorry. We'll come back another time.

314
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,730
- We'll come back later.
- Okay.

315
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:59,240
How are you settling in your new office?

316
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,369
It's nice.

317
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,839
Do you need anything?

318
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,410
I'll tell you when I need something.

319
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,480
We should go now.

320
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,380
Should I send up more water bottles?

321
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,779
- Sure.
- Let's go now.

322
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:11,109
We'll come back later.

323
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:14,049
Do let us know if the indoor temperature
is too high or low.

324
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,619
Let's go. Why are you so chatty?

325
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:17,690
Actually,

326
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,220
please clean the office now.
I'll step out for a moment.

327
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,359
- Goodness.
- Oh, no.

328
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:25,630
I must have bothered
and distracted you from work.

329
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,460
No. I have to go somewhere anyway.

330
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,930
We could have come back later.

331
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,569
That's why I kept telling you to leave.

332
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:33,940
Sir, you can do this.

333
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:36,039
I know about the vote today.

334
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,640
I'm sure you'll get the position.

335
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,609
Thanks.

336
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,140
- You got this!
- You got this!

337
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,150
Is this the secretary's office?

338
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:48,490
Yes. This is Seo Jin Young.
Did the meeting begin?

339
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:52,859
I see. How is it going?

340
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:56,759
Yelling? Gosh, they must be fighting.

341
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,430
Yes. Okay.

342
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:30,089
Are you nervous?

343
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:39,400
You're worried. Right, Tae Jun?

344
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,279
Right. I heard you worked hard
to find the guest's ring.

345
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:49,049
I'll give you a reward
when I become the general manager.

346
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:52,549
You don't have to be considerate.

347
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:54,220
I'm not being considerate.

348
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,349
I'm taking care of my staff
as the general manager.

349
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:59,119
I see. So it's nothing personal?

350
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,660
You have to separate work
from your personal life?

351
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:02,289
Of course.

352
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,589
Okay.

353
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:11,230
The weather is great.

354
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,740
I want to go out.

355
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:17,369
Are you having an affair?

356
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:19,380
What?

357
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,579
Are you seeing a man?

358
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,410
Goodness.

359
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,980
That's nonsense.
Why would I date when I have you...

360
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,150
When I have you as my friend.

361
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,400
Don't worry, Tae Jun.

362
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:42,500
You have me, so everything
will work out. Okay? You...

363
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,670
You got this.

364
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:52,309
Let me go and see what's happening.

365
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,180
What happened?

366
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,690
I'm not sure yet.
They are still in a meeting.

367
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,859
- Can you open the door for me?
- Okay.

368
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,329
Here's the problem with appointing
Han Tae Jun as the general manager.

369
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:11,430
Appointing him the general manager...

370
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,599
won't be accepted socially or ethically.

371
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:17,400
How do you plan to make the hotel better
with that troublemaker?

372
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,670
Mr. Kim, you can't keep making
this unreasonable accusation.

373
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:23,269
Seoul Hotel is in a crisis right now.
Who could do a better job...

374
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:24,779
at saving the hotel than Han Tae Jun?

375
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,140
Anyway,

376
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:30,049
I believe that the rest of you
will cast your vote wisely.

377
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,240
- How did it go?
- I'm not sure.

378
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:09,650
- Gosh.
- Bye.

379
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,960
Bye.

380
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,630
Bye.

381
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,839
Ms. Yoon.

382
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,819
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

383
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:41,990
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

384
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,289
- I'll work hard.
- I hope we can work well together.

385
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,559
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

386
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,359
Right. It's been about three years.

387
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,160
Congratulations
on your official appointment.

388
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:56,170
Congratulations, General Manager Han.

389
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,900
The real fight will start now.

390
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,339
We have so many obstacles ahead of us.

391
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:02,240
Think of this as the easiest obstacle.

392
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,609
As I know nothing about running hotels,
I'll end up making your job harder.

393
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:10,309
But don't just put me in my office
and make me sign documents all day.

394
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,420
If you need me to do anything, tell me so.

395
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,579
I'll work hard.

396
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:14,720
Yes, Ms. Yoon.

397
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,170
General Manager Han!

398
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,579
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

399
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:39,839
Thank you.

400
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:42,880
- Congratulations, General Manager Han.
- Thank you. I'll work hard.

401
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,450
We'll throw you a small welcome party
in the kitchen after work.

402
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,079
Be here by 8 p.m. Don't be late.

403
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:50,750
- By 8 p.m.? Okay. I'll be here.
- General Manager Han.

404
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:56,529
I heard the news. Congratulations.

405
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,029
Thank you, Soon Jung.

406
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,430
I knew you would get
the position all along.

407
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,500
That's why I got you flowers in advance.

408
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,970
Roses are the best to celebrate good news.

409
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,670
Here you go, General Manager Han.

410
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:12,079
Gosh. You didn't have to get me flowers.

411
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,380
My arms are about to fall off.
Please take them.

412
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,910
Okay.

413
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,250
Gosh. Did you catch a cold?

414
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,089
He doesn't have a cold. He's allergic.

415
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,420
Allergic?

416
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,289
The general manager
is highly allergic to pollen.

417
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:33,500
Gosh, I'm sorry about that.

418
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,200
But I do appreciate the thought.

419
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,809
Soon Jung, I'm not allergic to pollen.

420
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,220
There was a bit of a problem
with our plan.

421
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,390
We didn't have enough time
to contact the board directors.

422
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,960
I guess talking to a couple of directors
didn't do much.

423
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,660
It's fine.

424
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,930
It's best not to cling on
to what already happened.

425
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:09,769
Will that guy, Han Tae Jun,
be a huge roadblock to our plan?

426
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:11,740
With him in the picture,
things might get complicated.

427
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,410
You don't have to worry.

428
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:24,410
Of course, without him,
things would go more smoothly.

429
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,480
But he won't affect things
in the grand scheme of things.

430
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,720
Look into Seoul Hotel's bonds
in the market.

431
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,089
Buy them slowly over a month.

432
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,759
Make sure no one gets wind of this.

433
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,230
By the time they figure out
what we're up to,

434
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,200
we must have
at least 40 percent of the company.

435
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,569
Okay. I'll look into that.

436
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,539
("General Manager Saves a Guest's Life
with His Strong Sense of Duty")

437
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,519
(Monthly Guide Map, Escort Seoul)

438
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,490
I have an important meeting.

439
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:06,089
So I'll have to leave her alone
in the hotel.

440
00:28:06,589 --> 00:28:08,589
She has no problem playing on her own.

441
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:11,900
You can just go upstairs
and check on her from time to time.

442
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,930
Okay. Don't worry. Have a good meeting.

443
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,930
Soo Jin, you can be a good girl
while I'm away for work. Right?

444
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:21,000
I'll buy chocolate for you on my way back.

445
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:22,740
Okay.

446
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:25,210
- Please take good care of her.
- Yes, sir.

447
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,950
All right. Shall we go upstairs?

448
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,619
All right.

449
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,829
- What's your name?
- Hwang Soo Jin.

450
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:44,759
Do you often tag along
when your dad goes on business trips?

451
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:48,359
Yes. He's been bringing me along
after my mom and dad got a divorce.

452
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,430
I'm all grown up, though.

453
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,069
But my dad still thinks I'm a little kid.

454
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,170
You heard what he said, right?

455
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,269
He said he would buy me chocolate.

456
00:28:57,509 --> 00:28:58,910
Do you not like chocolate?

457
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,880
I don't. It's fattening.

458
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,690
The man and the woman who just walked
past us are having an affair.

459
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,720
How do you know that?

460
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,130
I'm sure of it.

461
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,710
Gosh, hello.

462
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,880
Who is this lady?

463
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,910
She's a guest at the hotel.

464
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,819
I reckon you just had your meal.

465
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,319
Yes. The Italian restaurant here
is quite good.

466
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,089
I'm glad to hear that.

467
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:46,089
I got the pamphlets
for the city tour programs.

468
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:47,319
When are you getting off work today?

469
00:29:48,089 --> 00:29:49,430
My shift ends at 4 p.m.

470
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:52,359
That's great.
You can be my guide for the tour.

471
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:56,670
But I actually have
another appointment tonight.

472
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,900
When is that?

473
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,569
At 8 p.m.

474
00:29:59,569 --> 00:30:01,970
Actually, there's a welcome party
for the new general manager.

475
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,339
The entire hotel staff will be there.

476
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:05,539
We have plenty of time then.
I'll have you back before the party.

477
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,980
So you'll come, right?

478
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,680
But...

479
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:11,049
I'll wait for you at 4:10 p.m.
in the lobby.

480
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:12,220
But...

481
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,819
That man must like you.

482
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,559
How could you know that?

483
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:21,759
Call it a woman's hunch.

484
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,960
Gosh.

485
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:27,660
You always mess up your tasks.

486
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,599
It was hard to follow her
because of the traffic jam in the city.

487
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:31,569
- How about her school?
- She went to school.

488
00:30:31,569 --> 00:30:33,269
- Who told you that?
- A worker at the student organization...

489
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:35,410
Did you see Yoon Hee in the lecture room?

490
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:37,769
- I don't know her class schedule.
- You incompetent...

491
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,039
- Hello, sir.
- Hey.

492
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,779
I told you to find me a bodyguard.
How did that go?

493
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:44,309
He's waiting for you in the office.

494
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,150
Where did he work before?

495
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,380
He's a former bodyguard
who also served in the special forces.

496
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,119
- But he quit.
- Why is that?

497
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,759
I bet money was the problem.

498
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:57,690
Gosh. I apologize for making you wait.

499
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,359
I'm sure you heard about my daughter.

500
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:05,000
I hope you can get it done
without alerting her.

501
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:06,940
Can I count on you?

502
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,980
I don't talk much.

503
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,849
It turned out to be a surprise

504
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:29,029
That wasn't what I expected

505
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:31,859
Are you not going to listen to me?

506
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:36,470
But I'm telling you the truth

507
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,079
I don't want any cliches

508
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:56,519
This morning is going to be it

509
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:01,559
But not with those things
that are right in front of me

510
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,829
To me

511
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:06,329
Hey.

512
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,200
I can't hear you.

513
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,170
Where? What did you say?

514
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,869
Okay!

515
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,440
Trust your instinct

516
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,569
I can't think straight

517
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,680
No one knows how I feel

518
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,019
- Ms. Jung Eun Joo?
- Yes.

519
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,890
Your reservation...
Yes. You can use Table Three.

520
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:29,990
- Over there?
- Yes.

521
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,049
Let's go.

522
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,690
- Did you also reserve the pool table?
- Yes.

523
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,759
That's interesting.

524
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:41,500
What's this?

525
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:43,569
Eun Joo, they made a heart with the balls.

526
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:45,569
This billiard hall is fun.

527
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:56,650
Jung Eun Joo.

528
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,549
I asked her to help me.

529
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,890
I asked her
to get me a chance to meet you.

530
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,319
He kept coming to the store
and begged me to give him a chance.

531
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,390
He wouldn't take no for an answer.

532
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:10,630
That's why.

533
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:12,960
And he bought a lot of dolls too.

534
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,259
I'm really sorry
about what happened that night.

535
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,670
That wasn't why I took you there.

536
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,799
My friends were pretty wasted.

537
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,640
So they did something
they shouldn't have done.

538
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,480
I would like to apologize on their behalf.
I'm really sorry.

539
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:30,279
Was drugging me also just a mistake?

540
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,349
You call those dirtbags friends?

541
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:40,089
Whatever. Just leave me alone.
I already forgot about that night.

542
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:41,960
I don't even want to think about it.
Just leave.

543
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,789
When I look at you,
you remind me of that incident.

544
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,559
So could you leave now?

545
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:54,940
Gosh.

546
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,339
What are you doing?
Eun Joo. Tell him to get up.

547
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,279
I don't care what people say about me.

548
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,849
I'm not getting up...

549
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,420
until you forgive me, Yoon Hee.

550
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,119
Get up already. You're embarrassing me.

551
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:15,559
I'm the one who should be ashamed...

552
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:17,860
and who messed up.

553
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:21,860
If you want,
you can leave me here like this.

554
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:25,329
I can spend nights and days here.

555
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,969
I will not get up until you forgive me.

556
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:30,809
No. I cannot.

557
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,039
- Sir.
- Yes.

558
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,730
This is Jung.

559
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:02,510
What? Underground? What's that?

560
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:10,150
I see. Good work.

561
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,849
Go to her school.

562
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,289
Welcome, ma'am. Will you be dining alone?

563
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:21,789
- Yes.
- This way.

564
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:23,059
Thank you.

565
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:39,280
Aren't flip-flops beneath our restaurant?

566
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:43,849
I guess the restaurant is accessible
to the general public now.

567
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,380
Back in the day, prominent figures
in politics and finance...

568
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,590
used to line up to make reservations
at our restaurant.

569
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:52,559
You wouldn't have been able to eat here...

570
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:54,260
unless you made reservations
2 or 3 days in advance.

571
00:35:54,789 --> 00:35:56,860
What happened to our golden days?

572
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,789
Literally, everyone on the street
can come and eat here now.

573
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,960
Right. The quality of our clientele
has gone down.

574
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:05,170
On top of that, that troublemaker returned
and became our general manager.

575
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,300
And what was that?

576
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:10,369
The Heart Beat Method?

577
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:14,010
He somehow ended up in the newspaper
because he got lucky with this thing.

578
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,510
Why are you making that face?

579
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:17,179
Hello, there.

580
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,920
Hello, General Manager Han.

581
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,889
There's a meeting
with team leaders tomorrow morning.

582
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,190
Come to the conference room
by 10 a.m. with the business proposal...

583
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,690
and the ledger for last month's sales.

584
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,719
Okay. I'll do that.

585
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,090
And I don't mind sharing memories,

586
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,199
but do that out of our customers' earshot.

587
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:35,670
That includes badmouthing
your troublemaker general manager. Okay?

588
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,829
Okay. I'll do that.

589
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:41,639
Besides, this isn't the Heart Beat Method.
It's called CPR.

590
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,369
Repeat after me. CPR.

591
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:46,139
- CPR.
- CR...

592
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,210
- CR...
- CPR.

593
00:36:49,449 --> 00:36:51,179
CPR.

594
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:53,050
- You should learn that too.
- CPR.

595
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,480
If a high-ranking employee
like Manager Oh faints,

596
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,650
it will come in handy.

597
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,190
CRP.

598
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:06,559
- It's "CPR."
- CR...

599
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,059
Don't laugh.

600
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:11,530
- Jenny.
- General Manager Han!

601
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,400
Congratulations.

602
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,809
Be quiet. Sit down. People are watching.

603
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:17,670
Congratulations.

604
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,840
How are you settling in?
Is Jin Young giving you a hard time?

605
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,980
No. Jin Young is so nice to me!

606
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,880
She said she would help me
get a job in the kitchen too.

607
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,019
Right. I heard about that.

608
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:28,219
That's great.
There's a welcome party tonight.

609
00:37:28,219 --> 00:37:30,449
Come with me. It'll be a nice chance
to introduce you to the executive chef.

610
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:31,690
Will Jin Young be there too?

611
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,619
Probably. This hotel is the only thing...

612
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:35,159
Jin Young has on her schedule.

613
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:37,590
I have somewhere else to be.

614
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,230
Starting now,
he will be looking after you, Soo Jin.

615
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,230
Where do you have to be?

616
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:46,099
Oh, well... My shift is over.

617
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,139
You're going on a date with the man
we saw in front of the elevator, right?

618
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,739
What?

619
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,650
No.

620
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,280
Goodness. No way.

621
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:03,119
Well, this card has my phone number.

622
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,659
He will take good care of you.

623
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:07,489
But if something happens,

624
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:09,730
you can call me at this number. Okay?

625
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,429
You can leave it there.

626
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,099
Okay.

627
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,739
Come and check on her once every hour.

628
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,369
Yes, ma'am.

629
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,010
Bye, Soo Jin.

630
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:28,579
Okay.

631
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:50,369
Shouldn't you be going home?

632
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:00,210
What are you doing?

633
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:08,179
I just want to disappear into thin air.

634
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,789
How am I going to face
the general manager now?

635
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:14,659
Whenever he sees my face,

636
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:17,090
he'll be reminded
how he's allergic to pollen.

637
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,960
It's so upsetting.

638
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,869
Your life must be so nice
if that's upsetting you.

639
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:30,840
Right. You're the opposite of sensitivity.

640
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,480
How could you understand
someone as sensitive as me?

641
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:38,809
By nature,
simple and one-dimensional people...

642
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:42,179
are dull and less sensitive
when it comes to disappointments.

643
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,349
Good for you, Ms. Seo.

644
00:39:45,889 --> 00:39:47,920
You rarely feel hurt.

645
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:51,730
You're dolling yourself up.
Where are you going?

646
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:52,929
Are you going on a date?

647
00:39:56,869 --> 00:39:59,599
Good for you. You're going on a date.

648
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,670
I hope it rains a lot today.

649
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,780
You know, when it doesn't rain in spring,

650
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,150
farmers will be so anxious.

651
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:14,849
Do you really want to know
what the general manager likes?

652
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,690
What is it?

653
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,889
Chocolate.

654
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:21,260
- Chocolate?
- Yes.

655
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,590
He likes sweets and chocolate like kids.

656
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,300
Chocolate.

657
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:33,000
- Do you like sweets?
- No.

658
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,070
Then we shouldn't have bought it.

659
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,769
It's okay. This is fun.

660
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,739
Men don't like sweets, right?

661
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,480
Right.

662
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,010
But there's a guy at our hotel...

663
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,579
who loves sweets like chocolate.

664
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,889
When people don't smoke,
they crave snacks.

665
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:52,050
No. He smokes too.

666
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:56,090
I've given him so much chocolate
every Valentine's Day.

667
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,659
Besides,
he doesn't like regular chocolate.

668
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:01,400
He only likes expensive chocolate
from bakeries.

669
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,730
Goodness. His standard has gone up
because he works at a hotel.

670
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:06,170
No. His palate has gotten refined.

671
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:09,940
You gave him chocolate
every Valentine's Day?

672
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:11,269
Yes.

673
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,639
And this year as well?

674
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:16,079
No. I couldn't give him
any chocolate this year.

675
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,110
He wasn't in Korea.

676
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:19,920
I wonder who that is.

677
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:21,880
Pardon?

678
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:24,019
I envy him too.

679
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:36,469
Well, let's go that way.
I'll show you around.

680
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,429
This way.

681
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,610
The late kings and queens
of the Joseon Dynasty are honored here.

682
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:48,639
No. Their tombs aren't here. So...

683
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,380
this place has mortuary tablets...

684
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:55,119
To be honest, my knowledge is limited too.

685
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,389
In the main hall, there are 19 rooms...

686
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:04,590
and 19 kings and 30 queens
are honored in there.

687
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:06,960
Over there, at Yeongnyeongjeon,

688
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:09,699
fifteen kings who were moved
from the main hall...

689
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:11,570
and 17 queens are honored.

690
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,599
My goodness.

691
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,809
King Taejo built this
after coming to Hanyang.

692
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,340
But it burned down
during the Japanese invasions of Korea.

693
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,380
Prince Gwanghae...

694
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:24,849
So it was rebuilt around 1608.

695
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,349
The total area...

696
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,920
comes out to 186,786m².

697
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,460
Goodness.

698
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:36,230
Did they teach you that at Harvard?

699
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,760
I saw it on the information board
on our way here.

700
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,199
What? Really?

701
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:49,070
But still. When did you memorize all that?
That's fascinating.

702
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,780
The interesting takeaways from that
are the numbers of kings and queens.

703
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,949
- Right. The kings...
- There were 34 kings.

704
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,280
But there were 41 queens.

705
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,550
It was quite common back in the day.

706
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,650
They had concubines along with the queens.

707
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:03,050
Seriously. That was
a ridiculous violation of women's rights.

708
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:05,849
Do you think they were truly in love?

709
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:08,860
- Did the kings love his queens?
- Yes.

710
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,800
Loving one person one's entire life
isn't easy.

711
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,300
I wonder if they were truly in love.

712
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,829
I'm not sure.

713
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,699
What about you?

714
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:20,969
Pardon?

715
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,670
The guy who always gets your chocolate
on Valentine's Day.

716
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:24,869
Do you really love him?

717
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:38,389
- Actually...
- Not like the kings and the queens,

718
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:41,460
but like the people over there.

719
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,099
Don't you think that's funny and unfair?

720
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,440
What do you mean?

721
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,139
They don't seem to be
with the right partner.

722
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:01,239
They would make good couples
if they switched their partners.

723
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,980
- Isn't that why they make good couples?
- Pardon?

724
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:10,119
We're supposed to fill in the parts
our partner lacks.

725
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,690
Is that so? I guess you do have a point.

726
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,130
You do learn
all sorts of things at Harvard.

727
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:21,030
I studied day and night at Harvard.

728
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:23,070
But there's nothing I can do
to find a good partner.

729
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,369
Excuse me.

730
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:36,650
This is Soo Jin. Where are you?

731
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:39,349
Are you with that man from earlier?

732
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,119
No. I'm not bored at all.

733
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:46,719
I just called to see
if this was your phone number.

734
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,530
Yes. I'll hang up. Have fun.

735
00:45:00,369 --> 00:45:02,400
- Mr. Valentine?
- Pardon?

736
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:03,940
No.

737
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:05,510
A guest at the hotel...

738
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,909
Right. You also met her. The little girl.

739
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:10,150
You must like kids.

740
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,210
Of course. Doesn't everyone love kids?

741
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,280
You think so?

742
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,920
Well, it's a hassle to look after them.

743
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,590
But deep down, no one really hates kids.

744
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:21,860
Yes, they do.
Many parents abandon their children.

745
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,460
That's a different story.

746
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,760
I'm sure those people must have had
a good reason to do so.

747
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,800
Imagine how tough it must have been
to give up your child.

748
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,769
If they were too poor to raise kids,
they shouldn't have gotten pregnant.

749
00:45:31,769 --> 00:45:33,500
Or they should have ended
their lives with the kids.

750
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:35,440
How could parents abandon
their own children?

751
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,039
Goodness.

752
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:40,010
That's exactly what my father said.

753
00:45:40,809 --> 00:45:43,880
When my father hears
about abandoned children,

754
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,119
he gets so worked up
and says the same thing you just said.

755
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:50,519
Does your father say something
like that too?

756
00:45:52,289 --> 00:45:53,989
You'll be late. Let's go back.

757
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:57,630
Okay.

758
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,570
- Here you go.
- Hurry.

759
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:04,869
Hurry up. Do we have everything?

760
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:06,699
Here.

761
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:10,239
- He's coming.
- Really?

762
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:26,159
I knew that you would get the job.

763
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:28,460
You said he had
a complicated past with women.

764
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,789
Be quiet. Why did you bring that up now?

765
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:33,960
All right. Housekeeping Department,

766
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,460
please be quiet.

767
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:39,699
The man of the hour,
General Manager Han Tae Jun...

768
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,070
You should lead the party, Chef.

769
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:46,980
Since you started, why don't you continue?

770
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,579
How could I?

771
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,010
All right. I'll continue then.

772
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:55,280
To celebrate the appointment
of the new general manager,

773
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:56,949
you should blow out the candles.

774
00:46:56,949 --> 00:46:58,590
Come on. Blow out the candles.

775
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,119
By the way, you guys prepared a lot.

776
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,530
Chef, did you perhaps use the ingredients
from the kitchen?

777
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,130
No.

778
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:07,230
We paid for everything ourselves
and prepared it.

779
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:08,960
We didn't use any ingredients
from the kitchen.

780
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,530
People in Food and Beverage Department
pooled money together for the cake.

781
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:12,570
I bought the indoor firecrackers.

782
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:14,070
Those freebies came with the cake.

783
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:17,139
We bought soju as a small gesture.

784
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:20,380
I wanted to buy hard liquor,
but she's not so generous.

785
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,780
All right. Please be quiet.

786
00:47:23,949 --> 00:47:26,780
Okay. Please blow out the candles.
The candles might burn.

787
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:28,679
All right, then.

788
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:31,190
(Welcome.)

789
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:35,059
All right. Let's remove the candles.

790
00:47:37,659 --> 00:47:39,730
All right. Why don't you give a speech?

791
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,000
To be honest, when I was away,

792
00:47:44,769 --> 00:47:46,099
I missed soju the most.

793
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:48,440
Goodness. Right?

794
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,110
Soju is rarer than hard liquor
in the US, right?

795
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:53,909
That wasn't it. It was just expensive.

796
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:59,849
Seeing you all here
gives me so much energy.

797
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:04,050
Thank you so much
for letting me know that I'm not alone.

798
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:08,190
I'll work hard, so we can have...

799
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:11,730
this kind of party
even 10 or 20 years later.

800
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:13,030
Okay.

801
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:15,900
Everyone, raise your cups...

802
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,929
for General Manager Han
and his return to the hotel.

803
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:20,239
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

804
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:32,710
There must have been an accident ahead.

805
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:39,760
Are you worried? I'm actually grateful.

806
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,039
What? Who's missing?

807
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:00,739
My daughter is missing!

808
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,179
Where is that, Mr. Kim?

809
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,079
The lobby entrance
that's under construction.

810
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,079
Soo Jin.

811
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:08,449
Tae Jun!

812
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:12,650
Can I like you?

813
00:49:12,889 --> 00:49:13,889
I'll think about it.

814
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,460
I...

815
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,769
I'm sick of this house and you!

816
00:49:24,769 --> 00:49:26,070
Get out of my house right now!

817
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:27,239
You go first!

818
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,809
What's this?

819
00:49:29,809 --> 00:49:31,409
I prepared it from the bottom of my heart.
Please accept it.

820
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:39,550
What? Are you all right?
