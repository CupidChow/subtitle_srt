00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,639
(Email, entertainment)

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,720
(I will love you forever.)

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,650
(Last Episode, The Day You Come to Me)

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,260
Young Jae. Did you wait for a long time?

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,359
Just a bit.

6
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,530
- You switched off your phone.
- Yes.

7
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:27,269
- Did you enjoy your dinner?
- Yes.

8
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:29,570
Tae Jun was very upset, right?

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,170
Yes.

10
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,869
- Will he come to the airport tomorrow?
- I told him not to.

11
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,740
- Why not?
- You'll be there.

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,979
Now that you're leaving,
you changed a lot.

13
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,710
- What about my stuff?
- I put them all inside.

14
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,549
And the key.

15
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:49,020
Right. I have something to give you,
so wait for a while.

16
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,040
This is mine.
I added all the songs that I like.

17
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:08,769
Listen to this when you miss me.

18
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,519
You want to come in for a while
and talk with me, right?

19
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:19,150
Yes.

20
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,620
Yoon Hee, you're finally seeing me.

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,620
Just go. I want to be alone.

22
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,659
I'm sorry, Young Jae.

23
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,629
It's okay. I understand.

24
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:33,829
See you tomorrow morning.

25
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:35,129
See you.

26
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:06,030
It's pretty.

27
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,469
It's a diamond, right?

28
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,069
I think so.

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,370
This must be really expensive.

30
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,210
How big is the diamond?

31
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,539
You call it "carat," Geum Soon.

32
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:22,409
- It's beautiful.
- It really is.

33
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,849
You must be so happy.

34
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:25,650
You can find a lot of rings like that
at Namdaemun.

35
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,520
They aren't even that expensive.
Do you want me to buy you one, Geum Soon?

36
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,789
This is different from the ones
sold at Namdaemun, Soon Jung.

37
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:33,020
They look the same.

38
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:35,830
Right. That's not what's important.

39
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:39,659
I'm so jealous of you
for getting proposed by a guy like him.

40
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,199
You have a lot of men around you,
so one day...

41
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,699
Ms. Seo, here's a warning.

42
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:46,340
I hate being pitied the most.

43
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:48,939
- Hello, Mr. Han.
- Hello.

44
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:50,539
Thank you for your hard work.

45
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,810
Please take extra care
of the dinner event.

46
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,810
It's the biggest event
since Diamond Villa was built.

47
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,550
We'll have a lot of state guests too.

48
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,250
Okay. Don't worry, Mr. Han.

49
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,689
Ms. Seo, don't run away
and stay until the end today.

50
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,360
Of course.
Ms. Seo is wearing a diamond ring...

51
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,330
to prepare for today's event...

52
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:10,300
Let's look around the bathroom
one more time.

53
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,099
- Okay.
- Thank you.

54
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,699
Ms. Seo, your footsteps changed.

55
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:22,639
Women must get haughty
when they get proposed.

56
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,979
Stop it.

57
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:25,280
You did become haughty.

58
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,639
Why are you walking like that?

59
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,080
Walk straight.

60
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,080
Why must you say that in front of Tae Jun?

61
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:33,620
Mr. Han must know everything already.

62
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,919
There's no need to hide.

63
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,949
What does he know?

64
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,719
The whole world knows
that the love triangle broke.

65
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,590
Why are you denying it so vehemently?

66
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,659
"Love triangle?"

67
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:42,759
How can you talk about us so rashly?

68
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,330
Is it not true, then?
To you guys, it might be romance.

69
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,900
But to us, it's a scandal.

70
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,629
What's so wrong about watching it for fun?

71
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,169
Does it even make sense
to watch someone's private life for fun?

72
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:54,009
Is that all you are to me?

73
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:56,069
Don't do this, Jin Young.

74
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,280
You're the one...

75
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,379
holding one man in each hand
and increasing the diamond price...

76
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:01,180
when I don't even have one man.

77
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,449
It makes me so jealous.

78
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:05,949
What? Take back what you said
about holding one man in each hand.

79
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,289
Han Tae Jun and Shin Dong Hyuk.
Aren't you holding one in each hand...

80
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:10,520
and weighing them?

81
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,159
"Weighing them?"

82
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,560
You're so uncultured.
How can you say that?

83
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,660
Goodness.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,199
What? "Uncultured?"

85
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,870
Are you serious?

86
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,839
I'm the epitome of cultured women
of Seoul Hotel.

87
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,240
Did you call me "uncultured?"

88
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:34,009
So what if you have a diamond ring?

89
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,870
Don't talk to me.

90
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:00,410
Don't say anything.

91
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:07,149
What's so great about her?

92
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,310
When she was dumped by a guy
and was feeling lost,

93
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,279
I bought her drinks
and took her to a hotel.

94
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,050
I attended to her every whim
and treated her so nicely.

95
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,189
What a brat.

96
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:18,889
What? "Uncultured?"

97
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,459
She's wearing a cheap ring
from Dongademun or Namdaemun.

98
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:25,600
Good for her. It's just a ring.

99
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:32,769
Here. It's not expensive.

100
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,009
If I wanted to match your class,

101
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:39,209
I would need to use up all my savings.

102
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,550
So I matched it to my class.

103
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,879
There's nothing wrong with your class.

104
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:46,519
- I also...
- Give me your hand.

105
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,589
Well, what does this ring mean?

106
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:54,329
Is it just a present for a colleague?

107
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:55,389
Or...

108
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,360
If it's something burdening,
I can't take it.

109
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,730
Give me your finger.

110
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,660
Han Tae Jun!

111
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,569
Was that all I was to you...

112
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,769
that you quit and left immediately?

113
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,970
Jin Young.

114
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:51,040
Don't look at me like that.
It's confusing.

115
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:56,350
Congratulations on coming back, Mr. Han.

116
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:57,779
Not yet.

117
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,550
Yes, friends.

118
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,490
So we should continue to be friends...

119
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:06,589
when we go back to Seoul Hotel.

120
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:08,959
We won't burden each other emotionally
as well.

121
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:18,370
Still, you're a great friend, Tae Jun.

122
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:11,720
We finished cleaning and arranging.

123
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,190
Come out.

124
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,320
The pain will get worse,

125
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,429
but she's stubbornly refusing
to get radiotherapy.

126
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,860
So I can't do anything.

127
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,759
They say surgery is meaningless
because it's in the final stage anyway,

128
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,629
so we should let her stay comfortable
for the remaining time.

129
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:04,139
I gave her painkillers,
so she'll sleep soon.

130
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:05,799
- Thank you, Kyung Rim.
- You're welcome.

131
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,169
Goodbye.

132
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,299
Ms. Yoon.

133
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,210
I heard about it from Tae Jun.

134
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,009
I thought his lips were sealed.

135
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,549
I saw you go in while I was passing by.

136
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,980
I see.

137
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,820
You're like my daughter.

138
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:03,330
I should've told you sooner.

139
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,929
I'm sorry.

140
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:07,429
Have a seat.

141
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:24,850
Let me ask you a favor.

142
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:28,320
Go ahead.

143
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:32,690
Even if I die,

144
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,460
can you not leave Seoul Hotel...

145
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,759
and protect it until the end?

146
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,539
I can entrust this hotel...

147
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:48,740
to Tae Jun and you.

148
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:54,210
If you two stay here,

149
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:57,679
I'll feel much more at ease when I die.

150
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,289
I'll feel relieved about Young Jae too.

151
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:08,059
Can you consider it my last wish...

152
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,460
and grant it?

153
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:15,799
Can you promise me
that you'll protect Seoul Hotel...

154
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,840
until the end?

155
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,179
Am I holding you back?

156
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,480
No, you're not.

157
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,679
We actually did it, Mr. Han.

158
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,750
Yes. Everyone worked hard.

159
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,720
I don't see Mr. No.

160
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,490
He must be in the kitchen
since more guests are coming.

161
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,159
Yes. We were able to do this...

162
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,960
because all the employees
were true hoteliers. Right?

163
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:52,230
Good job, everyone. You worked hard.

164
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,029
We only made it this far
thanks to CEO Choi.

165
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,970
Yes.

166
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,070
It would've been wonderful
if he were here.

167
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:29,200
What was that?

168
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,570
- Are you upset?
- Forget it.

169
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,970
You better not call me "uncultured" again.

170
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,779
I won't let it slide.

171
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:39,740
Gosh, when did I say that?

172
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,149
- I don't remember.
- My goodness.

173
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,080
I got it too.

174
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,059
My gosh, it's so pretty!

175
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,360
Who gave it to you?

176
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:58,399
The leopard of Mount Kilimanjaro.

177
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,169
Did Mr. No give you the ring?

178
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:02,570
How dare you.

179
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:06,669
Mr. Oh is so cool.

180
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:08,809
Isn't it pretty?

181
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:10,970
You should wear it properly.

182
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,279
Why wear it only halfway?

183
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,610
It's inconvenient to put it on and off.

184
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,679
Why can't I see 300 roses?

185
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,720
What?

186
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:22,419
He must be running late.

187
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,799
Everyone said it was impossible.

188
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:41,309
Some said Seoul Hotel would go bankrupt
because it spent too much money...

189
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:43,210
on Vision 21.

190
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,610
Many people gave us a hard time...

191
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,080
trying to take away the hotel.

192
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,549
But we did it.

193
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,789
I know very well
that this is all thanks to you.

194
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,929
Thanks to you guys,
I'm getting the honor...

195
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:05,630
that CEO Choi was supposed to get.

196
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:09,869
I'm sure CEO Choi would've felt
the same way...

197
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:12,140
as me if he were here.

198
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:14,509
I would like to give you a present.

199
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:16,569
- What present is it?
- Give us a bonus!

200
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,910
- Yes!
- Be quiet!

201
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,240
Be quiet!

202
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:26,450
I just signed a paper,
saying I would give the 28 percent...

203
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,990
of the Seoul Hotel shares,
which is all the shares I have, to you.

204
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:39,559
I'm finally giving back the right
you should have...

205
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,329
as a matter of course,

206
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:44,769
and I'm going to be on my way quietly.

207
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,869
I'm going to...

208
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:53,009
leave you, my beloved ones,

209
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,309
and go on a long journey.

210
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:02,519
Just like how making the guests
who come to our hotel leave...

211
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:05,819
with happy and beautiful memories...

212
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:09,160
is an accomplishment
and pride as a hotelier,

213
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,799
after I leave, I want to be remembered...

214
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,500
as someone you're proud of...

215
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,000
and a beautiful person.

216
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:24,240
You always work hard behind
to make the guests happy.

217
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,910
Today is our party.

218
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,849
So relax and enjoy the party.

219
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,250
Why didn't you tell me anything, Mom?

220
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,579
Don't change...

221
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,250
just because I'm sick, Young Jae.

222
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,960
Just like you are now,

223
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,890
live happily and healthily.
Do you understand?

224
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:19,359
Even when I gave you a hard time,

225
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,230
you didn't say anything.

226
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,170
It's fine as long as you know
that you gave me a hard time.

227
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,250
Mom.

228
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,420
I won't let you down now.

229
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,190
I want to become a reliable son.

230
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,900
My son.

231
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:59,700
You were always a reliable son to me.

232
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:04,210
I'll be good.

233
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:09,579
So live a long life.

234
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,619
Of course I should.

235
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,119
I'll live long enough
to see you get married...

236
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:22,059
and play with your children.

237
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,099
Mom.

238
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,200
I'm fine.

239
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,009
I'll take you back.

240
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:38,980
Thank you.

241
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,230
Jin Young. When you go to New York,
where do you want to visit first?

242
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,369
Most people want to go
to the Statue of Liberty...

243
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:12,900
or the Empire State Building.

244
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:16,240
Leo is a bit unique.

245
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,480
The first place he goes to in New York...

246
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,279
is a clear bone soup restaurant
in Koreatown.

247
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,279
His stomach feels upset
when he gets off the plane,

248
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,049
so he always eats clear bone soup first.

249
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,750
Where do you want to go first, Jin Young?

250
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,730
Dong Hyuk.

251
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,369
I need to tell you something.

252
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,140
Actually,

253
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,240
I don't think I can go with you.

254
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,220
I can't help it. I'm sorry.

255
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:55,339
The prosecution called to check.

256
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:59,509
I told them we would leave as planned,
and they said thank you.

257
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,549
Did you ask about Chairman Kim?

258
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:05,920
I asked them for leniency,
but I'm not sure.

259
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:08,589
He'll probably get a big amount of fine.

260
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,400
What are you going to do with her?

261
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:26,970
You can't do anything
when she has said no.

262
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:31,910
I can't lose Jin Young.

263
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:46,319
- You're home.
- Hey.

264
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,960
Great job today, Jenny.

265
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:49,529
The kitchen must've been busy.

266
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,190
The event ended well, right?

267
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,500
Yes.

268
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:55,230
Wash quickly and come out.
I'll make coffee for you.

269
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,430
I can't be bothered to do anything.

270
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:06,440
Didn't Dong Hyuk say anything?

271
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,880
- About going to the US?
- Yes.

272
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,950
Jenny, don't you want to follow him?

273
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:17,089
I have my job here.

274
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:19,759
And he's a US citizen. What about you?

275
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,829
What should I do, Jenny?

276
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:32,599
What do you think?

277
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:36,269
I keep thinking about the time
when we left you in the desert.

278
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:39,309
Tae Jun went back to where you were...

279
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:42,509
and called your name like a madman.

280
00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:44,750
I can't forget that voice.

281
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,119
If I leave,

282
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:55,390
will Tae Jun spend...

283
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,089
the rest of his life
calling my name like that?

284
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,259
You don't know about that.

285
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,039
Your brother gave me
a flight ticket today.

286
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,039
- For tomorrow?
- Yes.

287
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,240
What are you going to do?

288
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,740
- Goodbye, sir.
- Thank you.

289
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,730
Mr. Shin Dong Hyuk checked out.

290
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:11,799
Hyun Chul. Did you see the luggage tag
for Room 1705?

291
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,940
It should be in the drawer
of the concierge.

292
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,339
I can't find it.

293
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:24,579
Hey, boss. We're already
on a tight schedule even if we leave now.

294
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:32,049
Hyun Chul,
I'll be resting in the business center.

295
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:33,619
Call me if anyone looks for me.

296
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:34,880
Okay, Ms. Seo.

297
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:39,359
- What are you doing?
- Hi.

298
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,089
I'm connecting the office computer
and the network.

299
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:44,130
Then I can check all the emails.

300
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:47,730
Will it take long? I want to rest alone.

301
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:50,269
It'll be over soon.
It'll take about five minutes.

302
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:51,529
Five minutes?

303
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,710
(Internet)

304
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,549
(Email, Entertainment)

305
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,950
("The 23rd Letter, I Can't Lose You,"
"Jin Young Only Cares About the Hotel")

306
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,819
Ms. Seo, you have tons of emails.

307
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,329
Emails?

308
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:21,700
They're all from Frank.
I'll print them out for you.

309
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,839
("Passing by the Lobby,"
"The 11th Letter," "The 10th Letter")

310
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:37,150
("The First Letter, From the Sea")

311
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,250
Jin Young, I'm at the sea.

312
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:42,950
I met my father.

313
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,960
I've loathed and hated him
for my entire life,

314
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,029
but the moment I saw his face today,

315
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,759
I realized I had missed him.

316
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:57,829
I wished you were beside me
right this moment.

317
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:00,900
Without getting disturbed by anyone,

318
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,869
for just five minutes.

319
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:05,309
You got soaked in the rain
because of me, right?

320
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,079
I purposely covered you with my jacket,
thinking you would return it to me.

321
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,779
But I haven't heard from you yet.

322
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,680
You must've not fixed your computer.

323
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:19,619
Jin Young. I was going
to confess everything to you...

324
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:21,690
in the cathedral today.

325
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,430
Why I came to Seoul Hotel...

326
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:27,759
and what I was going to do.

327
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:30,900
I'm sorry.

328
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:33,400
I hurt your feelings.

329
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:37,369
If you want,

330
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,579
I can give up on everything I'm doing now.

331
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,380
So don't go farther away from me.

332
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:48,819
I can't live without you now.

333
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:54,420
My gosh.
Ms. Seo, you just got a new email.

334
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:57,759
("The 23rd Letter, I Can't Lose You")

335
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,299
I can't lose you.

336
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,609
Young Jae!

337
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:12,640
Help me. I'm in a hurry.

338
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,480
- The guest...
- Excuse me.

339
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,980
I can't lose you.

340
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,089
Even if we say goodbye and part ways,

341
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:25,890
I can't let you go.

342
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,690
I didn't want to think of this
as our last moment,

343
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,099
so I left without even saying goodbye.

344
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:38,069
Can't you drive faster, Young Jae?

345
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,539
To me, who was lonely and exhausted,

346
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:43,240
you taught me what warmth was
for the first time.

347
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:45,910
I can't lose you.

348
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,950
I'll arrive at the airport soon.

349
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:54,049
It feels like you will be waiting for me
at the airport,

350
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,789
saying, "You're late this time."

351
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:01,890
It feels like you'll be waiting for me.

352
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,329
Wherever I go, deep in my heart,

353
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:12,339
I'll keep your name buried.

354
00:32:13,569 --> 00:32:15,970
Even when I'm surrounded
by a lot of people,

355
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,539
I just want to listen to your voice.

356
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:22,450
Only your voice.

357
00:32:23,579 --> 00:32:24,910
I want to listen to it only.

358
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,319
Jin Young, where are you?

359
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,960
What are you doing and at where?

360
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:40,299
You are nowhere to be seen here.

361
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:45,740
I can't see your face nor hear your voice.

362
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:52,380
I can only feel your warmth in my heart.

363
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,450
It's time to leave now.

364
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,519
I need to turn back
without getting to see you in the end.

365
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,519
Jin Young.

366
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,430
It's time to test our love.

367
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,670
Me coming back...

368
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,470
and you coming to me.

369
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,509
I promise you a day...

370
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:27,539
that we'll have to grow
and manage together.

371
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:34,950
I promise you the day you will come to me.

372
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,519
I love you, Jin Young.

373
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,599
"Alaska has an average temperature..."

374
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,300
"of 10°C to 23°C from May to September,"

375
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,239
"so it's the perfect time for a cruise."

376
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,210
"It departs every Monday."

377
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,940
"When you arrive in Seattle..."

378
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,650
Mom. When you get better,

379
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:36,849
let's go on a cruise tour...

380
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,349
- to Alaska.
- Sure.

381
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,050
Do you want more water?

382
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,449
Yes.

383
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,320
Coming.

384
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,690
- Hold on, Mom.
- Okay.

385
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,730
Who is it?

386
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:53,230
I'm Kim Bok Man.

387
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:57,929
Don't act high and mighty
and just come in, Bok Man.

388
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:19,889
Your face grew very thin.

389
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,360
You aged a lot too.

390
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,730
Tae Jun and Dong Hyuk.
Those two young men...

391
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,369
screwed me up, so I aged a lot.

392
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:34,699
I need to deal with them.

393
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,510
You're still short-tempered as ever.

394
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,039
You look the same as before too.

395
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,510
Your face...

396
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,550
You still look as pretty as before.

397
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:51,550
You're such a smooth talker.

398
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,289
When I die too,

399
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:03,000
you'll be the only one remaining
among our college gang.

400
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,800
Don't be weak and recover quickly...

401
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,469
so we can go on a date we couldn't
when we were young.

402
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:09,110
Your husband isn't here anymore.

403
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:12,880
Let me ask you a favor.

404
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:15,309
Anything but money-related issues.

405
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,980
Goodness, you always talk about money.

406
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,179
You can ask about money too.

407
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,719
What's the use of earning money?

408
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:23,949
What is it?

409
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,389
After I die,

410
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:28,960
make sure to live a long life...

411
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,929
and check whether Young Jae...

412
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:34,360
and Yoon Hee are living well...

413
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,699
in my husband's and my stead.

414
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:42,739
That's easy.

415
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:59,219
Your name is Young Jae?

416
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,219
Yes, sir.

417
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,360
You're Yoon Hee's friend?

418
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:04,889
Yes.

419
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,369
Do you keep in touch
with Yoon Hee nowadays?

420
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:12,570
We just send emails occasionally.

421
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:14,800
Emails?

422
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,570
Yes.

423
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,980
Let's have dinner one day.

424
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,289
It's funny to see him call you Dong Sook.

425
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,760
He must've been very close with Father.

426
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:36,989
You wanted more water, right?

427
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:32,150
It feels like a contradiction.

428
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:35,019
What is?

429
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,920
After both Mom and Dad
who managed the hotel well for 30 years...

430
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,190
passed away,

431
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,460
the hotel improved and is doing better.

432
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:52,570
Yes. It feels strange.

433
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,210
People forget easily.

434
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,280
The leaves don't look lively.

435
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,750
So the lobby looks dead.

436
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,889
Should we cut off the tree altogether?

437
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:13,389
Mr. Yoo,
let's think about it realistically.

438
00:39:13,989 --> 00:39:16,329
Either prune some leaves or clean... No.

439
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,889
We should change the lighting.

440
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:20,030
Cleaning costs 4,500 dollars.

441
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:22,630
- We need to spend the money if needed.
- Understood, General Manager Oh.

442
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:25,429
Yes, he's here.

443
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:27,539
Mr. Oh.
Here's a call from the CEO's office.

444
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,210
Yes, Oh Hyung Man speaking.

445
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,579
Okay, I'll be there soon.

446
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,789
- Mi Hee.
- Yes?

447
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:47,889
Don't flirt with male employees
while working at the hotel.

448
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,630
What did I do?

449
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,260
- Mr. Yoo.
- Yes, sir.

450
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,230
It seems like
Mi Hee feels uncomfortable...

451
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,070
working in the lobby
which has a lot of people.

452
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,670
Just for one month,
send her to the dishwashing team.

453
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,969
Mr. Oh, that can't happen.

454
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:03,539
Wash the plates clean...

455
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:05,980
and clear your mind there too.

456
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:10,110
Goodness.

457
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,849
No.

458
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,679
Hello, General Manager Oh.

459
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,989
- Yes. Is the CEO inside?
- Yes, he's waiting.

460
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:21,719
Did you call?

461
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,059
Welcome, Mr. Oh.

462
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,659
What is it about?

463
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:30,469
Thanks to your hard work, our hotel
was selected as Asia's best hotel...

464
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,469
by International Travel Organization.

465
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,599
That's impressive.

466
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,510
It is. Speaking of which,

467
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:39,340
you need to visit Las Vegas.

468
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,280
Participate in the award ceremony
and take a rest while you're there.

469
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,409
No, I can't do that.

470
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,780
Why not?

471
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,489
Because of my wife.

472
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:50,619
She is...

473
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,989
Congratulations, Mr. Oh.
How far along is she?

474
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:56,429
Exactly one month.

475
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:57,989
A honeymoon baby?

476
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,300
Yes, pretty much.

477
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,860
So she can't sleep if I'm not by her side.

478
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,570
You guys can go together.

479
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,170
I would love to,
but she's very sensitive...

480
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,099
and not young,
so flying might be very dangerous.

481
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:11,739
What should I do?

482
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,309
They said the general manager
or the CEO must come.

483
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:15,980
Why don't you go?

484
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,980
The hotel is doing well now.

485
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,750
You can go and take a rest for a few days.

486
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,980
We have
two international meetings coming up.

487
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,789
Will it be okay to leave the hotel
for a while?

488
00:41:23,789 --> 00:41:25,650
Don't worry about it and just go.

489
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,360
I'll manage the hotel well.

490
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,090
Okay, then.

491
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:33,329
It feels like I'm setting a wolf
to guard the sheep, though.

492
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:34,730
Pardon?

493
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,199
Don't you bring around
the hard liquor cellar key now?

494
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,070
CEO Han, why are you doing this?
It was just once.

495
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,840
If you keep doing this,
I'll go back to being a bellman.

496
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,210
I'm joking.

497
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,050
Please congratulate your wife
on getting pregnant.

498
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,079
I'll make sure to tell her that.
She'll love it.

499
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,079
I'll get going.

500
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,119
CEO Han.

501
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:57,449
- You can give it to me.
- Okay.

502
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:26,980
I couldn't choose between a phone call
and an email,

503
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,079
and I decided to write a letter.

504
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:32,860
Convenience is nice and all,
but it's nice to think about the person...

505
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:35,019
who will receive the letter...

506
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:36,460
as I write it with my hand,
paste the stamp,

507
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,889
and put the letter into a mailbox.

508
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,800
I got used to the school life here
more smoothly than I expected.

509
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:45,429
I still have a hard time
because of English,

510
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:48,099
but I'm making friends
and living comfortably.

511
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:50,710
So I gained a little weight.

512
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,179
I occasionally meet people who know you.

513
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:56,650
That's probably why
the campus doesn't feel foreign.

514
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,780
There's a place I visit often to rest.

515
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:03,119
It's the lawn where you lay down
and read a book,

516
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,690
or that's what I decided for myself.

517
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,190
When I lie down on the lawn
and look up to the sky,

518
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,389
airplane clouds flying across the sky...

519
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:11,329
pass by dizzily.

520
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:16,929
I'd think, "Which one is flying to Seoul,
to Tae Jun?"

521
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,599
I'm growing my longing...

522
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,969
and living well with the power of longing.

523
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:27,710
Last night, I had a funny dream.

524
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:31,150
I was left alone
in the middle of a desert.

525
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,250
It was really scary.

526
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:36,989
But from afar, a red convertible
drove toward me, making a cloud of dust.

527
00:43:37,389 --> 00:43:39,789
I kept looking at it just in case.

528
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:41,920
And you got out of the car.

529
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,130
So I ran to you and...

530
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,059
No, I just ran to you.

531
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,000
I couldn't sleep because of that dream,
so I was late to class.

532
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,309
I'm keeping the blue top you gave me well.

533
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:00,139
One day, I'll wear it and...

534
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,039
Or put it around my shoulders...

535
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,679
because Las Vegas is hot.

536
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,750
I thought it would be nice
to greet you at the airport in that.

537
00:44:09,889 --> 00:44:12,019
I need to go to class now.

538
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,389
I'll get in touch again. Stay healthy.

539
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,380
Maidens won't know this feeling.

540
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,880
Hyung Man and I created a new life.

541
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:40,849
This is a miracle.

542
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,280
It's a complete miracle.

543
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:44,190
Are you that happy?

544
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:49,289
You won't know this feeling
until the day you die.

545
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,030
Gosh.
Are you telling me not to get married...

546
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:53,199
and live alone until I die?

547
00:44:53,659 --> 00:44:57,030
- That's not what I meant.
- Forget it.

548
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:00,269
Seeing you happy makes me happy too.

549
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:04,239
I'm tired. What does CEO Han need
to tell Hyung Man...

550
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:05,809
that it's taking them so long?

551
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:08,809
General Manager Oh's wife,
it must be hard for you to move around.

552
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:11,250
You should rest at home.
Why do you come to work?

553
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,650
Why would you say that, Mr. No?

554
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:16,719
If I'm absent,
who will take care of Housekeeping?

555
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:18,690
I'm not sure about Housekeeping,

556
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,559
but if you rest at home,

557
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:22,159
mouthkeeping will be done well for sure.

558
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,800
If you keep being this way,
I'll tell on you...

559
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,099
to my husband.

560
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:31,530
Gosh, I'm sorry I didn't know.

561
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:34,440
Now you know, Mr. No.

562
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:38,869
Mr. Oh has changed for sure.

563
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:43,079
He's working so hard for the hotel.
It's nice to see.

564
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:44,679
The hotel is lively.

565
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:47,150
I think he's working harder
than the previous general manager.

566
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,920
Really? I'll tell on you to CEO Han.

567
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,619
Up to you. I didn't even get promoted,

568
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:53,920
so I'm not scared of anything.

569
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:57,030
Are you still on awkward terms
with CEO Han?

570
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:02,130
A cooled-down flame
wouldn't come back to life...

571
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:04,199
just because you fan it.

572
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,769
We can control the heat as we like
in the kitchen.

573
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:10,869
Why don't you turn it on again?

574
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:13,679
Mr. No. Tae Jun... No.

575
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:16,179
CEO Han is...

576
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:19,150
just a friend and a colleague.
I'm satisfied with that.

577
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,679
So why would you two-time?

578
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,050
Soon Jung.

579
00:46:24,389 --> 00:46:25,849
Why is he taking so long?

580
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:27,920
We were supposed to go
to the hospital together.

581
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:30,489
I'm sorry, honey. I'm late.

582
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:33,659
Honey, two of us waited for so long.

583
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:35,030
I said I was sorry.

584
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,329
I'm sorry, baby.

585
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:39,539
What are you doing? People are watching.

586
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:44,710
Gosh. Jin Young, I can't watch it anymore.
It's too terrible.

587
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,179
Me too.

588
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:57,449
- You can go ahead.
- Yes, sir.

589
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,219
He didn't contact you either?

590
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,420
No.

591
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:07,590
There's been no news of him for a week.

592
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:10,159
What could be happening?

593
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:13,929
When he sent me money,

594
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:16,500
he did say he was busy dealing
with something.

595
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,730
Didn't he ask about me?

596
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,110
Why? What did he say?

597
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,010
He told me not to tell you.

598
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:28,679
What is it about?

599
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:30,679
I can't tell you because I promised him.

600
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:32,710
Like brother, like sister.

601
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:35,650
Why don't you go see him if you miss him?

602
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,420
You even have a flight ticket.

603
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,949
I can't do it just because I want to.

604
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:42,360
I don't even know what Dong Hyuk will say.
What if I go to the US...

605
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:45,090
and get left alone in a desert again?

606
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:47,800
You can wait for a limousine again.

607
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:51,300
Goodness.

608
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,940
What's gotten into you, Jin Young?

609
00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:29,440
You keep leaving the desk unattended...

610
00:49:29,809 --> 00:49:31,909
and sighing deeply at a place like this.

611
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,809
Why did you become so broken?

612
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,050
Whose fault is it that I became like this?

613
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,119
Thanks to your sacrifice,
our hotel is doing fine.

614
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:44,150
No, it's my fault.

615
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:47,559
It's my fault for not being able
to tell friendship and love apart.

616
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:51,829
I'm a fool
for kicking the precious chance...

617
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:54,130
of my life away.

618
00:49:58,869 --> 00:50:00,840
- You'll get another chance.
- I won't.

619
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:05,269
While I go on a business trip to Las Vegas
with Young Jae,

620
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:07,280
you can take leave.

621
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:09,610
How can I take leave
when the CEO is absent?

622
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:12,349
Mr. Oh will handle it.
Don't worry about it.

623
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:15,719
Let's go down. We have a VIP guest today.

624
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,519
Attend to him yourself.

625
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:18,590
It's so bothersome.

626
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,960
An employee near the CEO, please answer.

627
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,059
It's for you. Answer it.

628
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,829
I'm here.

629
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,329
The guest is still waiting.

630
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,030
Okay. Tell him we'll be there soon.

631
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,070
Let's go, Jin Young.

632
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:34,400
Can't you make someone else do it?

633
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:36,139
He's the guest I invited.

634
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,280
You always make me work
when you have Mr. Yoo and Ms. Lee.

635
00:50:43,579 --> 00:50:45,949
He's a very special guest of mine.

636
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:48,050
So attend to him well today...

637
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:50,119
and take leave starting tomorrow
and rest well.

638
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:51,590
You won't even give me a promotion.

639
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,820
Work hard,
and you'll get promoted automatically.

640
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:56,929
There he is.

641
00:51:50,179 --> 00:51:51,409
Did you wait for me?

642
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,019
I also waited for a long time.

643
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:03,159
Can I check in now?

644
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:08,099
How long will you be staying, sir?

645
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:11,730
Forever.

646
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:16,369
I'll stay by your side forever.

647
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:04,429
(We'd like to applause the hoteliers
who work hard...)

648
00:57:04,429 --> 00:57:07,159
(to provide the best service
and for the guests' happiness.)

649
00:57:07,159 --> 00:57:10,969
(Hotelier)

650
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,000
(Thank you.)
