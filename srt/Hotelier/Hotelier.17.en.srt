00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,580
(Episode 17,
The Truth About Happiness and Misery)

2
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,760
Have you had breakfast?

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,019
I did.

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,929
Tae Jun told me to make sure
to eat breakfast.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,530
- Do you want some juice?
- No.

6
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,070
I have to go to work soon.

7
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,570
He told me to go
to work 30 minutes earlier...

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,840
and get off work 30 minutes later
than everyone else...

9
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,640
until I get the assistant chef position.

10
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:41,009
Tae Jun must be taking good care of you.

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,119
I've known him since I was in high school
in the US.

12
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,149
If it weren't for him,
I would've died from drugs.

13
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,520
Or beaten to death by the gangs.

14
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,560
It must've been tough.

15
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:02,469
I can't remember much about it.

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,409
Still, it's a relief...

17
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,439
that my biological brother
became so successful.

18
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,280
It would've been better
if you were a nicer person.

19
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:24,359
I'll get going now.

20
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,890
Don't you want to know about your parents?

21
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:30,500
Are they alive?

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,430
I thought both of them passed away.

23
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,310
What gives, Jenny? You're late.

24
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:47,010
- Did you oversleep?
- No.

25
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,310
You don't look fine. You look unwell.

26
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,920
Are you sick?

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,049
I'm not.

28
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:53,890
Something bad must've happened.

29
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,519
You can tell me about it.

30
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,590
Something happened.

31
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,599
Are you back from your workout already?

32
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,340
Leo, I need to go to the East Sea.

33
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,439
The East Sea?

34
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:22,449
What?

35
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,520
Dong Hyuk is Jenny's biological brother?

36
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,990
You stayed with her in the US.

37
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,120
Did you not know anything?

38
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,490
There's no way I could know.
Jenny came to the US when she was two.

39
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,759
How could she remember anything?

40
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,830
That's true.

41
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,560
What a big, yet small world.

42
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,500
Exactly. Why Dong Hyuk, of all people?

43
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,509
How's Jenny doing?

44
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,139
She must be elated on the inside.

45
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,050
She found her only biological family
in the world.

46
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,180
But he happens
to be the hotel's Grim Reaper...

47
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:02,490
and your enemy,

48
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:05,590
so I think she's hiding her feelings.

49
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,629
Go and talk to her.

50
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:13,199
She only listens to you.

51
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,300
But...

52
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:20,409
if he's our hotel's Grim Reaper...

53
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,740
and my enemy,

54
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:23,740
what is he to you?

55
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,349
What is he?

56
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,319
What do you think he is?

57
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:33,719
- Can I be honest?
- Yes, be honest.

58
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,949
No, don't. Forget it.

59
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,419
- I want to tell you.
- No, I'm scared. Don't say it.

60
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:39,560
I need to get going.

61
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,460
I want to tell you, Jin Young.

62
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,729
I told you not to.

63
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,500
Hey!

64
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:17,660
Who is it?

65
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,600
Mister.

66
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,740
Jin Young's not home yet.

67
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,139
I know. She's dozing off at the desk.

68
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,569
- What did you buy?
- Pork belly.

69
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,740
I can't eat this at the hotel.
Grill it for me.

70
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:37,949
What's it like staying in Korea?

71
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,649
It's comfortable and nice.

72
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:41,649
Maybe because I only met nice people.

73
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,519
People in the kitchen
treat you well, right?

74
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:47,360
Of course. They're really nice.
They're all like my family.

75
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:50,360
It's still different from a real family.

76
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,870
I heard about it.

77
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:55,899
You found your brother, right?

78
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,639
I was going to tell you.

79
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,670
Mister, don't tell this to others.

80
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,339
- You understand?
- Why?

81
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,910
It's embarrassing.

82
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,480
What is?

83
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,579
That he is my biological brother.

84
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,149
Weren't you still happy to see him?

85
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,079
Since young,
you wanted to meet your brother.

86
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,389
No matter what he does,

87
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,120
he is your brother.

88
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,529
Your real family you wanted for so long.

89
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,759
You can be happy and glad.
You don't have to hide it.

90
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,800
I really hated that guy.

91
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,639
He tried to take the hotel away...

92
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:34,110
and take Jin Young away from you.

93
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,610
Think about it this way.

94
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:41,449
If it weren't for Seoul Hotel,
would he have come here?

95
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,610
Then you wouldn't have been able
to meet him.

96
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,220
Why does it have to be him?

97
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:50,220
Still, it's great.
You have a real family now.

98
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,660
It feels strange. It feels unreal too.

99
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,199
You feel like my real family.

100
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,300
He...

101
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,430
I don't know.

102
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,490
(Lighthouse Sashimi)

103
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,189
Leo?

104
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,850
Hi, Jin Young.

105
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,360
Are you still awake?

106
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,089
Why? Can't you sleep?

107
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,860
Jenny is sleeping.

108
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,370
Tae Jun came and talked with her
for a long time.

109
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,569
She's calmed down a lot.

110
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,110
I think Tae Jun is a lot richer than I am.

111
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,339
He has everything that I want.

112
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,410
My sister and...

113
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,319
He likes to share things with others,

114
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,050
but he can't keep things for himself.

115
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,620
That's why he has a lot of followers.

116
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,060
I didn't mean you were a loner.

117
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,569
It's okay. It's true.

119
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,269
I wish I had someone
I could share my things with.

120
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,410
Yes, tomorrow.

121
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,579
Can you go with me tomorrow?

122
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,199
Hello. I'm Han Tae Jun,
the general manager of Seoul Hotel.

123
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,569
Hello.

124
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:19,170
You're Shin Dong Hee's father, right?

125
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:22,410
Yes, I am.

126
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,379
Give us the bag. We'll keep it for you.

127
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,810
It's okay.

128
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,480
- Keep it for him.
- All right.

129
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,149
- This way, please.
- Okay.

130
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:32,620
Thank you.

131
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,190
This way.

132
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,360
All right.

133
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,860
Shin Dong Hyuk and Jenny will arrive
around 6 p.m.

134
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,700
Who is Jenny?

135
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,700
That's the name Dong Hee used
when she was in the US.

136
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,299
I see. So...

137
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:55,639
both Dong Hyuk and Dong Hee
are coming, right?

138
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,679
Of course. Congratulations, sir.

139
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,250
Thank you. I'm so happy to see my son...

140
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,080
and daughter.

141
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,019
- This way.
- Thank you.

142
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:15,289
Gosh, thank you.

143
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,500
The hotel invited someone like me...

144
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,399
for such a great occasion.

145
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,299
Thank you so much.

146
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:27,200
Have a seat.

147
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:29,340
I'll just stand and wait.

148
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,539
Please wait while seated.

149
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,840
Okay.

150
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,080
Goodness.

151
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:43,389
How can I repay this?

152
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,460
Your daughter is working at this hotel,

153
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,529
and your son is a very important guest
of the hotel.

154
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,200
It suits you so well. Right, Ms. Seo?

155
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,399
Yes. Jenny's pretty,
so she looks good in anything.

156
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,039
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

157
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,679
- No.
- You must be nervous, Jenny.

158
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,149
It's okay. You'll probably cry
when you meet your father.

159
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:11,649
Don't hold back your tears
and cry your eyes out.

160
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,149
Tears exist for you
to spill on a day like this.

161
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,590
It's not for you to spill...

162
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,490
when you get kissed by a guy.

163
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,090
- Jenny, let's go now.
- Okay.

164
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,590
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

165
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,629
Your bag.

166
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:25,059
- Don't forget to do a full bow.
- Okay.

167
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,070
- Don't fall backward.
- Bow well, Jenny.

168
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,470
She must be really happy.

169
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,700
Congratulations
on meeting your father, Jenny.

170
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,769
Thank you.

171
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,710
I'll give you a special leave
until tomorrow,

172
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,039
- so have a good time with your father.
- Thank you.

173
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:40,980
- Assistant Lee.
- Give this to your father.

174
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,909
Thank you.

175
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,350
Thank you so much, everyone.

176
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,679
Let's go, Jenny.

177
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,549
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

178
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:49,720
Good luck.

179
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:09,409
Dong Hyuk.

180
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,519
Isn't she pretty?

181
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,120
Your father will love it when he sees you.

182
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:24,360
Are you ready, Dong Hyuk?

183
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,759
Yes.

184
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,039
- Let me.
- It's okay.

185
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,750
My son gave this to me.

186
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,450
I see.

187
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,490
It's really good.

188
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:37,330
Gosh.

189
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:40,129
They'll be here soon.

190
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:41,730
Okay.

191
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:46,740
The younger one won't be able
to recognize me.

192
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,940
Right.

193
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:52,279
She'll resent me a lot.

194
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,700
Say hello. He's your father.

195
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,279
Let me bow.

196
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,480
Are you...

197
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,250
Are you Dong Hee?

198
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,990
My goodness.

199
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:49,429
Please forgive me.

200
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:50,659
Father.

201
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,100
- Father.
- I was cruel to you guys who were young.

202
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,029
No.

203
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,269
Thank you so much for being alive.

204
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,909
Thank you so much for meeting me again.

205
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,009
Forgive me.

206
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,820
I wanted to meet you, Father.

207
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,990
I really wanted to meet you.

208
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,759
Thank you so much for being alive.

209
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,860
It's all my fault.

210
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,860
It's okay.

211
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,500
It's okay.

212
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,100
My gosh.

213
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,350
You guys must be...

214
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,659
Jenny's coworkers.

215
00:16:58,659 --> 00:16:59,659
Yes.

216
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,029
Mr. No holds the highest position,

217
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:04,029
but he couldn't come because he was busy.

218
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:06,859
- He's the second higher-up.
- I see.

219
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,769
- Hello. I'm Lee Gab Soo.
- Hello.

220
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,440
Please take good care of Jenny.

221
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,440
Don't worry. She's doing great.

222
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:17,369
She's a woman, but she's strong and quick.

223
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:20,079
She's much better than these weak men.

224
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,180
Assistant Lee.

225
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,910
Bow your head down and keep quiet.

226
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,819
I'm Yoo Si Chan of Food and Beverage.

227
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,720
I'm in charge of this restaurant.

228
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,390
Hello.

229
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,430
They cook the food,

230
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,359
and we serve it.

231
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,099
No matter how terrible the food is,

232
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:41,369
with our care, it becomes a feast.

233
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:43,099
What do you mean "terrible?"

234
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:46,140
I'm just saying.

235
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,069
- Please have a seat.
- Take a seat.

236
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:50,839
- Sit down.
- We prepared this table...

237
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:52,980
especially for you today.

238
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:57,150
One, two, three.

239
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,690
Jenny, Mr. No cooked them himself.

240
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,559
They're special dishes
that even I haven't tasted yet, so enjoy.

241
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:06,759
Thank you.

242
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:09,430
Please have a hearty meal
even if the food isn't great.

243
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,329
We'll serve as much as you want.

244
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:14,599
I don't know how I can thank you.

245
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:17,430
I did nothing good for my children,

246
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,470
but thank you for welcoming me regardless.

247
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:22,539
We have one hour left
until we open the restaurant.

248
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:24,210
So take your time.

249
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,480
If you need anything,
feel free to tell us.

250
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,349
Let's go and leave them to eat.

251
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,450
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

252
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,289
Eat up, Father.

253
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,029
How do I eat this?

254
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,099
Father.

255
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:51,970
Hold the knife with your right hand.

256
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,240
Hold the fork with your left hand.

257
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,109
Press it like this.

258
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,809
Try it.

259
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,640
- Like this?
- Yes.

260
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,480
- It's good, right?
- It is.

261
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:07,150
Eat more.

262
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:10,549
Yes.

263
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,029
Who are you looking for?

264
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,640
I was checking if Kim Yoon Hee
of Food and Beverage was here.

265
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,539
I didn't want to intrude.

266
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:29,769
You're intruding anyway
since I didn't invite you.

267
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:32,710
Should I leave?

268
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:35,349
It's up to you.

269
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,089
Okay. Since you're here, have a seat.
Don't glare at me.

270
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,559
Did you comfort him well?

271
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,430
Yes.

272
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,430
It must be hard for him to accept it.

273
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,000
We prepared dinner for him and Jenny,
but he wanted to be alone.

274
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:04,539
He was competent
and earned a lot of money,

275
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,309
but he always looked lonely,
so I couldn't give up on him.

276
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,319
So you need to look lonely
to be loved by women.

277
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:15,390
Will anyone adopt me?

278
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,759
Tae Jun, don't joke
about someone else's misfortune.

279
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:20,890
I'm sorry.

280
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:24,089
I shouldn't talk badly
about Shin Dong Hyuk in front of you.

281
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,460
There seems to be a bite in your words.

282
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,700
Are you upset?

283
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,500
- Me?
- Yes.

284
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,730
No.

285
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,400
What's there to be upset
about your relationship?

286
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:37,009
- Right?
- Of course. I'm perfectly fine.

287
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,009
If you're really my friend,

288
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:46,180
you need to
accept whatever I say wholeheartedly.

289
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,619
Did I ever not do that?

290
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,859
- Tae Jun.
- Yes.

291
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:56,630
Stop calling my name and say it.

292
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,130
If...

293
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,039
I go...

294
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:12,680
to Dong Hyuk just like this,

295
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,950
will that...

296
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,420
make me a bad woman?

297
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,559
If I put my happiness before the hotel,

298
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,299
am I bad?

299
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,569
Answer me.

300
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:46,339
Do you really think you'll be happy...

301
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,750
if you go to him?

302
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,420
I'm not sure,

303
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,890
but men and women
becoming happy together...

304
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,589
Everyone expects that when they date,
but when you actually live together,

305
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,660
you don't know what might happen.

306
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,269
But he really needs me.

307
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:10,329
So...

308
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,369
will you or he be happy?

309
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:15,569
I said I wasn't sure.

310
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:20,480
Everyone has the right
to find their happiness.

311
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,579
If going to him will make you truly happy,

312
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,680
what can you do? You should go.

313
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,920
No matter what people say,
you're the most important to yourself.

314
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,089
What about you?

315
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:34,990
Me?

316
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:36,930
Yes.

317
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,559
I...

318
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:42,269
I need to protect Seoul Hotel.

319
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:48,109
I don't want to hear something
like how people normally are.

320
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,369
I want to listen to what you think.

321
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:04,890
I didn't know Ms. Seo was here.

322
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,490
It's okay. Come in, Yoon Hee.

323
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,789
We weren't talking
about something important.

324
00:23:08,329 --> 00:23:09,430
Right, Ms. Seo?

325
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,460
I wanted to give you a sandwich
before I left.

326
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,799
The cafeteria lady told me
that you didn't have dinner today.

327
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:19,500
Should I excuse myself?

328
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,000
No, I'll just get going.

329
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,170
No. I'll see you off at the taxi stand.

330
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,279
Right. Let's talk about the true happiness
of a woman some other time.

331
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,079
I'll be waiting.

332
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,420
Do as you wish.

333
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:35,650
Right. Don't eat the sandwich.

334
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:44,730
Did nothing happen at home?

335
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,829
Father can't treat me
however he likes now.

336
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,400
He used to scold me
and make me feel scared,

337
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:55,869
but he must've been shocked
when I said I would die.

338
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:57,640
You're a scary daughter.

339
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:00,710
He acknowledged
that his daughter is a grownup now.

340
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:04,980
He likes it
when I talk about his business.

341
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:07,119
Do you talk about the hotel too?

342
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:12,460
I don't think he changed his mind
about the hotel.

343
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:17,230
It's not just about the business.
He's doing it out of stubbornness.

344
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,759
He's always like that.

345
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:22,829
He thinks about good and bad later.

346
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:27,140
He's someone
who needs to get what he wants first.

347
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,109
That's why it's harder
to change Ms. Yoon's mind.

348
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,150
I understand her.

349
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:38,150
But to me,

350
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,680
this hotel is my last chance.

351
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:45,160
I'm not confident that I can
live like before after I leave the hotel.

352
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,490
I'll talk to Ms. Yoon,

353
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,059
but honestly, I'm not confident.

354
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,700
I don't want to pressure you that way.

355
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,509
What you've done
for me so far is more than enough.

356
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,039
What did I do?

357
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,309
You'll probably say...

358
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:10,210
that you saved me
because it took place in the hotel.

359
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,250
But I feel different.

360
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:15,119
Put yourself in my shoes.

361
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,789
That's even more pressuring.

362
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:24,690
I know how we're going to end up.

363
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,869
Time and life...

364
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:32,299
don't go faster
even when you chase them up.

365
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:35,039
Nor do they stop when you try to stop it.

366
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,180
For someone as smart
and soft-hearted as you,

367
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,609
what can I do?

368
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,049
The only thing we can do is...

369
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:51,319
meet like this.

370
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:57,690
Still,

371
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,299
tell me if you get sick and tired of me
who don't give up.

372
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:04,329
I don't want you
to think about me that way.

373
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,069
I don't think that way.

374
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:09,170
Then it's fine. I can endure it well.

375
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,480
Even if Father, Ms. Yoon,
and everyone else...

376
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,150
give me a hard time,
it's fine as long as I have you.

377
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,549
You must think the adults are too mean...

378
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,990
when you didn't do anything wrong, right?

379
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,690
I rather wish...

380
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:28,630
I was an orphan
or came back after being adopted.

381
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:31,430
There's one more who wants to be adopted.

382
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,430
Sorry?

383
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,660
It's nothing.

384
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,710
- Are you getting off work?
- Yes.

385
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,250
Where are you going?

386
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,849
To Yoon Hee.

387
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,490
That's good. Send her back safely.

388
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,490
Okay.

389
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:57,819
Thank you for walking me here.

390
00:26:57,819 --> 00:26:58,960
No worries. Go back safe.

391
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:04,359
Young Jae,
I don't think Yoon Hee had dinner.

392
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,500
Okay.

393
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:24,009
I was too hungry while waiting,
so I ate the sandwich.

394
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,349
It tastes terrible.

395
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Yes, Yoon Hee. Let's go together.

396
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:36,829
Together? Where?

397
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,059
Let's go study overseas together.

398
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,029
We don't have to work at the hotel
and listen to our parents nag.

399
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,299
Let's go overseas.
You can study as much as you want,

400
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:48,339
and I can have fun as much as I want.

401
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,710
Choi Young Jae, grow up.

402
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,109
I'm saying this because I grew up.

403
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,480
It won't always be fun for me...

404
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,980
to have fun in a country
where I can't communicate.

405
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,680
Stop the nonsense and take me home.

406
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,019
Hey, Kim Yoon Hee.

407
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:05,220
Do you think I'm a fool?

408
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,859
Why are you yelling?

409
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:10,690
Is this a hotel? I can yell here.

410
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:12,630
What is it? What's wrong?

411
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,970
I'm sick of living
under Tae Jun's shades like an idiot.

412
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,000
It's driving me crazy...

413
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,339
to wait for you to come back
and act like a servant!

414
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:23,269
You said you would be fine
to do it forever.

415
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:24,440
Forever...

416
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,640
I was going to.

417
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,579
Of course I can do it. But...

418
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:35,049
Goodness. This is insane.

419
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:42,029
When I'm born again,

420
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:44,690
I'll make sure to be born as Tae Jun.

421
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,400
I get it, so stop now.

422
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:49,400
Gosh.

423
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:52,769
Young Jae.

424
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,809
Come here.

425
00:28:58,109 --> 00:29:00,640
Hurry up before I change my mind.

426
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:09,690
Close your eyes.

427
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,839
- Okay.
- Gosh.

428
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:29,940
Let's go.

429
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:33,240
Hey, Yoon Hee.

430
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,619
Can you guess what he meant
by a change of heart?

431
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:42,089
He called me in the morning
and insisted on having breakfast together.

432
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:43,950
I have no idea what it's about.

433
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,619
Based on what he did to Tae Jun last time,

434
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:47,289
they don't do business in a normal way.

435
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:49,160
- We need to be careful.
- Okay.

436
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,279
Dong Hee. Are you going somewhere?

437
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:13,380
I have something to give to you.

438
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:16,089
Father left this for you.

439
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,589
He said he was sorry
that he couldn't see you before he left.

440
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,359
- Are you on your way to work?
- Yes.

441
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,599
I also want to say thank you.

442
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,940
Thank you for letting me meet my father...

443
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:36,309
and thank you for making the arrangements
for him to stay in the hotel.

444
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:37,569
You don't have to say that.

445
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:40,480
We lived like strangers until now,

446
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:42,349
but you don't have to do that now.

447
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,880
I'll buy Father
a house near where he's living now.

448
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,920
You'll be able to visit him
whenever you want.

449
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:55,089
And Jenny, when I'm done with this work,

450
00:30:55,089 --> 00:30:57,059
let's go to the US with me.

451
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:01,029
I'll let you continue with your studies...

452
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,470
and do whatever you want.

453
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,670
I'll compensate you
for everything that you've lost until now.

454
00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:10,869
I didn't lose anything.

455
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,609
I'm happier than anyone right now.

456
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:18,009
I'm learning cooking that I like
at a hotel that I like.

457
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,819
I met a lot of nice and kind people too.

458
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:25,089
I have nothing more that I want.
It's just...

459
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:29,829
If you leave our hotel be,

460
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:31,660
I won't wish for anything else.

461
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,130
You said you were competent.

462
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,069
If you have the ability to take away
a hotel without breaking a sweat,

463
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:39,869
don't you have the ability to save it too?

464
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:44,210
- Dong Hee.
- I owe a lot to Tae Jun.

465
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,539
He almost got shot and died because of me.

466
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:49,150
He also helped me live a new life here.

467
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:51,279
I want to repay him the debt.

468
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:54,250
Can't you help me?

469
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,220
Boss, we're late.

470
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:04,359
I'm sorry. I can't promise that.

471
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,900
Let's talk about it another time.

472
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:34,920
What is this?

473
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,789
I decided...

474
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:41,230
to hand Seoul Hotel
over to an overseas hotel chain.

475
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,670
There are two overseas hotel chains
that have their eyes on Seoul Hotel.

476
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:48,670
They contacted me,

477
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,670
saying they wanted
to buy the shares I'm holding.

478
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:54,480
- That's good.
- I think so too.

479
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:57,950
When I told them Frank was involved too,

480
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,779
they said they would buy them
at a good price.

481
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:01,150
There's no reason to reject them.

482
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,619
Didn't you want Seoul Hotel to yourself?

483
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:05,990
It's a headache.

484
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,559
Yoon Hee too.

485
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,759
I want to shake off everything
related to Seoul Hotel.

486
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:12,859
- Have you made up your mind?
- Yes.

487
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:15,029
I'm doing this to make money anyway.

488
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:17,569
It's easier to sell it off.

489
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:22,769
If an overseas hotel uses its money
to take over,

490
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,339
Yoon Dong Sook and Han Tae Jun
wouldn't be able to do anything.

491
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:29,509
If that happens,
the name "Seoul Hotel" will disappear too.

492
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:31,579
Who cares about the name?

493
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,549
If a hotel chain takes over,

494
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:36,150
it would mean giving up on the tradition
and brand value of Seoul Hotel.

495
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,720
Thirty years of tradition
doesn't put bread on your table.

496
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,920
Don't mind about that.

497
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,130
Just work well
and get a lot of money from them.

498
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,589
That's your specialty, isn't it?

499
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:45,630
Of course.

500
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,329
It's easier for him to work...

501
00:33:48,329 --> 00:33:50,069
with the companies in the US.

502
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,569
You better think about it again.

503
00:33:52,569 --> 00:33:54,240
What's there to think about again?

504
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,869
This is a chance.

505
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:57,640
When I joined Seoul Hotel
as its managing director,

506
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,480
I reevaluated the internal documents.

507
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:02,180
And it's a lot better
than how it's known externally.

508
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,180
What's good about it?

509
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,849
After Mr. Han joined,

510
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:06,880
the sales and profit
are increasing rapidly.

511
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:09,590
The new places they partially opened...

512
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,289
will bring in big profits
because the concepts are good.

513
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:14,159
- So?
- They will be in the black...

514
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,090
in two years.

515
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,800
It will become a goose
that lays golden eggs.

516
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,329
You want me to embrace that troublemaker?

517
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:24,369
And clean up after its mess for two years?

518
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:27,539
You won't be able to find a hotel
as good as this.

519
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:28,869
But boss.

520
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:31,710
Our goal is merger and acquisition,

521
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,880
not hotel management.

522
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,110
Working on it
because it has good business value...

523
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,449
isn't our style.

524
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:38,820
It can change depending on the situation.

525
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,380
Seoul Hotel is something worth getting.

526
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:47,690
Chairman Kim,
I advise you to rethink your decision.

527
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:50,329
I'm completely over the hotel now.

528
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,730
Stop talking and get to work.

529
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,030
One week is enough, right?

530
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,230
Boss, why are you doing this?

531
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:59,400
We just need to sell it off
and gain profit.

532
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,139
Why do you want to do hotel business
when it's a headache?

533
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:03,769
What will we get out of it?

534
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,909
Money, of course. Beautiful money!

535
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,179
For who?

536
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:10,010
For who? For us.

537
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:12,050
- For us?
- Yes, for us, for our lives.

538
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,619
How happy will our lives become
with the money earned...

539
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:17,949
by selling the hotel and its people?

540
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,219
Boss, what's wrong with you?

541
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:21,420
Did you change your major?

542
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,190
Did you suddenly become a philosopher?

543
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,960
If you keep doing this,
I can't work with you.

544
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,730
If things continue this way,
I don't want to work with you either.

545
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:29,170
What?

546
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,599
Tell him to give us
the hotel chain proposal again...

547
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,400
and that we'll review it
and get back to him after a week.

548
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:36,809
What review when he wants
to sign the paper after a week?

549
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,940
I'll go for a walk.

550
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:40,039
What walk?

551
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,610
Are you really going to pursue philosophy
instead of earning money?

552
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:45,849
- Hello.
- Hello.

553
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,119
Why did you say hello?

554
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:57,190
- Hi.
- Hi.

555
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,530
This way.

556
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,809
You're late again.

557
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:16,079
Mouthkeeper Ms. Lee.

558
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,880
We cleaned up all the rubbish
that wasn't recycled.

559
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,420
Don't take credit when you were supposed
to do that yesterday.

560
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,050
Do you know what we saw on the way here?

561
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,059
Pine trees and wind.

562
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,420
Three hundred roses.

563
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,690
Gosh. Where is he? Is he here?

564
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,829
Hello, sir.

565
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:37,769
- Hello.
- Hello.

566
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:39,139
- You saw us earlier, right?
- Hello.

567
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,900
- He's so handsome.
- Gosh.

568
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,739
Did I interrupt you?

569
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:47,510
- No.
- No.

570
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:54,320
Hello.

571
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,360
- Hello.
- Hello.

572
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,840
I think it'll rain.

573
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,139
No, I don't think so.

574
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,949
No, I'm serious.

575
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,650
- Hello.
- Hello.

576
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,750
- Let's make a bet.
- Jenny and I...

577
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:31,849
Who can stir-fry potatoes faster.

578
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:33,820
- You think you can beat me?
- My pride was hurt.

579
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:36,360
- Let's make a bet.
- Will you do it?

580
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,159
I'm confident.

581
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:45,230
- Three boxes of potatoes.
- We have three boxes.

582
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:48,099
- Bring the steak sauce.
- Okay, I'll bring the steak sauce.

583
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,110
How many bottles of steak sauce?

584
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,440
Five bottles of steak sauce.
Bring three more.

585
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,510
Okay.

586
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,340
- Steak sauce.
- Jenny.

587
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,050
- Jenny.
- Your brother's here.

588
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,150
What?

589
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,349
- Hello.
- Hello.

590
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,449
Jenny, go to him.

591
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,389
What brings you here?

592
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,500
I'm just going around to see
what working at the hotel is like.

593
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:14,460
Did you come to examine the employees?

594
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,400
No. That's not it.

595
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,599
I was taking a walk.

596
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:22,309
- You can get back to work.
- Okay.

597
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,179
Excuse me.

598
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,909
Are you free in the evening?

599
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:33,820
Why?

600
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:37,219
If you can come to my house,
I would like to have dinner together.

601
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:38,849
I'll cook.

602
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,989
Sure.

603
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,769
Hello, Mr. Jeffrey.

604
00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:56,710
You've got the flower.

605
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:59,840
You're very welcome. It's my pleasure.

606
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,880
Thank you, sir. Once again,
congratulations on your birthday.

607
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:04,550
- Did you send him a flower?
- Yes.

608
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,449
Hyun Chul, the guest
of Room 1302 is going to check out.

609
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,719
Can I ask you a favor?

610
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,420
Yes. How can I help you, sir?

611
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,329
Which place has the best view
in the hotel?

612
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,300
Jenny said she would cook me dinner.

613
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:22,230
Jenny's a good cook.

614
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:24,469
- What about you?
- I...

615
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:28,869
I never cooked myself
except cooking ramyeon and squid.

616
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:30,670
No, I meant today's dinner.

617
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,539
Oh, dinner?

618
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:34,110
I'll be there as soon as my shift is over.

619
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,250
I get to eat her food thanks to you.

620
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:07,179
Why don't you allow guests to come here
when it's such a nice place?

621
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,039
I know, right?

622
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,809
We could set up tables
and sell drinks here.

623
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,480
You're talking about the hotel work again.

624
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:19,260
Actually, this is my secret place.

625
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:23,090
When I'm tired, sleepy,
or want to play hooky,

626
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:24,860
I come here in secret and take a rest.

627
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,630
Then I came to the right place.

628
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,400
That's what I'm feeling now.

629
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,099
Are you sleepy?

630
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,070
No. The third one.

631
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,400
Playing hooky?

632
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:38,369
Do you find work troublesome at times too?

633
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,550
I never did,
but something must've changed in me today.

634
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:44,210
What kind of change?

635
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,750
I never felt
how the hoteliers greeted me...

636
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:52,489
and welcomed me before.

637
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,090
It's because you live without feelings
and modifiers.

638
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,360
But I can see everyone now.

639
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,869
My gosh.

640
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:05,869
And you told me
to close my ears and eyes...

641
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:07,239
and only look at you, honey?

642
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,039
"Honey?"

643
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,539
Gosh.

644
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,079
I think I went overboard.

645
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:24,250
Thank you, Jin Young.

646
00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:29,019
You made me find another me...

647
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:32,599
that was locked away in my heart.

648
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,429
- Ms. Yoon isn't inside.
- Where did she go?

649
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:06,800
She went to the hospital.

650
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,260
Why?

651
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,329
The cold doesn't seem to go away.
She's coughing a lot more nowadays.

652
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,679
- Ms. Yoon.
- Hi, Mr. Han.

653
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:22,750
You should've gone with your secretary.
Why did you go alone?

654
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,349
- Are you very unwell?
- No.

655
00:42:24,349 --> 00:42:26,780
It's nothing serious. It's okay.

656
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,050
Is there anything for me to sign?

657
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:31,250
Yes. I have something to tell you too.

658
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:35,789
Let's sit down somewhere else
than my office and talk.

659
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:38,489
Sure. I'll take you to a good place.

660
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:43,670
This reminds me
of when the hotel first opened.

661
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:48,099
When the court was first set up,
my husband and you played...

662
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:49,769
the very first game.

663
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:51,070
I lost by a landslide.

664
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,440
He knew you purposely lost to him.

665
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,650
He said you lost
because a lot of people were watching,

666
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:00,280
and you put on a show jumping up and down
as if you felt upset.

667
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,820
I didn't. I genuinely lost.

668
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,719
When I think back,

669
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:09,090
not only bad things happened.

670
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:12,090
Things got hard recently.

671
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,460
Last time, this hotel was fancy.

672
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,670
I want to live like a tree.

673
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:22,670
Even when the leaves turn brown in fall
and fall down,

674
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:27,079
after winter,
it grows new green leaves again.

675
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:29,809
How nice would it be
if we could live like a tree?

676
00:43:31,949 --> 00:43:34,679
New leaves are growing in this hotel.

677
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,590
Don't worry too much.

678
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,760
All you think about is the hotel.

679
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:43,429
And the CEO of the hotel is only thinking
about herself.

680
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:45,329
Pardon?

681
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,000
I was talking about my life.

682
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:52,369
Why? Do you regret your life?

683
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:55,099
Does anyone not regret their life?

684
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,909
People say they don't,

685
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,940
but every life leaves regrets
when you look back on it.

686
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:06,550
I struggled my way here,
trying to work hard.

687
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,989
But I wonder if I lived my life well.

688
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:16,989
Did I not miss anything?

689
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,159
I ran until here as if I was bewitched.

690
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,360
But I want...

691
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,670
to keep looking back,

692
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:30,869
and one side of my heart feels empty.
It feels strange.

693
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,050
I feel so down,
so why is the weather so nice?

694
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,420
You must be too tired
because of the hotel.

695
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,849
Even men find it difficult to work here.

696
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:47,119
You overworked yourself.

697
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:50,230
Yes, it was too much for me.

698
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:52,260
That's not what I mean.

699
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:54,829
I know you're worried about me.

700
00:44:56,929 --> 00:44:59,699
I'm so grateful that you're by my side.

701
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:03,239
When I meet my husband in the future,

702
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:06,510
I'll tell him that.

703
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,519
Right. Let's talk about work.
Enough with being emotional.

704
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:18,250
Okay.

705
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,659
It's about Kim Yoon Hee
of Food and Beverage.

706
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:25,559
I already made up my mind about it.

707
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,030
Please think about it again one last time.

708
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:30,800
The dinner setting is the most boring.

709
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,630
We have two groups of customers today.

710
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:33,699
Did they ask for wine too?

711
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:36,369
We need wine, beer, and hard liquor.

712
00:45:36,909 --> 00:45:38,570
- Don't break wine glasses.
- Wait.

713
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:41,710
- Where did all the radios go?
- Let's set up quickly.

714
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:49,119
What's this?

715
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:51,250
What happened?

716
00:45:51,989 --> 00:45:54,690
We only had two hours
after the lunch cleanup.

717
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:57,460
- Everyone went down to rest.
- Yes.

718
00:45:57,659 --> 00:45:59,360
Mr. Yoo, over there.

719
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:05,969
She's amazing.

720
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:09,199
She set up everything on her own?

721
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:12,309
What are you going to do?

722
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:15,210
Stop bullying her. You're so mean.

723
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,360
- I lost.
- Sorry?

724
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,190
I still don't understand why you need...

725
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:30,889
to work at a hotel,

726
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:33,099
but seeing you work until now...

727
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:36,699
Even if I'm not good enough,
please go easy on me. I'll work harder.

728
00:46:36,699 --> 00:46:38,900
That's why I'm saying I lost.

729
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:41,469
I never saw someone as determined as you.

730
00:46:41,769 --> 00:46:44,570
Who would scold you
when you work this tenaciously?

731
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:47,340
You'll be successful in whatever you do.

732
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:52,750
Then do you not have any hard feelings
for me anymore?

733
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,690
Honestly, I wasn't mean to you...

734
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:59,150
because I had hard feelings for you.

735
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,730
I just find people
from a rich family detestable, you know.

736
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:09,869
Even though you're my junior,
please forgive me.

737
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:12,130
It's okay.

738
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:15,000
You treated me well when I first joined.

739
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,309
You taught me how to work too.

740
00:47:16,469 --> 00:47:18,340
I was really thankful back then.

741
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,340
I'm sorry, Yoon Hee.

742
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:22,980
I think you're a great person.

743
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,519
Hey.

744
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:29,480
If any of you bully or nag at Yoon Hee,

745
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,650
you'll be dead meat.

746
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,250
Treat her well, okay?

747
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:39,059
Mr. Yoo.

748
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,630
Yes. Oh, right.

749
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,199
Okay.

750
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:50,510
Yoon Hee. Ms. Yoon wants to talk to you.

751
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,980
Have a seat.

752
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,650
It's okay.

753
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:00,280
It's easier for me
to look at your eyes that way.

754
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:12,489
I was harsh on you until now.

755
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,699
Please forgive me.

756
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:17,170
It's okay.

757
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:20,840
Yes, that's the habit we learn.

758
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:24,239
"It's okay, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am."

759
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,210
That became a habit for you too.

760
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:33,420
Do you really like
working at a hotel that much?

761
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,349
Yes, Ms. Yoon.

762
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:40,059
If you tell me to leave the hotel,

763
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:42,260
I'll really have nowhere to go.

764
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:46,960
People would laugh when they hear this.

765
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:50,099
Who would believe it
when a daughter of a rich family says...

766
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:52,929
that she has nothing to do
but be a hotel waitress?

767
00:48:55,539 --> 00:48:58,670
I've been serious since I first came here.

768
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:03,250
I heard about it from Mr. Han.

769
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:08,619
That you've had a hard time since young
because of your parents.

770
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:12,519
I didn't do that
because I didn't know about it.

771
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:16,329
Just like your father,

772
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:19,230
I have the same stubbornness...

773
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:23,400
and the same resentment in my heart.

774
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:26,599
So I couldn't accept it easily.

775
00:49:29,269 --> 00:49:30,909
I'm sorry about what my father did.

776
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:32,670
It's not your fault.

777
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,579
That's our business.

778
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,980
Young Jae and you must live...

779
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:41,719
in a different world.

780
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:47,960
Then can I continue to work here?

781
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:51,789
Instead,

782
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,659
can you promise me one thing?

783
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,469
Yes, go ahead.

784
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:01,670
Promise
that you'll keep our conversation...

785
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:06,840
from now a secret,

786
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:12,079
and become a good friend to Young Jae.

787
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:15,849
I will. What is it about?

788
00:50:18,789 --> 00:50:22,260
I don't have much time left to live.

789
00:50:25,929 --> 00:50:28,159
I went to the hospital, and they said...

790
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:30,530
I'm in the final stage of lung cancer.

791
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:33,030
I have 3 to 4 months, at most.

792
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:38,110
Three to four months...

793
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:41,739
are barely enough to wrap up my own life.

794
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:45,010
The hotel is one thing,

795
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,550
but Young Jae...

796
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:53,619
is whom I'm worried about the most.

797
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:57,289
So please,

798
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,170
can you be a good friend to Young Jae...

799
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,039
who'll be left alone after I leave?

800
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:36,300
Is this you?

801
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:41,440
It must be hard to imagine,
but I had days like that too.

802
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:48,010
You must not want to think about it now,

803
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:51,579
but one day, you'll be like me.

804
00:51:53,949 --> 00:51:56,619
No matter how hard you work
and no matter how happy you are,

805
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:01,119
life is sad because you need to leave.

806
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:07,400
Your father and I knew each other
since we were young.

807
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,670
He was my husband's best friend,

808
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:14,340
but they became enemies.

809
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:18,869
Your dad took that picture too.

810
00:52:20,409 --> 00:52:22,380
When my husband and I got married,

811
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:25,610
the guy who came to the wedding drunk
and caused a ruckus...

812
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,320
was your father.

813
00:52:31,289 --> 00:52:34,019
Even after time has passed,
his nasty temper didn't change.

814
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:36,690
But at least,

815
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:41,400
he raised
such a pretty and hardworking daughter.

816
00:52:42,099 --> 00:52:44,199
So he didn't waste his life.

817
00:52:47,269 --> 00:52:48,440
Ms. Yoon.

818
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:51,340
Can I...

819
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,739
keep this picture?

820
00:52:56,849 --> 00:52:57,980
Sure.

821
00:53:00,019 --> 00:53:02,349
Instead, for the time being,

822
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:05,550
keep it a secret from Young Jae.

823
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:09,289
Okay.

824
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:47,360
Okay.

825
00:53:48,429 --> 00:53:50,670
Bear with it for a while
even if you're bored.

826
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,429
I'll be there soon.

827
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:14,889
Yoon Hee.

828
00:54:17,289 --> 00:54:18,760
Did Mom call you again?

829
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,500
She told you
to leave the hotel again, right?

830
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:27,340
No, I'm fine. It's nothing.

831
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:37,710
Ms. Yoon is resting, so come back later.

832
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:43,849
Mom, must you do this?

833
00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:45,420
Will you only be satisfied
after you fire Yoon Hee?

834
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,760
Young Jae, please.

835
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,590
I need to rest now. Let's talk later.

836
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,630
Do you want to see me go crazy?

837
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,559
Do you want me to go insane?

838
00:54:53,929 --> 00:54:55,130
What are you saying?

839
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:57,869
You said I was a fool
for chasing around a daughter of an enemy.

840
00:54:58,469 --> 00:55:00,900
Fine. I'll quit working at the hotel...

841
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,869
and do whatever I want.
You do whatever you want as well.

842
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:05,809
You're so...

843
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,309
Get out. I said, get out!

844
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:11,880
I will.

845
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:16,519
I won't come back after I get out,
so good luck running the hotel without me.

846
00:55:17,889 --> 00:55:20,590
Young...

847
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,530
Ms. Yoon!

848
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,159
Ms. Yoon!

849
00:55:40,409 --> 00:55:41,679
I want to protect Seoul Hotel.

850
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:43,550
You must've completely lost it, Dong Hyuk.

851
00:55:43,909 --> 00:55:46,480
Jin Young,
you must find Tae Jun comfortable.

852
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:48,719
After crossing a river called a hotel,

853
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:50,590
a mountain called Tae Jun is blocking me.
