00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,580
(Episode 9, You Within You)

2
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,629
Wake up, Leo.

3
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,140
The New York Stock Exchange
will open in an hour.

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,140
Okay. Today is D-Day.

5
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,689
Morning, boss.

6
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:58,460
It's afternoon in New York.
We have 50 minutes left. Let's begin.

7
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,530
Okay.

8
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:01,899
Connect it to the Internet first.
Open our fax line.

9
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:03,299
Tell Brian to set up a hotline.

10
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:04,400
Give me the scenario.

11
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,549
All right. Let's review it one at a time.

12
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:21,019
Twenty minutes before the closing time,

13
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:23,150
be on standby to buy 1.2 million shares
of the hotel in Vegas. Next.

14
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,719
When Brian dumps 20,000 shares,
we'll buy 30,000 shares.

15
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,159
Three.

16
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,230
When Eric makes his move,
we'll buy everything. Or...

17
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,359
We'll dump everything in one go.

18
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,730
The expected price is 28 dollars.

19
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,200
The floor price is 23 dollars.

20
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,299
What's our gross price?

21
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,900
It's 33.6 million dollars.

22
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,840
If our cut is 15 percent?

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,939
That's 5.04 million dollars.

24
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,709
Brian, this is your brother. Big brother.

25
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:48,109
Gosh. He thinks he's my big brother.

26
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,379
Okay. You're ready?

27
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,280
Okay. Good luck, little boy.

28
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:53,549
We started, boss.

29
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,819
Are you on standby, Attorney Kim?

30
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,219
Okay. We'll start at the same time.

31
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,189
- Brian sold it.
- Get it.

32
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:01,290
Thirty thousand.

33
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:05,260
Attorney Kim.
No one is buying the stocks, right?

34
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:08,270
Don't worry about that.
The Chinese like to exaggerate.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,099
Oh, that?

36
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,669
I'm not interested.

37
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:15,039
Hold on, boss. Something is off.

38
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,270
Hold up.

39
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,439
What's this? Has Eric gone mad?

40
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:21,210
Check on Brian.

41
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:24,150
Brian, what the heck is going on?

42
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,219
Yes, I'm watching now.

43
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,990
- What did he say?
- He doesn't know.

44
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,319
How much time do we have left?

45
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:31,789
Fifteen minutes.

46
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,129
- Should we dump everything?
- Wait.

47
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,699
Check on Bloomberg to see
if there's other news.

48
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,009
Nothing.

49
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,939
Lawyer Kim, Eric is doing the opposite.
Do you know anything about this?

50
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,110
Does he have an ulterior motive?

51
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,580
I don't trust that guy.

52
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:59,050
Okay. Let's talk later, then.

53
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,219
Don't leave your desk.

54
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,889
What do we do?

55
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,330
Wait.

56
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,460
We have 14 minutes.

57
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:25,379
We have two minutes left, boss.

58
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,780
If we don't do anything,
we'll be losing 2.5 million dollars today.

59
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:31,379
- How much is it now?
- Twenty-three.

60
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,050
No. It went down to twenty-two.

61
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,030
Darn it.

62
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,759
Yes. It's Jackson.

63
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,500
Who?

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,469
The old man from the hotel in Vegas.

65
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:51,270
The bearded man from prison.
The one who lost to us.

66
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,969
Call Rachel right now.

67
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,039
Lawyer Kim, put Rachel on the phone.

68
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:58,509
What do I ask?

69
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,039
Ask her where Jackson is.

70
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,050
If he's in Los Angeles,
he must be working with Eric.

71
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,219
Hey, Rachel. Could you find out
where Jackson is now?

72
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:08,389
Okay. Thank you very much.

73
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,050
You were right.

74
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,520
He's been in LA for a week now.

75
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,229
What do we do?
Should we still dump everything?

76
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,830
No. It's the opposite.

77
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,360
Sell them over the counter
and get as many shares as you can.

78
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,060
- Buy them back?
- Yes. Hurry.

79
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,300
Okay.

80
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,730
Eric, that jerk.

81
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,569
- Are you in?
- Okay.

82
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,509
- How much in total?
- We have 1.56 million.

83
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:30,839
I cleaned the floor.

84
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,779
But boss, if this goes under 20 dollars,

85
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:36,009
we'll be left with nothing.

86
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,250
Why do you think Eric met with Jackson?

87
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,990
I'm not sure. To ask him
to sell off the rest of the stocks?

88
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:46,160
No.

89
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:48,259
That man will never give up the hotel.

90
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,660
I vividly remember his eyes
when we visited him in prison.

91
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,459
So what is it, then?

92
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,970
He's selling his stocks
to get his hotel back?

93
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,470
Eric must have coached him.

94
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,540
Brian likes girls.
If he leaked it to Eric,

95
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,870
they must have known we'd sell them.

96
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,040
That sly jerk, Eric, was pretending
to work for us,

97
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,810
but he was planning to take over.

98
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,319
Anyway, that's the problem
with men who like girls.

99
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,189
What do we do?

100
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,139
Hello? Eric.

101
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,240
Yes. We did.

102
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,439
Why? I don't know.

103
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,980
You'd better ask my boss.

104
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,250
Just inspiration.

105
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,220
That's all.

106
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:47,649
You must be kidding me.

107
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:51,889
Oh, Eric. I love you, my sexy boy.

108
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:53,290
I love you, my man.

109
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,889
Boss, you heard him, right?

110
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,759
Fifteen percent
of Seoul Hotel's foreign equities...

111
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,269
and 12 million dollars on top of that.
He's waving the white flag.

112
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:04,199
Bingo! We did it.

113
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,410
Boss, that's amazing. You did it again!

114
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,310
We have 15 percent
of their foreign equities...

115
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,579
and 38 percent of their bonds.

116
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:14,910
Once you sign it, it's over.
We'll be taking over Seoul Hotel.

117
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,120
Put a hold on that.

118
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,620
Postpone it for a week.

119
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,750
What are you talking about?

120
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:24,220
A week for these Wall Street guys
is the same as a year for regular people.

121
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,389
Don't worry.
They have no way to escape from this.

122
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:57,490
Leo, where's the car key?

123
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,319
This is Duty Assistant Manager...
This is Seo Jin Young.

124
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,860
Gosh. Dong Hyuk.

125
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:40,800
I'm sorry to wake you up.

126
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,939
And there's more.

127
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,740
I'm...

128
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,480
in front of your house.

129
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,379
What? Really?

130
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:56,350
Why? Is something wrong?

131
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,389
Yes. About 15 minutes?

132
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:03,620
But I should at least wash my face
before I come out.

133
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:06,420
Okay.

134
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:11,459
I got it. I'll be out in five minutes.
I won't put on makeup.

135
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,360
Okay.

136
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,279
- Was that four minutes?
- I barely washed my face before I left.

137
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,939
Get in. We have somewhere to go right now.

138
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,550
What? Where are we going?

139
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,070
What are we doing here? Are you Catholic?

140
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:34,679
Actually, I brought you here today
because I have to make a confession.

141
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,679
A confession?

142
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:40,080
I see. Like the sacrament of confession?

143
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,190
To tell you who I am...

144
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,059
and why I'm staying in Seoul Hotel.

145
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,860
I want to tell you the truth.

146
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:51,200
You must have committed a lot of sins.

147
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,799
Perhaps.

148
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,840
Then you must come to church often.

149
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,009
Do you?

150
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:06,309
There's St. Patrick's Cathedral
in Manhattan.

151
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:07,610
I go there sometimes.

152
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:15,720
The New York Stock Exchange
closes at 3 p.m.

153
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,519
Just like soldiers kill and get killed
on the battlefield,

154
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,360
I would be drained from fighting all day.

155
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,629
So I used to take the subway
to go to St. Patrick's Cathedral.

156
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,470
Even if I didn't pray there,

157
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:35,210
just sitting there quietly
brought me peace.

158
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,539
It's like an oasis
in the middle of the desert.

159
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:45,919
Sometimes, I fall asleep there.

160
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,600
You should have told the truth
from the start.

161
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:15,509
If you're the only one who knows,
how are we going to fix this?

162
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:17,580
The bank made it sound like
this could be smoothed out soon.

163
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,610
So I gave it a few more days.

164
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,779
As this is urgent,

165
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:21,980
- we should consider a private loan.
- No.

166
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,779
I'll look into second-tier banks.
I need your help.

167
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:28,090
Seoul Hotel has never been late to pay
its employees since its establishment.

168
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:31,019
If that happens,
you might as well think we're all fired.

169
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:33,120
How should I handle the expenses?

170
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:35,460
How much are we behind
on paying the construction company?

171
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,960
It's slightly under 1.2 million dollars.

172
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,559
You should use
the emergency funds for now.

173
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,100
The renovation schedule must be followed.

174
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,669
That won't be easy.

175
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,169
We have to train
the newly recruited employees.

176
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:47,169
The renovation schedule
has been delayed for a week.

177
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:49,269
The construction must finish on schedule
even if it means...

178
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,009
we stay up all night to work. Understood?

179
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:52,139
General Manager Han.

180
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,879
I've been looking everywhere for you.

181
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:56,809
I need to talk to you.

182
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,080
Go ahead.

183
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,419
We should talk in private.

184
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,289
- Administration Manager.
- Yes.

185
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:06,590
Isn't he holding the inspection ledger?

186
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,960
Yes, I think so.

187
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,929
I bet money is involved in this.

188
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,230
Goodness, where's Manager Oh? Come on.

189
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,669
Everyone has been slacking off.

190
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:22,940
- Administration Manager.
- Yes.

191
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,879
Tell everyone in the managerial positions
to gather in an hour.

192
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,639
Call everyone. I don't care
if they're on duty or off duty.

193
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,009
Yes, sir.

194
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,159
That's yours, Jin Young.

195
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,830
Hello.

196
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:46,759
Yes, this is Seo Jin Young.

197
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,840
No. I filled in for someone yesterday.
So I don't have the day shift today.

198
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,240
An emergency meeting?

199
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,340
Okay.

200
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,549
- Do you have to go back to the hotel?
- Yes, I guess this is urgent.

201
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,419
What a bummer, though.
I never got to hear your confession.

202
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,990
I already gave my confession.

203
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,220
No. I have to hear it in person.

204
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,620
You have to do it again next time.

205
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,889
- Sounds good.
- You must. Promise me.

206
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:21,669
Spread your palm.

207
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:24,000
Ta-da.

208
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,269
What's this?

209
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,639
I'm copying our contract.

210
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,779
Spoken like a true businessman.

211
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:33,340
- Let's go.
- Okay.

212
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,519
Hello, General Manager Han.

213
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,860
What brings you here?

214
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm here to talk to Manager Oh.

215
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,429
He's not in the office.
Do you want me to call him?

216
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,240
No. Tell him to come to my office.

217
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,610
Sure. Did you know we have
Ms. Seo Jin Young's birthday party today?

218
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,340
Everyone will go to her house
for a surprise party.

219
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,679
It will start at 8 p.m.

220
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,210
I'll be able to attend the party
if I hurry after my shift.

221
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,919
But I'm busy.

222
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,450
So when I told the other employees
that I couldn't make it,

223
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,950
but they kept pestering me.

224
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:18,220
Given what happened to Ms. Seo,
we should go to show our support, right?

225
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,090
Sure. Let's do that.

226
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,289
If you don't want to go alone,
do you want me to go with you?

227
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,159
Sure. Let's do that if nothing comes up.

228
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,029
Then will you call me?

229
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,100
Sure. I will.

230
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,470
See you in the conference room later.

231
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,899
Yes.

232
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:36,740
Anything new?

233
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,309
I need something stronger.

234
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,309
No.

235
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,009
Yes.

236
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,480
Come on in, Manager Oh.

237
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,320
- I'm sorry to call you when you're busy.
- Don't be.

238
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,889
I ought to drop everything
and rush over...

239
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:51,620
if the general manager
wants to talk to me.

240
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,120
Please have a seat.

241
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:55,559
What's this about?

242
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,399
This is the logbook for incoming
and outgoing items from last year...

243
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,230
to this year's first quarter
at the inspection room.

244
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:03,230
And this is the sales ledger
for Food and Beverage.

245
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,000
I found a few discrepancies.

246
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,539
Especially the liquor section.

247
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,309
The liquor we have in stock
doesn't seem to match the liquor we sold.

248
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,179
- So what?
- It means...

249
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,580
someone is stealing our liquor.

250
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:22,789
Are you not aware of this?

251
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:24,620
Why are you asking me about this?

252
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,960
Who has enough power
to rig the books at the inspection room...

253
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,389
and Food and Beverage?

254
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,129
The list is pretty short.

255
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:31,259
So let me get this straight.

256
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,399
Are you implying
that I'm tampering with the ledgers...

257
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,700
to steal liquor?

258
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,870
- You had no idea about this?
- Hey, Manager Han.

259
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,669
You must be desperate
to find me at fault to kick me out.

260
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:43,809
No. Don't get the wrong idea.

261
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:45,039
I, Oh Hyung Man,

262
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,279
started here as a bellman in my youth...

263
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,950
and have been working
at this hotel for 17 years.

264
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,879
I spent my youth at this hotel.

265
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,750
And I've dedicated my life to this hotel.

266
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,059
But what?

267
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,820
You think I'm stealing?

268
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:03,590
I'm tampering with the books?

269
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:07,059
You must think so lowly of me
to make that accusation.

270
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm not an easy mark.

271
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,069
If you're planning to kick me out,
I advise you to stop.

272
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,470
Do you know what my dream is?

273
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,250
To join hands with
a competent and experienced man like you,

274
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,119
so we can make Seoul Hotel...

275
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:28,349
the best luxury hotel in Korea and Asia.

276
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,220
If I can't get the house in order now,

277
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,430
I will not be able to keep the house safe
from future troubles.

278
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,759
Please remember that I'm watching...

279
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,029
Are you threatening me right now?

280
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:38,329
No. I'm warning you.

281
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:40,460
Let me tell you
a couple of things too, then.

282
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,900
If you want to get rid of me,
you'd better crush me.

283
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,700
I was born in the Year of the Boar.

284
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:50,839
If someone hurts me, I will never stop
chasing him and will crash into him.

285
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,450
Make sure to lock your house,
General Manager Han.

286
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,990
Gosh.

287
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,319
How dare Han Tae Jun threaten me?

288
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,589
Gosh. He must have taken me for some fool.

289
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,000
Fine. Let's do this, then.

290
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,960
- Lighter.
- Yes, sir.

291
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:20,369
- Come on.
- Gosh!

292
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,269
- Right. Kim Yoon Hee.
- Yes.

293
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,380
Keep a close eye on that girl,
Kim Yoon Hee.

294
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,440
Kim Yoon Hee.

295
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,150
Han Tae Jun and Kim Yoon Hee...
What was that?

296
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,250
Yes. They might be involved
in an inappropriate relationship.

297
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,950
Is that so?

298
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,519
That jerk, Han Tae Jun,

299
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:37,819
is trying to get rid of everyone...

300
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:39,259
who's standing against him.

301
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,329
Stay sharp. Otherwise, he will kick you
to the curb before you can do anything.

302
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,329
Do you understand me?

303
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
What? Yes.

304
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,730
Of course.

305
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:06,950
Everyone is here. Let's begin.

306
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,190
No. There's no need to get up.
Stay in your seats.

307
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,089
I came by because I was curious
about the agenda of the meeting.

308
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:16,829
Don't mind me. Have your meeting.

309
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:22,000
I reviewed business proposals
from each department...

310
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,400
and last month's sales ledgers.

311
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,470
I will not go into detail,

312
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,369
but I will mention this.

313
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,710
The sales keep going down
below our average.

314
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,279
This is our off-season.
It's only natural that our sales go down.

315
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:35,809
The problem is
our hotel can't afford to have...

316
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:37,480
an off-season.

317
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,420
We only have...

318
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,349
two months to save our hotel at max.

319
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,890
We must stabilize our hotel...

320
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,390
and complete the construction
that's underway within those months.

321
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,130
Our hotel has six restaurants.

322
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,900
Go over some realistic proposals
to increase our sales...

323
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,730
by 20 to 30 percent.

324
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,299
Please submit the proposal
by the end of this week.

325
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,140
By the end of this week?

326
00:19:58,369 --> 00:19:59,569
Is that too much time?

327
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:00,700
No.

328
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,369
That's impossible.

329
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,839
The sales didn't go down overnight.

330
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:11,480
How do you expect us
to increase the sales within a month?

331
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:15,589
I'd rather stir-fry some beans
with lightning. That sounds more doable.

332
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,549
You have until the end of this week.
Submit the proposal...

333
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,720
to me by 9 a.m. on Saturday.

334
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,089
- Ms. Lee Soon Jung.
- Yes.

335
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,329
Yes, General Manager Han.

336
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:25,930
I need you to check
on the conditions of the rooms.

337
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:28,930
Make a list of items
we have to replace in each room.

338
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,700
Check the curtains, carpets, and so on.

339
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,569
Do you need that by the end of this week?

340
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,009
- Yes.
- Okay, General Manager Han.

341
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,609
I'm sorry.

342
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:42,650
I can't listen to you anymore.
This meeting disgusts me.

343
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,720
Sit down, Manager Oh.

344
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,619
Gosh. That's enough, General Manager Han.

345
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,359
You didn't even schedule this meeting
with the managers in advance.

346
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,990
You scheduled it yourself
and gave us no choice but to attend it.

347
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,430
I cannot accept this.

348
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,700
I'm only sharing my discovery
after reviewing thoroughly.

349
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,500
Sure. In that case,

350
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,869
I ask that you review it more thoroughly.

351
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:08,170
It seems to me that
your three-year absence...

352
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,670
must have affected you a lot.

353
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:24,490
Hey, don't you think
we're being too harsh?

354
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,289
Don't worry. Just follow my lead.

355
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,329
Even if he hates us, he can't fire us.

356
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:34,730
Manager Seo, you must be tired.
You were on night duty yesterday.

357
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,329
I am.

358
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,539
I don't even know
if I'm alive or dead right now.

359
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,940
That's awful. You barely got any sleep.

360
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:43,710
Thanks for looking out for me.

361
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,039
Of course, I'm looking out for you.

362
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,380
You should go home and get some sleep.

363
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,210
Sleep is the best treatment for good skin.

364
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:51,579
People with bad skin must feel so awful.

365
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,880
You must be so happy
that you have good skin.

366
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,349
Not really. I was born with good skin.

367
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,859
Then have a good day, Snow White Lee.

368
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,390
Bye, Sleeping...

369
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,390
Witch.

370
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,670
Ms. Lee. I need to see you for a second.

371
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:17,210
Are you blind?
You can't see me from there?

372
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,380
What are you doing?

373
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:28,950
Do you not have any pride or self-esteem?

374
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,349
Then did you act like that at the meeting,

375
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,990
led by the general manager
because of your pride?

376
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:37,430
We have to band together
to stop him from turning into a tyrant.

377
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,960
If we let Han Tae Jun
do whatever he wants,

378
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:42,599
our hotel will be wrecked in a storm.

379
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,940
As long as we don't sail over a rock
called Oh Hyung Man,

380
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,569
we will be sailing smoothly.

381
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:48,869
How could you be so clueless?

382
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:51,710
The hotel is running out of money.
We can barely get paid.

383
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,509
What? We can't get paid?

384
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,180
What are you talking about?
Tell me everything you know.

385
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:31,079
Here's the basic etiquette
of serving water.

386
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:34,579
Push your right foot
toward the customer by 3cm.

387
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,420
Then pour it slowly.

388
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,890
When you do that,
gently rest your left arm...

389
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,960
on your back at a right angle. Okay?

390
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:43,789
- Yes.
- Great.

391
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,859
There can't be more than
three cigarette buds on an ashtray.

392
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,769
When you replace it with a new one,
put a new ashtray on the table.

393
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:50,799
Then remove the old one.

394
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,670
Be careful not to make a mess
with the ashes.

395
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,109
When I was at a cafe,
I saw how the waiters did it.

396
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:57,140
Ms. Kim.

397
00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:00,480
You can't compare a cafe
to a luxury hotel.

398
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,380
I'm sorry.

399
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,119
Miss, I would like some water.

400
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,819
Yes, ma'am. Go ahead.

401
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:15,230
Your left arm must be at a right angle.

402
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,460
Great.

403
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,470
Do you serve soju here?

404
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,599
Well...

405
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,069
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, sir.

406
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:29,240
We don't have it on the menu,
but if you want soju,

407
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,440
we'll get it for you.

408
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,039
However, our hotel
has great wine and beer...

409
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,650
along with other tasty drinks.

410
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,650
If you would like,
I can make a recommendation.

411
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,619
Then give me a beer.

412
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:42,819
Yes, sir. I will prepare
a cool bottle of beer.

413
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,490
Good work.

414
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,859
Ms. Kim is better than I thought.

415
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:52,859
She's almost done memorizing the menu.

416
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:55,769
She will be eyeing
for my position pretty soon.

417
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:58,339
Well, she's a smart girl.

418
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,269
Welcome, sir. Will you be dining alone?

419
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,470
Do you have a new employee
named Kim Yoon Hee?

420
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,880
If you don't mind me asking,
can you tell me who you are first?

421
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,950
Just answer my question.

422
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:15,490
I'm sorry. I must know who you are first.

423
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,720
Only then I can answer your question.

424
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:46,619
Who was that just now?

425
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,490
I don't know. But he was quite odd.

426
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,690
He was asking for one of our employees,
so I asked him to identify himself.

427
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,759
Then he bolted out of the restaurant.

428
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:54,759
Whom was he looking for?

429
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,890
He was looking for Ms. Kim Yoon Hee.

430
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,559
The girl who got the job
through the general manager's connection.

431
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,269
Do you see that pretty girl over there?

432
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:03,670
Over there.

433
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:07,940
Hey, Mr. Yoo.

434
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:18,880
What? She's doing what?

435
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:21,789
I witnessed her working
as a waitress at a hotel restaurant.

436
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,089
That crazy girl.

437
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:24,450
What? A waitress?

438
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,390
Seoul Hotel, of all places?

439
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:29,430
I like to keep quiet
unless it directly affects my work.

440
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,630
May I offer my opinion?

441
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,700
What is it?

442
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,130
When young people are willing
to stand up for themselves...

443
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,900
and make a living for themselves,

444
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,809
our society should be welcoming
their attitude.

445
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,369
Look.

446
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:45,410
You know nothing about my family.
Who are you to lecture me?

447
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:47,940
Well,

448
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,849
I'm not the chatty type.

449
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:51,509
Stop talking back to me
and lead me to her.

450
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,289
Welcome, sir.
I'm the general manager, Han Tae Jun.

451
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,529
I did hear that
there was a new general manager.

452
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,329
We may not be fully ready to receive you
as we weren't informed of your visit.

453
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:10,430
But where should I escort you to?

454
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,869
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

455
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,880
- Mr. Yoo, please escort him.
- Yes, sir.

456
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,049
I have prepared a table
with a great view, sir.

457
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,230
This way, sir.

458
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,109
- Gosh. What was that?
- Oh, no.

459
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,089
- What is this? Goodness. Oh, no.
- Come on.

460
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,549
Unbelievable.

461
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,519
I'm truly sorry, ma'am.

462
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,319
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

463
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,430
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

464
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,430
Be careful with that.

465
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:18,299
Sir, your table is this way.

466
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:20,700
I'll sit wherever I want.

467
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:31,609
If this is too noisy for you,
we can prepare a table somewhere else.

468
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,589
No. This view is amazing.

469
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,519
Then enjoy your meal.

470
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,789
Manager Yoo will take good care of you.

471
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,960
Get his order.

472
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,809
Are you all right?

473
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,839
Are you hurt?

474
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:12,220
Make sure to compensate the customers
for their cleaning fee.

475
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,559
And don't accept payments for their meals.

476
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:14,859
Yes, sir.

477
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,230
What would you like for your appetizer?

478
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,369
Would you like to have a drink first?

479
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:25,599
Which drink, sir?

480
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,799
Anything.

481
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,740
Are you okay?

482
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,509
Yes. I'm okay.

483
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,420
I'm pathetic, aren't I?

484
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,559
Why do you think so?

485
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,829
I'm so pathetic and stupid.

486
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,500
It was my first time...

487
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,730
to make a decision...

488
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,869
to start something new
without my father's help.

489
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,180
That's why I wanted to do well.

490
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,480
I wanted to show him that...

491
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,480
I could be fine on my own too.

492
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:45,950
Then?

493
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:49,990
I suddenly don't feel confident.

494
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,119
Mistakes aren't bad.

495
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,789
Being embarrassed
about your mistakes is bad.

496
00:30:56,589 --> 00:30:59,599
You will never be free
from making mistakes like today.

497
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:03,670
Being able to handle your mistakes well
without getting flustered...

498
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:06,869
separates professionals from amateurs.

499
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:09,710
Keep working hard...

500
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:12,279
to deliver food and live your own life.

501
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:14,579
You can't gain anything
without making an effort.

502
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,809
Don't feel intimidated.

503
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:18,450
Don't give up. Just keep trying.

504
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,779
Then at one point, you'll get to show
your father that you're a professional.

505
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:26,490
You have no idea how my father is.

506
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,430
That doesn't matter.
No fathers can say no to their children.

507
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,529
My father is different.

508
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:36,430
He's not like other dads.

509
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,670
I'm sure that's not true.

510
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:42,140
I bet he's worried about you
just like other fathers.

511
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,920
Just for one minute.

512
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,029
Let me borrow your shoulder for a minute.

513
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,469
They'll take care of it.
You should go back in for now.

514
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:31,139
Hey! Come on.

515
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,429
What brings you all the way here, sir?

516
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:57,730
I haven't gotten any updates.

517
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,539
I came to check
if you guys are still alive.

518
00:34:59,969 --> 00:35:01,469
We're alive and kicking.

519
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:02,570
Please sit.

520
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,739
I heard some good news.

521
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,409
Pardon?

522
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:12,679
I heard 15 percent
of the foreign equities...

523
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:14,349
just rolled into our hands.

524
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,750
Gosh. News travels fast for you, sir.

525
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,320
Bill me for your fee quickly.
I'll take care of it right away.

526
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,519
Sure.

527
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,989
- Where's Frank?
- He'll be out soon.

528
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,130
Hey, boss.

529
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,199
Hey, it's been a while. Frank.

530
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:32,070
I told you not to visit us at the hotel.

531
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,199
It's fine. This villa is far
from everything else.

532
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,239
No one will see me here.

533
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,369
The security cameras are all over here.

534
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,949
I came in as soon as I got out
of the car. What can they do with that?

535
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:46,280
Luxury hotels record
incoming and outgoing cars...

536
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:47,650
for VIP guests.

537
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,349
This is the revised plan.

538
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,590
We're two weeks ahead of schedule.

539
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,960
I saw it on the news.

540
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,429
You pulled this off brilliantly.

541
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:58,159
It will be delayed by a week.

542
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,000
Why?

543
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,400
I need to iron out
a few more internal problems of the hotel.

544
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,300
I see. Actually,

545
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,869
I burned a bridge for this darn hotel.

546
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:09,570
A bridge?

547
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:12,510
Are you talking about the bridge
around the rear gate?

548
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,679
Gosh. Come on.

549
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:16,650
You can't even read between the lines.
Are you sure you're up for this task?

550
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,150
Did you mess with their finances?

551
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,280
You're good indeed, Frank.

552
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,719
Their capitals will be tied up
at the end of the month.

553
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,860
They won't even have enough money
to pay the employees.

554
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,460
Chairman Kim,
call the bank now and fix that.

555
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,599
Why?

556
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,800
I'm trying to support you.

557
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,099
It wasn't easy to get this done.

558
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:38,329
You've made a huge mistake.

559
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,599
A mistake?

560
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:43,239
I can't let them have a breather.
That way, they'll give up faster.

561
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,110
You like sashimi, don't you?

562
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,409
Sashimi?

563
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:52,010
- Yes.
- Do you want to eat dead fish?

564
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:56,019
Who would want a dead fish,
floating around the tank?

565
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,690
How can I strategize
with the stocks of a hotel...

566
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,360
that can't even pay their employees?

567
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:03,690
Don't you agree?

568
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,230
I got it.

569
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:27,119
Why did you lie to him, boss?

570
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,420
What?

571
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,789
The dead fish.

572
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:34,360
If the hotel doesn't have enough capital
and their stock price will plummet,

573
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,059
then we can buy its stocks cheap.

574
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:39,630
What do the employees' paychecks
have anything to do with this deal?

575
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,730
I remember what you said once before.

576
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,570
A deer hunter won't be able
to pull the trigger...

577
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,170
if he looks the deer in the eye.
Remember?

578
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,809
Gosh. Come on.

579
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,559
Goodness. It's broad daylight.

580
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,989
Gosh. Where is this from?

581
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,829
I didn't order this.

582
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:15,500
I'm just delivering these presents.
Where should I put them?

583
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,570
Okay. Over there.

584
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:24,010
We'll get going now. Bye.

585
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,340
Bye.

586
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,389
(Happy birthday. From Shin Dong Hyuk)

587
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:43,159
(I don't know
how many birthdays you've had so far.)

588
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,829
Hello.

589
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,440
Why is your cell phone turned off?

590
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:56,070
Do you know how hard it was for me
to find your landline number?

591
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,909
Do you like the presents?

592
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:02,949
I didn't know what you liked,
so I got one of each.

593
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,610
Just put on the one you like the most.

594
00:39:04,849 --> 00:39:06,949
No. Dong Hyuk.

595
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:08,019
Just come out.

596
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:10,389
I made a dinner reservation
at a fancy restaurant.

597
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,119
Let's talk about the rest during dinner.

598
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:15,289
I can't let you spend
your birthday alone at home.

599
00:39:15,389 --> 00:39:16,489
I'll wait for you.

600
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:19,559
Wait. Dong Hyuk. Hello?

601
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,690
What are you doing?

602
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:52,389
Why did you bring them out?

603
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:55,159
I'm sorry. I can't take these.

604
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,469
They don't look good on me either.

605
00:39:56,469 --> 00:39:58,929
Besides,
I rarely have chances to wear them.

606
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:01,840
This is a waste of money.
You should take them back.

607
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:04,940
What will I do with women's clothes?

608
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,139
Just keep them.
You can wear them one at a time.

609
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:08,210
Gosh.

610
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:12,309
Quantity and cost
don't make presents good presents.

611
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,190
But buy me a tasty dinner.

612
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,619
I slept through lunchtime, so I'm hungry.

613
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:25,059
Come on. Open the door, please.

614
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,650
She's not answering the phone.
And her phone is off too.

615
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,349
Where did she go?

616
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:15,210
One, two, three.

617
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,309
Yes, this is Lee Soon Jung.

618
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,579
It's Ms. Seo Jin Young's day off.

619
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:24,090
Yes. She's not working today. Right.

620
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:31,889
Gosh, General Manager Han.
You haven't left yet?

621
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:34,829
- What?
- It's Manager Seo's birthday today.

622
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,070
Oh, right.

623
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,099
You don't have a lot of time until 8 p.m.

624
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:42,909
When does the department store close?

625
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:52,480
No. I can't give in now.

626
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,550
Let's wait. Yes.

627
00:41:56,349 --> 00:42:01,119
Be patient, elegant, and classy.
Keep your pride.

628
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:05,230
Gosh. I don't care about all that.
Just call me.

629
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:32,590
- Hello.
- Hello.

630
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:36,989
- Where can I find rings and necklaces?
- Hello.

631
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:38,360
You can go that way, sir.

632
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,829
- Thank you.
- Sure.

633
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:53,610
I'm sorry, sir. We're closed.

634
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:56,409
Yes. I know that.
But I must buy a present.

635
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:58,610
I have to buy a present. Please help me.

636
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:01,150
It must be for your girlfriend.

637
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:02,320
Yes. Well...

638
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,449
- Please look around, then.
- Thank you.

639
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,800
This necklace, please.

640
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:22,039
- Gosh.
- At least accept this present.

641
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:25,170
Do you know how hard it was to return
the clothes, shoes, and handbags?

642
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:27,780
I'm sorry.

643
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:33,949
This is beautiful.

644
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,679
I knew it would look great on you.

645
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,989
Are you sure I can accept this?

646
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:16,260
Can I look in the mirror?

647
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:17,960
Of course.

648
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:34,440
Thank you.

649
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,610
But this must be really expensive.

650
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:39,679
- Should I give you the receipt too?
- No. That's not what I meant.

651
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,079
I was worried that
you might have spent too much money.

652
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:45,989
Compared to my income,
I rarely have occasions to spend money.

653
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,920
Were you born into a rich family?

654
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:50,190
No.

655
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:53,460
I didn't even have money
to buy a burger when I was a student.

656
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,329
That's incredible.

657
00:44:56,469 --> 00:44:58,130
Then how did you make so much money?

658
00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:00,800
Wall Street is like Recoleta.

659
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,769
You either survive or kill.

660
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,239
You either become winners
or poor after losing everything.

661
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:08,610
Isn't that what people want
when they go for it at first?

662
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:11,110
I used to work at a gas station.

663
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,949
- When you were a student?
- Yes.

664
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,449
One day, there was a robber.

665
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,190
With guns?

666
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,590
The robber put a gun on my forehead.

667
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:22,619
There happened to be a gun
under the cash register.

668
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:23,860
So did you shoot the robber?

669
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:24,889
No.

670
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:28,429
I grabbed that gun
and pointed it at my head.

671
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:29,829
I told the robber
I would kill myself first.

672
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:31,000
Gosh, why?

673
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:33,639
Life was exhausting and tough.

674
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:35,400
I wanted to kill myself anyway.

675
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:38,039
"Great. Go ahead. Shoot me now."

676
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:40,610
"If you don't shoot, I will.
I will shoot my head off."

677
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,480
"What are guns for?"

678
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,349
Then the robber begged me...

679
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:48,820
not to kill myself...

680
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,750
because if I died, he would be a murderer.

681
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,619
That's how I survived in America.

682
00:45:54,989 --> 00:45:57,389
I risked my life, so I made money.

683
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,099
At first, I worked because I needed money.

684
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:01,730
But later on, when I made enough money,

685
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,530
I was just playing games.

686
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,340
Money wasn't the goal.
It became a means for me to enjoy my work.

687
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,969
So did you enjoy your work?

688
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:16,949
Yes. Before I met you.

689
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:21,519
Are you saying
you're not happy because of me?

690
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:22,679
No.

691
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,889
I used to be a fool
who only knew about money games,

692
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:29,659
but I finally learned about true love.

693
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,860
So I want more now.

694
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:34,760
You'd never loved anyone else?

695
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,570
No women.

696
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:38,630
What about you?

697
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,400
There was a man I liked.

698
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:46,239
I even proposed to him first.

699
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:52,849
I finally got his answer
after three years.

700
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:58,889
His answer was that
he wanted to stay as colleagues...

701
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:02,219
and friends. That was it.

702
00:47:04,429 --> 00:47:06,559
To put it simply, I was rejected.

703
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:11,900
So I changed my mind.

704
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:16,969
I told myself that I should move on
and that I was over him a thousand times.

705
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:19,679
But...

706
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:24,449
But?

707
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:28,849
when I see him,

708
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:33,789
a small part of me still gets butterflies.

709
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,929
I'm sorry, Dong Hyuk.

710
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,699
I...

711
00:47:49,269 --> 00:47:52,610
don't think
I'm ready to date other people yet.

712
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,179
A shadow.

713
00:47:57,309 --> 00:47:59,550
You're in the shadow of love, Jin Young.

714
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:10,460
Perhaps.

715
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:15,360
- Anyway...
- If you need time, I can wait for you.

716
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:18,500
I just hope you won't take too long.

717
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:24,909
Happy birthday.

718
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:36,590
Thank you, Dong Hyuk.

719
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:52,170
Gosh. This is tough.

720
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:54,440
You're a man. You're giving up
after blowing a few balloons?

721
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,599
Finish these too.

722
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,070
Hey, where's Jung Sik?

723
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,710
The bathroom. His feet stank pretty badly.
I told him to wash his feet.

724
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:02,980
What's this coffee? It smells great.

725
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,610
- It does smell great.
- Yes.

726
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:05,849
Is it because they are coffee beans?

727
00:49:05,849 --> 00:49:07,750
These aren't coffee beans.
They are green coffee beans.

728
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,550
Do you want a cup of coffee, chef?

729
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:10,820
Sure. Give me a cup.

730
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,289
- Me too.
- Sure.

731
00:49:12,289 --> 00:49:15,420
I'm coming. All right.
Here comes room service.

732
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:17,590
Hey, you should blow some balloons too.

733
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:20,260
Okay. Mi Hee, my feet smell okay. Right?

734
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:22,460
I can still smell them.

735
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,469
All right.

736
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,900
You call that a cake?

737
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:29,039
Are you sure you work at our hotel?

738
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:31,440
It's just for our party.
This is good enough.

739
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,969
You poured all the sugar,

740
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,380
and your decoration is all crooked.

741
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:35,840
Your career is over.

742
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:38,849
Hey, she's here. Turn off the lights.

743
00:49:38,849 --> 00:49:41,719
- Bring the cake here.
- Don't step on that.

744
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:44,849
- Where are the firecrackers?
- Here you go.

745
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:45,849
- Move.
- Gosh.

746
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:47,090
- You told me to turn them off.
- Hey.

747
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:48,619
Light the candles.

748
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,559
- Sit down. Hurry.
- Hurry.

749
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:54,599
- Hey, you're ready. Right?
- Sit down.

750
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:55,730
I'll turn it off.

751
00:49:59,769 --> 00:50:00,900
Why isn't she coming in?

752
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,440
Turn on the light. It's Han Tae Jun.

753
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:06,239
Besides, who rings the bell
when they enter their own house?

754
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:08,110
- Right.
- Gosh.

755
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:10,309
Jung Sik, go and be on the lookout.

756
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:11,349
Okay.

757
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,010
- I got excited about nothing.
- Gosh.

758
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,119
- You're here.
- Hey. Sorry, I'm late.

759
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:16,119
- You're here.
- You're here.

760
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:18,949
No, it's okay. The birthday girl
hasn't come home either.

761
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:20,289
Where is she?

762
00:50:20,289 --> 00:50:22,320
I have no idea. Her cell phone is off too.

763
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:24,489
She'll come home when it's time.

764
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:26,860
All right.
Let's play Go-Stop while we wait for her.

765
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,329
- Shall we?
- But where's Manager Lee Soon Jung?

766
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:32,730
- I'm not sure.
- I'm not sure either.

767
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:01,500
Yes, this is Lee Soon Jung.

768
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,469
Ms. Lee. This is Han Tae Jun.

769
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:05,570
I'm sorry.

770
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:08,369
It was hectic when I was rushing out,
so I forgot that you were waiting for me.

771
00:51:09,139 --> 00:51:10,539
You forgot?

772
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,010
Because it was hectic?

773
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:16,110
You forgot
when I was waiting for you all night?

774
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:19,750
How could you forget about me? How...

775
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,420
How could you...

776
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:24,750
break my delicate heart?

777
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:29,219
You could have forgotten
about a million things but me.

778
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:34,059
I don't want your apology.

779
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:37,230
Haven't you watched the movie,
"Love Story?"

780
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:41,440
"Love means
never having to say you're sorry."

781
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,150
I watched that movie too, Soon Jung.

782
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,219
Did you get stood up for your date today?

783
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:18,510
Well, do you want to watch a movie?

784
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,440
Go away, you hyena!

785
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,329
- What? She's not answering her phone?
- No.

786
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:48,940
Oh, no. She must be really upset.

787
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:51,010
Angry Manager Lee
isn't good for a lot of people.

788
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:53,739
The housekeepers
will have a tough day tomorrow.

789
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:55,980
Gosh. It will be tough
for Room Service too.

790
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,949
How could you forget that
she was waiting for you?

791
00:52:57,949 --> 00:52:59,650
Right. What should I do?

792
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:02,920
What choice do you have?
Beg for her forgiveness tomorrow.

793
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,719
Profusely apologizing is the best way
to make up for a mistake.

794
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:07,690
She's coming. Manager Seo is coming up.

795
00:53:07,989 --> 00:53:10,329
- Really?
- I saw her get out of a car just now.

796
00:53:10,329 --> 00:53:11,329
- Get ready.
- Hurry.

797
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:13,360
Get the firecrackers.

798
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,030
- Where did I put them?
- Hey, light the candles.

799
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,469
Gosh. You're making this place dusty.
Calm down and find the cards for Go-Stop.

800
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:28,210
Chef, please be patient.
We can play Go-Stop another time.

801
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:31,510
Be quiet!

802
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,570
Thank you for today.

803
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,670
I had a delicious dinner, thanks to you.

804
00:53:57,539 --> 00:53:58,909
I had a good time.

805
00:54:08,449 --> 00:54:09,579
Well,

806
00:54:10,349 --> 00:54:13,559
this is my unit.

807
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:17,789
Shouldn't you invite me inside
and offer me some tea...

808
00:54:17,789 --> 00:54:19,489
for escorting you home?

809
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:20,699
Pardon?

810
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,869
Well, not yet. I mean...

811
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:26,940
No. I...

812
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:30,170
Well,

813
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:33,039
I'm living with one of my juniors.

814
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:34,440
This junior of mine
also works at the hotel.

815
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:38,250
I mean, of course.

816
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,179
She's a woman too.

817
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,920
I was only teasing you.

818
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:47,920
I came up to make sure
you got home safely.

819
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:50,329
You should go inside.

820
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:52,389
Okay. Bye.

821
00:54:57,429 --> 00:54:58,599
My keys...

822
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:07,210
Oh, my.

823
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,440
No. Not yet. Give it a bit more time.

824
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:35,869
Goodnight.

825
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,050
Get your hands off her!

826
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:16,239
But I know that you and that girl...

827
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:18,369
- Watch your tongue, Oh Hyung Man!
- Get your hands off me!

828
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:21,280
Don't talk about her like that.
