00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,190
Are you Ms. Yoon Dong Sook's guardian?

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,129
- Yes.
- She was just moved to a ward.

5
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:24,660
Thank you.

6
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,009
You must've heard.

7
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:45,149
Yes.

8
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,020
I didn't want to let anyone know.

9
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,729
Let's go to another hospital
and get it checked again.

10
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:57,399
Or should I contact hospitals in the US?

11
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,399
They have a lot of hospitals
that specialize in cancer.

12
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,570
Don't waste your effort on it.

13
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:04,599
I'm fine...

14
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:07,409
as it is.

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,549
Let's go back to the hotel.

16
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,079
You can't.

17
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,780
You need to stay here
and get treated for the time being.

18
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,920
Mr. Han.

19
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:28,689
I'm the one
who wants to live more than anyone else.

20
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,159
If I had just one percent chance
of living,

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,469
I wouldn't have given up on living.

22
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,040
Whether it's possible or not,
we should try everything we can.

23
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,579
I don't want...

24
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:48,079
to hang onto it pathetically
until the end.

25
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:49,950
I'm going to die anyway.

26
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:58,459
How you live your life is important,

27
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,359
but I think how you die is important too.

28
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,270
I don't want to get stuck
in the hospital getting radiotherapy...

29
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,469
and trying hard...

30
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:13,870
until my last breath.

31
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:20,310
Even if I'm given only one day,
I want to be in a comfortable place...

32
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,349
with the people I like.

33
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,520
- Ms. Yoon.
- I really want to do that.

34
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:29,120
It's my wish.

35
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:41,370
What happened today...

36
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,800
I want it to be a secret...

37
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,240
between you and me.

38
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:52,479
And Young Jae...

39
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,750
He'll be devastated to find out
about this...

40
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,590
because he's still young.

41
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,729
He's impetuous,

42
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,360
but actually,

43
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:14,969
he's very kind and soft-hearted.

44
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,400
I know that.

45
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:26,039
I...

46
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,650
If possible,

47
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,620
I want to keep it a secret from him...

48
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,020
about my condition until I die.

49
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,090
And...

50
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:41,960
Mr. Han, even after I die,

51
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,360
can you take care...

52
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:48,500
of Young Jae like his brother?

53
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,340
You can do that, right?

54
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:55,770
Can you promise?

55
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,750
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,490
I keep asking you for difficult favors.

00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,089
Kids like stuff like this. Buy them one.

61
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,589
As you can see, the handle was designed...

62
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:48,730
with much care
so it won't hurt kids' hands...

63
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,360
even if they touch it.

64
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,560
How much is it?

65
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,230
It's 37 dollars.

66
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,670
It's too expensive.

67
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,069
It's not, sir.

68
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:57,769
Kids love it that much too.

69
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,870
If you buy the bicycle,
you can get a special gift too.

70
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,910
Take this.

00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,279
What are you doing?

72
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,079
Keep quiet, Eun Joo.

73
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,649
Kids love this too.

74
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:10,620
It has a funny sound.

75
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,649
We're giving it for free
because it's a promotion period.

76
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,250
Would you like to pay by card?

77
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,189
No, I'll pay by cash.

78
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:19,360
Eun Joo, help him with the payment.

79
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:20,589
Okay.

80
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,759
Hello?

81
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,269
Yes, I'm at Eun Joo's store.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,129
In front?

83
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,939
Okay, wait for a while.

84
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,540
Thank you. Have a nice day.

85
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,670
Thank you.

86
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,509
Do you learn things like that
at the hotel too?

87
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,810
You become like this
when you deal with all sorts of customers.

88
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,319
See you. Young Jae is waiting for me.

89

Hey, since you're here, help me sell more!

90
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
That brat.

91
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:49,579
If she kept preventing you
from working at the hotel,

92
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,420
I was going to quit too.

93
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,850
It's something you want
to do so desperately.

94
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,720
If you couldn't do it
and I couldn't protect you,

95
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,360
I wanted to go all out
and did whatever I wanted.

96
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,129
Actually,

97
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,600
I was going to quit.

98
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,769
Why?

99
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,209
A lot of people seemed
to be having a hard time...

100
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:20,009
because I was working at Seoul Hotel.

101
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,649
And my father kept telling me
to go study abroad.

102
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,350
But...

103
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:29,889
when Ms. Yoon told me to continue working
at the hotel,

104
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:32,589
it made my heart ache even more.

105
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,360
What's there for you to feel that way?
It's just a whim of an old woman.

106
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,459
She always changes her mind.

107
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,370
Your mom is very thoughtful.

108
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,899
She's very miserly too.

109
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,670
She doesn't even give me
pocket money often.

110
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,310
Did you know that my father
and your mom knew each other...

111
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:57,519
since they were young?

112
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,220
I did hear about it briefly,
but I don't really know.

113
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:05,220
My father
and your father used to be friends.

114
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,829
So your mom might have married...

115
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:10,899
my father.

116
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,699
That's right.

117
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,930
Then you and I could've become siblings.

118
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,800
That's not right.

119
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,170
Then I would've been born somewhere else.

120
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:27,079
It's fascinating
how people meet each other.

121
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:28,910
That thing called fate.

122
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,179
Does destiny really exist?

123
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,850
I don't believe in destinies.

124
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,029
Relationships that are not meant to be
don't work out no matter what you do.

125
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:47,899
Are you talking about Tae Jun?

126
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,899
Do you feel like
you've become a servant again?

127
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,039
Yes.

128
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:04,950
Here.

129
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,690
Forget it. It will become a habit.

130
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,289
Hey, Yoon Hee.

131
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,110
Did you try it in the US?

132
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,840
- Shaved ice?
- Yes.

133
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,879
No.

134
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,679
This reminds me of when I was young.

135
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,620
This is different from ice creams
in the US.

136
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,549
I find this more delicious.

137
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:44,090
It's fun to mix fruits and red beans.

138
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,220
Yes. I was reminded of shaved ice
in summer too.

139
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,830
You must like cooking.

140
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,799
Yes.
That's why I got a job in the kitchen.

141
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,529
With Tae Jun's help, of course.

142
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,600
Jin Young treats me well too.

143
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,870
Jin Young, is that you?

144
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:04,309
Is Jin Young home?

145
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,610
We have a guest.

146
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,190
Hello.

147
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,419
Hi.

148
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,759
Right. Sit on the sofa and wait.

149
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,929
I'll make delicious shaved ice for you.

150
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,529
Okay. Thank you, Jenny.

151
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,950
Yes. What are you doing?
You're still not home.

152
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,419
Tae Jun?

153
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,690
I can only hand over the work
when you come.

154
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,990
How can you not get in touch
without saying anything?

155
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,559
I'm sorry that I couldn't call,
but something happened.

156
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,029
It was very urgent.

157
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,330
You don't need to know that.
Get off work first.

158
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,200
How can I go and empty the desk?

159
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,139
Forget it.
I have an important appointment.

160
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:44,740
I'm supposed to meet an important person.

161
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,740
What?

162
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,909
That person will be waiting for you
at home.

163
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,250
So come quickly.

164
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:52,379
I'll go back soon.

165
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,190
Okay.

166
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:56,690
I'm here to see Jenny.

167
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,389
There's no need to pressure Jin Young.

168
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:02,029
I can clearly imagine her fidgeting
at the desk.

169
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,429
She won't leave the hotel
unless I go back.

170
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,429
Is everyone as serious as her?

171
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,370
Or is Jin Young exceptionally attached
to the hotel?

172
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,370
I don't know
why you're asking such a question.

173
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,039
It's as it sounds.

174
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,210
Did Ms. Seo beg you...

175
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,679
to keep the hotel running?

176
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,980
She didn't beg.

177
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,419
She just asked.

178
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,759
Is your plan going
to change because of that?

179
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:38,830
If you think of giving up on the hotel
because of a woman,

180
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:41,070
that'll be very surprising.

181
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,529
I didn't say that.

182
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,169
You didn't say that,
but I get the feeling...

183
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:46,440
Rather than my feeling,

184
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:48,909
I can smell it.

185
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:51,179
Are you anxious
that you might win by default?

186
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:52,940
If you surrender, I'll accept it,

187
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,409
but you better not think
about making any shady deal.

188
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,679
Why do you think that I have a reason
to make a shady deal?

189
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,220
Let us both not get soft-hearted.

190
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,490
You attacked me first,

191
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,559
and the issue between Jenny and me,

192
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,490
and the golf range incident.

193
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,190
We exchanged this and that.

194
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,259
So it's hard to control my expressions.

195
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But the essence
of the problem doesn't change.

196
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,570
I think so too.

197
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,570
That's good to hear.

198
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,379
Jenny.
How many bowls of shaved ice did you make?

199
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,379
Three bowls. Why? Do you want more?

200
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:32,580
No. Three of you enjoy it
when Jin Young comes.

201
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,590
I'll excuse myself.

202
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:38,159
Eat this before you go, Mister.

203
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,120
It's okay.
I can't leave the hotel for too long.

204
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,389
Enjoy.

205
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,669
- You can get off work now.
- Thank you.

206
00:13:57,409 --> 00:13:58,480
Ms. Seo.

207
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,580
What brings you all the way here?

208
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,320
Because I didn't want to waste
any minute waiting for you.

209
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:10,590
Tae Jun must be feeling uncomfortable
with me.

210
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,220
Don't you feel the same way too?

211
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:14,929
I don't.

212
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:18,799
I never had friends,
so I don't know how to make friends.

213
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,870
But I keep getting drawn to Tae Jun.

214
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,700
Do men feel that too?

215
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,200
Of course.

216
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,440
It's a slightly different matter,
but when choosing a business partner,

217
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,210
there are some people
you're personally more drawn toward...

218
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,379
under the same condition.

219
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,950
Do you sign the contract then?

220
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:38,179
Not exactly.

221
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,590
Humanism and money aren't close.

222
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,149
It's frightening.

223
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:48,059
Could I have a meal with Tae Jun one day?

224
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,429
You can.

225
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:51,100
Can you tell him?

226
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:52,659
Sure.

227
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,940
Jin Young,
you must find Tae Jun comfortable.

228
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:02,210
We're...

229
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,409
We're just friends. That's why.

230
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:10,809
It didn't seem that way to me.

231
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,429
The shadow of Tae Jun might've disappeared
from you,

232
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:25,960
but it's a different story for Tae Jun.

233
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:28,929
- I don't think...
- I'm sure.

234
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,039
After crossing a river called a hotel,

235
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,340
a mountain called Tae Jun is blocking me.

236
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:41,009
Of course,
the path I'm going to walk is decided.

237
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,299
Boss, what are you doing?

238
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,070
Do you know
how much that document is worth?

239
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:12,379
I don't need them anymore.

240
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:13,840
They're just like tissues.

241
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,250
Just why do you want to buy the shares
of Seoul Hotel?

242
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,779
I can't let the overseas hotel chain
take over.

243
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,519
Chairman Kim is overplaying himself.
I need to stop him.

244
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,519
No matter what Chairman Kim does,

245
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,320
we just need
to do what the client wants...

246
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,159
and benefit from it.

247
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:29,830
I want to protect Seoul Hotel.

248
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,429
"Protect Seoul Hotel?"

249
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,629
Is it because of that woman?

250
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,570
You're determined to go under.

251
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:42,039
You're struggling to go bankrupt.

252
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:44,039
I'm sorry, Leo.

253
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,710
If you wanted to quit,
you should've done so long ago.

254
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,379
What am I supposed to do now?

255
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:51,679
Do you know how much we need to spend?

256
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:56,250
I'll spend all the money I have.

257
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,220
I'll sell all my villas and yacht
in Santa Monica and San Diego.

258
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:01,529
Sell all of them and buy the shares
of Seoul Hotel.

259
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,859
You must've completely lost it, Dong Hyuk.

260
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,160
I worked for you for ten years
with my trust in you.

261
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,900
But you want to become a beggar
because of a woman?

262
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,440
How can you do this to me?

263
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,410
Was our ten years of friendship...

264
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,509
so petty and useless to you?

265
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:20,839
If I sell all my properties,

266
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,509
you won't lose a single dollar.

267
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,309
Do you think I'm saying this
because of money?

268
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,849
It means that's all you thought of me.

269
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,589
The document you ripped apart...

270
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:31,359
has ten years of our future on the line.

271
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:33,089
And you threw it away...

272
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,190
without discussing a word with me?

273
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:37,660
You made me a puppet...

274
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,359
by not telling me anything...

275
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,059
and throwing away everything.

276
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:44,470
Let me say this again.

277
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,670
I'm sorry, Leo.

278
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:50,069
You're not my boss now.

279
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,779
Sell your condominium or your soul.

280
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:54,950
Do whatever you want!

281
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,500
Ms. Lee, aren't you getting off work?

282
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,569
I have some work left. Go first.

283
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,730
Okay.

284
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,430
- See you.
- Bye.

285
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:20,940
- Hello.
- Hi.

286
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,920
I smell Kilimanjaro.

287
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,049
- A leopard?
- No, a hyena.

288
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:42,529
Gosh, what are you doing?

289
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:44,390
Let's stop being foolish.

290
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,069
Hyung Man, you're scaring me.

291
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:50,529
Hiding our feelings
and playing push-and-pull like kids.

292
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,839
I'm tired of it now.

293
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:55,309
Since we've worked together
for a long time,

294
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,440
you must know everything.
So why are you doing this?

295
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,779
What do I know?

296
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,210
No matter how tough working
at the hotel was,

297
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:06,519
I took comfort...

298
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:10,319
in your occasional smiles
and cute behaviors.

299
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:12,960
Imagine how hard it must be for me...

300
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,230
if you shut your heart
and whine like this.

301
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,400
You're going way too overboard.

302
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,829
I know how you feel, so don't hide it.

303
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,269
You can't hide from me.

304
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:25,869
Hide what?

305
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,440
What am I hiding?

306
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:29,410
Loneliness.

307
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,339
What did you say?

308
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,809
See?

309
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:39,619
Don't put up a front in front of me now.

310
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:40,779
Don't come near.

311
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,319
I'm going to scream.

312
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:44,190
Soon Jung. Look straight into my eyes.

313
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,279
Hyung Man, don't do this.

314
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,049
I don't want this.

315
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,859
One day, you'll realize my feelings.

316
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,960
Until then, I won't touch you.

317
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,720
Yes, Lee Soon Jung of Housekeeping.

318
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,359
Pardon? Where?

319
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,400
I first met him...

320
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,930
when he was 22 or so.

321
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:04,839
He suddenly came to find me...

322
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,509
and said, "Leo, how much do you need
for you to work for me?"

323
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:10,210
So I said,

324
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,710
"Fifty-fifty."

325
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,210
- Half each.
- Yes.

326
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,549
Then he put down 70 dollars and said,

327
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:21,490
"It's 50 percent of the money I earned
from my first stock trading today."

328
00:21:21,589 --> 00:21:24,390
He knew how to earn money since then.

329
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:27,359
Think about it. A 22-year-old brat...

330
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,029
hired a skilled lawyer
from an American law firm...

331
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:32,960
for just 70 dollars.

332
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,829
Did Dong Hyuk buy roses back then too?

333
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:38,740
I'm not talking about roses.

334
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:40,039
Fine. Continue.

335
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:44,640
Since then, we hit it off really well
for the past ten years.

336
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,640
Wall Street called us...

337
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,650
"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."

338
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:50,910
What's that?

339
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:53,819
You know the movie.

340
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:56,650
The movie that starred Paul Newman
and Robert Redford.

341
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,220
Raindrops keep falling on my head

342
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,859
You should tell me the Korean title.

343
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:04,089
Anyway, he only knew about work...

344
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,759
without getting sidetracked.

345
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,599
But now, he's head over heels for a woman,

346
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:11,230
saying he doesn't want the work or money.

347
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,569
Your boss is so cool.

348
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,670
How is he cool?

349
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,240
He's mentally ill.

350
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,809
That's because you don't know romance.

351
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:21,950
You're exactly like how you look.

352
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,009
What?

353
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:27,750
Thanks to people like Windsor
who threw away his crown for love,

354
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,450
this world is beautiful.

355
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,960
Goodness. Windson fell for Simpson
because Simpson hit on him.

356
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,759
Love and romance are ridiculous.

357
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,359
You act exactly like how you look, mister.

358
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,099
Don't call me a mister, old lady.

359
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,200
Who are you calling an old lady?
I'm a maiden.

360
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,640
Do you have a notarization...

361
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,769
from an attorney saying you're a maiden?

362
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:50,809
My gosh.

363
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:00,250
Why did you tell me to come here
if you were going to behave this way?

364
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,089
Why did you call a busy person here
to insult her?

365
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:14,230
I'm sorry. Wipe with this.

366
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,730
Hello.

367
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:21,869
Did you get a girlfriend?

368
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:24,779
I thought so,

369
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:27,240
but apparently not.

370
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,609
A glass of martini, please. Leo?

371
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,650
I still have my beer left.

372
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,890
- I...
- I'm sorry.

373
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,420
He and I have something to talk about.

374
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,819
Okay, go ahead.

375
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:38,890
I'll listen.

376
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,319
He's asking you to excuse us.

377
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,759
My gosh.

378
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,829
I'm sorry to intrude.

379
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:47,900
It's okay.

380
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,400
Right. Don't ever call me again.

381
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,670
Even if I call you again, don't come out.

382
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,500
I've never said this before.

383
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,130
I...

384
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,940
never relied on anyone
as much as I did on you.

385
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:36,880
You were the only person
who accepted my bad temper.

386
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,049
You were also the only person
who understood my past...

387
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:44,589
of being abandoned by my father
and my ugly pride.

388
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,160
I treated you however I liked...

389
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,059
because you felt like
a father and a brother to me.

390
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,700
I'm very sorry.

391
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,269
I have nobody.

392
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,640
You're the only true friend I have.

393
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:12,779
Please give your blessing...

394
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,450
to Jin Young and me, Leo.

395
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,680
I made some rice balls.

396
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,750
It should be better than sandwiches.

397
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,980
Even if you're busy,
make sure to eat breakfast, Dong Hyuk.

398
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:22,119
From Jenny.

399
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,230
I'm just saying you should meet him
for a meal without feeling burdened...

400
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,099
since he helped you last time.

401
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:37,200
Ms. Seo.

402
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,039
The number is different
from what housekeepers counted.

403
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,240
Just a moment.

404
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,210
He did help you.

405
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,410
Why are you acting like a jerk?
Are you scared?

406
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:49,579
- Ms. Seo, they're in a hurry.
- Okay.

407
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:50,710
Come see me.

408
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,119
Yes, it's a duel. Come right now.

409
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,789
How can I help you, ma'am?

410
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,269
Why did you call me during working hours?
I'm busy.

411
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,940
This is important too, Tae Jun.

412
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:14,569
How is the person on duty having a meal
with a guest important?

413
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,809
Dong Hyuk is different.

414
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:19,079
To you, he's different,
but he's just a guest to me.

415
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:20,710
Sometimes, he's an enemy.

416
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,579
Dong Hyuk changed.

417
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:23,980
And when that incident happened,

418
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,049
he had a really hard time carrying you.

419
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:27,950
I'm not as heavy as you think.

420
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,619
He shouldn't have had a hard time.

421
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,789
He took you to the hospital in his car
and dealt with the procedures too.

422
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:35,759
Tell him to claim the oil
and hospital fees.

423
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:36,990
Goodness.

424
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,859
Why are you so twisted?

425
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,170
I've already made an appointment.

426
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:43,430
Am I supposed to eat alone?

427
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:46,170
Did you make a reservation?

428
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,369
Yes. I reserved a VIP room.

429
00:27:49,369 --> 00:27:50,710
I'll pay.

430
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:52,940
I don't want
to see him showing off his money.

431
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,849
Of course you should pay
because you owe him.

432
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,220
- Hey, Jin Young.
- Yes?

433
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:03,420
Sometimes, you feel like a tag.

434
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:05,789
- A tag?
- Yes.

435
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:09,130
Like the plane tag stuck
on your luggage...

436
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:12,359
from your trip.

437
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,230
What does that mean?

438
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:16,599
You're a tag...

439
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:19,000
that is unnecessary...

440
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:20,900
but you don't want to remove it...

441
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,640
because the memories of the trip
might disappear.

442
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,680
I heard the luggage might end up elsewhere
if you don't remove the tag.

443
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,109
Does that happen often?

444
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,680
It happens in the US sometimes.

445
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:31,349
Then what happens?

446
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,349
The airline will find it for you, right?

447
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,319
They do most of the time,
but it takes about a month.

448
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,349
Sometimes, they don't come back at all.

449
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,319
Did that happen to you too, Dong Hyuk?

450
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:43,230
Just once.

451
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,529
I was on my way from New York
to Las Vegas.

452
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,000
My luggage came to Las Vegas,
then went back to New York.

453
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,440
Tae Jun, has that happened to you?

454
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,079
I didn't experience that
because I never checked in my luggage.

455
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,440
Do you like traveling?

456
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,349
Yes.

457
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,410
Have you been to Europe?

458
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,049
No.

459
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,349
Then where did you normally go?

460
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:10,549
Fishing spots.

461
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,730
Mr. Han, you're rather quiet today.

462
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:24,430
Actually, I wanted to see you
to tell you about my new approach...

463
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,839
to the hotel.

464
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,970
From now on,
I'm not a managing director anymore.

465
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:31,410
I'll become a shareholder of Seoul Hotel.

466
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,480
The work is not over yet, but...

467
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,619
The enemy who was shooting at me
is suddenly saying he's on my side.

468
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,390
I can't tell if it's true or a scam.

469
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,930
Mr. Han, the word "scam" is inappropriate.

470
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,230
Then what happens to the game?

471
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:01,000
What do you mean, Tae Jun?

472
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:04,809
Excuse me.

473
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:19,390
You're leaving already?

474
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,690
I felt a bit stuffed.

475
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,759
I don't think
there's enough oxygen inside.

476
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,059
How can a hotel general manager
dislike that kind of atmosphere?

477
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,069
Are you okay, Yoon Hee?

478
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:32,599
It's about time you get tired.

479
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,099
Once I set my mind on something,
I don't change easily.

480
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:38,609
Tell me anytime
if you find anything difficult or tough.

481
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,309
It's okay.

482
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,980
There's one.

483
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,779
What is it? Tell me.

484
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,650
Next time, one day,

485
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,519
I want to have a meal with you
in a good restaurant too.

486
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,720
Call me whenever you're hungry.

487
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,589
I'll reserve the best seats.

488
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:59,000
No, just the two of us.

489
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,900
Just once will do.

490
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,900
You have to accept my invitation.

491
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,710
Just once, the two of us.

492
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,019
Since it's a lunch plan,
he should be back soon.

493
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,990
Why don't you wait inside?

494
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:27,690
It's okay. The weather's nice too.

495
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:37,269
You should exercise too.

496
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:40,240
I still look like this
even though I exercise every day.

497
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,069
That's just how my DNA is.

498
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:44,440
You're blaming it on your ancestors.

499
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:48,380
Don't say that and hit two boxes
of balls or so per day at my golf range.

500
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,250
That's how you lose your belly fat.

501
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,819
Will my stomach become like this?

502
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:56,650
Leo.

503
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,390
I have something...

504
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,289
to talk to you personally.

505
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:12,369
For the last 30 years as a businessman,

506
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,410
I earned a fortune and avoided death
with my gut feelings alone.

507
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,279
And?

508
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:22,380
Are you getting a bad feeling?

509
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:28,619
People like you can't lie.

510
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:33,190
You're naturally kind,
so you can't harm others.

511
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,160
You're mistaken.

512
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,359
If that was true,
I should've quit my job as a lawyer.

513
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:53,779
I already knew Frank had another plan.

514
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:59,720
See? You can't lie.

515
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:05,559
Well, he must have a lot on his mind.

516
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:08,019
There's no need to have a lot on his mind.
Business is simple.

517
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,359
It's either O or X.

518
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,069
Since some time ago,
Frank started drawing an X.

519
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,369
I don't like that.

520
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,339
Do you have anything to ask me to do?

521
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:27,680
You're a cut above Frank.

522
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,150
I want to exercise
and talk about business with you.

523
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,619
- I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
- It's okay.

524
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:42,930
I lost track of time listening
to Leo talk...

525
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,430
about a blonde beauty in the US.

526
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,630
Did you read the document I sent
in the morning?

527
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:50,630
I have poor eyesight nowadays.

528
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,839
"Termination letter." Is that right?

529
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:55,970
Yes.

530
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,740
I personally feel sorry,
but I have no other choice.

531
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:00,940
Including the foreign capital inflow...

532
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,309
and selling stocks
to an overseas hotel chain,

533
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,980
I will stop working on everything
that has to do...

534
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:08,349
with the merger and acquisition
of Seoul Hotel starting today.

535
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,389
Leo will handle the return
of the contract deposit...

536
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:15,059
and claim for damage neatly.

537
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,429
- Why?
- I cannot accept...

538
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,300
your illegal and unreasonable way...

539
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,559
of doing business anymore.

540
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:27,800
With whose permission?

541
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:31,710
You're so uncool.

542
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,739
"Do you like traveling?" "Yes."

543
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,179
"Have you been to Europe?" "No."

544
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,710
"Where did you go?" "Fishing spots."

545
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,949
I told him truthfully.

546
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,349
Why are you doing this to Dong Hyuk?

547
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:44,719
Do you need to act so lousy
in front of him?

548
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,320
- Am I lousy?
- Of course.

549
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,829
As the hotel's general manager
and my friend,

550
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:51,989
it would've been nice
if you acted stylish and refined.

551
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,059
I'm so embarrassed.

552
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:54,829
Are you embarrassed of me?

553
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:56,969
Of course I am. You acted that way
when you invited him for a meal.

554
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,530
I didn't invite him.

555
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,840
Who invited him is not important.

556
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:02,769
I paid for the meal,
so why are you nagging?

557
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:05,579
Gosh. Did Dong Hyuk not pay
because he didn't have the money?

558
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:08,280
He just stayed seated awkwardly
because you acted so stiff.

559
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:10,610
Was I supposed to let him pay too?

560
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,780
Since he invited you,

561
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,190
it would've been nice to step back
and save his face.

562
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:18,650
I'm getting blamed when I paid.

563
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:22,429
I'm very sorry that I'm not refined
or stylish.

564
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:25,500
I want to die because I made you
feel embarrassed. Happy now?

565
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:28,030
Gosh, look at your temper.

566
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,369
I played second fiddle
to the guy you liked.

567
00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:33,739
What more do you want?

568
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,840
Why do you think you played second fiddle?

569
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:38,940
Are you that unhappy
about him helping the hotel?

570
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:43,909
- Did you make a deal with him?
- What deal?

571
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,380
Saving Seoul Hotel in return
for giving you to him.

572
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,590
I'll hit you.

573
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,070
I'm glad you turned down my proposal.

574
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,099
If we got married,
we would've stayed up the night fighting.

575
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,869
- Jin Young.
- What?

576
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:14,210
You might be fine with spitting out
what happened in the past,

577
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,610
but they could be precious memories
for me.

578
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,250
So don't ruin my fantasy...

579
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:24,920
and watch out.

580
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,159
Clean this before you leave.

581
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,769
Gosh.

582
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,980
You won't eat dinner at home?
Where are you going?

583
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,320
I'm meeting my friends.

584
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,219
You're going to eat out anyway.

585
00:36:56,389 --> 00:36:58,489
Have you still not resigned
from Seoul Hotel?

586
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:02,559
Ms. Yoon said I could continue to work.

587
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:06,230
Why does she keep changing her mind?
It hurts her pride.

588
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,230
She's warm-hearted.

589
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,269
Warm-hearted, my foot.

590
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:13,269
She's uncool and cold.

591
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,039
Still, you took a picture of her
because you liked her.

592
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,579
What? What picture?

593
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,139
I saw it.

594
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:25,619
The black-and-white picture you took
of Ms. Yoon in an orchard.

595
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:26,980
She must've become senile.

596
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,750
Why would she show that to kids?

597
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:30,449
I'm not a kid, Father.

598
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:33,960
When you took a picture of her
because you liked her,

599
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,320
you were my age.

600
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,559
They're all useless stories.

601
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:38,960
Seoul Hotel will be gone soon.

602
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,860
Just go study overseas, as I told you.

603
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,929
Mr. Jung.

604
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,900
Yes, sir.

605
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,500
This is the document
for your studies abroad.

606
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,739
I booked the flight ticket
for the Saturday after next, so get ready.

607
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:54,539
It's too soon.
You didn't even give me time to prepare.

608
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,010
I prepared everything for you.

609
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,949
You just need to go.

610
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,949
Forget about everything
that happened here.

611
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,550
Both Seoul Hotel and Tae Jun.
Do you understand?

612
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:07,119
What will happen to Seoul Hotel?

613
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,329
Don't mind it. You just need to go...

614
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,460
and study what you like.

615
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,599
- Answer it.
- Yes, sir.

616
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:18,400
Hello?

617
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,239
Yes.

618
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,769
It's the Prosecutors' Office, sir.

619
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:26,010
Yes, Kim Bok Man speaking.

620
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:30,079
That's right.
I collected all the evidence.

621
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:32,679
Tomorrow morning...

622
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:36,650
Yes, I'll send them to you right now.

623
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:41,289
That's right. I'll sue him right away.
Thank you in advance.

624
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:45,429
We need to get rid
of people like him completely.

625
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,429
Yes, please take good care of it.

626
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:54,139
Mr. Jung, you have his document, right?

627
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,710
Yes, it's in the car.

628
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,340
Take it to the prosecution immediately.

629
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,440
Drop Yoon Hee off on the way too.

630
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,710
I'll be at the golf range
after meeting CEO Lee.

631
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,710
Okay, sir.

632
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,449
I can go alone.

633
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:06,150
Go with him. It's late.

634
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,050
Quickly.

635
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,550
Let's go.

636
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:15,489
How long will you stay there?

637
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,329
It will take me a few years...

638
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:20,900
to master English
and study all hotel-related majors.

639
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:25,469
You won't be coming back
with a blue-eyed child, right?

640
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,440
Just thinking about it gives me chills.

641
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:30,039
What do we do with you, Young Jae?

642
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:34,940
If you're bored after Yoon Hee leaves,
call me. I'll accompany you.

643
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,780
No. I might go too.

644
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:41,349
Since I've had enough fun, I need to work.

645
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,250
If I'm going to learn hotel-related work,
I better follow Yoon Hee...

646
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,360
and learn properly.

647
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,989
You guys might cause trouble.

648
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,829
You need to stay with your mom.

649
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:51,130
Am I a child?

650
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,829
It's not because you're a child.

651
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,860
You can't leave her alone.

652
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,969
We don't have time to see each other
because she's so busy with the hotel work.

653
00:39:58,469 --> 00:39:59,739
Anyway, don't follow me.

654
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:03,110
Yoon Hee, that's going too far.

655
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:05,210
You're going to stop me from studying too?

656
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,340
Do you want me to stay as a bellboy
when you become a hotelier?

657
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:10,150
Hey. Young Jae must be angry.

658
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,309
You went too far with that.

659
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,420
When did you say you were leaving?

660
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,650
The Saturday after next.

661
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:17,349
Call me when you go to the airport.

662
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,719
What's this?

663
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:21,989
The document for studying overseas
and the flight ticket.

664
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:23,730
Where's the flight ticket?

665
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,829
Who is Frank Shin?

666
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:32,739
You idiot.

667
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:35,170
- Chairman Kim.
- This isn't something you can mix up!

668
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,570
Please save me!

669
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,070
You're so distracted
when you're still young.

670
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,280
Come here.

671
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,110
You didn't even make a copy
and gave the original document.

672
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,550
What kind of an idiot are you?

673
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,150
I'll get the document back right now!

674
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,750
- Find Yoon Hee right now.
- Yes, sir.

675
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,519
Find her, you punk!

676
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,750
- You punk!
- Goodness!

677
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,860
- Darn it!
- No!

678
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:55,829
You... You punk.

679
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,769
- Find her.
- Okay.

680
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,070
Right now!

681
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,139
You darn...

682
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,809
(Regarding Seoul Hotel
Merger and Acquisition)

683
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,710
(The two people mentioned above conducted
illegal actions while performing...)

684
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,349
(merger and acquisition of Seoul Hotel
as mentioned below.)

685
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,789
Will the Foreign Exchange law
be a problem too?

686
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,389
Forcibly speaking, yes.

687
00:41:31,929 --> 00:41:35,030
The Securities Exchange law is
more serious.

688
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:37,829
Do we follow Korean laws too?

689
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,400
Of course.

690
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,139
The act itself took place here.

691
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,480
Chairman Kim will get affected too.

692
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,349
He probably wanted to negotiate
with the prosecution.

693
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:52,750
He's planning to sell you out...

694
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,920
and escape himself
after paying a small amount of fine.

695
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:59,889
All the contracts are under your name,

696
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,219
and he left out
the representative contract...

697
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,329
we signed at first.

698
00:42:03,329 --> 00:42:05,590
He only collected the evidence against me.

699
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,030
I don't know about the content.

700
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,599
I brought it because it said
it was a document for your lawsuit...

701
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,800
on the cover.

702
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:18,269
I don't know if it will help.

703
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,980
It's not just helpful.

704
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:22,579
If the other party got hold of this
instead of me,

705
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,449
I would've been arrested.

706
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:27,750
Of course, we'll have to
go through a trial and find out,

707
00:42:29,019 --> 00:42:31,789
but I'll be driven to a corner
with this much information.

708
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:36,760
I want to know why you brought this to me.

709
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,730
You helped me out last time.

710
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,559
To work at Seoul Hotel.

711
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,300
Consider it as me repaying the debt now.

712
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,539
Will you be okay with your father?

713
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:53,110
I'm going to study overseas soon anyway.

714
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,480
What is he going to do?

715
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,550
What are you going to study?

716
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,309
Hotel management.

717
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,820
This is too big to be considered
as repaying the debt.

718
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:08,659
If there's something I can help with,
feel free to tell me.

719
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,489
There isn't.

720
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,829
Nothing?

721
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,929
Just one thing.

722
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:20,800
I don't know much,

723
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,840
but I know that your work is related
to Seoul Hotel.

724
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,949
Please help Tae Jun.

725
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:38,849
Can I go now?

726
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:41,190
Sure. Leo, can you drive her home?

727
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:43,329
It's okay. I came with my friends.

728
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,570
Yoon Hee.

729
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,039
Thank you.

730
00:44:06,449 --> 00:44:07,449
How is it?

731
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:10,119
Chairman Kim's secretaries are sloppy.

732
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,590
They should've looped in you only,

733
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:14,820
but there are traces
of Chairman Kim here and there.

734
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:18,559
As long as we attach
the representative contract we have,

735
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,659
Chairman Kim will be done for.

736
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:21,429
You said
this was the original copy, right?

737
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:23,829
Yes. They must be keeping a copy,

738
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:25,300
but it's not legally effective.

739
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,599
If we get rid of this, we'll be clean.

740
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:31,570
Hold on.

741
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:33,309
Turn it off, Leo.

742
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,050
Why?

743
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,480
This document is our shackle.

744
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:41,949
What will happen
if we take the bull by the horns?

745
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:45,320
- Legally?
- Yes.

746
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:47,519
In the worst case scenario,

747
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:50,059
we'll pay a small amount of fine
and get deported. That's it.

748
00:44:50,059 --> 00:44:51,260
That's really the worst.

749
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,900
Chairman Kim is a big shot
the Korean prosecution is interested in.

750
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,599
He's delicious prey in the eyes
of the National Tax Service.

751
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,099
You want to fight him?

752
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:03,710
I rightfully notified the termination
of the contract.

753
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:05,469
But he cowardly stabbed me in the back.

754
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:08,639
Show him that he'll get it back
a lot worse if he attacks us?

755
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,750
What will Chairman Kim do
when he finds out we have the document?

756
00:45:11,949 --> 00:45:14,320
I don't think he'll beg us
to return it to him.

757
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,579
Exactly.

758
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:20,190
He'll turn a blind eye
and try to dig out something else.

759
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:22,860
You're saying
if we're going to get attacked anyway,

760
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,760
we might as well
walk into the prosecution ourselves.

761
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,400
It's better
to get all the punishments first...

762
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,130
and put a strong shackle on Chairman Kim.

763
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,730
Chairman Kim isn't a pushover either.

764
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,940
Won't it be dangerous?

765
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,139
Wait for now.

766
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:41,210
He's very impatient,
so he won't just sit still.

767
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,650
I don't know why the creditors are trying
to kill off a hotel that's running well.

768
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:53,760
Look here.

769
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,559
We invest based on profit.

770
00:45:57,389 --> 00:46:00,500
There's a limit to adding money
in a bottomless pit.

771
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,360
We can't do more than this.

772
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,630
After two weeks,
the construction will be completed,

773
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,030
and we'll do the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

774
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,340
You'll be there to celebrate with us.

775
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,239
I don't like to come forward.

776
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:13,280
Then...

777
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:15,539
do you only like using fists behind?

778
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,010
What?

779
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:19,079
I'm not staying still
because I'm afraid...

780
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:20,320
of the note you're holding.

781
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,719
- Then?
- Consider it lucky...

782
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:24,590
that your daughter is working here.

783
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:26,389
Look here, Mr. Han.

784
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:33,659
I can break your ribs easily
whenever I want.

785
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:35,699
I'm sure you'll do it easily
since that's your specialty.

786
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:38,730
But the bones of Seoul Hotel are stronger
than you think.

787
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:41,000
Are they really?

788
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:45,269
You'll somehow stop the first bankruptcy,
but after that...

789
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,539
Tell your CEO...

790
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,409
to run away when I leave the door open.

791
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:55,019
Selling the shares the management has
to fund the hotel...

792
00:46:56,219 --> 00:46:57,989
will be your last chance.

793
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,920
That's what Kim Bok Man was aiming for.

794
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,059
The shares I have.

795
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:03,630
He gave us the note
aiming for that, right?

796
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:05,190
I think so.

797
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,460
That jerk.

798
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,800
Ms. Yoon. Here.

799
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:18,010
This won't do.
Let's go to the hospital first.

800
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:26,050
- It's okay, Mr. Han.
- Ms. Yoon.

801
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:31,150
Bok Man won't leave the hotel alone
just because I go to the hospital.

802
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:32,849
What should we do?

803
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:39,760
Goodness.

804
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:43,429
After the restructuring mess,
it's bankruptcy now.

805
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:46,440
This is so troubling.

806
00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:48,699
Why won't Kim Bok Man
get into car accidents...

807
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,070
or food poisoning?

808
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,539
How is this Chairman Kim's fault?

809
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,079
If we had followed his conditions
to begin with,

810
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,179
we would've paid off the debt,

811
00:47:57,849 --> 00:47:59,719
and the hotel would've been
perfectly fine.

812
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:04,119
We had to let it drag this far
because of that haughty general manager.

813
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,289
I don't understand what you're saying.

814
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:10,289
It's clear which is the way
to save the hotel.

815
00:48:10,289 --> 00:48:12,630
Is handing over the hotel
to someone else saving it?

816
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:16,699
I don't think you have the right
to say that.

817
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:19,699
What do you mean
she doesn't have the right?

818
00:48:19,699 --> 00:48:23,610
Don't you know who it is
that turned the hotel upside down?

819
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,039
Then who's the one who ran errands
under Shin Dong Hyuk?

820
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:27,510
It wasn't running errands!

821
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,780
I only think about the hotel's benefits.

822
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:35,219
I'm saying I only work with people
who are of help to this hotel.

823
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,519
I'm on another level from Mr. Han
who's keeping a low profile...

824
00:48:39,989 --> 00:48:41,059
until things ended up this way.

825
00:48:41,059 --> 00:48:43,530
He protected the hotel by getting hurt.

826
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:44,789
How can you say that?

827
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:46,829
That's why he's a fool.

828
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,230
Things would've been over already
if you went with the flow.

829
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,300
Why would he be so stubborn about it?

830
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,570
You're right.

831
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,739
It's always good to go with the flow.

832
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:00,139
Mr. Oh. What is the flow?

833
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,510
I want to ask what that flow is.

834
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,550
Saving the hotel is the flow.

835
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,210
Then the traitors who sided
with the Japanese...

836
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:08,519
during the Japanese invasion
went with the flow,

837
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,320
and people who sacrificed their youths...

838
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,250
and were beaten to death in prison...

839
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,289
were stubborn?

840
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,519
What nonsense.

841
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:16,829
Listen clearly.

842
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:19,659
The flow is following the right path.

843
00:49:19,659 --> 00:49:21,599
Following the righteous principle
is the flow.

844
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,030
Of course, it may...

845
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:25,599
look like stubbornness sometimes.

846
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:28,269
But when it's necessary,
you need to know how to be stubborn too.

847
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:30,170
People like you and Mr. Yoo...

848
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:33,239
who change sides
based on their own benefit...

849
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:35,980
sell the hotel and the country away.

850
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,949
I totally agree, Mr. No.

851
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,019
This ship is sinking
because I'm working...

852
00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:43,150
with frustrating people like this.

853
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:53,400
I need to check the restaurant setting,
so let me excuse myself.

854
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:01,400
Gosh. It's checkout time now.
Why are you here?

855
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,670
We have something to tell you, Ms. Lee.

856
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:07,139
We, the housekeepers, had a meeting.

857
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:10,110
We heard the hotel was
in a tough situation. So...

858
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:13,050
Don't worry about it,
and just focus on your work.

859
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:15,619
So we've decided.

860
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,690
Even if it doesn't help much,

861
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:21,920
if the hotel's in a tough situation,
maybe you can use our salaries.

862
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:24,030
What do you mean, Geum Soon?

863
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:26,400
We're saying that for the hotel,

864
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,159
we're willing to give up
on our salaries...

865
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:30,329
even if we starve for a few months.

866
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:36,570
Our housekeepers are really...

867
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:38,210
You're really amazing.

868
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:41,440
Don't worry about that and work hard.

869
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:44,880
Even when things were tougher than now,
Mr. Han took care of it.

870
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:47,780
Yes. Our hotel business isn't doing badly.

871
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,719
Rather, it's doing so well
that people want to get their hands on it.

872
00:50:51,989 --> 00:50:54,119
My gosh, you amazing ladies.

873
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:56,289
This is crazy.

874
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:58,429
Tell all the housekeepers to gather
in the evening.

875
00:50:58,429 --> 00:50:59,630
I'll treat you to dinner.

876
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,559
How wonderful.

877
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:06,130
Sorry to keep you waiting for long.

878
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:07,670
It's okay.

879
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,010
It's really nice here.

880
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,039
I didn't know they had a place like this.

881
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:14,380
Actually, this is my shelter.

882
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:17,010
I used to come here and rest
whenever I was tired.

883
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,780
One time, I actually fell asleep.

884
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,480
- Really?
- Yes.

885
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,349
When I just joined the hotel.

886
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:24,889
What is it about?

887
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,190
Can't I ask to meet you without a reason?

888
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,300
Well, you can.

889
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,559
But it looks like something's up.

890
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:41,639
I think I'm going to study overseas.

891
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,269
To where?

892
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,349
I want to be the junior
of the general manager that I respect.

893
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:54,150
You're going to Las Vegas.

894
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:57,920
I should contact the professors I know.

895
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:01,260
It's okay. I'm going alone anyway.

896
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:03,630
Should I say congratulations,

897
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,360
or should I encourage you to come back
as a great hotelier?

898
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,769
But it weighs on your mind
to say that, right?

899
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:17,670
It seems like I always owe you.

900
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:21,440
I'll give you a chance
to repay the debts at once.

901
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,840
How?

902
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:25,949
As promised, let's have dinner together.

903
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,380
In a place I choose.

904
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:30,849
- When?
- The evening before I leave.

905
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,159
I'll get going now.

906
00:52:39,329 --> 00:52:41,960
Thinking of leaving makes me feel rushed.

907
00:52:42,099 --> 00:52:43,800
Even though I have nothing much to settle.

908
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:46,329
Call me anytime if you need my help.

909
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:48,840
For the last dinner,

910
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,510
prepare a nice farewell...

911
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:52,139
instead of something you normally say
to everyone.

912
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,360
Goodness.

913
00:53:16,829 --> 00:53:18,369
Good ball.

914
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,849
Welcome, Leo.

915
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:36,480
I like working out at night
when it's quiet.

916
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:39,289
You must keep this a secret from Frank.

917
00:53:40,059 --> 00:53:44,489
I consider loyalty
the most important value in the world.

918
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:48,030
I don't know if Frank is as loyal as you.

919
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,130
Check the document first.

920
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:52,300
You're so impatient.

921
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,900
We can check complicated things later.

922
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:57,440
Take off your blazer first.
Let's do some exercise.

923
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,760
This is General Manager Han Tae Jun.

924
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,329
Can we meet now?

925
00:54:43,219 --> 00:54:44,949
This is what you call a great spot.

926
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:47,590
A mountain behind and a river in front.

927
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:49,360
It has a great view
because nothing's blocking it.

928
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,360
Whoever thought
of building a hotel here is incredible.

929
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,730
He's the founder of the hotel. CEO Choi.

930
00:54:59,469 --> 00:55:01,099
I think business is about imagination too.

931
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:06,880
Mr. Shin. Compared to
when you first came to this hotel,

932
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,239
you seem to have changed a lot.

933
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,880
Is that so?

934
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:13,980
In what way did I change?

935
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,619
I'm sure you know it well.

936
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,090
Why did you call me?

937
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:23,929
The hotel is in a bad situation.

938
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,699
Chairman Kim suddenly demanded
we pay the note, so we might go bankrupt.

939
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:28,860
So?

940
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,030
We need your help.

941
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,599
Do you believe that I can help you?

942
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,070
- Yes.
- That's enough, then.

943
00:55:37,539 --> 00:55:40,579
I'll stop the bankruptcy
and solve the creditor issue.

944
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:44,880
I learned that a confident request was...

945
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,380
more courageous than half-baked pride.

946
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,519
And it gains your trust too.

947
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,389
Were we talking about the game
when we stopped talking during dinner?

948
00:55:55,789 --> 00:55:56,960
I asked you.

949
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:59,329
Do you still have regrets...

950
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:00,860
after reading all the cards I have?

951
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:05,130
You must've gotten the ace card.

952
00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:10,869
Let me ask you a personal question.

953
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,039
Go ahead.

954
00:56:13,139 --> 00:56:15,480
You said you only played games
that you were sure you would win.

955
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:19,550
Isn't that because you're afraid
of losing?

956
00:56:24,289 --> 00:56:26,050
People like me who are used to losing...

957
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,190
find that a luxury.

958
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:32,130
Occasionally, it looks pitiful too.

959
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:36,300
Are you giving me a piece of advice or...

960
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,530
I don't always have a clear intention
or a goal when I talk.

961
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:43,769
I have nothing much to say
without my feelings and modifiers.

962
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:47,340
Anyway, thank you for helping us.

963
00:56:47,409 --> 00:56:48,579
I will not forget this.
