00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:04,179
(Episode 6, The Day in the Rain)

2
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:22,890
You're late, aren't you?

3
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:26,160
Yes.

4
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:29,399
Since you're late anyway,
let's get dinner together.

5
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,440
I'm getting hungry.

6
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,070
Pardon?

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,210
What do you want to eat?
Tell me what you want.

8
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:35,670
But just don't say kalguksu.

9
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:40,780
I'm good with anything
as long as Seoul Hotel doesn't serve it.

10
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,250
What are you doing here, Mr. Yoo?

11
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,750
Hey.

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,990
I was on my way to the restroom.

13
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,259
- The men's restroom is that way.
- Okay.

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,189
- Sit down.
- Gosh.

15
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,759
What did you say?
They were having a party in the kitchen?

16
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,600
Yes. I saw it with my own two eyes.

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,700
They used up all the ingredients
in the kitchen and were having a feast.

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,939
It was quite hectic in there.

19
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,540
He used up the ingredients
however he saw fit?

20
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,180
On top of that,
they ordered a cake from a bakery.

21
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,909
They opened a bottle of champagne
and exploded bombs too.

22
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:14,609
You mean, indoor firecrackers.

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,349
Hey, Manager Ji. You need to listen to me.

24
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,420
Anyway, Manager Oh,

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,049
I couldn't stand the sight of them
having a party.

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,859
I knew it. I saw this coming a mile away.

27
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,030
I knew that Han Tae Jun
was going to ruin the hotel.

28
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,030
Give me that.

29
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:34,969
Who did you see at the party?

30
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,500
Chef No. And remember that ugly guy?

31
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,599
What's his name? The one with a temper.

32
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,170
That's Assistant Lee Gab Soo.

33
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,079
Right. Lee Gab Soo. He was there too.

34
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,909
He had his underlings from the kitchen...

35
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:48,379
as well as the people
from Food and Beverage.

36
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:50,579
Lee Soon Jung from Housekeeping
was also at the party.

37
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:51,750
Lee Soon Jung?

38
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:55,090
Even Lee Soon Jung was there?

39
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,659
She was wearing red lipstick
and smiling from ear to ear.

40
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,730
I just couldn't bear to watch it.

41
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,299
That jerk, Han Tae Jun, is influencing
even an innocent woman like Soon Jung.

42
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,740
We ought to do something to fix this mess.

43
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,479
- He should have a drink.
- Sir, please have a drink.

44
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,539
- I'm good.
- Please.

45
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,509
General Manager Han.

46
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,319
Here.

47
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,250
What's this?

48
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,060
A present.

49
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,490
Congratulations on getting elected.

50
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,689
I mean, this is to celebrate
your appointment.

51
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,430
Isn't that a bribe?

52
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,300
I bet it's a bribe.

53
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,430
People with impure intentions
might consider it a bribe.

54
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,740
But this is coming from the bottom
of my heart. Please accept it.

55
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:48,569
What's this?

56
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:50,210
Chocolate.

57
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,280
How did you know I like chocolate?

58
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:56,750
Gosh. Really? You like chocolate?

59
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,150
I had no idea. I really didn't.

60
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:01,889
There must be telepathy between us.

61
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,360
I just had a feeling you would like it.
So I chose chocolate.

62
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,030
Coincidences like this
give you goosebumps, don't they?

63
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:11,930
You're giving me goosebumps.

64
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,330
Gosh.

65
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,669
Thank you. I'll enjoy them.

66
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,900
Where are you going?

67
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:21,240
To smoke a cigarette.

68
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,310
Seo Jin Young left early.

69
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,009
She must have had an important date.

70
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,879
She dolled herself up and left the hotel.

71
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,819
I see.

72
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,159
I doubt that
she'll come back to the hotel today.

73
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,240
- Is this the house?
- No, I have to go in a bit more.

74
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,410
Let me drop you off
in front of your house. It's raining.

75
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,550
If my father sees you, he'll scold me.

76
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,620
I'd rather walk for a bit in the rain.
Bye.

77
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,290
- Yoon Hee.
- I told you to go.

78
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,459
- Will you allow me to like you?
- What?

79
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,129
Will you allow me
to have feelings for you?

80
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,430
Stop joking around.

81
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,529
I'm not joking. My feelings are real.

82
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:33,040
Your feelings can easily change
based on the situation.

83
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,040
You may like me today.

84
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,240
But when you meet a more attractive woman
whom you connect better with,

85
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,180
your feelings are bound to change.

86
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,120
Do you know that?
That's how fickle one's feelings are.

87
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,220
It's me.

88
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:52,990
Go.

89
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,230
Yes, you're right.

90
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,889
But I don't think I can meet...

91
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,100
a more attractive woman
whom I can connect better with.

92
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:00,970
Don't be so hasty.

93
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,699
Your feelings can change anytime.

94
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,040
My feelings won't change
as long as you don't.

95
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,769
Even if you change, my feelings won't.

96
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,069
That's how I truly feel.

97
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:13,579
So can I like you?

98
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:18,019
I'll think about it.

99
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,110
- Father.
- Where have you been?

100
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,519
I asked where you have been.

101
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,290
The library...

102
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,089
How could you take after your mother,
of all people?

103
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,230
I never raised you to turn out like her.

104
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,399
How could you be so foolish?

105
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,699
You haven't been going to school
for months.

106
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,899
You've been going out to drink
all over the city...

107
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,240
while flirting with men!

108
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,339
All right. So do you want
to turn into your mother?

109
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:53,910
Don't speak badly of her.

110
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:55,850
What?

111
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,379
Mom ended her life because of you.

112
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,589
Get out. Get out of my house right now!

113
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,319
Okay.

114
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,230
I'm sick and tired
of being your puppet too.

115
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,689
I'm sick of you and this house.

116
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:11,459
It makes me sick that...

117
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:13,560
I have to lie and put on a fake smile
just to get on your good side!

118
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,829
Yes. I'll leave.

119
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,769
Just like Mom left your life,

120
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,569
I will leave your life too.

121
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,680
Satisfied now?

122
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:31,720
You!

123
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,240
Was alcohol not enough for you?
Is that why you gambled too?

124
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,440
You're responsible for this!

125
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,639
What did you say? Unbelievable.

126
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,580
Get out. Get out of my house right now!

127
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,730
(Haenim Toys)

128
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:42,980
- Shall we run?
- Yes.

129
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:15,279
Wait after you bring the car around.
I'll be out shortly.

130
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:19,220
Hey. Jin Young still hasn't come home.

131
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,149
Mister, come upstairs for a cup of tea.

132
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,750
You can stay
until Jin Young comes back home.

133
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,759
It's okay. I can see her tomorrow at work.

134
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,460
Come to the hotel with Jin Young tomorrow.

135
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,230
- Okay.
- Right.

136
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:32,000
Chef No is a good guy. So listen to him.

137
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,299
It might be tough in the beginning.
But hang in there.

138
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:37,129
Everyone struggles in a new job.

139
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,399
But make that job yours and work hard.

140
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,070
- Okay.
- Talk to me if you need help.

141
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,009
- Okay. Thank you.
- Sure.

142
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:45,139
Goodnight.

143
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,210
Goodnight.

144
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,730
Well...

145
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:42,700
He's a hotel guest.

146
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,200
He asked me to give him
a tour of the city, so I went with him.

147
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,570
I was going to be at your welcome party.

148
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,710
But there was a traffic jam. So...

149
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,980
It's okay. You'll catch a cold.

150
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,210
Get inside and rest up.

151
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,250
You can use the jacket as an umbrella.

152
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:40,990
Hold on, sir. Please stop the car.

153
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:58,740
Are you all right?

154
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:02,679
Are you going to the hotel?

155
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,519
- Give her my employee discount.
- Okay.

156
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,029
Sir, here's the room key and the card.

157
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:16,929
- Thank you.
- Sure.

158
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,629
We opened a tab with your card.

159
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:22,070
So settle the bill when you check out.

160
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,399
This is the room key.

161
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,250
Are you all right?

162
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,690
You know what?
I should walk you to your room.

163
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,690
Get up.

164
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,559
Hyun Chul. I need your help.

165
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,830
Yes, sir.

166
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,820
Are you sure
we don't need to take her to a hospital?

167
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,149
Her fever has gone down a lot.
But we need to keep an eye on her.

168
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,490
This lady passed out the other day.

169
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,960
She's always giving us a headache.

170
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,690
Give the wet clothes to the laundry room
and bring the ledger from my office.

171
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,259
I need to prepare for tomorrow's meeting.

172
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:25,360
Yes, sir.

173
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,519
Wake up...

174
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,629
Mom. Wake up.

175
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,259
Mom.

176
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,470
Wake up. Mom.

177
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:06,740
Mom!

178
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,750
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?

179
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:50,509
- What?
- What's wrong?

180
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,549
I'm detecting energy waves
I have never seen before.

181
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,240
Hello.

182
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,109
Yes, this is Seo Jin Young.

183
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:56,150
What? Who's gone missing?

184
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,029
Are you all right?

185
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:14,799
If you don't tell me anything
and just stay quiet, I can't help you.

186
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,599
I don't know what's going on with you,

187
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:20,299
but walking around in the rain
won't be good for your health.

188
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:23,670
I'm glad...

189
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,779
that your fever has gone down a lot
and you seem stable now.

190
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:28,849
Are you nice to everyone?

191
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,119
Or is there a reason
you're particularly nice to me?

192
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,180
I try to be nice...

193
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,289
to all the hotel guests
whoever they may be.

194
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,289
Besides, you're Young Jae's friend.

195
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:41,359
Young Jae is like a little brother to me.

196
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:46,400
Seeing how you're feeling better,
I'll leave you alone.

197
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,799
It's Yoon Hee.

198
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:51,640
I never told you my name.

199
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,240
My name is Yoon Hee. Kim Yoon Hee.

200
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:56,970
Ms. Kim Yoon Hee.

201
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,819
- We have an incident.
- What?

202
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:08,289
A girl has gone missing.

203
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:12,960
I'll get going. Goodnight.

204
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,859
What happened?
Tell me everything you know.

205
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:20,099
The girl in Room 1602 has gone missing.

206
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:22,430
- How old is she?
- She's about ten years old.

207
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,130
Her father had a meeting
outside the hotel.

208
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,339
But when he came back,
his daughter had gone missing.

209
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,339
- When did he come back?
- Before midnight.

210
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:30,970
I checked that she was in the room
slightly before 11 p.m.

211
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,009
The last time I checked her,
she was in her room.

212
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,549
Hey, what happened?

213
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:41,849
- Well...
- My girl is missing.

214
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,819
My daughter is missing!

215
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,619
I asked you to keep an eye on her
before I left.

216
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,130
How could you let this happen?

217
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,789
I'm sorry, sir.

218
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,730
I'm sure she's somewhere in the hotel.
We'll go and look for her.

219
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,329
Please wait in the room.

220
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:58,200
What will you do
if something happens to my girl?

221
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:00,200
Will you take responsibility for that?

222
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,609
If we're responsible for this incident,
we will take responsibility for it.

223
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,839
But shouldn't finding your daughter
be our priority?

224
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,950
Causing a scene here
won't help you find your daughter.

225
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,920
We will do our best to find your daughter
as fast as we can.

226
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,619
Please go back to your room and wait.

227
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:17,849
I'll go with you.

228
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,990
Our hotel is much bigger
and more complicated than you think.

229
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,829
It'll be much easier
for a group of employees...

230
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:25,099
who know the way around the hotel
to quickly look for your daughter.

231
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:27,759
So please go back to your room and wait.

232
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,569
Thank you for believing in us.

233
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,539
Please escort him to his room.

234
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:36,609
Yes, sir. Let me get that for you.

235
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,180
Where should I look?

236
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,250
You can let the staff on duty handle this.

237
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,849
You should go back home.

238
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,420
Let's go, Hyun Chul.

239
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:56,230
This is for all duty assistant managers.

240
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,559
Call all the employees who were working
since 11 p.m. for an emergency...

241
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:00,660
and gather them.

242
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,500
Reach out to every doorman,
the front desk, the bell desk,

243
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,500
and employees working outside the hotel.

244
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,700
Please check with them
if anyone saw a girl leaving the hotel.

245
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:10,210
Right. I need to reach
the communication center.

246
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:14,680
- This is only for the basement, right?
- Yes.

247
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:16,410
- Hold this for me.
- Yes, sir.

248
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,779
This is General Manager Han Tae Jun.

249
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:21,420
Everyone working at the hotel
must put on their earphones...

250
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,789
and listen to my message.

251
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:25,059
As you heard,

252
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:27,119
one of the hotel guests has gone missing.

253
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,559
She's a girl, around ten years old.

254
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,329
Please take special attention
to your surroundings and look for her.

255
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:33,599
Is this the flower shop?

256
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,029
- Yes. Did you check?
- Be discreet not to alarm other guests.

257
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:37,670
- Yes. Please check again.
- Let's find her discreetly and fast.

258
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,170
If you find her or any traces of her,
radio me on Channel Four.

259
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:42,869
Directly reach out to me
on the emergency channel.

260
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,309
This little girl is a guest
our hotel is responsible...

261
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:47,339
to protect.

262
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,289
Manager Seo told me to check every hour.

263
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:00,890
But I forgot. I'm sorry.

264
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,430
Don't apologize to me.

265
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,230
If this goes wrong,
all of our necks will be on the line.

266
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:07,329
- I checked there.
- What did you say?

267
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:08,730
- Give me the blueprint.
- Yes, sir.

268
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,000
- You should check with the concierge.
- Okay.

269
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,269
Get me the employees
in charge of the concierge desk.

270
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:16,670
- Yes. We checked...
- Do you think she got hungry...

271
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,869
- until 12:30 a.m.
- and went to the bakery?

272
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,680
- The doorman? Yes. Kim Sang Chul.
- Did you check this area?

273
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,380
Nothing unusual. Yes.

274
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,410
Any news from outside the hotel?

275
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,480
I don't think she left the hotel.

276
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,779
The doormen and the front desk said
they didn't see any girl leaving alone.

277
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,519
She could have been in a crowd
when she left.

278
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,890
It was late at night,
so there weren't a lot of people.

279
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:34,289
Great. Let's check the kitchen.

280
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,109
- You still haven't found her?
- Let me see the tapes after midnight.

281
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:55,410
All of them?

282
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,450
Just the footage from indoors.

283
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,559
- In Seok. Do you have a flashlight?
- Yes.

284
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,660
- Right here.
- Okay.

285
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,599
Thank you.

286
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,509
No. I'll be the one who finds her.

287
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,150
Okay. Stop.

288
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,559
Wait. Is that 14? Let me check that again.

289
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:47,759
Where is that?

290
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:50,400
The lobby entrance
that's under construction.

291
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:52,700
That path was supposed to be blocked.

292
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,670
- Let me borrow a flashlight.
- Okay.

293
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:03,410
- Give me the flashlight.
- Yes, sir.

294
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,009
Soo Jin.

295
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,309
Soo Jin. Are you here?

296
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,109
It's me.

297
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,549
Answer me if you're here.

298
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:44,690
Soo Jin.

299
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,829
What are you doing here?
I told you to go back home.

300
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,559
I know a girl is missing.
How do you expect me to go home?

301
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,299
Besides, I was the first one
to keep an eye on her.

302
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:55,599
I'm partly responsible too.

303
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,000
This happened after your shift.

304
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,369
You already handed it off to Hyun Chul.

305
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:00,700
I won't hold you responsible, so go home.

306
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,170
Why are you doing this to me?

307
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,710
What am I doing to you?

308
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,210
You keep acting as if you're angry at me.

309
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,740
Is this about the welcome party?

310
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,109
I told you that a guest asked me
to give him a tour of the city.

311
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:11,450
Do I look like I can't stay professional?

312
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:14,849
I don't care what you do
or whom you meet after your shift.

313
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:15,849
So go home.

314
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:17,750
You don't care?

315
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:20,420
Are you sure
you're not even one bit interested in me?

316
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,960
Hyun Chul, why don't we check the back?

317
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,529
Hold on. General Manager Han.
You have to answer my question.

318
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:29,230
Oh, no. My bunny!

319
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:31,130
Soo Jin!

320
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,740
She's on the second floor.

321
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,109
Soo Jin.

322
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,180
Manager Seo, are you all right?

323
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,880
Yes. I'm all right.

324
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,630
Stay there.

325
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:14,609
Are you Soo Jin?

326
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,049
Who are you?

327
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:22,849
My name is Han Tae Jun.
I'm the general manager of this hotel.

328
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,190
What are you doing here?

329
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,390
I was playing with my stuffed bunny.

330
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,690
But I dropped it.

331
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,059
I'll find the stuffed bunny for you.

332
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,829
Let's go down. Your father is worried.

333
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:38,000
Liar! My dad doesn't care about me.

334
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,670
He's always working.

335
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,170
He leaves me alone all the time.

336
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,640
He's working hard,
so he can buy pretty clothes...

337
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,140
and delicious food for you.

338
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,410
No. The only thing
he cares about is his work.

339
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,279
He never plays with me.

340
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,380
Soo Jin, we should go back to your dad.
Will you stay here all night?

341
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,220
I hate my dad. I don't want to go to him.

342
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:57,349
I'm not going!

343
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,660
Aren't you scared to be here?

344
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:00,859
I am.

345
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,130
See? If you stay here,
a monster will show up and bite you!

346
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,400
Come down already.

347
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,509
No one here played with me.

348
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,750
You left me to play
with that man with glasses.

349
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,549
The stuffed bunny was the only friend
who played with me.

350
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,119
But I dropped my bunny too.

351
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:35,289
Soo Jin, I'll find you
the white stuffed bunny before you know.

352
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:42,470
All right. Here it is.

353
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,069
My stuffed bunny.

354
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,970
Here.

355
00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:53,279
It's dirty. Oh, no.

356
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,579
I'll wash it and bring it back to you.

357
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,920
Will you come with us then?

358
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,180
Let's go.

359
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,930
Soo Jin, please!

360
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,380
Soo Jin, do you like chocolate?

361
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,980
It's fattening.

362
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,390
Then you can have only a bit of it.

363
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,150
Here.

364
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:51,029
In the basement of this hotel,

365
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:52,869
there's a boiler room.

366
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,940
My father
used to be the boiler operator there.

367
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:01,779
He spent his days in there
for years without any days off.

368
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,420
From time to time,
when I came to the hotel to give him...

369
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,980
his boxed meals,

370
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:13,789
I saw nicely dressed people,
having their fancy meals.

371
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:15,589
There are a lot of people like that
at hotels.

372
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:20,099
I know. I've been to many hotels.

373
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,269
I see. Right. You must have seen them too.

374
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:26,970
But you see,
compared to these rich people...

375
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,470
who wore clean and fine clothes,

376
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:32,779
my father always wore
his dirty work suit...

377
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,809
and damaged his hearing
because of the machine sounds...

378
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:37,349
that he had a hard time hearing me.

379
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:40,049
So...

380
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:43,789
I started to feel embarrassed
that he was my father.

381
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:47,789
One day, he called my name out loud
when there were so many people.

382
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,490
"Tae Jun, I finished the meal.
Take the box."

383
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,259
So what did you do?

384
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,029
I pretended
I didn't know him and ran away.

385
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,369
There was a huge crowd.

386
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:03,369
I was embarrassed that the man
who was dressed in a dirty suit...

387
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:04,509
was my father.

388
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
- Did he scold you?
- No.

389
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,579
That night, he got drunk...

390
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:14,019
and came home.

391
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,619
Do you know what he told me?

392
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,619
What did he say?

393
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,359
"I'm sorry, Tae Jun."

394
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,930
"Tae Jun, I'm sorry." That's what he said.

395
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:28,930
Why?

396
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,569
That's how dads are.

397
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:35,099
They work hard.
And with the money they earn,

398
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:39,410
they buy the food their kids like
such as jjajangmyeon and chocolate.

399
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,380
That's what all dads want to do.

400
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:43,809
But...

401
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,150
I was embarrassed of my father
who loved me so much.

402
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:53,059
I was wrong, wasn't I?

403
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:58,930
Then you should go to your dad now...

404
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,630
and tell him you're sorry.

405
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,900
I want to do that, but it's too late.

406
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:06,339
He passed away.

407
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,740
Oh, no.

408
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:12,410
So I regret it every single day...

409
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,609
like a kid who never listened to his dad.

410
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:17,250
If you hurt your father now,

411
00:31:17,849 --> 00:31:19,980
you will regret it like me.

412
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,150
Is my dad upset?

413
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:28,589
No. He's only worried about you.

414
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,359
You'll come with us now. Right?

415
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,769
I need to wash the white bunny.

416
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,869
I'll wash it thoroughly
and bring it back to you, good as new.

417
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,470
Promise me, then.

418
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,650
Soo Jin, let me take you to your dad.

419
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:57,490
He's quite busy.

420
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,190
No! I want to go with him.

421
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,589
Gosh. Soo Jin, you really are smart,

422
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:05,190
seeing how you like me over that old lady.

423
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:06,960
Gosh. Old lady?

424
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,700
What? You think I'm old, but you're not?

425
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,099
Unbelievable.

426
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:15,000
All right. Soo Jin.
I have to wash the bunny. Go with her.

427
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,640
She will bring you safely to your dad.
Okay?

428
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,039
Okay. I will go with her.

429
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,539
Let's go.

430
00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:22,880
Goodness. Aren't you a nice girl, Soo Jin?

431
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,920
- Goodnight, Soo Jin.
- Bye, mister.

432
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:29,650
Good work, General Manager Han.

433
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:33,789
Let's finish the conversation tomorrow.
The one we were having earlier.

434
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,849
Tae Jun!

435
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,259
Tae Jun!

436
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,269
Are you all right?

437
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,869
- Are you okay, Soo Jin?
- Yes, I'm okay.

438
00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:22,339
What about you?

439
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:23,369
I'm okay.

440
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,539
Soo Jin.

441
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,650
It stings a bit, right?

442
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,990
It stings a lot. Right there.

443
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,960
It's all done. You won't need bandages.

444
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,460
Make sure
to stop by the infirmary tomorrow.

445
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,460
Okay, will do.

446
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:46,099
Thanks, Ms. Lee Kyung Rim.

447
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,359
Gosh, you remember my name.

448
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,970
I never forget
pretty, competent employees' names.

449
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:53,400
Thank you.
Don't forget to drop by tomorrow.

450
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
Okay.

451
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,470
Thank you.

452
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,569
- Sure.
- Bye.

453
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,839
It could have been much worse, sir.

454
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,150
The Almighty and Buddha
were both looking out for you.

455
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,519
That's why you came out of it
with only a few scratches.

456
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:07,420
You must believe in many religions.

457
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,719
The more, the merrier.

458
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:12,219
- Good work. Go and get some rest.
- Okay, rest up.

459
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,320
Okay. Good work, Hyun Chul.

460
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,090
- Sure. You too.
- Okay.

461
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:27,400
I wonder if you remember my name.

462
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,639
What?

463
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:31,440
You said you would never forget
pretty, competent employees' names.

464
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:36,050
Right. What was your name? Was it Seo...

465
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:38,050
Seo Tai Ji?

466
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,920
Goodness. Forget it.

467
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:43,949
I'm shaken up too.

468
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,960
When I saw you under the piles of boxes,
I thought I was going to die too.

469
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,389
Obviously. If I were to die,
you would be fired for negligence of duty.

470
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,400
- You... Gosh. I'm sorry. Oh, no.
- Gosh.

471
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,599
- Come on.
- I'm sorry.

472
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:04,869
- Are you sleepy?
- Yes.

473
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,179
Okay. Rest up.

474
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,789
But...

475
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:19,489
how come you've never told me about that?

476
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,289
About what?

477
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,900
About your father.

478
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,829
Because you didn't ask.

479
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:32,500
I can never figure you out. Seriously.

480
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:37,010
I wonder how a great man like your father
gave birth to a petty man like you.

481
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:38,769
Gosh.

482
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,980
You hurt my feelings earlier.

483
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,690
Even if I handed off the task
to the bellman,

484
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,719
I started the task when I was on duty.

485
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:55,489
But you said...

486
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,590
I should just go home
because it wasn't my business.

487
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:03,000
You made me feel like
I wasn't wanted at the hotel.

488
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:04,800
So...

489
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,010
Are you sleeping?

490
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,380
Are you?

491
00:36:16,949 --> 00:36:17,949
Han Tae Jun.

492
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,989
Goodnight, Tae Jun.

493
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,840
Did you tell her?

494
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:51,710
To Manager Lee Soon Jung.

495
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:54,150
About what?

496
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,050
That I like chocolate.

497
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,860
Yes.

498
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,789
Why?

499
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:03,889
What?

500
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,159
What do you mean?

501
00:37:06,929 --> 00:37:09,329
Did you run out of money
to buy chocolate for me?

502
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,670
I didn't like regular chocolate.

503
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:18,110
I liked the chocolate...

504
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,539
you wrapped up for me
every Valentine's Day.

505
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,449
You didn't know that?

506
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,960
I mean,

507
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,630
I didn't think much of it.

508
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,929
You should've been more careful
when you shared that about me.

509
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:45,739
Don't do that next time.

510
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:51,539
Goodnight. Good job today.

511
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:32,920
(Women's Dressing Room)

512
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:34,949
- Hello.
- Hi.

513
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:36,920
- Hello.
- Hello.

514
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,659
Hello.

515
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:48,699
- Hello.
- Hello.

516
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:51,500
What's the point of being tall?

517
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:54,599
Gosh, my legs.

518
00:38:56,369 --> 00:38:58,610
- Are you all right?
- Gosh. Get your hand off my leg.

519
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,780
Black is better, right?

520
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,349
No. It's spring now.

521
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:10,389
Tan is better.

522
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,820
But black is sexier.

523
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,130
Jjajang or jjamppong.

524
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,260
Jjamppong is better.

525
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:33,639
Goodness. What are you doing?

526
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:36,480
You shouldn't just barge in like that.
Have some manners.

527
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,179
Don't you know how to knock?

528
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,489
Must I knock before I enter my own office?

529
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:45,150
Well, it depends on the situation.

530
00:39:45,889 --> 00:39:47,460
Put them on quickly. I won't look.

531
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,199
Don't look. I mean, they ripped.

532
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:01,199
Hurry up. I'm a busy man too.

533
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,539
Don't turn around.

534
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,539
I won't look even if you beg me.
It's too early...

535
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:06,039
for me to go to the zoo.

536
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,579
The zoo? What are you talking about?

537
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,449
Why would I want
to look at an elephant's legs?

538
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:13,980
Are you serious?

539
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,079
Or a hippopotamus?

540
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,849
You...

541
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,989
It disgusts me that I have to work...

542
00:40:20,989 --> 00:40:23,360
with a bad-mannered
and ignorant man like you.

543
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,329
Why are you getting
so worked up over a joke?

544
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,929
How is calling a lady
a hippopotamus considered a joke?

545
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,429
Fine. I'll change it to a penguin.

546
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,469
A penguin? I have short legs?

547
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:34,570
Penguins are cute.

548
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:38,269
- If I'm a hippopotamus, you are...
- A wolf.

549
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,980
Gosh. Wolves are cool.

550
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,079
You are a hyena.

551
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:44,710
Soon Jung.

552
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,280
Don't call my name
or even ask for my forgiveness.

553
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,550
I don't want your apology.
You ignorant hyena!

554
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,619
No. That's not it. Manager Lee!

555
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,329
Hello.

556
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:03,769
Hello.

557
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,599
Hello.

558
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,880
- Hello.
- Hello.

559
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,909
Manager Lee.

560
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,880
What?

561
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:20,780
Your stockings.

562
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,320
Your stockings.

563
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,960
Oh, no. Goodness.

564
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:31,489
All right.
The bunny got clean after a shower.

565
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,099
Yes. Thank you.

566
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,730
I'm truly sorry
about yesterday's commotion.

567
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:38,829
No. It should be us who let down Soo Jin.

568
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:41,940
Please come back again.

569
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,070
Next time, we will make sure
Soo Jin has fun here.

570
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:45,409
Thank you.

571
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,239
Soo Jin, say goodbye now.

572
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:49,750
What?

573
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,119
Bye, mister. Bye, miss.

574
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:58,090
- Okay. Bye.
- Have a good day.

575
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,360
- Goodbye.
- Okay.

576
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,460
Bye.

577
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:07,260
- Dad, don't they make a good couple?
- Yes?

578
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:09,000
Right.

579
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,170
I bet they'll get married later.

580
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,940
- I'm sure of it.
- How do you know that?

581
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:15,500
Call it a woman's hunch.

582
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:20,079
Don't you want a daughter like her?

583
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,010
No way.

584
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,179
If I had a daughter like her,
my body wouldn't last.

585
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,599
So no word from Yoon Hee?

586
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:50,639
No. She didn't reach out at all.

587
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,949
(This is Yoon Hee's. Don't touch it!)

588
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:03,019
(My house. A house full of joy...)

589
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:08,460
(Haenim Toys)

590
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,639
Hello. How can I help you?

591
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:53,000
(1 text message)

592
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,170
(Yoon Hee, where are you?)

593
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,610
(Call me now.)

594
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:03,409
- Who is it?
- Room service.

595
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:12,050
What's this?

596
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,460
The general manager
told me to bring this up.

597
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,690
- The general manager?
- Yes.

598
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,730
I brought orange juice, fresh fruit,

599
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,199
and abalone porridge.

600
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,760
And there's a note too.

601
00:44:22,659 --> 00:44:24,170
I will put your laundry there.

602
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:26,539
(Even if you don't have an appetite,
make sure to eat and get some energy.)

603
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,400
(Take the medicine again
30 minutes after the meal.)

604
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,739
Enjoy your breakfast, then.

605
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:34,199
This is the general manager's room. Right?

606
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,210
- No.
- No.

607
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:39,369
I'm sure it is.

608
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:43,650
He used this room temporarily
and moved to another room.

609
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,050
But which department are you from?

610
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,289
I don't work here.
I'm here to return these.

611
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:53,889
Give them to me.
We'll see that he gets them.

612
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,760
No. I want to give them in person.
Where could I find him?

613
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:26,960
I don't think she's here to ask him
to settle the tab from a bar.

614
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:31,860
Gosh. The general manager
wouldn't go to those bars.

615
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,199
You never know with men.

616
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,329
Gosh. Anyway, women
are the problems these days, not men.

617
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:43,309
Look at her. She's a looker too.

618
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:46,039
She's got sexy eyes just like me.

619
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,909
Gosh. Look at her plump lips.

620
00:46:49,909 --> 00:46:52,449
I bet men will fall at her feet.

621
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:54,280
She looks like an actress.

622
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,780
Right.

623
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,449
She's got the same lips as me.

624
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,690
Did you look that pretty
when you were young?

625
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:02,059
She looks just like me.

626
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,829
She's the spitting image of me
when I was young.

627
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,230
- Look at her.
- Goodness.

628
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:08,559
- What are you doing?
- Goodness.

629
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,929
- Hello, General Manager Han.
- Hello.

630
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:15,000
A woman came by earlier...

631
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,670
So a woman
who looked just like Geum Soon...

632
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,440
went into your office.

633
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,480
She didn't come out, so we were worried.

634
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:23,780
A woman?

635
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:24,880
- Yes.
- Yes.

636
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:33,320
(General Manager's Office)

637
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,760
- Something feels off.
- Right.

638
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:36,889
Hello.

639
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:38,730
Hey. What are you doing here?

640
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,130
To bring these back.
You left them in my room last night.

641
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,699
I could have sent someone to get them.

642
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:45,570
Right. Did you get your laundry?

643
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:47,369
Yes. They arrived early in the morning.

644
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:48,969
I guess it doesn't take long
to wash clothes at hotels.

645
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:50,670
Right. It's the Early Bird system.

646
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,210
If you put a rush on it,
you can get it washed quickly.

647
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,380
But it costs more.

648
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:55,239
- Did you like it?
- No.

649
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,710
Why? Is something wrong?

650
00:47:56,809 --> 00:47:58,780
I thought I was going to get...

651
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,079
a free T-shirt and jeans.
I was disappointed.

652
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:03,389
I don't get paid a lot.

653
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,949
Then the clothes weren't from the hotel?

654
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:07,519
Sometimes, yes.

655
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:08,960
But I bought the clothes last time.

656
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,829
Take them as a present from me.
No need to feel bad.

657
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:12,530
Do you give out such presents often?

658
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:14,360
No. Only in special circumstances.

659
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,400
Does this kind of special circumstance
take place often here?

660
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,000
No. That's why it's special.

661
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,769
Are all hotel managers good
at answering questions like this?

662
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:22,500
Of course. When guests ask us questions,

663
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,969
we can't say, "I don't know."

664
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:25,440
But there are times
when you really don't know the answer.

665
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,809
"I'll look into it."
We can say that instead.

666
00:48:27,809 --> 00:48:29,440
- Next question.
- You're not annoyed...

667
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,510
when I keep asking questions?

668
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:31,710
Not at all. Ask anything you want.

669
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:33,179
- Can I really ask another question?
- Go ahead.

670
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:34,349
Are you married?

671
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:42,590
Are you?

672
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,730
- No.
- Do you have a girlfriend?

673
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,730
You said I could ask you anything.

674
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:53,199
But you can't ask me personal questions.

675
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:54,369
But you said I could ask anything.

676
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:03,150
Can I ask you why you asked me that?

677
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,949
I'm personally interested in you.

678
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:10,550
Well, you see, I don't want you...

679
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:12,690
to have any... So...

680
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:15,119
I'm a bit old for you
to be interested in me romantically.

681
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:19,030
You said I could ask you anything.
You're not going to keep your promise?

682
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:22,300
You can ask me any questions,
but I can't answer all of them.

683
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,599
Lame.

684
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:33,039
My high school gym teacher told me...

685
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,980
if you dodge the ball flying to you
instead of grabbing it,

686
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,480
you'll never be able to score.

687
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:40,920
So if you avoid a woman approaching you...

688
00:49:44,289 --> 00:49:45,650
Don't be scared.

689
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,789
I haven't thrown my ball yet.

690
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,230
My father and my mother
had a 14-year age gap.

691
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:54,000
How old are you, Mr. Han?

692
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:58,599
I'm 21.

693
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,070
Hit me, you punk.

694
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,289
Are you scared that you might fall for me?

695
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,030
- Well...
- I asked her to show me around.

696
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,730
I'm Shin Dong Hyuk.

697
00:51:03,969 --> 00:51:05,269
Just for a minute.
