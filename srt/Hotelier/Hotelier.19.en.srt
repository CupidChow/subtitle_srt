1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,839
Yes. I run every day if I can.

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:04,009
Even on rainy or snowy days?

3
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:05,480
Even when there are thunderstorms
and wind.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,480
Not everyone can do that.
You must be very tenacious.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,710
Is that how your personality is?

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,050
"Personality?"

7
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,220
I think "style" is a more suitable word.

8
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:15,419
"Style?"

9
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,760
Everyone lives according to their style.

10
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,260
Whether it's good or not comes next.
Everyone needs their own thing.

11
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,230
Simply living without any thoughts
and a clear goal is hard...

12
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:26,769
to endure.

13
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,030
Aren't you putting too much pressure
on yourself?

14
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:33,770
Making myself comfortable is my job,

15
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:36,509
but making myself strong
by adding pressure and whipping...

16
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:37,609
is my job too.

17
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,609
Other people are indifferent to me...

18
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:43,380
and are not responsible for my life.

19
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,380
I learned it early.

20
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,719
That means you're always alone.

21
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,320
That's why you have a hard time
getting along with others.

22
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,429
Do you think I don't get along
with others?

23
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:55,130
You're always lonely.

24
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,630
I'm fine now because I have one person.

25
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,969
I think I know who that person is.

26
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,239
You're right. I changed thanks to you.

27
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:07,239
I can see other people.

28
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,310
The housekeepers, the kitchen workers,

29
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,579
and the hotel employees.

30
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:14,049
They all look competent now.

31
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,219
Everyone working at the hotel knows you.

32
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,189
You must be happy because you're popular.

33
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,329
Why? Don't you like being popular?

34
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:32,730
No, that's not it.

35
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,599
- Jin Young.
- Yes?

36
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:41,170
What is it?

37
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,579
Every morning...

38
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:48,879
Every bright and pleasant morning,

39
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,920
I want to see you.

40
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,290
Well, that's...

41
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,770
Me too.

42
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:13,870
Have you had breakfast?

43
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:15,270
You haven't, right?

44
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,379
Would you like to go in
and have some coffee and light food?

45
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,879
No. I need to go for an important task.

46
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,680
You better cut down important tasks...

47
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,580
if you want to see me every morning.

48
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,949
I'm sorry. It can't be helped today.

49
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:31,990
I'm going to take revenge on you
for getting rejected today.

50
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,990
Sure. I'll help you.

51
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:35,830
Good luck, Dong Hyuk.

52
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,629
I'll call you later.

53
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,879
Are you ready?

54
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,490
Why? Are you nervous?

55
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:03,620
A hit-and-run like this...

56
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,919
should be done in big countries
like the US.

57
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,490
We might not be safe in Korea.

58
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,300
We should fly, then.

59
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,400
If we had a pistol,
it would've been perfect.

60
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,900
If you bring a pistol,
what would they bring?

61
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,000
Well, probably a shotgun.

62
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,340
Okay. Good luck, Leo.

63
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,409
Don't do something else
and pray for me nonstop.

64
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,699
Do I sign here?

65
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,000
Hold on.

66
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,939
Mr. Choi.

67
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,740
Where does it say
"double the market price?"

68
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,879
Here, sir.

69
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,610
I see. Sorry, Leo.

70
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,449
You need to look before you leap.

71
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,150
I understand, Chairman Kim.

72
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,490
When will the money come in?
After one week?

73
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,719
No. It will be transferred to you
as soon as you sign the paper.

74
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,490
- Mr. Jung.
- I got people ready at the bank.

75
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,500
Everything is so smooth.

76
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,670
I should've worked with you
from the start.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,800
I'll sign now.

78
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,410
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

79
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:30,139
(May 29, 2001, Grantor Kim Bok Man)

80
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,579
Yes, just signed.

81
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,250
Send money immediately.

82
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,980
Yes, he's double-checking.

83
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,850
Okay, thanks.

84
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,259
Just wait for ten seconds.

85
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,370
Yes, Manager.

86
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:58,439
Is the amount correct?

87
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,740
Okay.

88
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,310
It's transferred.

89
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,040
Okay.

90
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:07,350
Seoul Hotel
that gave me a headache is gone.

91
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,509
Yes.

92
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:14,149
Frank has no idea about this, right?

93
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:17,490
Good job, Leo.
He'll find out soon if the bank calls him.

94
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,620
You should run quickly.

95
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,629
He'll faint if he finds out
that we bought his shares with his bond.

96
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,500
I finished talking with the prosecution.
They'll cooperate.

97
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,430
Okay.

98
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,339
Yes, this is the front desk.

99
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,910
Hold on, sir. I'll put her on the line.

100
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,310
Ms. Seo.

101
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,209
Excuse me. Please help her.

102
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,310
Yes, this is Manager Seo on duty.

103
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,449
Sorry?

104
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:46,879
What do you mean?

105
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,850
Sure, let's meet up and talk.

106
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,089
Mr. Han as well?

107
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,529
"Debt-equity swap?"

108
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,529
What does that mean? Explain in detail.

109
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,529
I had the right to use the financial bond
that Chairman Kim had.

110
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,569
I made use of it.

111
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,439
I bought Chairman Kim's shares
at a high price with the bond...

112
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,339
and bought them back under my name.

113
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,009
In conclusion,
Seoul Hotel does not have any more bonds,

114
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:12,379
and the shares are in my hands.

115
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,509
It's even more confusing.

116
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:20,889
Basically, the money he earned
from selling his shares is his own money.

117
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,490
While the money was transferred
from his left pocket to his right pocket,

118
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,660
the shares were sold.

119
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,019
In the end, he got twice the money.

120
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:29,089
How can that happen?

121
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,600
The experts must have worked their magic.

122
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,930
It's similar.

123
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,569
Anyway, Seoul Hotel doesn't need
to worry about notes or bonds.

124
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,069
But in the end, we need to pay
for the loan of shares that doubled.

125
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,370
Where can we get the money?

126
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,550
I have nothing left
other than a piece of paper...

127
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,149
that says "Seoul Hotel shares."

128
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,449
Anyway, I kept my promise.

129
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:58,220
Thank you.

130
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,819
"Promise?"

131
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:01,529
You don't need to know.

132
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,199
Can we talk about something that I know?

133
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:06,660
Aren't you leaving the desk unattended
for too long?

134
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:11,040
I'll get going, Dong Hyuk.

135
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,339
Right, Mr. Han. I have a favor to ask.

136
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,689
Frank! Leo! Where are you?

137
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,019
The guests went out.

138
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:32,189
Out.

139
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,000
These rats.
Wait until I get my hands on you.

140
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:49,069
Will we be okay? We shouldn't lie.

141
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:52,980
We just followed Mr. Han's orders.

142
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,449
We didn't say they checked out.

143
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,149
Yes. I just said they went out.

144
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,319
Yes. I just said "out."

145
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:05,720
Geum Soon, weren't you nervous?

146
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,889
Of course I was nervous.
Kim Bok Man is a scary man.

147
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,759
With one slip of the tongue,

148
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,230
I could've gotten dragged away
and beaten up like Mr. Han.

149
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,329
Despite that, to protect the hotel,

150
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,399
our brave housekeepers...

151
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,300
You lied bravely. Is that right?

152
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,540
We didn't lie, Mi Hee.

153
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,410
- Yes. I just said "out."
- Out.

154
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,980
- That's safe.
- That's safe.

155
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,040
Out!

156
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,649
That's out.

157
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,149
We stopped him for now,

158
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,320
but will he just sit back and do nothing?

159
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,419
What else can he do?

160
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,190
All the debts were completely...

161
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,190
What was it?

162
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,230
Debt-equity swap. It became equity.

163
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,759
I know that.

164
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,500
Debt-equity swap happened
for all the debts. What can he do?

165
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,700
We must keep in mind
who is holding the shares...

166
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,769
that were swapped.

167
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,440
Shin Dong Hyuk?

168
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,710
We can't tell what he's thinking.

169
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,139
If he's really trying to save the hotel
and improve it,

170
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,110
or if he's going to toy with the hotel
and earn some money with the shares.

171
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,710
- He is...
- He won't take part in the management.

172
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,649
He promised Mr. Han
that he would remain a shareholder.

173
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,289
We can't trust him fully.

174
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:10,590
Playing with money is his specialty.

175
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,889
You don't know what might happen.

176
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:16,190
If you know that,
why did you go crawling under him?

177
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,629
Why are you saying that again?

178
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:20,200
I didn't go under him.

179
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:22,470
Do you want me to talk
about the Japanese Invasion again?

180
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,669
Forget it. Stop.

181
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:26,000
Everyone, stop talking,

182
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,610
and get to your shifts on time.

183
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,769
Housekeepers, out.

184
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:31,940
- Out. We'll go out first.
- Out. We'll go out first.

185
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,309
Let's go.

186
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,750
Is that so?

187
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:37,110
Good evening, Seoul Hotel. May I help you?

188
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,620
What? Gosh, Dong Hyuk.

189
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,750
Yes.

190
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,320
He has great English pronunciation.

191
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:46,090
Tell him that I chased Kim Bok Man away.

192
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,220
I chased him away.

193
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,759
Please be quiet.

194
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,990
Yes.

195
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,100
As a representative
of Seoul Hotel's housekeepers...

196
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,200
and all female employees,

197
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,539
thank you so much for the great deed...

198
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:03,610
that you did...

199
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,110
for our hotel.

200
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:08,350
Whenever you want
to change the bed sheets,

201
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,480
need more pillows...

202
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,320
or need more bathroom towels, call us.

203
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,220
We'll take care of it ourselves.

204
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,820
Tell him we chased him out.

205
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,559
So we want to strongly recommend you...

206
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,860
as the best guest of the hotel.

207
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,700
Pardon?

208
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:28,470
Yes, she's here.

209
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,970
She must've come in just now. Yes.

210
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,340
He must think
you're the only female employee here.

211
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,940
Hello? Yes, Dong Hyuk.

212
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,710
Everyone is happy to hear the news.
They feel grateful to you.

213
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,220
Yes, they're the housekeepers.

214
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,850
Gosh, he's talking about us.

215
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,149
I said, "Out."

216
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,559
Yes. Tonight?

217
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,429
I'm on the night shift today.

218
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:56,529
Ms. Seo.

219
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,830
I'll fill in for your shift today.

220
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,399
Come to work tomorrow morning.

221
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,799
Can I do that, Mr. Oh?

222
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,500
This is an order.

223
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,669
Mr. Oh is finally grown up.

224
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,879
Yes, I think I can find the place.

225
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:18,320
It's okay. You don't have to send a car.

226
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,750
Tell him to send it.
A limousine like in "Pretty Woman."

227
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:25,120
Yes. Okay.

228
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,269
Well...

229
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,600
He said he sent me something.

230
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,970
Ms. Seo.

231
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,210
Here's room service from Sapphire Villa.

232
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:46,539
Is this considered room service too?

233
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:55,990
- Oh, my.
- A necklace?

234
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,789
- It's a necklace.
- It's so pretty.

235
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:03,090
- It's so pretty.
- Right?

236
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,629
"I want to have dinner with the owner
of this necklace."

237
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,139
"I'll send a car. From Shin Dong Hyuk."

238
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,909
- Are you Ms. Seo Jin Young?
- Yes.

239
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,279
This way, please.

240
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,279
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

241
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,019
Please wait for a while.

242
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,970
As I said earlier,

243
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:55,970
I used up all my money
for this shares trade.

244
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,809
I can't sell the shares for the time being
because of complicated reasons.

245
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,379
I only have the Seoul Hotel
one-month accommodation fee...

246
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,480
I paid in advance...

247
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,889
and a few sets of suits.

248
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,690
I couldn't even prepare a house
to welcome you.

249
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:22,669
I have nothing now.

250
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,240
I spent a long time
to take a very long path...

251
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,210
and came to you empty-handed.

252
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,649
I love you, Jin Young.

253
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,200
Will you marry me?

254
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,750
Do you like it?

255
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,450
To be honest, I didn't choose it.

256
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,889
I never bought a woman's ring,

257
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:58,519
so I asked the employee to help me choose.

258
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,590
Did you ask the employee
to give you the most expensive ring?

259
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,630
I'm not that stupid, Jin Young.

260
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,000
Then what did you say?

261
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,940
I said, "Give me a magic ring
that would prevent her..."

262
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,269
"from running away
if put it on her finger."

263
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,140
And the employee gave you this?

264
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:18,640
No.

265
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,279
The employee asked,
"What's the price range..."

266
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:23,349
"you're looking thinking of?"

267
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,380
It can't be helped. That's their job.

268
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,220
So what did you say?

269
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,490
"Don't mind the price."

270
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:33,460
"Give me a ring that I can give
to a woman..."

271
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,160
"who suits me the best in the world."

272
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:40,430
I'm sure you got ripped off.

273
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,029
Next time, choose it with me.

274
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,170
You want another ring?

275
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:47,839
No.

276
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,339
That's not what I mean.

277
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,980
This is bad. I don't have much money left.

278
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:57,109
Don't worry. I make money.

279
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,490
I can rest comfortably now.

280
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,720
Of course.

281
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,519
You can take a rest, Dong Hyuk.

282
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:09,490
If I...

283
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,529
It's just hypothetical.

284
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,539
Even if something bad happens to me
and I get hurt...

285
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,809
or have to go far away,

286
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,910
can you always stay by my side?

287
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,180
What do you mean?

288
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:33,420
Such things might happen in life.
I'm asking just in case.

289
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,549
That's a given.

290
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:39,190
Since we're getting married,
I should always stick by your side.

291
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,490
Why?
Are you worried that I might run away?

292
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:48,130
I grew up alone.

293
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,400
I don't have an experience
of someone taking care of me.

294
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:59,440
How were your stepparents...

295
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,150
in the US?

296
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,609
They were nice people...

297
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,650
and faithful Christians.

298
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,750
They had two more adopted children
besides me.

299
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:12,859
They took care of us better
than they would their biological child.

300
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,559
But you?

301
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,799
As I went through puberty...

302
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,799
and as I found out
I had a different skin color,

303
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,940
it was hard to endure it.

304
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,480
When I went to the US,

305
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,980
the guys in the orphanage
made a slingshot for me.

306
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,849
It was made of wood.

307
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,180
You know what a slingshot is, right?

308
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:44,660
With that, 100 yards...

309
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:50,359
I mean, I played around in the garden
and broke a window.

310
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,200
I thought I would get punished,

311
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,200
but the stepfather was worried
about whether I got hurt or not.

312
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,839
He was a very nice person.

313
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,109
But...

314
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,980
when he told me to throw away
the slingshot so it won't happen again...

315
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,819
and pray together, I ran away.

316
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:19,359
I was worried
that he might take away the slingshot,

317
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,259
so I buried it in the ground
without letting anyone know.

318
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:23,890
Why?

319
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:27,660
The slingshot I brought from Korea...

320
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,869
was more precious...

321
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,470
than the good toys and food
the stepparents provided for me.

322
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:40,240
At night,
I would go to the garden secretly,

323
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,319
dig it out, bury it back,
and dig it out again.

324
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:52,089
And I got caught and had it taken away
from me.

325
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,259
What happened?

326
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,130
I snapped all the tree branches
in the garden in anger...

327
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,170
and dug all over the garden.

328
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,769
Then...

329
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:08,940
my stepmother took me...

330
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,650
to see a psychiatrist.

331
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:48,210
Dong Hyuk,

332
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,579
such things won't happen again.

333
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,789
Let's live comfortably...

334
00:21:57,819 --> 00:22:01,059
and joyfully with others.

335
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:05,160
You have the right to.

336
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:10,000
Do I really?

337
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,470
Will I have...

338
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,440
such luck?

339
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,309
You met me.

340
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:53,009
Dong Hyuk, come here.
Let's take a picture.

341
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:55,609
Hurry up and come.

342
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:58,049
Isn't it better to take a proper picture
in a studio?

343
00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:00,650
This is more fun than that.

344
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,450
Hurry up.

345
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,529
Big heads, get out.

346
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,339
Get ready.

347
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:20,039
- One.
- Two.

348
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,670
- Three.
- How will you...

349
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,440
(Wait. We're making pretty pictures.)

350
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,150
We're printing the pictures,
so do your best to wait.

351
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,849
Gosh.

352
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,019
Did you contact the prosecution, Leo?

353
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,930
Okay. I'm on my way.

354
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,000
We need to tie down Chairman Kim.

355
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:48,400
I'll do it myself.

356
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,769
Okay.

357
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,609
Hello, Chairman Kim.

358
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,019
Frank, you're alive.

359
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,619
I was upset
because I thought you had disappeared.

360
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,289
What?

361
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,289
You want to come see me yourself?

362
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,299
You're really amazing.

363
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,069
Of course I'm fine with it.

364
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,470
Okay.

365
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,109
Is everyone from the US so fearless?

366
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,849
Mr. Jung. Get ready to welcome the guest.

367
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,009
Yes, sir.

368
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,930
- I'm Leo.
- Hello.

369
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,230
Please come in.

370
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,279
It's a great gain for us...

371
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,750
if we apprehend a big shot
like Chairman Kim.

372
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,750
But we can't ensure your safety.

373
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,480
Tell me which part you need me to record.

374
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,390
It'll be great if the details
of the illegal actions that took place...

375
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,990
during the merger and acquisition
are recorded.

376
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,420
Is there no issue internally?

377
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:23,160
Chairman Kim has connections too,

378
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,529
so he'll lobby a lot.

379
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,529
So we're keeping this a secret
from the higher-ups too.

380
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,569
This switches on automatically,
so you don't need to touch it.

381
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:34,670
Should the censor switch off,
use this assistant microphone.

382
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,670
This is the switch. Push it up to use it.

383
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,150
Let me say this again.

384
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:44,279
If you record it,
it becomes important evidence.

385
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:47,380
But recording itself is considered
entrapment,

386
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,890
so we can't come forward.

387
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,019
I understand.

388
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,490
Tell me if you change your mind.

389
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:53,619
I'm ready.

390
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:04,400
Leo, stay in the room.

391
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,039
No, I better follow you.

392
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,509
You'll just get in the way.

393
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:10,869
Boss, think about it again.

394
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,339
We already threw the dice.
What are you saying?

395
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,980
You know well what kind
of person Chairman Kim is.

396
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,319
He must be very irritated.
He won't stay still.

397
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,150
Besides, the investigators
can't come forward either.

398
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,160
I know I'm playing a tough game, Leo.

399
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,829
We've only played winning games.

400
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,660
It's time to take up the challenge
and leave it to luck.

401
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,599
It'll be over once we fly back to the US.

402
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,369
Is this necessary?

403
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:40,470
We just need to leave,
but what about others?

404
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,509
What about the others at Seoul Hotel?

405
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,380
This is the only way
to keep Chairman Kim dormant.

406
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,049
This is my last bet.

407
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,380
Then let's go together.

408
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,019
I was always by your side.

409
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:53,849
We don't have much time.

410
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:56,390
Okay.

411
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,430
If something happens to me,
call Jin Young.

412
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,329
Don't tell her anything before that.

413
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,299
Is this the front desk?

414
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:44,069
Please put Ms. Seo Jin Young on the phone.

415
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,299
Can you tell me her landline number?

416
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,480
Hello?

417
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:02,289
Yes, this is Manager Seo.

418
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,160
They removed my shift today.

419
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,900
Who?

420
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,369
Why did Dong Hyuk go there?

421
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,039
Okay, I'll be there soon.

422
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,769
Please call Mr. Han too.

423
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:27,339
No, I'll call him.

424
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,549
Okay.

425
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:10,789
Did you call the district police station?

426
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:12,319
Yes, I told them to be on call.

427
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,859
If possible, we shouldn't come forward.

428
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:15,289
Turn it on.

429
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,640
Why would he do something so rash?

430
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,410
You clearly know what kind
of person Chairman Kim is.

431
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:36,650
That's how Frank is.

432
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,980
He puts his life on the line
for the last match...

433
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,250
and takes the bull by the horns.

434
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,049
Even though I knew it was dangerous,
I couldn't stop him.

435
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,160
What happened? Is Dong Hyuk fine?

436
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,299
I haven't gotten any call from him yet.

437
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:55,430
Tae Jun. Chairman Kim
wouldn't leave Dong Hyuk unscathed, right?

438
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,630
Jin Young, calm down.

439
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,230
I'm sure Dong Hyuk has a plan too.

440
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,700
Chairman Kim can't simply harm him.

441
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,769
Chairman Kim caused a ruckus in the hotel
saying he would kill Dong Hyuk...

442
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:02,910
if he found him.

443
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:04,569
Did you call the police?

444
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,380
We can't get help from the police.

445
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,750
- Why not?
- That's how the situation is.

446
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,750
Call the police, Tae Jun.

447
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,809
I don't know about the situation,

448
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:13,680
but Dong Hyuk can't get hurt. Help him.

449
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,390
Okay.

450
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,950
Please, Tae Jun.

451
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,490
Don't worry too much.
Everything will be fine.

452
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:23,589
You took out the money from my safe
to buy my shares?

453
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,700
Frank.

454
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,130
I knew that Harvard graduates were smart,

455
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,769
but I didn't know they learned fraud too.

456
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:33,670
You went too far
as to use the word "fraud."

457
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,769
Since the bond was liquidated
and added to your bank account,

458
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,680
you didn't lose anything.

459
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,640
Enough with the complicated words!

460
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:45,880
Why did you do this?

461
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:50,490
Did you think you could go back
to the US safely...

462
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,960
after stabbing me in the back?

463
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
What happened?

464
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,230
I'll explain on the way.

465
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,900
We need to meet your father first.

466
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,799
- My father?
- Yes.

467
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:10,509
Stay here with Leo.

468
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:12,039
No, I need to go too.

469
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,079
You won't be of help.

470
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,609
Calm down and wait.

471
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,109
I'm from Seoul Hotel.

472
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:48,480
We need to take Dong Hyuk out.

473
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,609
I'm sorry.
It's still ongoing, so I can't cooperate.

474
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:55,619
Okay. Then let's do this.

475
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:58,660
You taking your hands off completely
from Seoul Hotel...

476
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,690
in exchange for the documents
containing your illegal actions...

477
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:03,960
is the condition of my negotiation.

478
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,230
Negotiation.

479
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,529
Did you say "negotiation?"

480
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:11,700
That's how we both can live.

481
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,069
If not, I'll pass them
the documents I have,

482
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:17,240
and you'll be in trouble.

483
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,910
Look, Frank. Do you still not know me yet?

484
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:23,579
All the businesses I took over
in this country...

485
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,079
didn't come to me willingly.

486
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,579
I manipulated things here and there...

487
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,890
and did what others couldn't do.

488
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:33,859
Are you saying you can withstand it
even if it was illegal?

489
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:34,890
Of course!

490
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,529
Completely tearing the labor union
of Jecheol Chemical...

491
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:40,259
and rounding up all the directors
of Sangdo Corporation...

492
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,769
and stripping them naked
at the Hantan River in midwinter.

493
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:44,200
Mr. Jung. What else was there?

494
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:45,940
For the Junghyun Corporation incident,

495
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,470
we set fire to the chairman's house.

496
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:50,309
We got it. It's being recorded, right?

497
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:51,309
Yes, it is.

498
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:53,839
Are you done?

499
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,410
We'll be on watch,

500
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,609
but it's better
to settle it among yourselves.

501
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:58,680
Okay.

502
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,549
- Let's go now.
- Okay.

503
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:06,460
That was the case
that was taken care of most neatly.

504
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,559
You heard that, Frank?
We have way more than these.

505
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:11,160
They were all my doing.

506
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,759
There's nothing I can't do
if I set my mind on something.

507
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,170
And you want to negotiate with me?

508
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,970
Pass the documents about me over
to someone?

509
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,710
How impertinent. I treated you nicely.

510
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,049
What's that? Search him.

511
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,190
How dare you.

512
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:43,730
You're playing tricks now, Frank.

513
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,700
It's no use, Chairman Kim.

514
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,200
Giving up on Seoul Hotel
and lessening your crimes...

515
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,099
by accepting my condition will be wise.

516
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:51,130
Shut it!

517
00:33:52,069 --> 00:33:54,269
Even if I go to jail later,

518
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,109
beating you up comes first.

519
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,980
- Remove his glasses.
- Yes, sir.

520
00:34:07,819 --> 00:34:09,389
Most of the time,

521
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,460
I don't get blood on my hands.

522
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:16,690
Since you're successful,
I'll give you special treatment.

523
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,889
Hold him tight.

524
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,460
You jerk.

525
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,099
Come here.

526
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:24,099
Chairman Kim!

527
00:34:25,269 --> 00:34:27,000
Bring my golf clubs!

528
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,610
Not that one! Bring the driver!

529
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,079
You punk.

530
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:36,309
- Father!
- I...

531
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,010
Father, stop!

532
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:45,590
You... What brings you here, Yoon Hee?

533
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,619
Stop it, Father.

534
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,789
It's none of your business. Step aside.

535
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:53,800
Han Tae Jun,
are you still using my daughter?

536
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,570
That's enough.

537
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,400
Investigators are here too.

538
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,500
What?

539
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:09,780
The general manager of Seoul Hotel
and Frank are working together...

540
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,150
to destroy me?

541
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,119
On top of betraying me,
you're going to put me in jail?

542
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:17,849
Fine. Frank, you jerk.

543
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,619
- I'll kill you first!
- No!

544
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,019
Father, please don't do this.

545
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:23,030
Everything is over!

546
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:25,960
I beg of you. Please don't do this.

547
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,380
It's okay, Jin Young.

548
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:55,219
Why did you do something rash
without telling me?

549
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:57,750
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

550
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:17,710
Father.

551
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,110
Make up your mind and wrap up everything.

552
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,449
Do you think I'm going to leave them be?

553
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:26,449
These jerks.

554
00:37:26,449 --> 00:37:28,920
How dare they entrap me?

555
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,820
- It's all over.
- It's not.

556
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,190
No matter how much it costs me,

557
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,519
I'll take over Seoul Hotel.

558
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,690
I'll take over, demolish it,
and build a cemetery there.

559
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,530
Why are you so obsessed with Seoul Hotel?

560
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,630
My pride.

561
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,239
Business isn't just about earning money.
It's about winning.

562
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:48,369
I would rather fight until I die
and win...

563
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:50,239
than lose and live pathetically.

564
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,940
Is your pride more important
than your old friend?

565
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,750
What old friend? She's not my friend.

566
00:37:57,309 --> 00:38:00,179
She looked down on me
because I was poor and stupid...

567
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:02,489
and fell for CEO Choi's seduction
because he was rich.

568
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,949
And all she became was a wife
of a hotel CEO.

569
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,500
Ms. Yoon...

570
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:19,800
She's dying.

571
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,110
What?

572
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,179
She has lung cancer.

573
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,809
How bad is it?

574
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,179
It's at the final stage.

575
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,889
She even gave up on surgery.

576
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,360
She smoked cross-legged in a cafe...

577
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,630
since she was young.

578
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:48,960
She only has 2 to 3 months left, Father.

579
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,199
Even so, she treated me warmly and said...

580
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,739
that I could continue
to work at the hotel.

581
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,809
Even though I was her enemy's daughter,

582
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,110
she forgave me and accepted me.

583
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:03,750
She even complimented you,
saying you were a great man.

584
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,519
What does she know about me?

585
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,820
Why would she smoke so much like a fool?

586
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,159
See?

587
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:18,429
You still like Ms. Yoon.

588
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:20,929
Hey, Yoon Hee, You don't know anything.

589
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:22,230
She used to chase me around,

590
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,730
but she turned back
when she got sick of it.

591
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:25,699
I didn't even budge.

592
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,380
I...

593
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,980
am rethinking studying overseas.

594
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:42,119
What do you mean?

595
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:46,590
You'll have a hard time
because of what happened.

596
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:50,389
Who'll look after you when I leave?

597
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:52,260
Don't worry about me.

598
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,500
Even if the sky splits into two,

599
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:57,500
I won't even blink.

600
00:39:58,099 --> 00:39:59,800
- But...
- Stop.

601
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,170
Don't worry about it,
and go on with your life.

602
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:24,829
Dad.

603
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:31,630
Answer me, Dad.

604
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,239
Yes.

605
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:35,440
Yes.

606
00:40:38,409 --> 00:40:39,809
Actually,

607
00:40:40,909 --> 00:40:43,010
I really love you.

608
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,030
Forgive me for causing you trouble
until now.

609
00:40:56,389 --> 00:40:59,530
Hey, you never caused any trouble.

610
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:05,869
I'll look after you from now on.

611
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,269
You were always lonely.

612
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:13,179
I really don't have to
study overseas, Dad.

613
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:17,849
No, Yoon Hee. Go study hard...

614
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,579
and inherit my business.

615
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:25,150
You didn't forget your promise
to inherit my business, right?

616
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:26,559
Yes.

617
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:29,730
So go study hard...

618
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:32,429
and get people to say...

619
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:35,559
that you're better, smarter,
and a better businessperson...

620
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,300
than me.

621
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:46,039
I might not even be able to see you off
at the airport.

622
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,409
I'll go visit you
when I have the time later.

623
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:54,650
So don't get sidetracked
and focus on your studies.

624
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,090
Okay. I promise.

625
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,320
Take care.

626
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:07,400
Dad, take care too.

627
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,699
Don't skip your meals...

628
00:42:11,469 --> 00:42:13,239
and don't drink too much.

629
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:18,510
Promise me too, Dad.

630
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:22,179
Okay, I promise.

631
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:53,510
Thank you.

632
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,349
You helped me last time as well.

633
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,519
Consider it a draw.

634
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,849
I have a lot...

635
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:06,889
to thank you for besides this too.
Jenny, for example.

636
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,829
The fate I have with you...

637
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,030
is rather odd.

638
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:18,199
At first,
when I came to take over Seoul Hotel,

639
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:21,139
I thought you were a pushover,
to be honest.

640
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,539
Did I look easy?

641
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:28,579
I didn't think you were my match,
so I looked down on you.

642
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:30,610
And?

643
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:37,050
I never had any opponent
who gave me so much hard time like you.

644
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:40,989
You speak as if the game's over.

645
00:43:45,329 --> 00:43:46,559
I proposed to her.

646
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:51,570
I agreed with the prosecution
to leave Korea in a week,

647
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,199
so I'm planning to leave with Jin Young.

648
00:43:57,239 --> 00:43:59,039
You must find it hard to agree.

649
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,579
No.

650
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:05,679
There's nothing for me
to agree on a matter between you two.

651
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,789
But as a general manager,
I'm not happy that you're taking away...

652
00:44:09,789 --> 00:44:10,920
my employee.

653
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,349
Not as a general manager.

654
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:19,400
What happens...

655
00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:22,300
if we both get a straight flush
in a poker game?

656
00:44:22,929 --> 00:44:24,730
You decide the rank based on the patterns.

657
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,710
Spade, diamond, heart, and clover.

658
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:32,940
Is that the correct order?

659
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,739
I think so.

660
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,110
Do you remember the patterns
of the cards...

661
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,210
that you're holding?

662
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,179
What about you?

663
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:44,219
I covered them up a long time ago,

664
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:45,719
so I can't remember.

665
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:55,599
It might not be right for me
to ask you to congratulate us,

666
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:01,099
but as I worked here,
the emotions I felt about you...

667
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,110
How should I put it?

668
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,610
I thought...

669
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,349
that maybe we could become good friends.

670
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,289
I already have my hands full
with one friend that I have now.

671
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,159
Thank you for the drink.

672
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,289
Excuse me.

673
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:38,670
The guest said he could only pay
with this card.

674
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,710
Can you make a new one quickly?

675
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,909
We have the authorization letter
and the documents ready.

676
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:44,349
The person has to come himself.

677
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:46,949
We're the employees of Seoul Hotel.

678
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:49,519
Seoul Hotel? Give me a moment, please.

679
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,019
Administration Manager.

680
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:58,190
Then are the debts
of the hotel completely gone?

681
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,260
Yes.

682
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,059
I need to meet the bank manager
to discuss a loan.

683
00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:05,730
Then what will happen
to Yoon Hee's father?

684
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:12,409
Please look here.

685
00:46:13,909 --> 00:46:15,440
- Look to your left.
- Look here.

686
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,409
Now, stop taking pictures!

687
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,949
Mr. Oh, look at this article!

688
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:25,190
Kim Bok Man is finally arrested.

689
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,889
We finally got the hotel back!

690
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:30,730
It's so touching.

691
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:33,329
It's such a happy occasion.

692
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:36,329
So I brought the newspaper for you...

693
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:37,929
to read first.

694
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,400
It was on the morning news.

695
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,000
Pardon? I see.

696
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:45,340
Still, it's a happy occasion for sure.

697
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,079
Aren't you getting ready for lunch?

698
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:51,750
Okay. I'll leave the newspaper here.

699
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,420
- Mr. Yoo, this way.
- Okay.

700
00:46:54,849 --> 00:46:56,150
Please take care of this quickly.

701
00:46:56,949 --> 00:46:59,690
Hyung Man,
must you embarrass him like that?

702
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:01,289
What did I do?

703
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,389
Mr. Yoo was happy
after reading the newspaper,

704
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:06,760
so he came here running
with the pure intention to show you first.

705
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,760
"It was on the morning news."

706
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:10,199
Goodness.

707
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:12,329
Are you telling me
I should've held his hands...

708
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,769
and jumped up and down like a girl?

709
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:17,139
You should be considerate of others too.

710
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:19,139
Don't act high and mighty and frown.

711
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,710
Treat people with a warm heart.

712
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:24,179
- "A warm heart?"
- Yes.

713
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:26,650
Don't bite
and bully others like a hyena...

714
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,349
not caring about what others think
about you.

715
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,090
You're really like a hyena.

716
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,219
Lee Soon Jung!

717
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:38,289
Have you ever opened up my heart?

718
00:47:38,659 --> 00:47:41,360
Have you ever come into my heart?

719
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,329
Whether my heart is warm or hot.

720
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:48,840
Don't simply assume
when you've never touched it!

721
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:50,809
What's wrong with you?

722
00:47:50,809 --> 00:47:52,340
I don't mix business with pleasure.

723
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:55,679
I become a cold-blooded beast at work,

724
00:47:57,449 --> 00:48:00,349
but when it comes to love,
I can become a man hotter than anyone.

725
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:03,389
Hyung Man.

726
00:48:03,449 --> 00:48:05,849
If you ever make
another false assumption...

727
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,369
I'm letting it slide because it's you.

728
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:31,309
What goes around comes around.

729
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,619
What will happen to him?

730
00:48:35,619 --> 00:48:36,690
Will he go to jail?

731
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,050
We'll only find out
when the prosecution's investigation ends,

732
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:42,420
but he acknowledged most of the charges
and is cooperative,

733
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,690
so he might end up with a fine only.

734
00:48:44,889 --> 00:48:48,000
It's amazing
to see him back off willingly.

735
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:51,429
He was unexpectedly straightforward
once he changed his mind.

736
00:48:52,869 --> 00:48:54,840
That's what he actually is like.

737
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:57,110
He's short-tempered and fickle.

738
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:59,840
He's stubborn and acts however he wants,

739
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,280
but if he likes you,
he treats you incredibly well.

740
00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:05,250
I think he changed a lot
thanks to Yoon Hee.

741
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:08,550
Right. Will she be okay?

742
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:10,519
What if something goes wrong
with her plan to study overseas?

743
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:14,420
She's a very strong person,
so she'll be fine.

744
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:17,730
Tell her
to join our hotel no matter what...

745
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:19,699
when she comes back after studying.

746
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,409
Gosh.

747
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:32,670
You should knock before entering.

748
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,539
This is my office.

749
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:36,980
Still.

750
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:38,679
What were you writing?

751
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:40,219
My resignation letter.

752
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,920
I never wrote something like this,

753
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,519
so I don't know how to write it.

754
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:46,289
"I would like
to resign due to this reason."

755
00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:47,360
Just write that.

756
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,960
Submit it to Mr. Yoo.

757
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,630
Not that kind of resignation letter.

758
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,559
A special resignation letter for you.

759
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:57,469
I wonder what it's about.

760
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,400
I'm not done writing it yet.

761
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:02,070
You can get it when you come
to the dinner party tonight.

762
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:03,739
A party?

763
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,809
You didn't forget the promise, right?

764
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:10,110
You promised to have dinner with me,
just the two of us.

765
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:11,849
Is today the day?

766
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,380
Yes.

767
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,420
You're not going to avoid it again,
are you?

768
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,250
Why does it have to be today?

769
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:21,090
I'm leaving tomorrow.

770
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:24,559
To Las Vegas?

771
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:26,500
Yes.

772
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:35,000
Goodness. Must we say goodbye so sadly?

773
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:37,469
Ever since I became the team leader
of Food and Beverage,

774
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:40,610
I'd never seen an employee
as hardworking and competent as you.

775
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:42,139
- Let us all die.
- We should.

776
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:43,710
In the midst of jealousy and harassment...

777
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,409
- of your colleagues...
- Mr. Yoo!

778
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,050
Be quiet when your senior is talking.

779
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:48,519
In the midst of harassment,

780
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:50,590
you were able
to continue doing your work firmly.

781
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,289
With that spirit and passion,

782
00:50:52,289 --> 00:50:54,860
you can bloom into a colorful flower...

783
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,829
in the middle of the desert in Las Vegas.

784
00:50:57,829 --> 00:51:00,199
- This sounds familiar.
- It kind of does, right?

785
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,530
Thank you. I'll study hard and come back.

786
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,670
And make sure...

787
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:07,440
not to forget
about our time spent together...

788
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,699
even if you come back
and hold a higher position.

789
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,510
- You're finally getting to the point.
- It's so cheesy.

790
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:13,909
Look. I got goosebumps.

791
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,849
Thank you so much for everything.

792
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,980
I'm not saying this out of courtesy.

793
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,780
The short amount of time spent here...

794
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,349
is the most precious to me.

795
00:51:23,389 --> 00:51:25,750
Full setting, 2cm,

796
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,320
and the L-shape of your left arm.

797
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,730
These terms became so familiar
that they feel like my old friends' names.

798
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:33,030
Remember the name Jenny too.

799
00:51:34,429 --> 00:51:38,730
Actually, I wasn't mean to you
because I had hard feelings for you.

800
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,800
It's an allergy you get when you see
someone prettier than you, right?

801
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,840
Correct.

802
00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:45,440
Ju Hee, pass me what we prepared.

803
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,579
Here.

804
00:51:47,309 --> 00:51:51,150
Food and Beverage
and the kitchen collected a little...

805
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:53,719
to show our sincerity.

806
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:56,380
On the plane, buy some boiled eggs...

807
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,449
and gimbap.

808
00:51:58,590 --> 00:51:59,690
Use this for your trip.

809
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,190
It's okay, Mr. Yoon.

810
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:04,329
Yoon Hee. If you don't accept it
because you're rich, I'll kill you.

811
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,500
This is different. This has our sincerity.

812
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,500
Thank you.

813
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,929
But I have a favor to ask.

814
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,599
What is it?

815
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:15,769
- Hello.
- Hello.

816
00:52:15,769 --> 00:52:17,170
Mr. Han, what's gotten into you?

817
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:19,210
- I have a special dinner.
- I see.

818
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:20,840
Mr. Han, it's not that way.

819
00:52:20,909 --> 00:52:21,909
What?

820
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:23,980
The location
of the special dinner changed.

821
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,750
Please follow our instructions, sir.

822
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:28,219
This way.

823
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:54,440
The restaurant isn't closed yet.

824
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,909
Is this okay, Mr. Yoo?

825
00:52:55,909 --> 00:53:00,820
You're invited
as Yoon Hee's special guest now.

826
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:02,280
So just sit down.

827
00:53:15,429 --> 00:53:20,269
Ready. One, two, three.

828
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:25,610
If I knew you were conspiring
something like this,

829
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:27,340
I should've met you
at the employee's cafeteria.

830
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,150
I asked them to set a table separately.

831
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:32,550
Mr. Yoo and the rest went overboard.

832
00:53:34,219 --> 00:53:35,449
It looks good.

833
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:39,889
Have a pleasant evening, Mr. Han.

834
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,690
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

835
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:45,329
- Have a good time.
- Have a good time.

836
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,010
Aren't you eating?

837
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:07,349
Go ahead. I'll just watch you eat.

838
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,619
Yoon Hee. You're really pretty today.

839
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,760
You speak as if we met for the first time.

840
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:24,570
If it's someone...

841
00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:29,440
who will leave tomorrow,
will everything about her look nice?

842
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,469
I don't think that's always the case.

843
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:35,940
Do liking and loving someone need...

844
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:39,150
a certain amount of time?

845
00:54:39,949 --> 00:54:41,019
I'm not sure.

846
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:43,119
It must be different for everyone.

847
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:45,949
If you really love someone,

848
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:49,159
can you remain unchanged
even if you meet...

849
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:50,960
after a long time?

850
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,400
That will depend on the individual too.

851
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:57,670
Unchanging love.

852
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,730
Eternal love.

853
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,840
Do those really exist?

854
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:05,869
I haven't tried it yet.

855
00:55:08,679 --> 00:55:12,449
What's unrequited love,
and what's requited love?

856
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:15,780
Marriage?

857
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,760
Does it mean marriage is the completion
of love?

858
00:55:21,389 --> 00:55:22,559
It might be.

859
00:55:23,289 --> 00:55:26,059
Then what about a couple who breaks up
after getting married?

860
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,000
A wrong marriage.

861
00:55:30,699 --> 00:55:32,230
If marriage is the completion,

862
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:34,469
it must not break apart again.

863
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,599
Is that so?

864
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:40,210
That means marriage is not the completion.

865
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:42,409
True love...

866
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:46,750
can be completed
by the fact that you're loving.

867
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:53,219
I can do that.

868
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:54,860
By yourself?

869
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,699
Yoon Hee.
I hope your innocence remains unhurt...

870
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:04,500
for a long time.

871
00:56:05,269 --> 00:56:06,570
Don't worry.

872
00:56:09,639 --> 00:56:11,170
There's something I want to give to you.

873
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:14,079
Really? I prepared something too.

874
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,280
Really? What is it? Show me quickly.

875
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,150
Here.

876
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:24,820
What is it?

877
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:28,019
I didn't like the clothes I bought
for you...

878
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:29,559
when you first came to this hotel.

879
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:34,099
So I wanted to buy you clothes
that I liked.

880
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:38,699
- Like this?
- Do you like it?

881
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:40,369
Thank you.

882
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:43,340
I'll make sure to wear this
when I meet you next time.

883
00:56:46,409 --> 00:56:47,679
You're making that face again.

884
00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:51,980
What about your present for me?

885
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,949
This is mine.

886
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,690
Promise me.

887
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,320
Read it after I leave...

888
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,889
and don't come to the airport tomorrow.

889
00:57:04,289 --> 00:57:05,789
Don't call me as well.

890
00:57:08,929 --> 00:57:10,030
Okay?

891
00:57:12,869 --> 00:57:14,039
All right.
