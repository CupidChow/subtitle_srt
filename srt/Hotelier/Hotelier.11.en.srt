(Episode 11,
Between Misunderstanding and Truth)

2
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:21,730
How pathetic.

3
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,199
I have something to tell you.

4
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,829
I have nothing to hear from you.

5
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:29,469
Father, I have my own thoughts too.

6
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:30,570
Shut it.

7
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:33,070
Someone who has thoughts...

8
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:36,210
is working as a waitress in a hotel?

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,380
You have done enough to bring shame
to the family.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,350
I don't want to listen to you.

11
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,219
Just stay at home and keep a low profile.

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,799
Leo, we only have 15 minutes left.

13
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,369
Okay, I'm almost done.

14
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,909
What about the documents?

15
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:10,180
Darn it.

16
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:11,739
Three hundred...

17
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,750
Roses.

18
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,319
- He's really handsome.
- He's really handsome.

19
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,959
- I'll drive. Get in.
- Okay.

20
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,650
You'll clean the bathroom, right?

21
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,549
Let's clean together.

22
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,180
Let's clean the living room first.

23
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,120
Then pick up the trash
before vacuuming the floor.

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,390
Or you might get scolded
by Lee Soon Jung again.

25
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:00,459
"Can't you tell trash
and documents apart?"

26
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,760
Got it.

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,159
What are these?

28
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:08,699
It has our hotel name on it.

29
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,740
Manager Seo, wake up.

30
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,639
Oh, my. What time is it?

31
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,210
You can go home now.

32
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,680
Okay.
Thank you for your hard work, Hyun Jung.

33
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,150
Is there anything for you to hand over?

34
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,120
- Right, this.
- Okay.

35
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:33,319
Did you inform them
about reserving a meeting room at 8 a.m.?

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,729
Gosh, look at me.

37
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:36,860
Hyun Jung,
I'll go up and get ready for serving.

38
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,129
- Contact the banquet for me.
- Okay.

39
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:40,930
Contact the kitchen for the morning buffet
for six people as well.

40
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,330
- Okay.
- Take extra care. They're our VIPs.

41
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,370
Okay.

42
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:45,199
Is this the banquet?

43
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,169
Yes, we have VIP guests.

44
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,969
I'm sorry. I forgot.

45
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,909
You're seven minutes late, miss.

46
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:54,750
This is an important meeting with those
from the US. How can you be late?

47
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:58,219
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

48
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,319
I'm sorry. We'll prepare
delicious breakfast for you instead.

49
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,659
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

50
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:16,270
Get up.

51
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,039
Are you sure it was from that room?

52
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,169
Of course, General Manager.

53
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:24,439
Who in this hotel doesn't know
that handsome gentleman?

54
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,409
Everyone knows him
when you mention 300 hundred roses.

55
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,620
(Seoul Hotel
Mergers and Acquisitions Scenario)

56
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:40,159
(Shin Dong Hyuk)

57
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,699
Don't tell this to anyone
for the time being.

58
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:48,830
Yes, sir.

59
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,099
We, housekeepers, always keep quiet.

60
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,169
- You can trust us.
- Yes.

61
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:57,009
- Can you get in contact with Manager Seo?
- No.

62
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:01,409
- Put this in my room.
- Yes, sir.

63
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,819
- Hey.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Oh.

64
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,860
What's that?

65
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,100
- Jin Hee.
- Yes.

66
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,009
- Have you seen Manager Seo?
- No.

67
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,370
Okay.

68
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,750
Hyun Jung, where is Manager Seo?

69
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,750
She went up to the meeting room just now.

70
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,620
Since she went to the banquet,
she should be back soon.

71
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,149
- Okay, thank you.
- No problem.

72
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,259
- Mr. Han.
- Did you put the document in my room?

73
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,329
Well...

74
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:56,170
Mr. Oh took it.

75
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,000
- What?
- I'm sorry.

76
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,139
But I remembered something.

77
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:05,339
I think Chairman Kim visited
the guest's villa.

78
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,480
When?

79
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,379
Was it the day before yesterday?
It was pretty recent.

80
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:11,750
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I saw his car.

81
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,990
- Okay. Wait in the lobby.
- Yes, sir.

82
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,410
Thank you, Eun Kyung.

83
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,209
Dong Hyuk, I'll get going now.

84
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:39,209
Okay, thank you. I'll keep in touch.

85
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:41,209
Okay. Good luck with your meeting.

86
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,829
What is it?

87
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,790
This is a very important matter.

88
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,060
Can you tell me honestly?

89
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,860
I'm so tired. I need to get off work.

90
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,930
What is it?

91
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,899
You know, about Shin Dong Hyuk...

92
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,800
How did you get to know him?

93
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:09,670
I thought you didn't care
about whom I met now.

94
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,740
Tell me. How did you get to know him?

95
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:15,310
After you ditched me
on the way to Las Vegas,

96
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,509
I got to get to know him.

97
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,550
Did you know that he was working...

98
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,149
at Seoul Hotel?

99
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,389
I told him.

100
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:28,829
Do you know what he does?

101
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:31,360
Mergers and acquisitions or something.

102
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,029
What's important
for me isn't what he does.

103
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:35,899
It's how well he treats me.

104
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,939
Jin Young, he...

105
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,250
- Jin Young, he...
- That's enough.

106
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,879
Just like how you have things you want
to hide from me,

107
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,949
I don't want to talk to you about him.

108
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:56,889
- What did I hide from you?
- Kim Yoon Hee.

109
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,689
- What about her?
- Getting her a job...

110
00:06:58,689 --> 00:06:59,990
in Food and Beverage
and letting her stay in the villa.

111
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,589
You didn't tell me a thing about it,
do you know that?

112
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:03,089
It doesn't concern you.

113
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,259
The same goes for Shin Dong Hyuk.

114
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,699
He has nothing to do with you.
So stop asking about him.

115
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:07,870
Jin Young, they're different.

116
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,430
How are they different?
I'm so tired because I couldn't sleep.

117
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,800
Gosh, General Manager Han.

118
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,810
- Jin Young, are you getting off work?
- Yes.

119
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,610
Jin Young,
I heard some good news about you.

120
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,379
I heard you were going out
with the long-term guest...

121
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,149
staying in the villa.

122
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:31,060
Everyone is saying you really lucked out.

123
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,860
I heard he was such a nice guy.

124
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,129
Yes, he's very nice.

125
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,560
- Gosh, really?
- Yes.

126
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,730
Then it means you have feelings
for him too.

127
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,769
There's no way I would dislike a guy
who says he likes me.

128
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,470
That's really good to hear.

129
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,310
You were lost for some time.

130
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,740
That's good to hear.

131
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:56,550
- Manager Seo, hold on.
- What?

132
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,819
- He came here because...
- The CEO is looking for Mr. Han.

133
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:00,819
Mr. Han.

134
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:02,589
- If you see Mr. Han,
- Goodbye.

135
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:04,220
please contact me as soon as possible.

136
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,720
The CEO is calling him.

137
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:14,430
I had a detailed report about the guest
in Sapphire Villa from Mr. Oh.

138
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:17,600
Did Chairman Kim Bok Man send him?

139
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,709
From what I found out, yes.

140
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:24,540
Is it also true that he's close
with Ms. Seo Jin Young?

141
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,579
Yes.

142
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:31,750
You turned a blind eye
even though you knew about it.

143
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,649
You're such a generous man.

144
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,519
I don't understand how you,
of all people, knew nothing...

145
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,889
about something related...

146
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:40,960
to Ms. Seo.

147
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:42,629
I'm sorry, Ms. Yoon.

148
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:44,529
I'll find out about it in detail
and report to you.

149
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:47,129
This is about the existence of our hotel.

150
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:48,700
We don't have time to delay it.

151
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,970
Ms. Seo finished her shift yesterday
and got off work just now.

152
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,440
I already called her in.

153
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:59,809
I'm exhausted because I couldn't sleep
from filling in the shift.

154
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:01,080
Don't you know what this is about?

155
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,879
I don't know. Give me a moment.

156
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:03,919
Okay.

157
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,519
Ms. Yoon, Ms. Seo Jin Young is here.

158
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,019
Ms. Yoon, I heard you looked for me.

159
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,480
Let's cut to the chase. Manager Seo.

160
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,350
Do you know Shin Dong Hyuk,

161
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,320
one of the long-term guests staying
in Sapphire Villa?

162
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:39,649
Sorry?

163
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,289
She's asking
whether you know him or not, Jin Young.

164
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,190
Yes, I know him.

165
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,159
May I ask how close you are to him?

166
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:56,470
This is a very important matter, Ms. Seo.

167
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:58,240
Can you answer me?

168
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,210
I know...

169
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:07,139
that I didn't set a good example
as a manager...

170
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,779
by creating strange rumors about myself
and a guest.

171
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:14,190
I have nothing to say about that. But...

172
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,750
Continue.

173
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,759
But a personal matter...

174
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:20,490
Well...

175
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:23,190
I mean...

176
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,299
I don't want the company to interfere...

177
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:28,730
with whom I love.

178
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,000
What a joke.

179
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:31,870
It's such a great romance scandal.

180
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,470
Be quiet, Mr. Oh.

181
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,940
We don't have an impure
nor strange relationship.

182
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,149
We like each other purely.

183
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,980
Ms. Yoon.

184
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,490
I feel wronged...

185
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,059
getting called here
and having to tell you about this.

186
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:55,490
How is it pure in any way?

187
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:58,200
Is fooling around with a guy
who will ruin the hotel...

188
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,299
being pure?

189
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,730
Just how much money did you receive
from him?

190
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,940
- What?
- How much money did you receive...

191
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,769
to sell this hotel to him?

192
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,909
- What do you mean?
- Are you an idiot?

193
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,779
Do you think you can fool us...

194
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:16,980
if you pretend to know nothing
with an innocent face?

195
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,419
I don't understand what you mean.

196
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:21,990
Shin Dong Hyuk is a minion
sent by Chairman Kim...

197
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,590
of Hangang Logistics.

198
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,029
You hooked up with a guy
who's staying here in secret...

199
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,129
to ruin the hotel...

200
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:31,659
and gave him all the hotel's information,

201
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:33,629
your body, and your heart.

202
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:36,200
- Mr. Oh.
- Or were you promised the position...

203
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:39,299
of a general manager
by handing over Seoul Hotel?

204
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,440
I don't understand.

205
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:44,879
What are you guys talking about?

206
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,809
Ms. Seo, you know what his job is, right?

207
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,179
Yes.

208
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,179
He's a mergers and acquisitions expert.

209
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,120
And he only specializes in hotels.

210
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,320
Do you still not understand
what we're saying?

211
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:03,090
He's not.

212
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:07,159
There's no way he would fool me.

213
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:11,399
Smart Ms. Seo, are you blinded by love...

214
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:14,570
that you can't even tell
whether Seoul Hotel is dying or not?

215
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,840
There must be a misunderstanding.

216
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,240
There's no way he would do that.

217
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,279
Or as Mr. Oh said,

218
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,909
did you strike a deal with him
and get money in return?

219
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,950
How did things end up like this,
Ms. Seo Jin Young?

220
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,230
I'll find it out myself.

221
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,570
LA.

222
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
Are you alone?

223
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,350
Jin Young, what's your job in Korea?

224
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,590
I work at a hotel.

225
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,990
- A hotel?
- Yes.

226
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,389
It's Seoul Hotel.

227
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,759
It's a famous luxury hotel in Korea.

228
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:13,429
It's very beautiful.
You've heard of it, right?

229
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:16,230
Yes, I think I've heard of it.

230
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,870
I heard it was going
through a hard time recently.

231
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,450
Yes. No.

232
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,350
As you can see from the pictures,

233
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:36,019
they went under
a large-scale construction recently,

234
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:38,190
so it will turn
into the best hotel in Korea.

235
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:43,830
Tourists from Taiwan
and Japan are visiting steadily.

236
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,899
It...

237
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,470
It has a great natural environment...
A moment, please.

238
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,370
Jin Young, you must be tired.
You haven't gone back yet?

239
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,840
Is it true?

240
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:02,610
Are you here to take over our hotel?

241
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:08,019
Let's continue later.

242
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,919
No, I'll call you.

243
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,330
- Who did you hear that from?
- Just answer me.

244
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,470
Did Chairman Kim Bok Man
of Hangang Logistics send you?

245
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,570
Jin Young.

246
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,679
I'm asking
whether you're working for him or not.

247
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,649
Let's sit down and talk.

248
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:53,860
It was...

249
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:57,769
It was all true.

250
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,870
Jin Young.

251
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,700
You used me, right?

252
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:02,940
Listen to me.

253
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:06,740
You con man.

254
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:08,409
Stop lashing out and listen to me.

255
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:09,610
What's there to listen to?

256
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:11,049
You approached me,
knowing that I was working...

257
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:12,879
at Seoul Hotel from the start, right?

258
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:16,019
You came to this hotel
and treated me nicely until now...

259
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,389
because you wanted to use me. Am I wrong?

260
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:19,620
That's not it, Jin Young.

261
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:22,789
Don't get worked up.
Let's sit down and talk calmly.

262
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,090
Why did it have to be me?

263
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:26,799
Did I look like a pushover?

264
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,399
Did I look that easy that you thought
you could win me over...

265
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,000
with a few roses and expensive presents?

266
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,169
That's not true.

267
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:33,669
Everything worked out as you planned.

268
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:34,669
Good for you.

269
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:37,240
You must've been so happy
that you met such an easy prey like me.

270
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,539
I...

271
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:42,679
I didn't even know about that.

272
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:46,919
I thought you really loved me.

273
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,149
My feelings are true. Please trust me.

274
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,059
People who do mergers and acquisitions
or whatever.

275
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,889
Hunters like you...

276
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:00,299
tell lies that move people
and make them cry.

277
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,200
It had to be me of all people.

278
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,509
I was so foolish.

279
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:16,309
I want to tell you from the start,
Jin Young.

280
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,679
- So please sit down and...
- Let me go. You scare me.

281
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,429
Next time, go to a bargirl
who does everything you say...

282
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:32,029
as long as you give her money.

283
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:42,099
I'll make sure...

284
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:44,200
to get you citations from the CEO...

285
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,839
and give you special promotions.

286
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,609
Thank you, Manager Oh.

287
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,579
This is all thanks...

288
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:56,609
to Manager Lee's thorough management.

289
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:57,710
Of course.

290
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,079
Ms. Lee is a reliable pillar
of this hotel.

291
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,490
I'll request your citation as well.

292
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,920
Forget about citations.

293
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,690
Geum Soon and In Soon,
you guys are giddy over citations...

294
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,759
after killing your fellow employee?

295
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,299
Manager Seo won't be able
to get 300 roses now,

296
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,170
but it doesn't mean she'll die.

297
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,140
Do you guys know love?

298
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:20,970
Do you guys know genuine love?

299
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,970
Imagine how Jin Young must be feeling.

300
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,109
Ms. Lee,
you're covering up for Jin Young...

301
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:27,710
because you don't know
how serious the matter is.

302
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,279
She almost ruined the hotel. She's a spy.

303
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,180
If it's for love,
so what if she's a spy or a thief?

304
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,690
This hotel isn't a place...

305
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,549
that picks up after an employee
who's cheating.

306
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,990
I think he's right, Manager Lee.

307
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,859
I think so too.

308
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:43,960
Keep quiet.

309
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,559
I'm so sick of working with people...

310
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,430
who have rocks in their hearts.

311
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,240
You birds of a feather have fun together.

312
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,339
Goodness.

313
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,940
Mr. Oh, is there a reward too?

314
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,640
- Hey.
- How did it go, Mr. Han?

315
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,980
I heard she just left the villa.
Didn't she come here?

316
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,150
She didn't.

317
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,720
- Where did she go?
- Maybe...

318
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,480
- Where?
- There's a place she goes to often...

319
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,589
when she's angry.

320
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,710
Are you okay?

321
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:41,289
Do I look okay to you?

322
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,420
You look slightly broken.

323
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,089
Why didn't you tell me?

324
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,960
You could've told me...

325
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,000
before Ms. Yoon or Mr. Oh found out.

326
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:56,529
You walked away yawning
from the employee elevator.

327
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,970
You should've held me back.

328
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,769
Are you happy to see me in trouble?

329
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,380
Was it fun watching me getting toyed
by him?

330
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,609
That's not it.

331
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,380
You must be laughing at me
because the guy I bragged about...

332
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,480
is a guy like that.

333
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:12,549
I'm not.

334
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:17,190
I was worried about you getting hurt
because you really liked him.

335
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,720
I didn't laugh at you.

336
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:22,359
Go.

337
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,960
I don't need anyone.

338
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,269
- You want me to go?
- Yes. I hate everyone.

339
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,569
Laughing at me after making me a fool.

340
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,079
How can I work at this hotel now?
I'm so embarrassed.

341
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,509
It's okay, Seo Jin Young.

342
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,549
Don't get intimidated
over something like this.

343
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,519
Just consider
that you met a nasty guest...

344
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:47,819
and had a scandal.

345
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:50,190
I told you to just go without comforting
or sympathizing with me!

346
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,019
- Really?
- Yes, go!

347
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:57,359
I'll really go.

348
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:12,440
Jin Young, you're a big fool.

349
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,890
Where is Ms. Seo?

350
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,599
What's the matter, sir?

351
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:32,960
Please call Ms. Seo.

352
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,400
You can't meet her now.

353
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,970
Please go back to your villa.

354
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,140
Who are you to tell me
to go back to the villa?

355
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,170
Jin Young, I'm Shin Dong Hyuk. Answer me.

356
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,869
Sir, you can't do this.

357
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,940
Why are you touching me
without my consent?

358
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,740
Let him go.

359
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,819
You as a general manager could help me.

360
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:55,619
It's as my employee said.

361
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:57,890
You can't meet Manager Seo.

362
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,059
So stop causing commotion
and go back to your villa.

363
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:03,759
Whom I meet
is none of the hotel's business.

364
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:06,299
I'm just asking you to contact Ms. Seo.

365
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,170
Let's talk in a quiet place.

366
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,009
It's still my working hour,

367
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:56,549
but can I talk to you man to man?

368
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,730
That's enough, Dong Hyuk.

369
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,059
Money and business may be important,

370
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,670
but isn't it cheating to play
with a weak woman?

371
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:17,730
Continue, Tae Jun.

372
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,369
As you know,
Jin Young is a kind and innocent woman.

373
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,910
I don't know how much it will help
with your job by shaking her up, but...

374
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,180
What's my job?

375
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,150
If you really want Seoul Hotel,
you better deal with me instead.

376
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,880
I want to get Seoul Hotel?

377
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,519
I'll deal with you as much as you want.

378
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:35,220
I'm here to take over the hotel?

379
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,019
Or are you going to say you came here
for Jin Young?

380
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:43,529
How fascinating, General Manager Han.
No, Tae Jun.

381
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,299
How do you know so well about me...

382
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:48,700
and my business?

383
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,869
This is the first hotel
where the general manager knows...

384
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,240
about the guest's job in great detail.

385
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,910
Do you know how much I have
in my wallet too?

386
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:06,079
I don't know about your wallet,
but I know enough about you.

387
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,880
so you better not hide yourself.

388
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,289
You speak
as if you're reading all my cards.

389
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,720
Except for the ones up your sleeves.

390
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,420
- You were in Las Vegas.
- For a short while.

391
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,730
The house has a higher chance
of winning, right?

392
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,730
Of course.

393
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,130
And you're the house.

394
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,559
Because you came in here.

395
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,000
Then let's have a fun match.

396
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,470
- By all means.
- "By all means?"

397
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,599
Yes, by all means.

398
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,069
Since you know a lot about me,

399
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:26,970
you must know I don't play games
that I may lose.

400
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:30,039
Winning or losing this game
might not mean much for you,

401
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,940
but to me, it has 1,200 employees' lives
on the line.

402
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,279
She might be a hotelier...

403
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,410
that you can play with once,

404
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,019
- but to me...
- Is the woman included in the game too?

405
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:49,390
I don't care about the lives
of 1,200 people.

406
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,029
I just need to win the game.

407
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,599
Are you betting Jin Young too?

408
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:07,109
You better be well-prepared
to go against me.

409
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,200
Go away.

410
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:48,319
Manager Seo, is the rumor true?

411
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,619
You know, the 300 roses.

412
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,660
I heard the guy you're dating...

413
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,930
is staying here in secret
to take over this hotel.

414
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:04,730
Did you really not know about it?

415
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:07,500
What do you mean?

416
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:11,109
I just wanted
to know whether you really didn't know.

417
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:14,740
Isn't it strange?

418
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:18,180
It's strange
that Mr. Han you've been waiting for...

419
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,380
for three years came back,
but you're dating another guy.

420
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,890
It's also strange that you didn't know
what he was doing.

421
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:24,049
So what?

422
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:27,589
Are you saying I teamed up
with him, and...

423
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:31,430
Forget it.

424
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,329
Everyone becomes weak in front of money.

425
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:35,930
- Isn't that right?
- Hey, An Mi Hee.

426
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,470
Don't simply blabber just because
you have a functioning mouth.

427
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,670
What did I do?

428
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,039
It takes one to know one.

429
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,869
Do you think all women jump at men...

430
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,210
with an ulterior motive like you?

431
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,210
I can vouch for Jin Young.

432
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,380
You still don't know about her
after working with her for a few years?

433
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,579
Manager Lee.

434
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,920
You badmouthed her so much last time.

435
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,089
Why are you suddenly behaving...

436
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:57,549
- like Manager Seo's guardian angel?
- Go.

437
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,490
Just go home.

438
00:26:59,589 --> 00:27:01,390
Gosh, okay!

439
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,589
Darn it.

440
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,700
Are you okay?

441
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:21,539
- Soon Jung.
- Yes.

442
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:25,019
Buy me some soju.

443
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:44,069
We have an appointment with Chairman Kim
at 7 p.m.

444
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:45,740
Everything else is ready too.

445
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,869
Postpone it for one hour.

446
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,069
What about Eric?

447
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:50,839
He's putting everything aside
and waiting for your decision.

448
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:54,309
Boss! Hey, boss!

449
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,650
("Service Quality Management")

450
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,220
"Hotel Management?"

451
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,200
Have a seat.

452
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,339
What's this?

453
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,869
I was studying hotel management.

454
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,109
Studying about hotels?

455
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,180
This isn't your major.

456
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,450
I want to learn about hotel management.

457
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,420
Management isn't for women!

458
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:37,890
You'd like it most if I got married
to a man from a good family...

459
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,960
and lived quietly
without bringing shame to the family.

460
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,160
It's fine as long as you know it.

461
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,859
Stop reading stuff like this
and focus on your school studies.

462
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:49,269
Just because I'm a woman
doesn't mean I can't live like you.

463
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,369
What do you mean?

464
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:54,900
I mean I could inherit your business.

465
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,740
- What?
- The fortune you earned...

466
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,079
by working hard for your entire life.

467
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,779
Who are you going to give it to
besides me?

468
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,579
It's a waste to give it to someone else.

469
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,819
I want to strike a deal with you...

470
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:08,019
with my life on the line.

471
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:10,750
If you let me manage the hotel,

472
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,619
I can do what I want,

473
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:16,259
and you can rest assured and pass down
your wealth to your only child.

474
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:19,099
Anyway, it can't be that hotel.

475
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:21,559
You're going
to take over that hotel anyway.

476
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,930
Consider that I'm studying there
in advance.

477
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,799
Go study abroad instead.

478
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,069
Then I'll support you.

479
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:31,569
You're not in that position
with your academic background either.

480
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:38,250
Stop daydreaming...

481
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,279
and come out
for the dinner appointment on time.

482
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,930
Are you here for Jin Young?

483
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:30,769
- Who...
- I'm Jenny who's living with Jin Young.

484
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:32,970
I'm Shin Dong Hyuk.

485
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,410
I know. You came to her house
on her birthday, right?

486
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,509
You gave her an expensive necklace
as a present too.

487
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:39,779
That's right.

488
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,849
I'm here to see Jin Young,
but I can't get in touch.

489
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:45,880
Can you tell me where she is?

490
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,019
I don't want to.

491
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,019
Why not?

492
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:51,720
Just because.

493
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:53,319
Goodbye.

494
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,240
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

495
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,750
We already emptied a bottle.

496
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:27,059
Let's drink just one more bottle.

497
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:29,559
Okay.
Let's order one more chicken feet too.

498
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:32,460
Stop eating bar snacks.
Your face will get puffy tomorrow morning.

499
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:35,269
- I'll pay for it.
- Okay, then.

500
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:38,940
Ma'am, give us one more bottle of soju
and chicken feet.

501
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,069
Okay.

502
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,910
Shall we try smoking too?

503
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,009
Don't go overboard, Jin Young.

504
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:51,309
Ma'am, give us a pack of cigarettes too.

505
00:31:55,349 --> 00:31:56,519
She's incredible.

506
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,190
They look pretty good.

507
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,390
Why do they say nothing
when men drink together...

508
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:07,460
but say it's pathetic
when women drink and get drunk?

509
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,730
They're green with envy...

510
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,799
because we women are pretty.

511
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,640
Why do they smoke on the streets...

512
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,710
but point fingers when women smoke?

513
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:20,710
I said they were green with envy
because women are pretty.

514
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,380
Why is it cool for a man
to confess his love first...

515
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,650
but is shameful
when a woman confesses first?

516
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,950
Answer me, Soon Jung.

517
00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:32,789
How will we live without alcohol?

518
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:35,559
I don't know
because I've never experienced that.

519
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:40,130
Have you really never dated?

520
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,400
Hey, let's drink.

521
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:46,569
Stop poking at my wound.

522
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:03,589
Have a drink.

523
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,029
This is fun.

524
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,480
I told you not to go overboard.

525
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,309
Why would you try smoking?

526
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:40,819
Jin Young, are you crying again?

527
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,990
I was dumped by a guy
whom I met after three years.

528
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:48,099
And I was used by the new guy.

529
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,869
I'm so upset.

530
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,900
I just want to die.

531
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:55,740
Someone like me who's had crushes
all her life is still living.

532
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,470
Why would you die?

533
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,079
When people tell me having a crush
must be nice because it's free,

534
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:05,720
do you know how I feel?

535
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:09,019
Do you know how lonely
and miserable I feel?

536
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:14,920
So what if you get dumped?
So what if you get used?

537
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:18,090
You still got to hold hands
and kiss guys...

538
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,760
that liked you.

539
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,900
I still haven't had my first kiss.

540
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,599
Really?

541
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,139
Yes.

542
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:31,940
People say it's so good,
but I've never done it.

543
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,750
Give me some tissue. I used up mine.

544
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,090
Jin Young?

545
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,760
Yes, Leo.

546
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,699
Okay. Tell them I'm on my way.

547
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:59,440
Okay, I'll be there right away.

548
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,920
- Hello.
- Hello.

549
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,300
- Where's Chairman Kim?
- He stepped out while waiting.

550
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,699
He should be back soon.

551
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,639
Hello?

552
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,769
Young Jae, I can't talk right now.
Hang up.

553
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,079
I can't talk now.

554
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:55,289
You look very different from last time.

555
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,789
Work must be really tough.

556
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,429
You look different from last time too.

557
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,099
You look a lot brighter.

558
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,070
I worked at a hotel for a while.

559
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,800
- A hotel?
- Yes. Seoul Hotel.

560
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,769
It was just for a short while,
but I had fun working there.

561
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,409
I got interested in hotel management too.

562
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,210
Is that so?

563
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,849
I want to continue working at the hotel
and learn more,

564
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:20,619
but Father is strongly against it.

565
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:24,690
He is very sexist, you know.

566
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:28,460
So...

567
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,730
Can I ask you a favor?

568
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:36,469
I'm quite expensive.

569
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:42,369
Tell me. I'll decide the price after that.

570
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,409
Please convince my father.

571
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:49,150
He gets persuaded more easily
by people around him...

572
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,280
than his own daughter.

573
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,150
Especially, if it's your words...

574
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,920
Do you have someone you like there?

575
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,590
I...

576
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:01,659
Yes.

577
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:04,329
How did you know?

578
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:10,170
I can tell from your expression.

579
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,000
Hey, Frank.

580
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:15,539
I'm sorry I'm late.

581
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:18,340
It's okay. Have a seat.

582
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:22,210
Things are pretty hectic
because I'm buying over factories...

583
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,250
in China.

584
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:27,480
I was hoping you could help me
with the issues in China too.

585
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,989
Why don't you just join my company?

586
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,059
That's beside the point.

587
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:37,429
How are things going with Seoul Hotel?

588
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,000
Once we get 15 percent of the shares,
we can get to work immediately.

589
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,599
It's not easy to acquire a hotel.

590
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:49,269
Right.
Actually, Yoon Hee is highly interested...

591
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:51,010
in that hotel.

592
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:56,050
She wants to start running my business
starting with that hotel.

593
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,820
She always made me worried,
but she thought of something admirable.

594
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,920
So...

595
00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:04,650
I'm planning to send her abroad
to study more about the world.

596
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,789
What do you think?

597
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,690
It's not a bad idea.

598
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,630
You think so too, right?

599
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,630
But instead of blindly sending her
to study abroad,

600
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:15,769
it'll be better to learn more on the field
before going.

601
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:18,030
Seoul Hotel would be much better.

602
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,539
Really?

603
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:23,110
Do you really think so?

604
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,809
Of course it all depends
on whether she wants it or not.

605
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:28,210
Thank you. How can I repay you?

606
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:32,010
If things work out well
with your boyfriend, pay me with interest.

607
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:34,119
How much is the interest?

608
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,050
You said you were expensive.

609
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,820
Three hundred roses.

610
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,489
Pardon?

611
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:54,260
(To: Seo Jin Young,
Subject: The fifth letter)

612
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,000
(I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
I've never hated my work so much before.)

613
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,329
(Because of my work...)

614
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,760
Where is this?

615
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,789
Obviously it's a hotel.

616
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:27,260
A hotel? It's not our hotel.

617
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,369
- It's another hotel.
- Why are we at a hotel?

618
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,269
We don't have to serve others
at a hotel forever.

619
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:36,340
Let's get others to serve us...

620
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,639
and spend a night for everyone to see.

621
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,840
Let's go.

622
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:43,349
Here's your key. Do you have any luggage?

623
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:45,179
- No.
- Yes, we do.

624
00:40:57,059 --> 00:40:58,690
- Are you drunk?
- No, I'm not.

625
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,239
What's this smell?

626
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:10,570
We applied new varnish yesterday.

627
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,010
Then you should get rid of the smell.

628
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:14,139
Don't you know a lot of guests
hate this kind of smell?

629
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:15,739
We sprayed some odor eliminator.

630
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:16,909
That's not enough.

631
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:19,010
You need to use candles in this case.

632
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,550
- Pardon?
- Tell the concierge...

633
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,519
to turn on candles in each room
for two hours,

634
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:24,889
and the smell will be completely gone.

635
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,559
- Okay.
- And the room might catch on fire,

636
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,690
so tell the mouthkeepers
to check the rooms.

637
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,429
Pardon? Mouth...

638
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:35,000
- I meant housekeepers.
- I understand.

639
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,230
Take a good rest.

640
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,429
Wait.

641
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,170
- Our bags.
- Right. I'm sorry.

642
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,769
And put 3 or 4 more pillows on the bed.

643
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:46,639
How can you not change the mattress cover?

644
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:49,550
Educate the ladies well
in the morning meeting.

645
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,309
And...

646
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,679
That's all.
Send the manager on duty my regards.

647
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:58,420
Okay. Rest well.

648
00:42:03,489 --> 00:42:05,530
This is how it feels like
to be a guest at a hotel.

649
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,670
They must've bought new beds.

650
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,070
They must've redone the wallpapers too.
They're silk wallpapers.

651
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,300
The furniture is luxurious too.

652
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:17,269
But it's less cozy than our hotel, right?

653
00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:20,309
It doesn't feel comfortable
because it's too fancy.

654
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:21,940
Hotels and men are best...

655
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,250
if they are reliable and comfortable.

656
00:42:24,579 --> 00:42:26,980
You sound like you know well about men...

657
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,449
when you haven't even had your first kiss.

658
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:32,219
What about you?

659
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:34,760
Do you know so well about men
that you got dumped by two?

660
00:42:46,539 --> 00:42:48,239
(Email)

661
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:49,269
(Location)

662
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,579
(Finding a friend)

663
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:00,719
(The phone is switched off.)

664
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:28,179
(Haenim Toys)

665
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,179
Welcome...

666
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,690
Choi Young Jae, what brings you here?

667
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:38,250
Did Yoon Hee call you?

668
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,760
No. She works at your hotel.

669
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,920
Didn't she go to work today?

670
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:42,019
She went back home.

671
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:44,489
- Was she taken away?
- Yes.

672
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,199
Poor her.

673
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:47,730
Her dad is no joke.

674
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:48,860
Did you call her?

675
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,469
I did, but she didn't pick up.

676
00:43:51,469 --> 00:43:53,039
I'm so worried.

677
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:57,110
If she calls you,
please tell her to call me.

678
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,469
I definitely will.

679
00:43:58,769 --> 00:43:59,840
Thank you.

680
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:01,440
Choi Young Jae!

681
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,480
Since you're here, buy something.

682
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,079
You're my first customer today.

683
00:44:10,789 --> 00:44:11,920
Okay.

684
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:14,260
Give me anything.

685
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:17,190
Eun Joo.

686
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,929
You can gift-wrap it, right?

687
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:33,179
Who is it?

688
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:35,139
It's delivery service.

689
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:42,449
- What brings you here?
- Hi.

690
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,989
This is Kim Yoon Hee's house, right?

691
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:48,059
Yes, it is. Where are you from?

692
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:50,829
It's from Professor Choi Young Jae.

693
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:52,429
Is Kim Yoon Hee inside?

694
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:55,559
She's resting because she's unwell.

695
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,000
- Give it to me.
- No.

696
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,130
It's an important object.

697
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:02,070
I need to get it signed
by the recipient herself.

698
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,170
I don't think she can come down now.

699
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,639
Gosh, I need to get it signed by her.

700
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,949
Then I'll go in and pass it to her myself.

701
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:15,219
- Can't you just pass it to me?
- It's okay.

702
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:16,489
I'll pass it to her myself.

703
00:45:17,889 --> 00:45:20,260
Miss, you have delivery.

704
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,719
He says you need to sign it yourself.

705
00:45:22,989 --> 00:45:26,159
- Who was it from?
- Professor Choi Young Jae.

706
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:28,730
Right, it's from Professor Choi Young Jae.

707
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:31,530
I need to get it signed by you.

708
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,869
Okay, come in for a while.

709
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:37,610
I'm so thirsty.

710
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,809
Ma'am, can you bring a glass of juice?

711
00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:40,909
Okay.

712
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,480
Thank you.

713
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:47,719
Young Jae, you're so brave.

714
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:49,820
How did you think
of coming all the way in here?

715
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,989
I missed you so much,
so there isn't anything I can't do.

716
00:45:51,989 --> 00:45:52,989
What?

717
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,489
Your room's amazing. It smells nice too.

718
00:45:56,789 --> 00:45:59,059
Why did you run away from home
when you had such a nice house and room?

719
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:00,230
What's this?

720
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:02,760
I got this from Eun Joo's store.

721
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,099
It's a cushion.

722
00:46:06,269 --> 00:46:08,840
Hug it whenever you're reminded of me.

723
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,670
I'll give it to my dog.

724
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:12,110
Come on, Yoon Hee.

725
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,179
How is the general manager doing?

726
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:16,250
He's doing fine.

727
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:17,809
Didn't he ask about me?

728
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,179
No.

729
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,980
He's very busy
with the hotel stuff nowadays.

730
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:23,849
Since you left the hotel,
I didn't get to see him either.

731
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:25,519
Everyone's doing well, right?

732
00:46:25,789 --> 00:46:27,820
Mi Hee, Ju Hee,

733
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,460
Jung Sik, and Mr. Yoo.

734
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,530
And the kitchen staff.

735
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,360
You sound like you left the hotel
a few years ago.

736
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:34,730
It really feels like a few years.

737
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,469
I miss everyone.

738
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:39,539
Right, I might go back to the hotel.

739
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:40,869
Really?

740
00:46:40,869 --> 00:46:43,469
I'm talking with my father,
and it might work out.

741
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:45,070
That's really great.

742
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:48,440
Yoon Hee, if you come back to the hotel,
I'll treat you really well.

743
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:50,780
Gosh, come on.

744
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:53,150
Young man. Have some juice.

745
00:46:53,179 --> 00:46:54,349
Thank you.

746
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,550
Go now. You can go now.

747
00:46:58,119 --> 00:46:59,489
Please sign this.

748
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,559
Did she not contact you?

749
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:08,630
She didn't call us,
nor did she pick up the landline.

750
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,730
I guess she feels sorry to come to work
as if nothing happened...

751
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:12,099
after causing trouble.

752
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,369
What about Manager Lee Soon Jung?

753
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:17,869
Don't you know one rotten apple spoils
the whole barrel?

754
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:20,480
I'm sure kind Soon Jung was influenced...

755
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,139
by Jin Young.

756
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,619
Tell Ms. Seo to come see me
when she comes to work.

757
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:30,250
Right, what are you going to do
with Shin Dong Hyuk?

758
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:31,719
Do what?

759
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:33,059
Are you going to leave him be?

760
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:36,329
- If I don't?
- We should kick him out or take measures.

761
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:38,059
Kick out a guest?

762
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:40,400
We can't let an enemy stay in our hotel.

763
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,900
A guest is a guest, Mr. Oh.

764
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,199
If what he does
is hotel merges and acquisitions,

765
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:46,599
that's something to be fought with
at the business management level.

766
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:48,469
Once he's in our hotel,

767
00:47:48,469 --> 00:47:50,170
we cannot mess with his rights as a guest.

768
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,809
Why don't you lie down in front of him
and beg to kill you?

769
00:47:52,809 --> 00:47:54,380
I'll take responsibility for this matter.

770
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,210
Don't barge in and cause trouble.

771
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:00,449
Every time, I'm not the one
who causes trouble, Mr. Han.

772
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:31,380
It's 12 p.m.? I must be out of my mind.

773
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,480
I must be crazy.

774
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,780
- What are you doing?
- Oh, dear.

775
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,889
It's 12 p.m. We're late!

776
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:40,019
- Do you have money for the hotel room?
- What?

777
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:41,320
- I have.
- You have?

778
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,090
Hurry up.

779
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:46,960
- What should we do?
- I must be crazy.

780
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,940
- It's here.
- Let's go.

781
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:18,590
Sorry, ma'am. The card exceeded its limit.

782
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:21,360
That's strange.

783
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,730
I didn't even spend much
in department stores.

784
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:32,070
I paid for the cart bar. You pay for this.

785
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,980
This is your fault, Jin Young.

786
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,619
Why did you ask me to go have a drink?

787
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:43,019
Who's the one who dragged me to the hotel?

788
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:44,389
Why would you drag me
to such an expensive hotel...

789
00:49:44,389 --> 00:49:45,449
when you don't have money?

790
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:47,590
Who knew my card was deactivated?

791
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:49,789
Anyway, let's split the bill.

792
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,559
It's over once you swipe the card.

793
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,630
How can you split the bill?

794
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:56,929
You must calculate money accurately
even between siblings.

795
00:49:56,929 --> 00:49:58,869
Give me 100 dollars
when you get your salary. You got it?

796
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:01,900
It's over once you swipe the card.
Do you think I'll pay for it?

797
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,369
No way.

798
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:04,710
- I'm confiscating this.
- My gosh!

799
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:07,409
Hey, Jin Young!

800
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,719
You didn't pick up your landline.

801
00:50:19,789 --> 00:50:21,019
Nor did you pick up your cell phone.

802
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,000
Even if you're angry,
shouldn't you at least hear me out?

803
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:28,460
I have nothing to hear from you.

804
00:50:28,699 --> 00:50:29,900
Let's talk for a moment.

805
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,670
I don't have the time.

806
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:34,800
Excuse me. Even though
you're a VIP guest staying in the villa,

807
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,510
aren't you going too far?

808
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:38,510
If you think you can play around
with a female hotelier...

809
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:40,610
just because you have money,
you're dead wrong.

810
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,840
Let's go.

811
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:48,219
Jin Young, talk with me for a while.

812
00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:50,250
Let's talk, Jin Young.

813
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,889
Seo Jin Young!

814
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:53,820
Gosh!

815
00:50:56,489 --> 00:50:58,360
Jin Young!

816
00:50:58,590 --> 00:50:59,730
Jin Young!

817
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,530
Jin Young!

818
00:51:09,739 --> 00:51:11,869
Help!

819
00:51:11,909 --> 00:51:14,380
Call the securities now!

820
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,480
- She's in trouble! Come quickly!
- What's happening?

821
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,150
- Jin Young is trapped!
- What?

822
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:19,380
- Hurry up!
- Ms. Seo!

823
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:23,949
Hurry up!

824
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:25,789
- What is it? What's going on?
- Hurry up!

825
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:29,090
- My gosh.
- Manager Seo.

826
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:32,590
- We can't open it.
- Call the securities.

827
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:36,630
What do you think you are doing?

828
00:51:36,929 --> 00:51:39,429
I want to talk with you
without getting interrupted.

829
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,599
What difference does it make?

830
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:43,070
- You don't know me.
- I know you enough.

831
00:51:43,539 --> 00:51:45,369
Yes, I'm here to take over Seoul Hotel.

832
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:47,539
But I came here because of you.

833
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:49,010
Don't talk nonsense.

834
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,409
Listen to me.
I'll tell you from the start.

835
00:51:51,409 --> 00:51:52,679
I don't want to hear it.

836
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,349
- Jin Young, look at me.
- What are you doing? People are watching.

837
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:57,449
Forget about others
and look at me straight!

838
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,920
Look into my eyes, Jin Young.

839
00:52:00,789 --> 00:52:02,789
Look at me and listen to what I say.

840
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,360
Don't do this.

841
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:15,570
Just look at me.

842
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:21,579
Don't care about what everyone else says.
Just listen to me.

843
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:25,579
Cover your ears and close your eyes.

844
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:28,019
Just look at me.

845
00:52:30,989 --> 00:52:32,789
Can you hear me?

846
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:40,829
Are you looking...

847
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:43,199
at me now?

848
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:51,909
You're only looking at me, right?

849
00:52:58,949 --> 00:53:00,519
Listen to me carefully.

850
00:53:11,329 --> 00:53:12,929
I love you, Jin Young.

851
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,449
Make way.

852
00:54:10,949 --> 00:54:12,949
- He's here.
- Excuse me.

853
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,210
Jin Young.

854
00:55:00,139 --> 00:55:01,739
- What was that?
- My goodness.

855
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:09,309
- Be quiet. Go away.
- What happened?

856
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:11,210
Go back to your work. Go now.

857
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:14,550
She must be crazy.

858
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:15,980
Both of them must be crazy.

859
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,449
Mi Hee, you go away too.

860
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:26,699
Are you okay?

861
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:31,000
Are you okay? It seemed rather intense.

862
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,670
Didn't you bleed? Let me check your mouth.

863
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,250
What's this? What happened?

864
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:21,880
We got kicked out.

865
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:25,949
About 3 to 4 people rushed in...

866
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:28,059
and carried all our stuff outside.

867
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:29,960
They even took away the room key.

868
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:34,429
This is my first time getting kicked out
of a hotel.

869
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,000
How embarrassing is this?
