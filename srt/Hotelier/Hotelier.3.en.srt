1
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:32,799
Hey, give me my bag!

2
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,380
You jerk!

3
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,579
You like her.

4
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,079
You love her.

5
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,480
You don't know anything.

6
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,950
That's enough.

7
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,890
Stop being so stubborn. Let's go back.

8
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,170
I know you, Mister.

9
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,430
I know you want to go back.

10
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,009
(Episode 3, The Unforgiven One)

11
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,469
Hey!

12
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,780
Where are you headed?

13
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:01,889
LA.

14
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,219
Are you alone?

15
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:05,490
Yes.

16
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,189
- Get in.
- Thank you.

17
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,810
Thank you so much.

18
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:32,849
Actually, I was with my friend. And he...

19
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:34,789
He left me.

20
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,689
You mean your friend just left you
in the middle of a desert?

21
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:39,819
Yes. But maybe,

22
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,599
he was...

23
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,259
He was very busy.

24
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,460
Oh, really?

25
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:50,099
How busy could he have been
just to leave a beautiful girl like you...

26
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,000
in the middle of nowhere?

27
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,639
Stop it. Just keep talking about Eric.

28
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,979
I told you everything, boss.

29
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,979
He's got to process the deal
instead of us.

30
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,180
He won't.

31
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,379
You don't know him. He always has
something else in his sleeve.

32
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,550
I know, boss.

33
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,189
What do you know?
You think you really know him?

34
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,789
Concentrate on yourself.

35
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:14,659
Come on. Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

36
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,930
So we can use that against him this time.

37
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,430
Gosh. You were Korean?

38
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:22,930
No.

39
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:26,569
We are American citizens.

40
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:27,939
I see.

41
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:40,410
Mister, were you able to get in touch
with your friend?

42
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,420
Well, it looks like
he's on a business trip.

43
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,220
Why didn't you finish that?

44
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,259
Should we get going then?

45
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,889
You know,

46
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,930
I have something to say.

47
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,430
Mister, can you bring me to Korea?

48
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,240
I want to find my birth parents.

49
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,040
I caused a lot of trouble for you.

50
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,310
I know that we're here
because I messed up.

51
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,310
You know,

52
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,250
if you take me to Korea, I'll be good.

53
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:20,250
I can cook. Yes.
You know I'm good at cooking.

54
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,290
I can't live here anymore.

55
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,189
If I stay here,

56
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,430
I might get shot or overdose on drugs.

57
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,269
Mister.

58
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,540
I'm totally exhausted, you know.

59
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,839
I'm so sick of this life.

60
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,180
If I cause trouble again,

61
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,310
you can send me back to the States.

62
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:54,089
I want to live like a normal kid.

63
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:57,089
Please.

64
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,290
Please.

65
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,629
Please.

66
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,209
That's my weakness.

67
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:19,009
When I spot a mistake,
I can't overlook it.

68
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,379
It's always been my problem wherever I go.

69
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:24,250
Actually,
that's why I fought with my friend.

70
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,250
When things go wrong,
I tend to blurt out hurtful things...

71
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,319
even if I don't mean it.

72
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,860
And then I regret it a few seconds later.

73
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,990
You must be worried about that friend.

74
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:35,689
I'm not sure.

75
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,769
Well, shouldn't my friend
be worried about me?

76
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,430
Is that so?

77
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,769
What line of work are you in, Jin Young?

78
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:49,939
I work at a hotel in Korea.

79
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,009
- A hotel?
- Yes.

80
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:55,879
It's called Seoul Hotel.
It's a famous luxury hotel in Korea.

81
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,649
It's very beautiful.
I'm sure you've heard of it.

82
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,290
Yes. I think so.

83
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,019
I heard that the hotel
has been struggling lately.

84
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,389
Yes.

85
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,459
But things will turn around soon.

86
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,199
Throwing money at problems
has become a common thing now.

87
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,269
But our hotel has things
that money can't buy.

88
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,240
You should stop by when you're in Korea.

89
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,339
I'll make sure you experience
the best hotel stay.

90
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,509
Sure.

91
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,180
Excuse me.

92
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,519
Did you like the room service?

93
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,860
Pardon?

94
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,690
What? The room service?

95
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,330
Then...

96
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,970
you're Frank?

97
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,539
My Korean name is Shin Dong Hyuk.

98
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:14,529
Hey, I called earlier.

99
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:16,889
Can you check
if Ms. Seo Jin Young is in her room?

100
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,860
She checked in, but she left right away.

101
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,129
If you leave a memo,
I'll pass it along to her.

102
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,110
We'll just wait.

103
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:11,980
Wake up, traitor.

104
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,389
Jin Young!

105
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,389
How did you get here?

106
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:21,330
A rattlesnake brought me here.

107
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,889
It said anyone who leaves their girlfriend
in the middle of a desert...

108
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,559
should be bitten to death.

109
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,399
I'm glad you're okay.

110
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:31,039
How did you know I was here?

111
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:34,340
He called every hotel to find you.

112
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,840
He was really worried when you were gone.

113
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,549
Jenny, I'm sorry, but I don't buy it.

114
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,120
Well,

115
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,350
I need to talk to you.

116
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,950
I have nothing to talk about with you.

117
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,529
For the past three years, I had jobs that
had nothing to do with hotel management,

118
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,799
just like you saw.

119
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Despite that,

120
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,080
do you still think I deserve to be
the general manager of Seoul Hotel?

121
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,309
If I don't do a good job... No.

122
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,649
I might not be good at my job.

123
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:19,720
Have you thought about that?

124
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,889
No.

125
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,350
Why would I worry about that?
I know you'll be the best.

126
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:25,860
I believe in you.

127
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,129
I believe in you, Tae Jun.

128
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,370
You're so brave.

129
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,899
I know.

130
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,200
And reckless too.

131
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,970
I know that.

132
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:44,110
I agree with all of that.

133
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:47,480
If I wasn't brave or reckless,

134
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:50,679
I wouldn't have been able
to develop feelings for someone like you.

135
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,350
And I wouldn't have come
all the way here without a plan.

136
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,620
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

137
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,559
You don't have to apologize.

138
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:02,929
How should I put it?

139
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,370
Right. We're old friends.

140
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:13,970
Friends?

141
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,639
Yes.

142
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,320
Yes. We're friends.

143
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,690
So when we go back to Korea,

144
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,960
we should just stay as friends.

145
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,289
There won't be any pressure between us.

146
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,279
I look forward to working with you,
my friend.

147
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,889
Leo, it's me.

148
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:39,659
It's about the M and A case
of Seoul Hotel.

149
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:43,860
Call them right now.
I'll take on the project.

150
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,529
What's wrong?

151
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,100
- It's about Jenny.
- What about Jenny?

152
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,600
Can she stay with you
just until we get a house?

153
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:32,340
She's never been in Korea.
She seemed a bit worried.

154
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,509
I thought she would have an easier time
if she stayed with you.

155
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,720
- Just for a month or two until I find...
- No.

156
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,990
- Hey, Jin Young.
- Never.

157
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,049
Taking care of myself is already tough.
I can't be responsible for her.

158
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:48,629
On top of that,
I have never lived with anyone before.

159
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,090
I don't think I can do it.

160
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:52,230
I'm sorry.

161
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,669
Did you brush your teeth again?

162
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,840
I can't seem to get the stink off me.

163
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,769
- From the cigarettes and drugs.
- Don't mention that.

164
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:05,740
Jin Young, we only have two hours left
until we land in Seoul.

165
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,549
My heart is starting to beat so fast.

166
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:10,279
Of course, you must be nervous.

167
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,750
How many years has it been for you?

168
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,850
But I'm really relieved that
I'll be staying with you.

169
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,350
Thank you, Jin Young.

170
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,490
You know what? I'm going to quit drinking.

171
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,830
I'll quit smoking too.

172
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:23,559
Never. Ever.

173
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:27,429
Tae Jun told me that
you hated people who drank and smoked.

174
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:30,500
I'm never going to do anything
that you hate now.

175
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,000
I'll also do laundry and cook.

176
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,940
I'm good at cooking. Right, mister?

177
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,240
Yes. She's really good at cooking.

178
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,289
Unbelievable. How could you tell her that
without running it by me first?

179
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,960
But aren't you at least proud of her?
She quit drinking and smoking.

180
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,370
I nagged her to quit for two years,
but she never did.

181
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:03,830
I'm talking about Jenny.

182
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,570
Hurry up.

183
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,840
Gosh. I've never seen her so happy.

184
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,440
Jenny!

185
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:19,950
Sir, don't drop me off at the lobby.
Drop me off in the back.

186
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:22,450
Why?

187
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,490
I need to stop by somewhere.

188
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,610
All right.

189
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:55,120
- Move!
- Get out of the way.

190
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,490
- Watch out.
- Hurry.

191
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,059
- Is it all ready?
- Yes.

192
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,389
- Hurry up!
- Where does this go?

193
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,490
Hey, that goes there!

194
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,700
Okay. Bring in the vegetables quickly.

195
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,740
Be careful.

196
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,839
Sir, the hotel hasn't settled the tab
for this month yet.

197
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,349
I'm sure they'll do that soon.
Please be more patient.

198
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:24,619
Well, my company isn't doing
so well these days.

199
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,480
Could you expedite the payment?

200
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,420
And here.

201
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,359
So you can have a team dinner
with your staff.

202
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,930
Hey, look over here.

203
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,359
This guy is trying to get me fired
by bribing me. What should I do?

204
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,130
Should I put him in the freezer
for two days?

205
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,599
That sounds fun.

206
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,970
If you have money to give me,

207
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,869
buy some meat for your employees.

208
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,410
Sir, but still. Please take it.

209
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,940
Come on. Put that away.

210
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,509
Or do you want to freeze to death
in the freezer?

211
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:56,450
Or should I stop ordering
from your company?

212
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,319
I'll see if the hotel can settle the tab
by the end of this week.

213
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,619
Don't worry.

214
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,519
Take this.

215
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,309
You went on vacation
and disappeared all of a sudden.

216
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:26,640
I was wondering what you were up to.

217
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,509
You made yourself useful this time.

218
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,079
Goodness. Don't even start.

219
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:33,220
Do you know how much trouble he gave me?

220
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,519
Do you still like fishing?

221
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:40,490
Yes. I go fishing on my days off
from time to time.

222
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:43,890
What do you say? Should we go fishing
to celebrate your return?

223
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
Sounds good.

224
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:48,299
I'll get to have your spicy seafood stew.
It's been a while.

225
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,670
Right. Ms. Yoon must be waiting.

226
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,970
Yes, you should go upstairs.

227
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,809
We'll see each other often.

228
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,170
Okay.

229
00:18:58,779 --> 00:18:59,940
Hey, Tae Jun.

230
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,980
I'm happy you're back.

231
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,819
I...

232
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:12,059
- Is that true?
- Yes.

233
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,660
I saw him with the executive chef
with my own eyes.

234
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,829
That's a problem. A huge one, at that.

235
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,029
- Hey, go back in.
- Yes.

236
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,670
- Hey, Mr. Kim.
- Hello, Manager Oh.

237
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,640
Have you been well?

238
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,779
- Is your business going well?
- Yes. Thanks to you.

239
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,450
What's going on?

240
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,319
- This is Louis the 13th Cognac.
- I see.

241
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:41,250
Goodness, this was so hard to find.

242
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,319
- It wasn't easy.
- I see.

243
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:46,359
I trust that
you will continue to help me, sir.

244
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,589
Sure. You got it. You can go now.

245
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:48,589
Okay.

246
00:19:58,069 --> 00:19:59,069
Who is it?

247
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,269
It's me, Manager Oh.

248
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,269
Don't barge in like that.

249
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,880
You startled me.

250
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:10,349
Well, I had to barge in
because this is a time-sensitive matter.

251
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:11,349
What?

252
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:15,990
- Pardon?
- The door.

253
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,859
Right.

254
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,869
- What's this about?
- Well,

255
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,509
he's back.

256
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:36,640
Who?

257
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,309
- Han Tae Jun.
- Han...

258
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,779
What? Who's back?

259
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,349
Han Tae Jun.

260
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:51,789
Manager Seo took him to the CEO's office.

261
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:53,690
- Han Tae Jun.
- He must have been...

262
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,990
the general manager
Ms. Yoon hired from the US.

263
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,160
- Han Tae Jun.
- Gosh.

264
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,930
How could she hire someone
with his history?

265
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,529
Gosh. That's so vulgar.

266
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:05,740
Why would you say something like that?

267
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,269
Does he deserve to be punished
for what happened?

268
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:09,670
It wasn't his fault.

269
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,069
He's handsome and well-mannered.

270
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,740
So naturally,
women threw themselves at him.

271
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,910
That can't be his fault.

272
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:17,549
Women who don't know their place
are the problems.

273
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,319
She's sick.

274
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,519
So how did he seem?

275
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,089
Has he changed a lot from before?

276
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:25,289
How did he look?

277
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,920
A handsome face never goes anywhere.

278
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,960
He's lost some weight,
but he seemed healthy.

279
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,259
Is that so?

280
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,140
I must have had
too much to drink last night.

281
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,140
My makeup looks awful.

282
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:50,079
How do I look?

283
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:57,019
Come in.

284
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,599
I'm glad you're back.

285
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:09,069
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- No.

286
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:11,329
I'm grateful that you even came back.

287
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:14,539
I'm sorry to ask you to come back
when we're struggling.

288
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,210
But I'm so happy to see you again.

289
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:20,480
I prepared your uniform, Manager Han.

290
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,349
We still had one in your size
in our dressing room.

291
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,150
By the way, you've lost weight.

292
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,579
Try it on.
And if it's too big, let's fix that.

293
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,559
Jin Young, call everyone
to assemble in the conference room.

294
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,319
We should introduce
our new general manager.

295
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:43,200
Ms. Seo, is it true?

296
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,740
Is it true that Han Tae Jun is coming back
as the general manager?

297
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,369
Sit down. He'll come down with Ms. Yoon.

298
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,609
They are determined
to drive down the hotel.

299
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,250
Does everyone know
why that jerk was kicked out of the hotel?

300
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,920
He hit on a guest
and ruined the hotel's reputation.

301
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
That's why he got fired.

302
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,759
But he's coming back
as the general manager?

303
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:13,230
- Do you want the hotel to go down?
- Manager Oh.

304
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,529
I would have been more understanding
if he had stolen money.

305
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,599
How could he try to force himself
on a woman?

306
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,769
How can a hotelier do that?
Don't you agree?

307
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,309
Manager Oh.

308
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,210
Don't you think you're being too harsh?

309
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,839
Everything I said is true.

310
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,150
No, it's not.

311
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,910
What happened three years ago
wasn't his fault.

312
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,420
You all know that the guest...

313
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,450
was known to fool around with other men.

314
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,420
Is that his fault for having bad luck
and falling into her trap?

315
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,460
Listen. He was caught red-handed.

316
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:46,829
If you get caught red-handed,
will you resign as well?

317
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:48,900
What?

318
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,200
All right. Mr. Han...

319
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:55,670
left an indelible stain
on our hotel's reputation.

320
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,880
As Manager Oh pointed out just now,

321
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,339
I would have been more understanding
if he had stolen money.

322
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,849
But this is a matter
of a hotelier's ethics...

323
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:05,819
and our hotel's pride.

324
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,779
Our hotel may be struggling right now,

325
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,720
but having a man with his past
as our general manager...

326
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,890
cannot happen.

327
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,960
Exactly, my point.

328
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,319
From what I heard outside,
you all seem to know...

329
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:42,450
what this meeting is about.
I won't drag this out.

330
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,690
As you know,
General Manager Han Tae Jun...

331
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:49,460
is the most distinguished hotelier...

332
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,559
at hotel operation and management.

333
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,829
From what I remember,

334
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:56,799
the late CEO also trusted him
more than anyone.

335
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,170
Mr. Han Tae Jun made a tough decision...

336
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,910
to come back when our hotel is struggling.

337
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,210
I would like to express
my gratitude to him.

338
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,380
I'm sorry, ma'am.

339
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,980
I cannot accept this appointment.

340
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:10,349
- Manager Oh.
- Putting everything aside,

341
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,019
you should only consider what would happen
to our hotel's reputation...

342
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,890
if he were to get appointed
as the general manager.

343
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:19,190
I'm sure things will get worse
to the point that you can't fix it.

344
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,559
If you insist on hiring Mr. Han Tae Jun
despite my advice...

345
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,660
Fine. I will resign.

346
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,170
I will also join Manager Oh.

347
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,740
I now know
what Yoon Dong Sook values the most.

348
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,369
She values Han Tae Jun more than...

349
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:11,369
all of us combined, doesn't she?

350
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,740
I have spent the last decade
working my head off for this hotel.

351
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,250
She won't heed any advice
from a mere team leader like me.

352
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,680
It's all very clear to me now.

353
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
Okay.

354
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:24,220
It's time for us
to turn in our resignation letters.

355
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,960
Why would we do that?
We're not going to resign for that jerk.

356
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,960
But you said you were going to...

357
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,490
I was trying to make a point.

358
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,259
Do you think I'm mad? Why would I give
my position away for that jerk?

359
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,000
Besides, if we do resign,

360
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,829
do you think we'll be able to find a job?

361
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:40,369
Well, that's...

362
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,480
Tell them I'm far from leaving this place.

363
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:49,410
I will not back down this easily
no matter what happens.

364
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,210
Do you have a plan in mind?

365
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,289
This is Oh Hyung Man.

366
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,759
Hey, Young Jae.

367
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,730
Yes. Okay.

368
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,730
Okay. I'll be in the lobby.

369
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,670
The heir of Seoul Hotel is under my thumb.

370
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,509
- Hello.
- Hello.

371
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,410
Ma'am.

372
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:53,809
What's Han Tae Jun doing right now?

373
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:56,109
He went up to his room.

374
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:58,049
He said he wanted to be alone.

375
00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:00,049
He must have been really upset.

376
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:02,319
He heard everything
they were saying in the conference room.

377
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:05,490
If I were him, I would have marched
in there and beaten them up.

378
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,730
What do we do with Manager Oh
and Team Leader Yoo?

379
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,630
They're not the problems.
It's Han Tae Jun.

380
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,400
What they said knocked his confidence.
I'm worried if he'll be able...

381
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,500
to restore his confidence.

382
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:25,940
He's here.

383
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:35,349
As you requested, we prepared a car.
What do you think? Is it to your liking?

384
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:36,619
It's excellent.

385
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:39,759
Twenty years, boss.

386
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:41,359
Twenty-one.

387
00:28:45,829 --> 00:28:47,029
It's been 21 years.

388
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,980
- They are here, sir.
- Okay. Show them in.

389
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,250
Oh, right.

390
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:09,549
What's on my schedule for this afternoon?

391
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,890
You have a meeting at 3 p.m.
with the branch manager from Shanghai.

392
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:12,960
Anything else?

393
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:15,529
Well, it's Yoon Hee's birthday today.

394
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:16,990
What?

395
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:24,930
Okay. Tell my guests from the US
to give me three minutes.

396
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,970
Yes, sir.

397
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:27,670
Call my house.

398
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:40,480
Young lady, there's a call for you.

399
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:44,450
It's your father.

400
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:53,130
Yes, Father.

401
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,230
Hey, Yoon Hee. Happy birthday.

402
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,200
Why don't we have dinner together today?

403
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:00,200
You like Italian food, right?

404
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:04,539
No. Don't worry. I'm not busy.

405
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,910
No matter how busy I am,
I'll take you out on a date today.

406
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,349
Okay. I promise.

407
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:13,920
I'll send you a car.

408
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,650
You'll come after school?

409
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:19,319
Okay. Take a cab, then.

410
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,490
You know the restaurant, right?

411
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,589
Yes.

412
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,369
Did you tell him that...

413
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:32,799
it was my birthday today?

414
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,869
No. I didn't.

415
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:36,970
Okay.

416
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:34,430
Goodness. I'm so sorry.

417
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,269
It's nice to meet you.

418
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,099
- My name is Shin Dong Hyuk.
- I'm Kim Bok Man.

419
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:42,569
You look much younger in person
than in the picture from the newspaper.

420
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:46,539
- This is my business partner, Leo.
- Leo. Nice to meet you.

421
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:47,809
Do you speak English?

422
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,950
Okay. My full name is Leonardo Park.

423
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,849
I have the same name as Leonardo da Vinci.

424
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:55,220
I look like him too, don't I?

425
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:57,720
You can call me Leo for short.

426
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,119
All right. Why don't we sit down then?

427
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:05,799
I got you an office which will be
available for you starting tomorrow.

428
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,000
It's the one next to mine.

429
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,130
I also got you the royal suite
at Radisson Hotel.

430
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,730
I'm sure it will be to your liking.

431
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:13,400
I got you a car too.

432
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,240
Do you need anything else?

433
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,039
I will stay at Seoul Hotel.

434
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,480
I can also work there.

435
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,279
I don't want you to tell anyone about me
or our business relationship...

436
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:23,579
to anyone.

437
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,619
Pay special attention to Seoul Hotel,
so they don't find out about me.

438
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,650
So you want to conduct
some preliminary research in secret.

439
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,990
Hide-and-seek.

440
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:33,160
What's that in Korean?

441
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:36,089
Right. It's like hide-and-seek.

442
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,430
Blindfold our opponents
and make them trip.

443
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,170
Let's do that.

444
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:46,099
All right.
When will you start the process then?

445
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:48,170
We need three weeks to warm up.

446
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,410
We'll load up our gun
for these three weeks.

447
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:53,079
Then we'll start firing. Bang.

448
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,880
I do have one question.

449
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,349
Why Seoul Hotel?

450
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,849
Are you truly interested
in the hotel business or...

451
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:04,990
Or what?

452
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:12,630
Fine.

453
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,299
I'll tell you the truth.

454
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:16,630
I'm in logistics.

455
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:19,700
I just have to buy things at low prices
and sell them at higher prices.

456
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,940
so I'll be happy
as long as I make a lot of profit.

457
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,069
Why would I want to run a hotel?
It will only give me a headache.

458
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,980
Then you don't need me here.

459
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,880
This is a 300-million-dollar deal.
It's not a small case.

460
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,589
In Korea,
aren't those people called realtors?

461
00:33:38,589 --> 00:33:40,890
I didn't fly over the Pacific Ocean
just to acquire one hotel.

462
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,130
Then what is it?

463
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:11,920
Gosh. It's like you read my mind.

464
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,559
To be honest, I had the same idea.

465
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:18,230
We do see eye to eye on many things.

466
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,099
I agree too.

467
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,800
- We're partners.
- Frank.

468
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,429
No. Mr. Shin.

469
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,769
Can I address you casually from now on?

470
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:29,840
Great.

471
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,710
Let me pour you a drink.

472
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,849
All right. Cheers.

473
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:54,760
- Sir, you have a phone call.
- What?

474
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,300
Leave us be.

475
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,130
Sorry about that.

476
00:36:29,429 --> 00:36:30,829
Hey, Eun Joo. It's me.

477
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:32,630
What are you doing tonight?

478
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,030
Me? Take a wild guess.
Of course, I'm at the store.

479
00:36:35,929 --> 00:36:38,400
I stayed out all night,
and my mom caught me sneaking in.

480
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,539
Don't even start.

481
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:43,110
She even threatened to hit me
with my brother's baseball bat.

482
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,039
What?

483
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,809
What are you up to?

484
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,550
Really? Great. Come out then.

485
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:52,619
Don't worry.

486
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:54,679
If she catches me sneaking in again,
I'll let her hit me this time.

487
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:57,289
Who are these roses for? Is that her?

488
00:36:58,619 --> 00:36:59,619
No.

489
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:00,989
Then who are they for?

490
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,460
Did you get stood up?

491
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:03,960
Should I throw away these flowers?

492
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:06,260
Gosh. You guys.

493
00:37:13,969 --> 00:37:16,639
- Welcome.
- Gosh. I see pretty girls here tonight.

494
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,539
You should have high standards.

495
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:20,079
It's that girl again.

496
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,750
- Who?
- Over there. The red pants from Itaewon.

497
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,050
She's gotten prettier.
Did she go under the knife?

498
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:28,880
Hey, who's that? She's new here.

499
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,150
Where? Gosh. The one with long hair?

500
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:32,989
They both have long hair.

501
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,389
Surprised?

502
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,630
Happy birthday, Yoon Hee.

503
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,730
I didn't tell you. How did you know?

504
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,730
That's why you'll starve without me.

505
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,000
I even got you a gift. Ta-da.

506
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:48,639
Of course, I stole one.
My mom doesn't know.

507
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:50,039
Thanks.

508
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,510
Blow out the candles.

509
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:53,679
Come on.

510
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,349
She looks fine.

511
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,659
- Hey, give me the flowers.
- What?

512
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:08,559
- Why?
- Give them to me.

513
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:13,929
What was that?

514
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,139
Gosh. I'm sorry.

515
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,010
Hey.

516
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:29,380
Happy birthday.

517
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,210
Here.

518
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:53,440
Hey.

519
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:55,769
I would like to talk to you.

520
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:57,539
- About what?
- I have nothing to talk about with you.

521
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,280
Stop playing hard-to-get. Just get in.

522
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,639
- Hey, hop in!
- Stop it.

523
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,190
You know...

524
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,820
I'm not interested
in a bellboy at a hotel.

525
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:14,719
Hey, he's not a bellboy at a hotel.

526
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,090
Be quiet.

527
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,199
Okay. Yes. I'm not a bellboy at a hotel.

528
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,000
I'm a bellman.

529
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:24,500
What's that?

530
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:27,099
So what? What do you want from me?

531
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:28,400
I'm looking for someone.

532
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,239
Well,

533
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:35,179
a woman who wants
the best birthday party in the world.

534
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,650
That's you.

535
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,280
Gosh.

536
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,070
You've been doing this all day?

537
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:40,010
Shouldn't you be working?

538
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,750
I should have thought about this.

539
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,550
Coming back here...

540
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,989
wasn't as easy as it sounded.

541
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:55,989
They still haven't forgotten
what happened three years ago.

542
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:59,760
And no one has forgiven me for that.

543
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,900
So what?

544
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,269
I should reconsider.

545
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,869
Reconsider what?

546
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,000
You decided to come back, and you did.

547
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,969
All you have left to do is
to start working. What do you mean?

548
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:14,010
I'm not sure if I'm the person
the hotel really needs.

549
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,860
When I was struggling
at the beginning of my career here,

550
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,829
do you remember what you told me?

551
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:40,139
"Your relationship with people..."

552
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:42,769
"depends on how you behave."

553
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,440
"If you act like an owner,
you will be treated as one."

554
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:51,880
"If you act like a servant,
you will be treated as one."

555
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:56,090
If you keep acting guilty,

556
00:41:56,849 --> 00:42:00,159
people will think of you as guilty.

557
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:02,760
Will you be okay with that?

558
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:16,510
Manager Seo.

559
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,440
Yes. This is Duty Assistant Manager Seo.

560
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:21,039
There's an incident
in Room 203 on the 6th floor.

561
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,050
- A guest passed out from a heart attack.
- What?

562
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,809
- Please hurry.
- Okay.

563
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,380
There's an incident. A guest in Room 203
on the 6th floor passed out.

564
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,550
It must be related to heart disease.

565
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:31,989
Are you not coming?

566
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:38,559
Excuse us.

567
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,559
Manager Han.

568
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:53,309
We need to move him to the bed first.
Can you help me?

569
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:54,309
Okay.

570
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,380
- Be careful.
- What happened?

571
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:00,920
He asked to have water in his room,
so he could take his medicine.

572
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,920
We brought him water,

573
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,389
but he wouldn't answer
when we knocked several times.

574
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:06,320
Did you call 911?

575
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:08,219
They must be on their way.

576
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:10,190
I called the ambulance quickly.

577
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:11,889
Quickly.

578
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:14,960
How long has it been?

579
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,269
We found him like this 3 or 4 minutes ago.

580
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,039
What's going on?

581
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:01,039
We were doing fine before he got here.
He must have brought his bad luck here.

582
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,429
- Oh, my. He's back.
- Goodness.

583
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:26,269
- Gosh. He's back.
- Oh, my.

584
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:29,239
Are you all right?

585
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,710
I think his limbs are numb for the moment.

586
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,440
Cover him with a blanket
and help him stabilize.

587
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,539
- Okay.
- Okay.

588
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:38,949
When the paramedics arrive,
explain to them what happened.

589
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,349
- Call his family.
- Okay.

590
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:45,590
That was amazing.

591
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,219
You all saw that, right?

592
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:49,889
Manager Han saved his life.

593
00:44:49,989 --> 00:44:51,489
- You all saw that, right?
- Yes.

594
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,030
Give him a round of applause.

595
00:44:55,929 --> 00:44:57,070
What?

596
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,369
Yes. Again?

597
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,039
Gosh. There's one incident after another.

598
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:05,110
Okay. Manager Han.

599
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,539
Facility Maintenance Department called.

600
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:09,880
There's a problem in the boiler room.
They will stop running the heater...

601
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,710
for the rooms
on the 8th to 12th floors for 1 hour.

602
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:14,619
We got a call that the laundry
from Room 2202 has gone missing.

603
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:15,920
And we have...

604
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,320
Chairman Kim of Handong Electronics
staying in the VIP room tonight.

605
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,760
Is Kim Han Hee still working
in the boiler room?

606
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:27,030
No, we got someone new
about two months ago.

607
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:32,130
There's a separate switchboard
for the rooms from the 8th to 12th floors.

608
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:35,139
And the fuse
behind the second boiler goes out often.

609
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:37,070
So... No.

610
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,010
I'll go down there myself.

611
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,940
You should call the employees
and tell them...

612
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,079
to visit the guests staying in the rooms
from the 8th to 12th floors...

613
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,679
and to personally ask them
for their understanding.

614
00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:48,650
And let the guests switch rooms
if they request.

615
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,090
Yes, sir.

616
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:54,889
I want you to go to the guest in Room 2202
and apologize for the missing laundry.

617
00:45:54,889 --> 00:45:56,090
Tell the guest we'll compensate for it.

618
00:45:56,389 --> 00:45:58,789
And give the guest a free meal coupon.

619
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:00,630
Okay.

620
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:02,969
As for Chairman Kim
of Handong Electronics,

621
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:05,269
he'll go to the gym tomorrow morning.
Tell the staff.

622
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:08,739
Tell the staff to get chocolates ready
for tomorrow morning.

623
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:10,110
He has diabetes.

624
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,210
Okay.

625
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:12,769
Wait.

626
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,679
Welcome back, General Manager.

627
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:17,750
Not yet.

628
00:46:57,449 --> 00:46:58,449
All right.

629
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,289
- How fancy.
- Gosh.

630
00:47:00,289 --> 00:47:01,659
This is Young Jae's hotel.

631
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:02,820
Let's go inside.

632
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,159
- Gosh. This is nice.
- Don't thank me.

633
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:06,659
Do you need anything else?

634
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,929
It's my friend's birthday today.
Bring us champagne and a cake.

635
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:11,099
Sure.

636
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,570
If you need anything, just let me know.

637
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:16,070
Don't forget that
I'll always have your back. Okay?

638
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:19,369
Have a good night.

639
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:21,610
- This is so fancy.
- Where's the key?

640
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,949
- He's here.
- Let's go.

641
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:25,349
- Hey, open the door already.
- Open the door.

642
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:27,050
- That rude punk.
- Gosh.

643
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:54,539
Do you like the room, sir?

644
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:57,380
Not bad. Not bad at all.

645
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:00,849
Hold on. Is there a system
on the phone to prevent any wiretapping?

646
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:02,619
- Pardon?
- Is this a satellite phone?

647
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:05,920
- We don't have...
- The window doesn't seem bulletproof.

648
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,219
That's enough, Leo.

649
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:09,159
I was joking.

650
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,559
- Let me ask you a question.
- Yes, sir.

651
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,230
Is there someone named Seo Jin Young?

652
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,269
I heard she worked here
as a duty assistant manager.

653
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:20,400
You mean Manager Seo Jin Young?

654
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,800
Is she working tonight?

655
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,010
Probably.

656
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:25,340
She's usually at the hotel
unless she's sleeping.

657
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:28,079
Can you give her a note?

658
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:49,460
Aren't you sick of people
talking about you behind your back?

659
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,630
Yes, I'm sick of it!

660
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,300
- What's gotten into you?
- What is that supposed to mean?

661
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,969
I'm living my life. Why are you meddling?

662
00:48:56,969 --> 00:48:58,170
Sit down, you punk.

663
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,389
- You little...
- Hey.

664
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:16,389
Hey!

665
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:20,230
These are sleeping pills.
