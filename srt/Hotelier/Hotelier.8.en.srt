1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,540
Hey, you jerk!

2
00:00:02,109 --> 00:00:04,209
I'm the guest here. Do what I say.

3
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:05,809
You're a mere bellboy.
How dare you talk back?

4
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:08,449
- Am I your servant? Am I your slave?
- Young Jae, calm down.

5
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:11,419
How dare you boss me around
to take your shoes off?

6
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:13,390
- How dare a bellboy yell at a guest?
- Sir.

7
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,990
- Sir.
- Young Jae, calm down.

8
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,190
- Come here.
- Calm down.

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,219
- Come here.
- Sir, please calm down.

10
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,289
- Young Jae.
- Gosh.

11
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:20,460
- Sir.
- Sir.

12
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,660
- Goodness. Ms. Yoon.
- No!

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,199
- Are you all right?
- You little...

14
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,329
Young Jae.

15
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:29,230
What are you doing? Stop it!

16
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,739
Go ahead. Hit me, you punk.

17
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,609
Gosh.

18
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,310
Yes. I slapped you. Now what?

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,780
I see. A hotel employee
is assaulting a guest now?

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,149
A guest?

21
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:49,719
If you want to be treated like a guest,
act like one, you jerk!

22
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,060
You little...

23
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,600
(Episode 8, One Long Day)

24
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:04,469
- General Manager Han.
- What happened?

25
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:05,969
Someone slapped a guest in his cheek?
What's this about?

26
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:08,109
- Well...
- I did it.

27
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,680
Ms. Seo, are you out of your mind?

28
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,750
I also believe she's out of her mind.

29
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,480
The guest caused trouble first.

30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,790
He was completely drunk.
He was out of control.

31
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,090
So you slapped him?

32
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,019
I couldn't even try to stop her.
It happened so fast.

33
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:26,489
Gosh. She was so quick!

34
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:28,560
He shoved Ms. Yoon first,
so she fell down.

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,859
I'm her employee.
Can't I even protect her?

36
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:32,000
That was rash of you.
How could you be so immature?

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,069
That's right. I agree with you.

38
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:35,170
Manager Seo is known to be...

39
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,599
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet.

40
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,450
I'll reprimand you for what you did today.

41
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,980
Come with me.

42
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:09,770
- Well, Manager Lee.
- Manager Lee.

43
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:12,740
- Manager Lee.
- Get your hands off me!

44
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:14,810
I don't want your pity!

45
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,250
I'm so sorry.

46
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:23,520
It wasn't our intention
to wrong you like this.

47
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,979
I don't care about your apology.

48
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,189
Call the police right now.

49
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:30,819
Call the police!

50
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,729
Fine. If you're not going
to call the police, I will.

51
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,099
I'm the general manager of this hotel.

52
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,569
I'm in charge of what goes on
in this hotel.

53
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,539
I am sorry about what happened today.

54
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,240
I hope you can be generous and forgive us.

55
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,509
We will compensate you
for all the psychological damage.

56
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:53,340
I see. So you must want to settle this.

57
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,750
Do you think I'll just let this slide?

58
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,719
Gosh. Who knew
I would be in a situation like this?

59
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:06,289
I got slapped by a hotel employee.

60
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,960
If I expose you in the morning newspapers,

61
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,759
you know what will happen to you. Right?

62
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:14,270
You will be done for.

63
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:17,340
I'd like to offer
my sincere apology once again.

64
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,169
Please calm down and forgive us.

65
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:21,240
Forget it.

66
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,979
I don't need anything from you.
Call the police now.

67
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:26,439
Did you hear me?

68
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,810
You won't call them?

69
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,879
Fine.

70
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,430
This happened because
I wasn't a good CEO or a leader for them.

71
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,189
Please find it in your generous heart
and forgive us.

72
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,030
You are a valuable guest to our hotel.

73
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,770
But we made a grave mistake.

74
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,469
And for that, I am sorry and ashamed.

75
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,669
If you can forgive us just this once
for my sake,

76
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:57,039
I will do my best, so something like this
never happens in the future.

77
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:59,439
Get up. What are you doing?

78
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,650
Please forgive us.

79
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:03,379
Get up now!

80
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,250
Please get up.

81
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,520
If you don't forgive us, I cannot get up.

82
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,000
It's okay. You can wait outside.

83
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:22,730
I will take responsibility for this
as the CEO.

84
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,579
Gosh.

85
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,279
Get up. What are you doing?

86
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,579
Get up. Please get up.

87
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:39,220
Will you forgive us?

88
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,069
It's done. Get back to work.

89
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,009
You can finish things here,
General Manager Han.

90
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,279
Yes, ma'am.

91
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,709
No. Why would I kneel?

92
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,610
Do it. You can't?

93
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,779
What's gotten into you?

94
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,819
I'm at the hotel,

95
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:24,019
working my butt off
just like you and my mom wanted.

96
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,290
My pride took enough hits.
I did my best to be patient.

97
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:29,990
No more talking back. Kneel.

98
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,399
I said, no.

99
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,199
You can just tell me to kneel
because you're the general manager?

100
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,629
I'm not the general manager right now.

101
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,810
Kneel. Do it.

102
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,879
Gosh.

103
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,620
- You jerk.
- Let go.

104
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,519
- Don't move.
- Get your hands off me!

105
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,689
Get a grip.

106
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,639
Why are you doing this to me?

107
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,439
He was drunk. Why was it my job
to take off his shoes?

108
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:17,980
Aren't I entitled to some pride?

109
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,439
Do you know why?

110
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,310
Your mother...

111
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,720
kneeled in front of him
and begged for 30 minutes to settle this.

112
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:33,290
Why did she do that?

113
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,860
Because of your precious pride.

114
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,360
Because a bellboy was too proud
and insulted a guest.

115
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,670
So you deserve
to be on your knees all night.

116
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,259
Darn it.

117
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:15,170
Come on!

118
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:22,240
Why did my mother have to kneel
in front of that jerk?

119
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,709
It's just some hotel!

120
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,740
Why did she throw away
her dignity for this?

121
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,180
Watch your mouth, Young Jae.

122
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:31,019
Forget it.

123
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,850
I can still have a good life
without that hotel.

124
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:35,850
I'll quit!

125
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,659
Don't get the wrong idea.

126
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,090
The 1,200 hotel employees
don't work at Seoul Hotel...

127
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,460
because they can't find another job.

128
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,200
They don't wait on our guests
day and night...

129
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,070
because they're afraid
they can't find another job.

130
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,570
When I first got a job here,

131
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:57,070
my seniors made me carry
20 water glasses on a tray.

132
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:00,480
I walked around the Grand Ballroom,
which was as big as Seoul Stadium.

133
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:03,480
My arms hurt, so when I tried to hold it
with two hands, they kicked me.

134
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,519
All of my old seniors used to do that.

135
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,090
Yes. Back then,
it was tough to earn a living.

136
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,419
And I put up with it
because that was my job.

137
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,259
But that wasn't everything.

138
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:18,230
My seniors
and I wanted to be real professionals.

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,370
These guests are nobodies
once they step out of our hotel.

140
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,470
But as long as they stay here,

141
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,899
it is our job to entertain
and make them happy.

142
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,840
Finding your own happiness...

143
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,139
while making others happy.

144
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,909
That's what a hotelier does.

145
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,549
You come from a rich family.
So when you go out,

146
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:42,350
you can do whatever you want,

147
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:44,519
and no one will say anything to you.

148
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:46,289
I was born that way.

149
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:48,090
No one was born that way, Young Jae.

150
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,169
I don't think you will change overnight.

151
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,700
But think about your colleagues
who work with you and your mother.

152
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,409
I want you to be more careful.

153
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:14,250
Either kneel or meditate.
But stay here alone.

154
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:18,559
See what or who comes to your mind.

155
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,789
You'll feel better.

156
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:23,190
Right.

157
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,759
Pick up all the balls before you leave.

158
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,720
I'm sorry, ma'am.

159
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:52,360
We see all kinds of people at hotels.

160
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,789
So there are some good days and bad days.

161
00:10:57,929 --> 00:10:59,029
I'm sorry...

162
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:01,669
for making you do what you did.

163
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,570
I will face any punishment you give me.

164
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,879
Jin Young, kneeling in front of him
wasn't a big deal.

165
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,740
I'm the CEO of the hotel.

166
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,909
What is the CEO's job?

167
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,549
Aren't CEOs supposed to protect
their employees in situations like this?

168
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,049
If that can resolve the problem,

169
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,360
I can kneel 10 or 20 times.

170
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,889
However, don't forget this.

171
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,330
No matter how awful and rude
someone may be,

172
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,799
as long as he checks into our hotel,

173
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,899
he is our client and guest at our hotel.

174
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,500
No matter what happens,

175
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,740
it's our duty to do our best.

176
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,669
That's what real professionals do, right?

177
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:45,610
I'm ashamed.

178
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:47,279
It's okay. Don't worry.

179
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:53,320
When you slapped him earlier,

180
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,990
I did feel good inside.

181
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,960
I'm so starving.

182
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:08,669
Hey, mister!

183
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,669
- Hey.
- General Manager Han.

184
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:12,740
What are you doing here at this hour?

185
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:16,669
Well, I was exercising.
Where are you going?

186
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,309
They are going to throw me
a welcome party.

187
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:21,480
Good for you.
How's working in the kitchen?

188
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,549
It's fun.

189
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:24,080
Everyone is so nice to me.

190
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,450
General Manager Han, she was born
with a culinary talent and diligence.

191
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,720
I'd like to teach her.

192
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,620
How can you tell only after a day?
I'm not buying it.

193
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,159
I'm serious.

194
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,259
I can tell just by the way
someone peels a potato.

195
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:37,759
But when Jenny peels potatoes,
they get halved.

196
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,000
Hey, don't you remember
when you first started?

197
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:43,399
You peeled your fingers, not potatoes.
Why did you say that?

198
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,169
Anyway, take good care of her.

199
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:46,769
Don't you worry.

200
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,370
Okay. Have fun.

201
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,039
- Okay. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

202
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,779
- Let's go.
- Get in.

203
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:25,179
(Email, Community)

204
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,240
(Location, Find locations)

205
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,779
(Find Friends, Confirm)

206
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,320
Did you make an appointment?

207
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,549
How many in your party?
Let me show you to your table.

208
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:36,889
Have a good time.

209
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,029
Put my thumb
on the inner side of the chair.

210
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,559
Grab two-thirds of it.

211
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,129
Then pull the chair out.

212
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,570
Gosh. Why are there so many rules?

213
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,570
I have to take their order next.

214
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,769
Give the menu. So they took the menu.

215
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,679
Well... Let me tell you
about the special course of the day.

216
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,779
We have Norwegian salmon,
seasoned with herbs and spices,

217
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,519
Italian vegetable soup,

218
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:08,250
and jumbo shrimps with chili sauce.

219
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:11,659
As for the main dish, we have
grilled veal tenderloin and lobsters...

220
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:14,590
paired with morel mushrooms
and cream sauce.

221
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:19,129
Allow me to spread the napkin.

222
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,000
Place it 2cm from the table.

223
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,169
The knives...

224
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,809
Which side do I reach from
to serve the main dish?

225
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,809
Was it this side?

226
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:36,309
No. Gosh. That's confusing.

227
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,620
Left. Serve it counterclockwise.

228
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,950
How long have you been watching?

229
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,750
When you seated the customers.

230
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:44,919
But they didn't order drinks.

231
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,990
I haven't learned everything yet.

232
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,559
I think I almost broke my brain,
trying to memorize the wine list.

233
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:51,100
You know what? Sit here.

234
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,000
I need to practice. Hurry. Sit down.

235
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,100
Where was I?

236
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,570
You served the main dish.

237
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,500
- Let's say I'm done with that.
- Okay.

238
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,139
Enjoy your meal.

239
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:04,710
Well, let's say I finished it.

240
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,779
- Okay.
- Yes.

241
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,379
Sir? Did you enjoy your meal?
I'll clear the plates for you.

242
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,480
No. Don't let the customer see
the leftover food.

243
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,690
So you have to turn your body
toward the back.

244
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,220
- Okay. So I finished clearing them.
- Yes.

245
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,620
- Let's say I'm done.
- There might be leftover food like this.

246
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,129
Let me clean that for you.

247
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:25,100
Gosh. You're going to make
some customers very unhappy.

248
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,399
I'm sorry. Let me try again.

249
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,129
All right. Here.

250
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:30,700
What's this?

251
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:32,299
Watch.

252
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,570
Try this.

253
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:38,879
Go ahead.

254
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,350
- Like this?
- Gosh, you're good.

255
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,850
You are an excellent employee.

256
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,789
- You can keep it.
- Really?

257
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:49,789
Of course.

258
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,190
Thank you.

259
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,059
I've been carrying it
ever since I was in Las Vegas.

260
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:54,090
It's my good luck charm.

261
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:56,360
But you're giving that to me?

262
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,330
- Sure.
- Why?

263
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,100
Well...

264
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,870
Because you like me?

265
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Right?

266
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,909
Can you buy me a bowl of udon
before the girl you like starves to death?

267
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,740
Fine.

268
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,809
But I will not... Yoon Hee...

269
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:19,539
No.

270
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,750
I'm yours.

271
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,279
Yours, Yoon Hee.

272
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,420
Give me one more drink.

273
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,559
Are you okay?

274
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,690
Gosh. I might not look like it,
but I can hold my liquor.

275
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,029
No, you look like
you can hold your liquor.

276
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,329
But you should stop here.

277
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:44,230
I'm fine. One more drink.

278
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,140
See?

279
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,509
I can't stop bodily function.

280
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,079
- What's wrong with me?
- Ma'am, a glass of water, please.

281
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:55,009
- Sure.
- Let's stop drinking and go.

282
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,049
Gosh. I want to hear a bit more
about your time in Las Vegas.

283
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,349
Here. Drink it.

284
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:10,930
I'm good. I'm sober now.

285
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:14,500
You won 20,000 dollars.
Why did you end up losing all of it?

286
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,630
It's getting late.

287
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,140
Gosh. I'm sober now. Look.

288
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,940
No more.

289
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,880
Five more minutes.

290
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,640
Just until my hiccups stop.

291
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,710
Fine.

292
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:32,150
So I won the money.

293
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,349
Then on my way out,
I met some weird guys in the restroom.

294
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:36,190
- How many?
- Three.

295
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,789
They locked me inside the restroom
and turned off the light.

296
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,900
What? So what happened?

297
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,099
That's it. Your hiccups stopped, right?

298
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,170
- Let's go.
- Gosh.

299
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,539
I wanted to spend the night
drinking and talking to you.

300
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,069
I'm a general manager.

301
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,779
Going out with a female employee
will be frowned upon.

302
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,549
- Why do you keep trying to run away?
- What?

303
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,680
Are you scared that you might fall for me?

304
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,720
Or have you already fallen for me?

305
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:11,859
Yoon Hee, you're crossing the line.
That's enough.

306
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,259
Stop talking to me like that.

307
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,059
I don't want you to treat me like a kid,
Tae Jun.

308
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:17,789
I want you to address me
as the General Manager.

309
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,660
We're not working right now.

310
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,900
- Right.
- I passed out in front of you twice.

311
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,569
And I've changed
after coming to this hotel.

312
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:29,410
I got to work with other people
for the first time in my life.

313
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,640
I laughed out loud for the first time.

314
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:33,680
That's good to hear.

315
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,009
I'm given a chance.

316
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,119
A chance to be happy.

317
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,319
I don't want to lose it
no matter what happens.

318
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,490
Or the person who brought it to me.

319
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,660
Goodnight.

320
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,269
Gosh. Will you be okay?

321
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,569
Should I walk you to your room,
Ms. Kim Yoo Hee?

322
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,069
You know that you can't do that.

323
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:02,109
I'm fine.

324
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:10,910
And my name isn't "Kim Yoo Hee."
It's Kim Yoon Hee.

325
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,880
You can call me Yoon Hee.

326
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,089
Sweet dreams.

327
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:29,430
Bye.

328
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,339
- Are you going home?
- Isn't it obvious?

329
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:35,009
Where's Ms. Seo?

330
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:36,940
I need to do a hand-off and go home too.

331
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:39,940
She's with Ms. Yoon right now.

332
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,109
It will take some time.

333
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:43,980
She acted as if she was better than anyone
and messed up big time.

334
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:45,779
Did something happen?

335
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,190
I don't care.
I don't want to talk about it.

336
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,250
Ms. Lee.

337
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:52,890
Do you have plans after work?

338
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:56,259
- Why do you ask?
- Grab a beer with me after work.

339
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,460
Why should I grab a beer with you?

340
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,299
Then how about wine?

341
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,240
Look, Mr. Oh.

342
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,910
I'm not the type of woman
who drinks with any men.

343
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,140
There are things I don't do
and people I don't associate with.

344
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,309
I follow principles.

345
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:14,950
I don't go on dates with just anyone.

346
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,380
I especially hate men like hyenas.

347
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,420
Understood?

348
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:22,319
That's why you're still not married.

349
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:24,119
Mr. Oh.

350
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:25,960
Being unable to marry
and choosing not to marry...

351
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,190
are two different things.

352
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,960
Well, that's what they all say.

353
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,500
What a hyena.

354
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:32,630
What a penguin.

355
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,170
- What are you looking at?
- Penguin's legs.

356
00:21:47,109 --> 00:21:48,180
Goodness.

357
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:51,009
Those are some cute penguin legs.

358
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,920
- What's wrong?
- Hello.

359
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,980
Manager Seo.

360
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,549
Hey, what's going on?

361
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,890
We sent up room service this afternoon.

362
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,019
But he's not leaving.

363
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:01,019
It's past our closing time.
But we can't go home because of him.

364
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,990
- Can you talk to him?
- Sure, I'll talk to him.

365
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,599
But you know you can't ask him to leave
before he leaves on his own, right?

366
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:07,829
- Gosh, don't worry.
- Manager Seo.

367
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:08,869
Gosh. Don't worry.

368
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,869
No. It's not that way.

369
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,500
What? No one is here.

370
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,210
Over there.

371
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:39,099
Hello, sir. You must have had
a lot of drinks today.

372
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:40,160
Please sit.

373
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,230
- Well...
- Sit down and join me.

374
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:47,569
You know that drinking with a guest
on my shift isn't allowed.

375
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,109
The employees are all waiting for you.

376
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:51,609
So you guys have to close.

377
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,980
- Yes.
- Doesn't it mean you can drink with me?

378
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,250
You're done with your shift.

379
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,880
Well, no. That's not what I meant.

380
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,750
The bar is closing.

381
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,549
But I'm still on the clock.
You understand that. Right?

382
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:05,619
Anyway, you can't drink here. Right?

383
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:08,190
Right. I'm sorry, sir.

384
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,190
Then let's go out and drink.

385
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:12,859
Wait.

386
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,670
- Gosh. Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm okay.

387
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,470
- I'm sorry for keeping you here.
- No, it's all right.

388
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,710
- Bye, sir.
- Bye.

389
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,240
Jin Young. That was so cool.

390
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,880
He didn't sign the bill.

391
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,079
- Put it under his room.
- Bye.

392
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:43,430
Are you all right?

393
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,529
No.

394
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,369
I can't seem to find my room.

395
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,369
Could you escort me to my room,
Manager Seo?

396
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,900
Of course.

397
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,309
Here. Why don't we drink first
before our walk?

398
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,940
I'm sorry, sir.

399
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,980
I still can't drink.

400
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,650
But kalguksu is okay?

401
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,720
I went to the East Sea.

402
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:10,720
Gosh, the East Sea?

403
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,990
It must have been so fun.
Did you go there on a trip?

404
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:15,089
- No.
- I see. Then a business trip?

405
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,359
No, not that.

406
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,700
It wasn't a personal trip
or a business trip. Then why did you go?

407
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:24,599
When I got to the beach, I called you.
But you didn't answer.

408
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,000
So I sent you an email.

409
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,799
Really?

410
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,140
I've had such a hectic day.

411
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,069
I didn't even turn on my computer
in the office.

412
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,880
I'll make sure to read it later.

413
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,349
But what did you write?

414
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,119
Well...

415
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:49,589
Sender Shin Dong Hyuk.
Recipient Seo Jin Young.

416
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,329
What's the title?

417
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:53,859
The title...

418
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,039
To the other half of me.

419
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:05,309
What was in the email?

420
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:06,740
It said...

421
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,380
Duty Assistant Manager, please answer.

422
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,920
Yes, this is Seo Jin...
This is the Duty Assistant Manager.

423
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,349
I'm listening.

424
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,890
Locate yourself now.

425
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,119
Yes. I am...

426
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:22,660
patrolling the Diamond Villa.

427
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:25,259
I thought you were done for the day, sir.

428
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,130
I stopped by on my way to the dorm.

429
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,230
Have a good shift.

430
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,869
Yes. Goodnight.

431
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:33,500
The Diamond Villa?

432
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:35,869
Yes.

433
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:39,910
It's over there. It's...

434
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,650
the most luxurious villa
for our VIP guests.

435
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,880
It's very expensive
and has a good ambiance.

436
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:48,720
Can I take a look?

437
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,390
Sure.

438
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:53,819
If you want to, sir.

439
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,029
It's well-built.

440
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:06,000
Right. Only special VIP guests
can stay in this villa.

441
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,640
- Of course, it's expensive...
- Then how come I didn't get this villa?

442
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:10,910
Well, that's because...

443
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,880
I was just joking.

444
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,309
My current villa is more than enough
for a businessman like me.

445
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:18,349
Right?

446
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:20,980
By the way, what do you do?

447
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,549
Well,

448
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,759
- I hunt.
- Pardon?

449
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:33,259
A corporate hunter.

450
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,500
In English, it's called a raider.

451
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,930
I keep an eye out
on easy-to-acquire companies...

452
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,369
and take over when I see a chance.

453
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,940
There's a job for that?

454
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:43,809
Yes.

455
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,609
I'm a brutal and cruel fighter.

456
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:49,950
Then you must have come to Korea
for a hunt too.

457
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,720
Let's stop talking about my work.
Can I look inside?

458
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,119
- But the rules...
- Those rules again.

459
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,150
The rules...

460
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:58,319
are there, so we could break them.

461
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:01,460
I'll give you a tour
if you want to go inside.

462
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:07,329
Come on in.

463
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:20,779
This villa was built in consideration
for the VIP guests' safety...

464
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:22,880
and to honor them to the highest degree.

465
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,079
Including the basement,
this villa has three floors.

466
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,720
Well, there are five large
and small function rooms...

467
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,220
for meetings and parties.

468
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,519
And we have special bedrooms
for the VIP guests.

469
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,930
We also have separate bedrooms
for their aides.

470
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:40,259
And we have five bathrooms.

471
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:43,599
Manager Kim Hye Kyung is in charge
of this villa.

472
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,829
You can ask her for more details.

473
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,470
Excuse me?

474
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,769
This is the perfect music for a dance.

475
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,910
Sir, but I can't...

476
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,710
I don't want you to treat me like a guest.

477
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,950
But sir, you are a guest at the hotel.

478
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,589
Then...

479
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,299
how should I address you?

480
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,869
Shin Dong Hyuk.

481
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,140
- But...
- Call me Dong Hyuk.

482
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:22,940
Go on.

483
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,779
Dong Hyuk.

484
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:32,109
You must find me pathetic
for making a fuss...

485
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,880
over 300 roses.

486
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:39,880
It's not because of the 300 roses.

487
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,650
Then what?

488
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:43,490
It's because of the man...

489
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:49,789
who has been sending you room service
ever since you were in the US.

490
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,500
That's why you're here with me.

491
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,170
Do you...

492
00:29:58,069 --> 00:30:00,440
always have to be so precise?

493
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,769
Like you...

494
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,880
- Like you...
- I'm clumsy...

495
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:13,779
and simple-minded.
You don't like that, right?

496
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:16,150
No.

497
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,589
I wish I could have a positive
and cheerful outlook on life like you.

498
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,069
Do you mean that?

499
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,549
I'm in front of the Diamond Villa.
Where are you?

500
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:07,200
Thank you, Jin Young.

501
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,279
I wanted to be with you
just for five minutes...

502
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,980
without anyone interrupting us...

503
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,220
with you in my arms.

504
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,349
No.

505
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,220
I wouldn't have minded
if I had been in your arms.

506
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,289
That's what I wrote in my email.

507
00:31:38,569 --> 00:31:41,039
Manager Seo, press the button all the way
when you talk.

508
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,140
I can't hear you. Where are you?

509
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,009
I have to answer the call.

510
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,279
I'm entering the garden from the south.
Where are you?

511
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:51,809
This is Seo Jin Young.

512
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,549
Ms. Seo, what are you doing here?

513
00:31:57,789 --> 00:32:00,359
From what I know,
Security patrols around the villa.

514
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,460
- Well...
- I asked her to show me around.

515
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:06,700
I liked the villa. I was thinking
about staying here next time.

516
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:09,430
We were just heading out.

517
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,140
You're the general manager, right?

518
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:15,470
- Yes.
- I'm Shin Dong Hyuk.

519
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:18,609
I'm well aware, sir. You're staying
at the Sapphire Villa, right?

520
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,880
It's getting late.

521
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,009
When I go back to my room
is none of your business.

522
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,079
I shouldn't have to hear about it
from a hotel employee.

523
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,319
This is a restricted area, sir.

524
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:30,220
Please leave.

525
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:35,329
Manager Seo must have made a mistake.

526
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:36,890
I'm sorry to inconvenience you.

527
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:37,960
No.

528
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:41,730
Thank you for showing me around,
Jin Young.

529
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:14,299
Have you lost your mind?

530
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,529
You're the Duty Assistant Manager.

531
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:18,700
What are you doing with the guest alone
in the middle of the night?

532
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,869
Should I write up an apology letter?

533
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,069
Jin Young, I'm saying this
because I'm worried about you.

534
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:24,940
Nothing good will come of it
if other people see this.

535
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,180
Did I commit a crime?

536
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,779
Hey, are you happy how people are talking
about you getting 300 roses from a guest?

537
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:32,319
Gosh. Is that my fault?

538
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,849
The guest sent them to thank me.
What could I have done?

539
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:35,650
You know that's not my point!

540
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,789
Then what's the problem?

541
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:42,430
Are you seeing him?

542
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:46,000
Is he your boyfriend?

543
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:55,269
He's not my boyfriend or anything.
He's interested in me and nice to me.

544
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:57,910
So a few nice gestures are enough
to win over your heart?

545
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,509
Tae Jun, you're crossing the line.
How could you say that to me?

546
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:03,849
Are you implying that I'm an easy woman?

547
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:05,579
- You look easy.
- What?

548
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,179
Are you done?

549
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,019
How could you say that to me
when you're my friend?

550
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:13,360
- Friend?
- Yes!

551
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,059
We promised to be friends in the US!

552
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,230
Friends.

553
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,039
You can't leave
in the middle of our conversation.

554
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,639
I'm done talking to you. Get back to work.

555
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,139
I'm done with my shift.
I need to do a hand-off now.

556
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,670
Then get off work and go home.
Don't follow me.

557
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,440
I'm not following you.
I have to go this way too.

558
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,739
Fine. I don't care where you go.
Do whatever you want.

559
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,809
Gosh. Unbelievable!

560
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:38,309
Fine. I'll go on my way.

561
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,380
I hope you have a happy life, Tae Jun.

562
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,190
You say we're friends, but you don't care
about my feelings at all.

563
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,519
- You don't even comfort me when I have...
- Be quiet!

564
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:48,489
Gosh.

565
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,030
If you were going to do this,
why come all the way to the Diamond Villa?

566
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,960
You got off early. Then you should've gone
to your dorm and slept.

567
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,400
Why did you come here
and put me in a bad mood?

568
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,300
I bought sundae in case you got hungry.
What?

569
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,440
You don't want me to bring you sundae now?

570
00:35:02,539 --> 00:35:03,570
Gosh.

571
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,690
This is Han Tae Jun.

572
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,920
Hello. I'm on another line...

573
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,159
- Hey, it's me. Hold on.
- Hello. Tae Jun?

574
00:35:55,929 --> 00:35:58,460
Are you there?

575
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,760
Hey, what's going on?
How are you calling me right now?

576
00:36:01,429 --> 00:36:02,469
With my cell phone.

577
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:04,630
- Your cell phone?
- Yes, my phone.

578
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,070
Hello.

579
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,739
What? That wasn't it.

580
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:09,909
- Hello.
- Yes, it's me.

581
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:11,710
You didn't call from your cell phone.

582
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,639
I called you from my cell phone.

583
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:14,780
To my cell?

584
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,150
No. I called your landline
from my cell phone.

585
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,849
Yes. Right?

586
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,730
- So what?
- What?

587
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,300
Why did you call? To apologize?

588
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,699
Why must I apologize?
I didn't do anything wrong.

589
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:38,030
Gosh. You yelled at me
and said really mean things.

590
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,039
But you won't apologize?

591
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,199
You're ridiculous.

592
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,510
You yelled at me because you thought
you didn't do anything wrong.

593
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,469
How could I not say anything
after you called me easy?

594
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:47,780
You're the one who called yourself easy.

595
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,409
I just implied
you gave off that impression.

596
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:50,510
Don't be absurd.

597
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,280
I'm tired. I just finished my shift.

598
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,750
But you called to tell me that?

599
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,420
Did you wake me up for this?

600
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,719
Why did you call me then?

601
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,550
I'm not the only one who called.
What about you?

602
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,920
- Why did you call me?
- I...

603
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:04,659
I called because I had a feeling
you'd call me first. What?

604
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:06,500
Then forget it.

605
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,429
- Goodnight, Ms. Easy.
- What? Are you serious?

606
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:10,800
Hello? Han Tae Jun.

607
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,469
I have nothing else to say to you.
Don't call me.

608
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,239
- Goodnight.
- I have nothing to say...

609
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,780
Hello? Hey, Han Tae Jun!

610
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:24,409
Darn it.

611
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:40,699
You told me not to call you.
Why do you keep calling me?

612
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:42,599
- I'm tired. Why do you keep calling...
- Did someone upset you?

613
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:47,469
Dong Hyuk.

614
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:50,340
You must be tired.
I'm sorry to call so late.

615
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:53,110
No. It's okay.

616
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,150
A friend of mine kept telling me nonsense.

617
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,690
- Can you talk?
- Yes. I can talk.

618
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:06,190
I couldn't fall asleep
because of our dance earlier.

619
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:13,360
Actually, I can't fall asleep either.

620
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,670
I put you in a tight spot, didn't I?

621
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:20,739
I wouldn't put it that way.

622
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,909
I think my heart is still beating fast.

623
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:28,239
Well, not that. The guy from earlier...

624
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,480
The general manager seemed very upset.

625
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,650
Did he scold you?

626
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,420
Oh, that. No, it's okay.

627
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,349
He's always grumpy like that.

628
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:39,519
He's very anal about following the rules.

629
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,559
He tends to say whatever he wants.

630
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,829
I won't let it get to me.

631
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,869
He smelled like chocolates.

632
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:58,409
I'll look forward
to next year's Valentine's Day.

633
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,579
Pardon?

634
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,980
Can I look forward to...

635
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,780
next year's Valentine's Day?

636
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,090
The phone is turned off.

637
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,750
- Please call back another time.
- Yes.

638
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,389
But you have to be at Seoul Hotel
by next year's Valentine's Day then.

639
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:15,829
Gosh, Jin Young.

640
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,699
- Aren't I a great hotelier?
- Yes, you are.

641
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:28,699
- You should go to sleep. You must tired.
- It's okay. I'm feeling better...

642
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,969
thanks to your call.

643
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:33,610
- Really? Do you mean that?
- Yes. I mean it.

644
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,110
That feels nice.

645
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:41,980
But you should go to sleep early.
Well, it's already late.

646
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,690
Shouldn't you get to sleep
to work tomorrow?

647
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,190
Please call back another time.

648
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,590
Yes. Right.

649
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:49,860
Goodnight, Jin Young.

650
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,800
- Goodnight.
- You should hang up first.

651
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:03,039
Okay. Get some rest.

652
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:35,400
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

653
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:37,769
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

654
00:40:37,909 --> 00:40:39,880
It's not a long walk. I'll walk.

655
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:41,739
Hey, I waited for you for 20 minutes.

656
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,179
Come on. Get in.

657
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,510
Don't do this.

658
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,849
If you keep doing this,
you'll make me uncomfortable.

659
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:49,019
What did I do?

660
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:51,719
Don't be too nice to me.

661
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:55,190
That won't change my mind.
I'm sure you know that.

662
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,590
I won't ask you to change your mind.

663
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,159
I won't pester you to like me back.

664
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:01,230
I won't get in your way about your crush.

665
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:03,900
So you shouldn't stop me either...

666
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:06,699
because liking someone
and being nice to someone...

667
00:41:07,099 --> 00:41:08,269
is the freedom I'm entitled to.

668
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,170
Get in now.

669
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:17,909
Okay. Just for today.

670
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:19,880
So let me drive you.

671
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,250
Promise me. This is the only time.

672
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:23,949
Okay.

673
00:41:29,789 --> 00:41:31,030
Did you find her?

674
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,360
Yes. Where is she?

675
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,929
What? Seoul Hotel?

676
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,500
What on earth is she doing there?

677
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:42,840
To put it simply, it's about a man.

678
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,780
There's nothing more I can say.

679
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,010
You're frustrating me! Just find out more!

680
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,320
- Your face is puffy.
- Right? Totally.

681
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,449
It might explode.

682
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:02,889
Your perfume is too strong. Change it.

683
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:04,559
It's not perfume. It's lotion and toner.

684
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:06,500
Then change your lotion and toner.

685
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,599
Yes, sir.

686
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,800
Your postures.

687
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,139
- Keep your back straight.
- I did.

688
00:42:15,139 --> 00:42:16,510
How is that straight?

689
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,210
Yes. I've always had
a slightly hunched back.

690
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:21,280
Then you must fix that
even if you have to get a spinal CPR.

691
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:29,750
Ms. An Mi Hee.
Is that the only lipstick color you have?

692
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,789
This is a trendy color this spring.

693
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:33,860
- It's not that suggestive.
- You're making excuses again.

694
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,989
You're never to make excuses
in front of our customers.

695
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,260
"I'm sorry. It's my fault."

696
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,230
You must admit that they are right.

697
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,570
- Understood, Ms. An?
- Yes.

698
00:42:45,969 --> 00:42:48,400
I'm sorry for having sexy lips.

699
00:42:53,409 --> 00:42:55,480
- Ms. Kim Yoon Hee.
- Yes.

700
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,449
You will start working in the hall today.

701
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,519
We're short-staffed.

702
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:02,150
So you will be serving actual customers
starting today.

703
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,389
Ms. An.

704
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:06,420
You will be responsible
for training Ms. Kim.

705
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,690
Yes, sir.

706
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:10,630
Your hands.

707
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,170
The other way around.

708
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,010
What's going on?
What are you plotting this time?

709
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:25,210
It's Manager Seo's birthday.

710
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,679
So we're planning a surprise party.

711
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:29,110
It's her birthday today?
It's already been a year?

712
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,579
Gosh, time flies.

713
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:31,980
You'll come to the party, right?

714
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,880
- What time?
- You have to be there by 8 p.m.

715
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,750
It's a surprise party,
so don't tell her anything.

716
00:43:37,889 --> 00:43:38,889
Okay.

717
00:43:38,889 --> 00:43:40,360
Wrap that up quickly and get to work.

718
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,719
- Yes, chef.
- Yes, chef.

719
00:43:42,929 --> 00:43:44,889
They don't keep track
of their ancestors' anniversaries.

720
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:46,960
But they never forget their birthdays.

721
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,400
A party? How ridiculous.

722
00:43:48,699 --> 00:43:49,829
All right.

723
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:51,730
Let me see.

724
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,099
So there will be about 8 to 10 people.
Right?

725
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,409
Why did you remove Manager Lee?

726
00:43:57,409 --> 00:43:58,639
They hate each other.

727
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:59,840
You have no idea.

728
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,750
They might be at each other's throats,
but they'll be disappointed...

729
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:03,809
if they're not invited
to occasions like this.

730
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:06,820
- I thought they weren't close.
- It's like that with women.

731
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,320
They bond as they fight.

732
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,389
- Right, Jenny?
- No.

733
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:12,760
Women don't talk to each other
for the rest of their lives after a fight.

734
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,989
See? Men bond as they fight.

735
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:17,230
Be quiet. Just call Manager Lee.

736
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,489
You'll prepare the cake.

737
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,159
Bake it with the leftover ingredients
from the bakery. Got it?

738
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:21,630
- What?
- Do as I say.

739
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:23,869
I'll go to the fish market
and get some sashimi. Okay?

740
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:26,170
Let's see.

741
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,940
- Hello.
- Hello.

742
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,039
Hey.

743
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,820
What brings you here, Mi Hee?

744
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:44,019
She's new to Food and Beverage.

745
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:45,289
I wanted to introduce her to you.

746
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:47,590
Hello. I'm Kim Yoon Hee.

747
00:44:47,659 --> 00:44:50,030
She'll start working in the hall today.

748
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:52,230
I was hoping
you guys would help her a lot.

749
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:53,860
I'll thank you in advance for your help.

750
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:56,199
- Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Gab Soo.
- Hello. Let's shake hands.

751
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,929
Your hand is wet. What are you doing?

752
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:01,099
Yoon Hee, if you have any questions
about the food,

753
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:02,539
don't hesitate to ask me anything.

754
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:04,110
Stop bragging.

755
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:06,440
Mr. Yoo is pretty tough, isn't he?

756
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,480
I have my own notebook where I record...

757
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,480
the names of the menu and ingredients
for each dish.

758
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,809
I'm sure it will be helpful.

759
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:12,880
Thank you.

760
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,179
Shouldn't you get to work, sidekick?

761
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:16,389
Right. And it's not easy
to get around the basement level here.

762
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:17,989
If you get lost, you can...

763
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:20,460
Se Hyung..
Can you go and check on the bakery?

764
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,690
Okay.

765
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,789
- Hurry.
- I look forward to seeing you around.

766
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,230
You think you'll see her around?

767
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,500
Go and bake the cake.

768
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,329
Is there a party?

769
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,170
It's Manager Seo's birthday today.

770
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:34,039
I'm planning a surprise party.

771
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,869
You're coming too, right?

772
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:37,210
I can't say no to parties.

773
00:45:37,409 --> 00:45:39,039
Right. You should come too, Yoon Hee.

774
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:40,880
- You can meet Manager Seo too.
- Okay.

775
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,210
Does the general manager know
about the surprise party?

776
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:45,980
I already told him yesterday.
He'll be there in time.

777
00:45:46,349 --> 00:45:47,780
Was it Yoon Hee?

778
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:49,590
Yes.

779
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:51,449
You see, working at hotels...

780
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:52,750
We have to get going.

781
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,090
I have so many people
I must introduce her to.

782
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,420
Let's go.

783
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:01,630
I found the plates. The spoons...

784
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,670
I found the coffee cups and the saucers.

785
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:09,340
The salad bowls, salt shakers,
and pepper shakers.

786
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,070
Where are the pepper shakers?

787
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:17,210
Is that it?

788
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:26,320
Here. The pepper shaker.

789
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:30,059
- How's it going?
- It's going well.

790
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:32,159
How's the room? Is it okay?

791
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:34,429
I can't afford it with my paychecks.

792
00:46:34,429 --> 00:46:35,699
I'll move once I find a place.

793
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:37,929
You should stay there.
I'll take care of it.

794
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,329
Take care of what?

795
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:42,000
I'll talk to the front desk
and get you a lot of discounts.

796
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,869
How about a 90-percent discount?

797
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:47,039
What you're doing isn't helping me.

798
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,579
Don't do anything.

799
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:54,079
Besides, other people can't know
that I'm staying in the villa. Okay?

800
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,889
- Okay.
- And...

801
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:58,050
What are you doing after work tonight?

802
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:00,590
Should we call Eun Joo and have some fun?

803
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,320
I have a lot of work until late at night.

804
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,760
I need to practice setting the tables.

805
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,090
I must memorize all the dishes
on the menu as well.

806
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,929
Mr. Yoo is very strict.

807
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,800
He keeps telling me to forget about
my connection to the general manager.

808
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:12,670
I guess he doesn't get along
with the general manager.

809
00:47:12,969 --> 00:47:14,139
So it bothers me more.

810
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,869
I don't want to put him in a tight spot
by performing badly.

811
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,739
- Tae Jun is a great guy, isn't he?
- Yes.

812
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,510
But is he nice to everyone?

813
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:24,550
Has he always been like that?

814
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:26,949
Yes. That's the nature of hotel employees.

815
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,079
Tae Jun is a special case at that too.

816
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,489
I see.

817
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:35,360
But Tae Jun likes someone.

818
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:37,789
She works at our hotel.

819
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:39,389
They've had feelings for each other
for a very long time.

820
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:42,730
I'm sure everyone who works
at our hotel knows about them.

821
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,300
Why are you telling me that?

822
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:50,969
It looked like
you were interested in Tae Jun.

823
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:54,710
Yes. I am interested in him.

824
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:55,840
A lot, actually.

825
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,610
But Yoon Hee, Tae Jun...

826
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:00,750
I don't care
if another woman likes Tae Jun.

827
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,750
I don't care who that woman is.
It doesn't matter to me.

828
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:04,719
I follow my heart.

829
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,659
Only time will tell what will happen
in the future. Right?

830
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,929
I'm only saying this because I'm worried
that you will be miserable.

831
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,190
How is that miserable?

832
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:14,360
Isn't wasting your life, moping around
for your crush considered miserable?

833
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,500
Or is expressing your love
and following your heart miserable?

834
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:21,300
Love?

835
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,579
Well, it's probably not love yet.

836
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,409
I don't know what love is
or how it's supposed to make you feel,

837
00:48:32,449 --> 00:48:34,320
but I don't plan on avoiding it.

838
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:38,989
You might not know because you're young.

839
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:42,860
But I believe you only get
one chance at true love in life.

840
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,670
You have nothing to say, right?

841
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,429
Then you should go.
I need to get back to work.

842
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:53,670
Okay.

843
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,639
I'll see you after your shift.
I'll wait for you.

844
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:58,409
Don't wait for me. I'll end pretty late.

845
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:41,719
Yes. But I still won't change my mind.
