1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:05,780
Excuse me.

2
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:11,949
Gosh, sir. What brings you here?

3
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:13,990
We're closed.

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,289
Then can you go somewhere nice...

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,730
and have a cup of coffee with me?

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,100
I'm sorry. I can't.

7
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:28,699
Then what about tomorrow?

8
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,600
I do my best to serve the customers
who come to the restaurant,

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,570
but I can't spend my personal time
with them.

10
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:36,740
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:38,179
Wait.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,350
My girlfriend's name was Yoon Hee too.

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,450
I met her in this restaurant
of this hotel.

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,420
It was fun.

15
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,090
But we broke up a month ago.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,590
I can't forget Yoon Hee,

17
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,270
but she doesn't let me meet her anymore.

18
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:05,040
She won't meet me
because I'm a coward, foolish,

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,040
and jobless.

20
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,879
That is,

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,310
you, Kim Yoon Hee
and my girlfriend Jung Yoon Hee...

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,049
looked so alike,

23
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,150
so I was really shocked. But later,
I found out you had the same name too.

24
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:27,930
So I thought this was fate.

25
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,430
Fate.

26
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:32,159
Sir.

27
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,629
Don't do this.

28
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:34,829
Just once,

29
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,599
go on a date with me pretending
to be my girlfriend.

30
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,569
Just once. Please?

31
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:42,810
What are you doing?

32
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:48,209
I'm sorry, sir.

33
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,879
Darn it.

34
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:52,650
Is there anyone? Is nobody here?

35
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
Hey!

36
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:56,689
Why are you running away, Yoon Hee?

37
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,489
Why are you running away?

38
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,449
I'll kill you
if you answer another guy's call.

39
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,349
Please don't do this.

40
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:26,219
I have nothing to do with your girlfriend.

41
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:27,590
Not anymore.

42
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,520
Beg now. Beg, Jung Yoon Hee!

43
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,030
I'm Kim Yoon Hee, not Jung Yoon Hee!

44
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:35,789
Sir!

45
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,330
What are you doing?

46
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:42,229
I work in Food and Beverage. This guy...

47
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:46,740
Who are you? What are you doing?

48
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:49,009
Don't come close.

49
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:50,879
Both Yoon Hee and I will die.

50
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,710
Don't do this.

51
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,650
Calm down. Throw away the knife.

52
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,389
Whatever it is, let's talk it out.

53
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,490
Who are you to intrude?
It's between me and my girlfriend.

54
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,689
Go away. I said, go away!

55
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,099
Follow me!

56
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,400
You and I will die today, got it?

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,840
General Manager Han, answer me.

58
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,280
- It's a big trouble.
- Call the police and 911.

59
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,349
Evacuate all the employees.

60
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,280
Block the emergency stairs
and elevators from the guests...

61
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,020
so they can't use them.

62
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,050
Is he a guest?

63
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:37,360
I don't think so.

64
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:41,460
What happened?

65
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,460
An accident occurred.

66
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,599
A lunatic seized
one of our female employees...

67
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,460
and went to the rooftop to jump off.

68
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,000
Ms. Seo, look after the desk.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,199
Well...

70
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:51,400
I'm getting off work now.

71
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,139
There's an accident at the hotel.

72
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:55,939
Okay.

73
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:57,710
Who is the female employee?

74
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,909
Kim Yoon Hee of Food and Beverage.

75
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,449
It's Kim Yoon Hee again?

76
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:06,750
Gosh, what is this mess?

77
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:08,650
- Mr. Han.
- How's the situation?

78
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,050
It's really bad.

79
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,919
This lunatic who got dumped...

80
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,060
is going wild and telling us
to bring his girlfriend here.

81
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,290
He said he would jump off
with Yoon Hee if we didn't.

82
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,600
- What about the police?
- They're on the way.

83
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,000
- Are you hurt?
- He grazed me.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,100
It's not a serious wound.

85
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,300
- He's holding a knife too?
- Yes.

86
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,540
That's why we can't do anything
but be on standby here.

87
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,069
It's better not to provoke him.

88
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:31,379
Okay.

89
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,680
Let me go!

90
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,290
Be quiet!

91
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,189
Don't do this.

92
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,129
Stay still!

93
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,000
Don't come near me.
I said, don't come near me.

94
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,529
If you do anything unnecessary,
both Yoon Hee and I will die.

95
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,769
I'll jump off.

96
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,939
- Okay?
- Excuse me.

97
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,509
I'm the general manager of this hotel.

98
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,209
General mangaer or whatever, I don't care.

99
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,540
If you come near me, I'll kill you!

100
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,350
He's the one in charge of the hotel.

101
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,620
You can trust him.

102
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,189
Everyone listens to his orders,
so you can tell him what you want.

103
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,790
Yes. As she said,
I'll take responsibility.

104
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,420
So calm down and tell me what you want.

105
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,959
I want nothing else.

106
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:22,459
Just bring Yoon Hee to me.

107
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:25,800
That's his girlfriend's name.

108
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,069
Jung Yoon Hee.

109
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:29,970
Okay. Give me her number and address.

110
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:32,870
I'll call her as soon as possible
and bring her here.

111
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,839
But if you hurt my employee,
I won't keep the promise.

112
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,939
I got it!

113
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,579
I got it.

114
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,980
Just bring Yoon Hee quickly.

115
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,949
Are you okay, Ms. Kim Yoon Hee?

116
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:38,569
Yes. Okay.

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,370
Is there any news from upstairs?
Are things still not settled?

118
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,279
The police will arrive soon.

119
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:50,410
What happened? Where is Yoon Hee?

120
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,079
Young Jae, you can't go in!

121
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,680
- The police will take care of it.
- Where is she?

122
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,819
- Stop.
- Move!

123
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:59,089
Doing this will put her in bigger danger!

124
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:00,689
It's no good to provoke him.

125
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:01,730
Get out now!

126
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,689
Young Jae, calm down.

127
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,029
Mr. Han is outside too.

128
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:07,399
How can I trust Tae Jun?

129
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,430
Young Jae.

130
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,980
Mr. Han!

131
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,850
We called Jung Yoon Hee.

132
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,389
She's on the way!

133
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:29,550
- You heard that, right?
- It's obvious.

134
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,790
You planned this with the police
and are stalling for time.

135
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,019
If you do anything stupid...

136
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,430
He said she was coming.
Why won't you trust him?

137
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,800
Yoon Hee, don't do that. Stay still.

138
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,399
Yoon Hee, do you trust him?

139
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,610
Yes, I trust him.

140
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,810
I trust you completely, Tae Jun.

141
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,250
(Authorized Personnel Only)

142
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,620
Stay still!

143
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,500
Don't come!

144
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:25,839
Don't come close.
I said, don't come close!

145
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:04,950
- Are you okay?
- Let me go!

146
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,379
- Come here.
- Let me go!

147
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,590
I told you I trusted you.

148
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,059
I was frightened too.

149
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,200
Let me go!

150
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,000
I'll die. Go away!

151
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,370
Go away!

152
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,580
Move away! Step back.

153
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:37,850
I'll die.

154
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,980
I'll die!

155
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,389
How does that solve anything, sir?

156
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,120
- "Sir?"
- Yes.

157
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,190
Since you're in my hotel,
you're my guest.

158
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:50,490
And I don't want my guest to get hurt.

159
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,429
I got dumped by someone I love.

160
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:57,799
I lost my job,
and she completely forgot about me too!

161
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,399
I can't solve this!

162
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,070
How can you be certain
when you haven't even tried?

163
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:05,340
- Yoon Hee.
- You have the courage to jump from there,

164
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,179
so why can't you hold back your lover
like a fool?

165
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,350
Yoon Hee, stop.

166
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,580
Yoon Hee, you don't know how I feel.

167
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,320
You don't know how hurt I am!

168
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,350
What kind of a man says
he would die over that?

169
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,590
You deserve to die.

170
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,559
Come down quickly and take this.

171
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,159
Yes.

172
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:24,629
You don't know how fun
and exciting your life will be.

173
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,899
Look down.

174
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:29,100
Have you thought of what would happen
if you were to fall?

175
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:40,980
I...

176
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,649
hurt them.

177
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,720
Are they okay?

178
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:48,450
The wounds are not bad.

179
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,419
I'm fine, you punk. Just come down.

180
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,559
You'll get investigated by the police
and punished,

181
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:56,559
but you can get your punishment wholly
and start anew.

182
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:07,200
Come visit our hotel again next time.

183
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,940
I will officially invite you
and your girlfriend, Jung Yoon Hee.

184
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,809
We'll provide you with the best service.

185
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,679
It will be free of charge.

186
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,019
How did it go?

187
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:06,259
Yoon Hee is safe.

188
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:08,990
Mr. Han
and Young Jae caught the perpetrator.

189
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,429
The guys at our hotel are cool.

190
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:12,429
Where's Mr. Han?

191
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:13,860
He went to the infirmary with Young Jae.

192
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,029
Young Jae got hurt.

193
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:17,230
- Did he get hurt badly?
- No, it wasn't a serious wound.

194
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,200
Then look after the desk for me.
I need to leave for an urgent matter.

195
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,710
- Okay.
- Thank you.

196
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:31,440
Give me one martini
and a memo pad, please.

197
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:56,200
(To Seo Jin Young)

198
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,720
Excuse me. Give me the same drink.

199
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,629
Gosh, why are you overreacting?
This is nothing.

200
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,460
What do you mean "nothing?"

201
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,659
We almost held a funeral.

202
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,299
It was a heroic act...

203
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:31,200
that deserves a medal and a statue,

204
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,970
but it was rash.

205
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,669
Here. Sit down.

206
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:36,370
I'm sorry.

207
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,039
Don't be dramatic.

208
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:40,240
"Dramatic?" I'm hurt because of you.

209
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:42,679
Who told you to rush in and get hurt?

210
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,620
You're being too harsh, Yoon Hee.

211
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,750
He sacrificed himself.

212
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,490
He threw himself at the guy for you...

213
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,450
like a bodyguard. How can you say that?

214
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,519
That's how she is.

215
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:52,960
She's feeling grateful on the inside.

216
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,990
That's right. When you were
getting treated in the infirmary,

217
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,289
she kept crying.

218
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,330
Mr. Han, when did I cry?

219
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,830
I shed some tears because I was startled.

220
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,139
That's why people say a tear
is the seed of love, Mr. Han.

221
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,039
The lyrics of pop songs are accurate.

222
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:10,240
That's going too far.

223
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:11,580
It's not.

224
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,480
You are Yoon Hee's lifesaver.

225
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,850
So she should do
whatever you want for you.

226
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,379
What are you going to do for me?

227
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,080
What do you want?

228
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,519
Here.

229
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,970
Where's Young Jae? Is he here, Mr. Han?

230
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,039
- Yes, he's here.
- Gosh, what is this?

231
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,840
Where did you get stabbed?

232
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,740
Mr. Han, how could you leave him here?

233
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,409
You should've taken him to the hospital.

234
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:48,210
I was going to take him to the hospital
after first aid,

235
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,809
but he said he was fine.

236
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,450
Would it be okay?

237
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:52,820
It's nothing, Mom.

238
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,450
What do you mean?

239
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,450
Someone almost jumped off the building,
and people got stabbed. How is it nothing?

240
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,820
Ms. Yoon. That knife wasn't for steaks,

241
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,990
and it was pretty blunt
because it wasn't sharpened,

242
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,859
so he wasn't wounded badly.

243
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,500
Is he really okay?

244
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,039
And Young Jae is very agile,

245
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:14,170
so he was able
to avoid getting hurt badly.

246
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,839
He was like a tiger.

247
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,109
He's an expert
when it comes to worrying me.

248
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,279
Goodness.

249
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,980
Yoon Hee.

250
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:29,150
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm completely fine.

251
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:30,750
Can you go back by yourself?

252
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:33,690
Even if I say no, you can't take me home.

253
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:36,690
- Hyun Chul.
- Yes, Mr. Han.

254
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,130
I'm fine. I can go home by myself.

255
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,730
No, you must've been very shocked.

256
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,170
Send her home.

257
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,529
I need to stay here.

258
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,839
- Why?
- Ms. Seo entrusted the desk to me...

259
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:45,839
before she left.

260
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:47,339
Where did she go?

261
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,869
She had an urgent matter
she had to attend.

262
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,910
- Did she get off work?
- No. She ran off in her uniform.

263
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:59,349
Okay. You can get off work
after sending Yoon Hee home.

264
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:00,450
Yes, sir.

265
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,759
You know my family can't find out
about what happened today, right?

266
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,690
And tell Ms. Yoon that I'm sorry.

267
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:12,430
Tell her I'm also sorry
that Young Jae got hurt because of me.

268
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,670
I will. Go back safely.

269
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:16,599
Okay.

270
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:33,150
What are you doing here?

271
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:37,720
Why?
Did Dong Hyuk want you to put him to bed?

272
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,960
I couldn't even meet him.

273
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,559
We promised to meet outside...

274
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,599
because he had something
to tell me one last time.

275
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,470
But I couldn't keep the promise.

276
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,970
Then you can go in.

277
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:51,869
Do you want me to knock for you?

278
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:54,740
There's nobody inside.

279
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,180
Is Young Jae fine?

280
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,250
- Yes.
- I heard he got hurt.

281
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,279
He's not hurt badly.

282
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:09,420
That's a relief.

283
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:12,319
You're not asking about Yoon Hee?

284
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,990
Is Yoon Hee fine too?

285
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:20,400
As long as she's fine.

286
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
I'm sure you protected her well.

287
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,039
You became really mean.

288
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,440
You weren't like this before.

289
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,470
Right.

290
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:31,069
I must be getting mean
because I'm ill-fated.

291
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,380
I was happy because I met a guy
who shook my heart after a long time.

292
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,420
And he happened to be in charge
of mergers and acquisitions of this hotel.

293
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,990
Still, you decided to meet him.

294
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,519
Yes.

295
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,329
But even that was ruined...

296
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:51,859
because of Kim Yoon Hee.

297
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,230
How is that Yoon Hee's fault?
It's the perpetrator's fault.

298
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,740
I can't tell if you're the general manager
or Yoon Hee's bodyguard.

299
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,480
Who was it that went to meet a guy
when the hotel was a mess?

300
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:08,009
- You didn't even get to meet him.
- Stop.

301
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,650
I think it's over now.

302
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:16,089
He'll get over me with the fact
that I couldn't keep my promise.

303
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:23,130
Maybe it's better this way for both of us.

304
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,930
If we're not destined to be,
we have to end it.

305
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,730
Really?

306
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,670
Do you mean it?

307
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:40,009
Still, I miss him.

308
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,250
Why?

309
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,190
Don't look at me like that.

310
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,220
I'm telling you everything
because it's you.

311
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,460
Who else could I tell this to?

312
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:05,869
Still, you're a great friend, Tae Jun.

313
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,509
You're the biggest asset I earned...

314
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:10,710
from working at Seoul Hotel.

315
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,079
I don't know who's pathetic, you or me.

316
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,809
It's being pitiful.

317
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,619
- Who?
- Me.

318
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,690
You're pitiful?

319
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:23,890
Yes.

320
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:26,960
I lost hold of all the guys I liked.

321
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:30,730
I'm left behind without anyone,
so I'm pitiful.

322
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,500
I lost both Han Tae Jun
and Shin Dong Hyuk.

323
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:40,400
Who said that you lost me?

324
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:43,609
What do you mean?

325
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,799
Dong Hyuk.

326
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,299
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

327
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,069
- Something happened at the hotel...
- You don't have to explain.

328
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,710
I'm seeing why you couldn't come
with my own eyes.

329
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,170
You don't have to make any other excuses.

330
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:19,710
There was an accident at the hotel. So...

331
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,849
Mr. Han, I'm talking with Jin Young now.

332
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,720
I'm sorry, but will you excuse us?

333
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,019
I'm sorry. Please excuse us.

334
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:32,789
Okay.

335
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,470
I clearly asked you...

336
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:46,339
to meet me one last time.

337
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:50,109
One last time.

338
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:52,009
Something urgent happened at the hotel.

339
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:53,880
I said it was one last time.

340
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,380
Was I nothing to you
that my last request was ignored...

341
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,380
because of a hotel matter?

342
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,420
Was I?

343
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,220
That's not it.

344
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,690
I thought you would want
to sit down calmly face-to-face...

345
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,619
with me and listen...

346
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,630
to my thoughts and my honest feelings.

347
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,829
So I waited.

348
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,900
But you didn't come.

349
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,630
You should've given me the benefit
of the doubt...

350
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,900
and trusted me just once.

351
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,539
Was I that untrustworthy?

352
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,339
You're the one
who made me distrust you first.

353
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,180
Do you know what real trust is?

354
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,980
Do you know what real trust is, Jin Young?

355
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,920
Trusting what can't be trusted...

356
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,019
is what real trust is.

357
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:50,430
Thank you for letting me know
about your feelings clearly.

358
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,539
Lastly, I'll promise this.

359
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,680
I'll acquire Seoul Hotel...

360
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,609
no matter what.

361
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,349
Mr. Han.

362
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,690
You know the game starts now, right?

363
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:18,089
Doing this to a woman isn't in the rule.

364
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,900
My game doesn't have a rule
except for winning.

365
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,799
It's hard to watch
because you're causing too many stirs.

366
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,970
Only pleasant things will happen
from now on.

367
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,099
Shin Dong Hyuk.

368
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:30,210
Be thankful that you're here as a guest.

369
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,410
General Manager Han Tae Jun.

370
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,910
I'll contact you when I check out.

371
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,950
Even if you don't, I'll find out.

372
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,180
Send your employee back safely.

373
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:48,490
Goodnight, Jin Young.

374
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:08,349
Don't cry. You're a fool if you cry now.

375
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,650
I would not want to look at you if you do.

376
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:13,880
Then...

377
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,359
don't look at me.

378
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,240
He sure is young.

379
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,309
He came to work after one day.

380
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:37,369
Young Jae became a true hotelier now.

381
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,740
He should be called Yoon Hee-lier
instead of a hotelier.

382
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,180
What's Yoon Hee-lier?

383
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,049
He got stabbed while trying
to save Yoon Hee...

384
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:44,380
who was held hostage.

385
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,750
That's why he's Yoon Hee-lier.

386
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,079
Someone must be happy.

387
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,089
She has a bodyguard who saves her...

388
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:52,690
- whenever she's in danger.
- Jenny, don't be jealous.

389
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:54,559
I'm your bodyguard.

390
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,329
You have another bodyguard on your right.

391
00:25:56,329 --> 00:25:58,329
Yes. If Jenny is taken hostage,

392
00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:00,329
you fight with the hostage taker.
I'll take her.

393
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:01,970
Forget it.

394
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,970
I'm dumb enough to be taken as a hostage.

395
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,940
Why? Did I say something wrong?

396
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:13,509
I didn't ask him
to take me as a hostage either.

397
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:16,180
Anyway, it happened
because you were clumsy.

398
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,609
You're going too far.

399
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,549
How am I going far?
She has functioning arms and legs.

400
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:22,150
Why would she make others get hurt
by going around foolishly?

401
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,160
Working in the kitchen
must've made your language rough.

402
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,160
Hey.

403
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,059
What does her language have anything
to do with working in the kitchen?

404
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:33,430
How can she say that to someone
who barely managed to survive?

405
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:36,730
I mean,
Jenny is poor at expressing her thoughts,

406
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,369
but you don't need to involve the kitchen
in that matter.

407
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:40,869
I agree with him.

408
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:42,640
Agree with what?

409
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,210
How dare you act up?

410
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,009
Act up? What do you mean by that, Mr. Yoo?

411
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:48,240
Stop now.

412
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,210
You were clapping happily moments ago.
What is this now?

413
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,420
Let's go down and get ready for lunch.

414
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,420
- Yes, chef.
- Yes, chef.

415
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,690
Food and Beverage, let's start setting.

416
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:00,890
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

417
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,559
Yoon Hee. Walk slowly.

418
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,200
I can't walk that fast yet.

419
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:14,769
Don't be too upset.

420
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:18,410
Food and Beverage
and the kitchen don't get along.

421
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,579
They get into fights often
when they work in a rush,

422
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,079
so they're on edge.

423
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,519
It's not because of you.

424
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,980
Occasions like this will happen more
in the future, right?

425
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,589
Consider them hurdles to overcome.

426
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:34,690
They say nothing is easy.

427
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,390
You can do it.

428
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,289
You have power.

429
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,430
I don't. I'm just a woman.

430
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,730
You're different.

431
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,539
I got the strength because you had power.

432
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,940
Is that why you did something so rash?

433
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,880
When I first saw you being held hostage
by that guy...

434
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,140
Did you lose your mind?

435
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,180
Yes.

436
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,980
I thought it was fine for me to die.

437
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:02,849
This was the first time
I had such a thought and experience.

438
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:07,720
I thought I could sacrifice my life...

439
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,829
for you and what you wanted.

440
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,859
People say stuff like that easily,

441
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:14,500
but it's hard to actually do it
when the situation arises.

442
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,799
But...

443
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,039
that was what I felt.

444
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,410
- Young Jae, I'm sorry.
- About what?

445
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,650
- You treat me so well, but...
- Stop.

446
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,710
I like being like this.

447
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,720
I don't want anything from you.

448
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:40,119
I can't seem to have those kinds
of feelings for you.

449
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:42,029
I said, stop.

450
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:51,839
I have to get back to work.

451
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,339
- Bring the box quickly.
- Okay.

452
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:00,009
- Let's hurry up.
- Bring it here.

453
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:02,250
- Hey, Yoon Hee.
- Yes?

454
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,380
Where have you been again?

455
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,250
Don't you know lunch hour starts
after ten minutes?

456
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,220
You're new here,
but you keep playing hooky.

457
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,950
Where did you go this time?

458
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,160
I went to see Young Jae.

459
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,089
Birds of a feather flock together, is it?

460
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:17,130
Since you're from a rich family,
you hang around with the CEO's son?

461
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,160
That's not it, Ms. An.

462
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,329
Since Young Jae got hurt because of her,

463
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:23,400
they must've met for a while to talk.

464
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,269
- What's wrong with you?
- Stay out of this, silly.

465
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:28,369
Every why has a wherefore.

466
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:29,809
How can you not lose a single argument?

467
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:31,740
Mi Hee, that's enough.

468
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,710
Look. She doesn't even say sorry...

469
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,750
and is standing so brazenly.

470
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:37,809
She's such an eyesore.

471
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:42,089
Please understand her.

472
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:44,349
You know she's not a bad person, right?

473
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,289
I understand, but...

474
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:49,529
- Yoon Hee.
- Yes, Ms. An.

475
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:51,690
Go to the kitchen and tell them
to bring the appetizer quickly.

476
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,660
You can just call them.

477
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,829
I'm going to use the phone. Hurry up.

478
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:56,930
Okay.

479
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,839
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

480
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,910
Are you feeling sick?

481
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,140
No.

482
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,279
Then why do you look so pale?

483
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:11,509
You look especially pale and dull today.

484
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:15,250
Are you comforting or dissing me?

485
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,849
I'm genuinely worried.

486
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,220
You didn't go drinking again, did you?

487
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,319
I didn't.

488
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,359
I get it. It's the aftereffect.

489
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,430
What?

490
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,599
The aftereffect of love
is lasting for a long time.

491
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,529
It makes you get completely dried up.

492
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:32,940
You need to get over it quickly.

493
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:35,809
How do you know that
when you haven't even had your first kiss?

494
00:30:37,109 --> 00:30:38,339
Well, that's...

495
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,009
Yes, Lee Soon Jung speaking.

496
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,849
Gosh, Mr. Han.

497
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,950
Yes, she hasn't gotten off work yet.
Hold on, please.

498
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:48,079
Answer it.

499
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:52,089
Hello?

500
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:56,259
Casablanca? Why?

501
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,529
We looked around there last time.

502
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,730
Okay.

503
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,910
What is this?
You didn't get back together, did you?

504
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:14,880
Mr. Han.

505
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:19,380
- Tae Jun.
- Here.

506
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,019
What is it about?

507
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,789
Just because.

508
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,519
Can you light it up?

509
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,730
Why is there a cake? It has one candle.

510
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:33,000
Yes.

511
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,730
Do you know what day it is today?

512
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,440
If there's one candle...

513
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:43,069
This music.

514
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,710
This is from the movie, "Casablanca."

515
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,039
"As Time Goes By."

516
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,279
During the manager training.

517
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:57,720
Gosh, Tae Jun.

518
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:01,160
Today is your birthday, right?

519
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,529
I thought you were out of it
because of the other guy,

520
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:07,529
but you didn't forget this.

521
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:11,529
Right, during the training,

522
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,500
two of us sneaked into the restaurant...

523
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,410
and listened to this music and said,
"Humphrey and Ingrid..."

524
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:19,009
"are lovers forever
in the black-and-white film."

525
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:21,539
"So let us not age forever too."

526
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:24,279
You said that was why you put one candle
for your birthday cake.

527
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,250
Oh, dear. Why didn't you tell me?
You should've told others.

528
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,450
If the general manager announces
his birthday...

529
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,859
when the hotel is having a hard time,
the employees will feel pressured.

530
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,819
But everyone came for my birthday.

531
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:37,730
I don't want to cause trouble
like what happened during your birthday.

532
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,730
I'm sorry, Tae Jun.

533
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,700
It's okay.

534
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,769
I was going to let it pass
without saying anything,

535
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,910
but I thought I'd feel upset
if I didn't tell you as well. So I called.

536
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,269
You did well.

537
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:55,849
Do you...

538
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,819
remember what you gave me
for my birthday back then?

539
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:00,819
What?

540
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,349
I found out on that day,

541
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:05,890
so I couldn't prepare anything, right?

542
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,059
The name of the cocktail...

543
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:10,359
What is it?

544
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,859
Kiss of fire.

545
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,500
I remember it now.

546
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,869
I kissed you.

547
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,769
Do you want that present again?

548
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:26,279
I'm not interested in the lips
stolen by another guy.

549
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,950
I'm sorry. I was joking.

550
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,420
No, I know you weren't joking.

551
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,529
Well,

552
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,799
let's blow out the candle.

553
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,980
That time, we listened to this song...

554
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:03,849
and talked about our dreams
as hoteliers all night, right?

555
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:08,380
Why do days like those disappear
so quickly?

556
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:12,260
Our dreams are gone,
and only our work is left.

557
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,760
Why is each day so tough?

558
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,789
Tae Jun,
you must be having a hard time, right?

559
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,829
I'm fine with me having a hard time,

560
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,599
but I'm worried about you.

561
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,329
What about me?

562
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,699
You don't smile often nowadays.
Do you know that?

563
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,769
You used to smile all the time,

564
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,909
but you suddenly stopped smiling.
It's strange.

565
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,309
Am I a fool? I don't smile all the time.

566
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,480
Still, there are people who get happy
from your smile.

567
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,150
Guests?

568
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,250
Yes, the guests,

569
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,360
but your colleagues too.

570
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,090
Right.

571
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,000
I'm too lost nowadays, right?

572
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:00,199
If you're going to forget him,
forget quickly.

573
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,670
Don't keep him in your heart for too long.

574
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:06,409
What's there to worry about
if I can think however I want?

575
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,179
There will be no worries...

576
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:11,210
nor regrets in the world.

577
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:17,949
I'm worried about the hotel too.

578
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:21,889
There's nobody else who loves the hotel
as much as I do.

579
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,130
You know that, right?

580
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,900
Of course.

581
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,769
As much as you love the hotel, I...

582
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:31,769
Do you...

583
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,369
love me?

584
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,510
Well...

585
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:44,510
I treasure you as my good colleague.

586
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,980
You're saying that you love me.

587
00:35:57,059 --> 00:35:58,630
Thank you, Tae Jun.

588
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:01,400
I hope you stay...

589
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:05,429
as a comfortable friend like this.

590
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:12,340
Cheers. Happy birthday.

591
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:15,179
- As for the present...
- Just skip it.

592
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,750
Where have you been all day?

593
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,619
Leo, get to work starting tomorrow.

594
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,019
Tell Eric to buy the 15 percent
of the overseas shares...

595
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:07,960
and buy all the remaining shares
in the market.

596
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,690
Buy them at a price 20 percent higher
than the market price.

597
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:11,960
As much as 20 percent?

598
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:14,260
If there's not enough money,
use the money from my bank account.

599
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,869
And find out
who in the hotel are against Han Tae Jun.

600
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:21,869
I roughly know the list.

601
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,039
Have you met them?

602
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,469
Not yet.

603
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,940
I'll meet them myself,
so get it ready quickly.

604
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:30,010
Can I ask why you're rushing again?

605
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:33,579
I'm just going back to doing it my way.

606
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:35,789
Are you talking about the woman or work?

607
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,219
Both.

608
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,309
How did it go?

609
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:04,980
Things are looking bright.

610
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,750
Chairman Kim is brighter.

611
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,920
Eric is dazzling.

612
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:11,349
Okay. Let's go.

613
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:16,090
Exactly.

614
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:18,289
I hope it turns out well.

615
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,900
We'll find out today or tomorrow.

616
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,000
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- It's okay.

617
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:56,769
We're meeting for a happy occasion.

618
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,469
So what will happen to our hotel now?

619
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:00,800
Will Kim Bok Man take over?

620
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,769
Since you and Young Jae have 40 percent
of the shares,

621
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:06,440
we need to get hold of 11 percent first.

622
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,510
They must've bought all the shares
in the market.

623
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,610
We have no choice but to persuade
the minority shareholders.

624
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:12,079
Do you have the list of the shareholders?

625
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,820
Here.

626
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,389
I can't meet you today.

627
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,289
I already have a plan.

628
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,610
Come on, can't you even do that much
as a bank manager?

629
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:46,280
I'm angry because that's all you can do,

630
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,619
not because I don't know
what kind of person Chairman Kim is.

631
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:53,519
Fine.

632
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,599
Yes.

633
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,159
This is room service.

634
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,730
Yoon Hee, what is this?

635
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,170
I brought you dinner.

636
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,940
It's a kimchi stew set.

637
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:11,170
I added grilled pork and braised hairtail,

638
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:13,809
and there are fruits and sikhye
for dessert...

639
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:15,280
since coffee's bad for your health.

640
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,510
I paid for it, of course.

641
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,219
Why would you bring something like this?

642
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:22,250
If you don't like the menu,
would you like something else, sir?

643
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,650
It became a habit.

644
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,559
Would you like something else, Tae Jun?

645
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,119
No, I like the menu.

646
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,630
But it must be hard working
at the restaurant, so why bother...

647
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:34,260
I heard things were getting tough
for the hotel.

648
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,269
So you want me to eat this and cheer up?

649
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,769
Yes.

650
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:41,800
Thank you.

651
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,880
Let me start eating.

652
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,440
Eat up.

653
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:51,309
But there's something missing.

654
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:53,050
What is it?

655
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:55,949
Oh, right.

656
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,460
- On the right.
- What's wrong with me?

657
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,989
You can join me.

658
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:08,059
We can't eat with the guests of the hotel.

659
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:09,329
I'm sorry, sir.

660
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:12,170
You always make me happy.

661
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:14,940
How can I make you happy?

662
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,309
Since we can't eat together in the hotel,

663
00:42:17,309 --> 00:42:18,840
treat me to a nice meal outside.

664
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,940
- Well...
- When you're not busy.

665
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,849
We have a lot of time.

666
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,889
(Preview, I love you.)

667
00:42:31,889 --> 00:42:33,420
(I love you. You're all I have.)

668
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,630
It's Young Jae's work.
When will he grow up?

669
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:39,159
Don't be so harsh on him.

670
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,730
There's no other men
who treat you as well as he does.

671
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,170
I don't think he's lacking as a boyfriend.

672
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:47,369
But I don't think of him
as more than a friend.

673
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:49,099
Young Jae seemed to want more than that.

674
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,570
Don't mind about that...

675
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,880
and eat up.

676
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:55,210
(Email)

677
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,579
(Preview, I'll do it if you want!)

678
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:22,300
Hey, don't pull a prank like this.

679
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:25,210
I'm scared that the hostage taker
might appear in my dream.

680
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,280
Dream about me.
I'll protect you in my dream.

681
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,610
Stop being nonsense, and get going.

682
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:30,550
- Are you going home straight?
- No, I have a business to attend.

683
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:31,949
Business? You?

684
00:43:31,949 --> 00:43:32,949
Yes.

685
00:43:32,949 --> 00:43:34,280
Except for the time spent at the hotel,

686
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,889
I agreed to follow my father's schedule.

687
00:43:36,889 --> 00:43:39,820
I'll meet whoever he wants me to meet
and go wherever he wants me to go.

688
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,059
You're amazing, Yoon Hee.

689
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:42,360
You might really become
a businesswoman one day.

690
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:43,760
I already am.

691
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,329
Let's go.

692
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:03,650
So...

693
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:07,380
you found someone
who's holding three percent of the shares?

694
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:08,820
He's Kim Han Su,

695
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,820
an ex-assemblyman who passed away
from cerebral hemorrhage last year.

696
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,820
All his shares are
under his wife's name now.

697
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,920
Her name is Song Ji Hyun.

698
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:16,530
Song Ji Hyun.

699
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:20,630
I've met Ms. Song a few times.

700
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,469
She had scandals with many men,

701
00:44:23,469 --> 00:44:24,829
but only her husband wasn't aware of it.

702
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:26,699
Poor man.

703
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,039
In the end, he did what was good
for his wife and died first.

704
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,469
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Have a seat.

705
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,179
Then...

706
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:37,110
as long as
we get Ms. Song's three percent,

707
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:40,980
is Seoul Hotel done for?

708
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,059
It's okay.

709
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:50,460
She's determined to inherit my business.

710
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,489
To inherit my business in the future,

711
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:55,260
it's better to listen to this much.

712
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,030
If we get the three percent,

713
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,599
we can make the executives of Seoul Hotel
step down immediately.

714
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,869
We can completely replace
the CEO, directors,

715
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:04,869
and even the general manager.

716
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,110
I should hire more people.

717
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:11,579
Anyway, I'll leave this to you.

718
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,179
Let's drink.

719
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:19,860
How's working at the hotel like, Yoon Hee?

720
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:23,090
- Pardon?
- Is working at the hotel fun?

721
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:26,460
- Yes.
- I wish she would just stay at home...

722
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,800
and get married.

723
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:31,969
But what can I do?
She takes after me and likes work more.

724
00:45:34,769 --> 00:45:37,869
Right. Frank, do you have a girlfriend?

725
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:42,949
He has many ladies chasing after him.

726
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:46,380
He's handsome, well-mannered, and rich.

727
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,550
He's not lacking in any way.

728
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,119
I'm sure about that.

729
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:52,289
You know,

730
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:55,289
women chase after men's honor and wealth.

731
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,929
And women confuse it with love.

732
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,500
You see right through it.

733
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:03,400
Marriage is a business to people like us.

734
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,599
Isn't that right, Frank?

735
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:07,869
Let's discuss more about Ms. Song.

736
00:46:07,869 --> 00:46:10,239
You need to help us find her.

737
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:12,880
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Han.

738
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,610
You found all the shareholders
when there were so many of them?

739
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:15,809
Yes, I found them all.

740
00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:17,409
Except for the last three percent.

741
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:18,409
Who does it belong to?

742
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:20,250
It was transferred multiple times
from one borrowed-name account to another,

743
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,449
so it's not easy to find the owner.

744
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,949
The opponents can't get their hands on it.

745
00:46:24,219 --> 00:46:25,389
If they do, it will be a disaster.

746
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,320
What should we do?

747
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:28,760
We need to find that person.

748
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:30,090
Who could it be?

749
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,840
I want to rest a few days
in Diamond Villa.

750
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:48,840
Yes, well,

751
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,750
that villa is already booked.

752
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:53,579
Can I recommend you another villa
that has a nice view?

753
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:57,920
Miss, you're that lady
from three years ago, right?

754
00:46:58,949 --> 00:46:59,989
Pardon?

755
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:05,460
You haven't changed at all.

756
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,099
Thank you.

757
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,099
I want Diamond Villa.

758
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:14,469
I'm sorry.

759
00:47:14,469 --> 00:47:16,940
It's already booked,
so you can't stay there.

760
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,269
It can't be helped, then.

761
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:22,079
I'll ask the general manager himself.

762
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,110
I can meet him, right?

763
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,019
Things have changed a lot
since three years ago.

764
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:34,719
Yes. We renovated it.

765
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:36,460
Do you like the room, ma'am?

766
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,559
Things have changed a lot for sure.

767
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,329
How is Mr. Han compared
to three years ago?

768
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:48,070
I don't think he would've changed a bit.
Am I right?

769
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:52,070
I miss him since it's been too long.

770
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:54,309
Can you call him right away?

771
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,849
Does he know that my husband passed away?

772
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,780
I'm single now.

773
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:01,519
I'm sorry,

774
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:04,889
but Mr. Han is on a business trip now.

775
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:08,389
Really? To where?

776
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:12,329
He went to Jeju Island
to attend a seminar.

777
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,530
Then he should come back soon.

778
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:15,929
I got it.

779
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,530
Rest well, ma'am.

780
00:48:17,969 --> 00:48:19,130
Wait.

781
00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:24,309
Go and buy my underwear and pantyhose.

782
00:48:24,409 --> 00:48:26,409
Here are the size and the brand I want.

783
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,349
Yes, ma'am.

784
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,820
Ms. Seo, is Mr. Han on a business trip?

785
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,750
I met him in the lobby in the afternoon.

786
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,659
- He's not on a business trip.
- What?

787
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:42,590
Hyun Chul,
don't tell Mr. Han that she's here.

788
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:44,329
But if she keeps looking for him...

789
00:48:44,329 --> 00:48:45,429
Never.

790
00:48:45,429 --> 00:48:47,730
You must never let her meet Mr. Han.

791
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:49,800
If he gets into another trouble with her,

792
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,269
he'll be really done for.

793
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,639
But I can't lie to the guest.

794
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,440
Hyun Chul.
Do you want to see Mr. Han get fired?

795
00:48:57,539 --> 00:48:59,369
She's such an eyesore.

796
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,010
Why did she come back like a ghost,

797
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:02,780
trying to devour Mr. Han?

798
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:06,010
I better hide this from Mr. Han, right?

799
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,079
Of course. You did a good job.

800
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:12,190
You made a wise decision unlike yourself
for the first time in a while.

801
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:15,190
Make sure the employees don't find out
about her.

802
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:17,989
It will be a hassle if things go wrong
and Mr. Han hears of this.

803
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,429
I understand.

804
00:49:19,929 --> 00:49:22,429
Making the employees
keep their mouths shut is my specialty.

805
00:49:23,469 --> 00:49:26,940
There won't be a problem
as long as you keep your mouth shut.

806
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:28,769
What? Gosh.

807
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:31,710
- I'll get going, then.
- Okay.

808
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:35,340
I should check with a department store
for this.

809
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,380
What?

810
00:49:41,949 --> 00:49:43,190
What about a department store?

811
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:45,190
To buy pantyhose and underwear.

812
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,820
What? "Pantyhose and underwear?"

813
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,329
She's going to a department store
to buy those during her working hours?

814
00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:52,730
Not hers but a guest's, Mr. Oh.

815
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,500
A guest?

816
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,800
What kind of a guest makes her do that?

817
00:49:58,429 --> 00:49:59,599
Who else...

818
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,900
but Prima Donna Song staying
in Pearl Villa?

819
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:05,670
- Who?
- You know, that famous woman.

820
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,880
Ms. Song,
the wife of the deceased Assemblyman Kim.

821
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,309
The woman who got Mr. Han fired. Oh, my.

822
00:50:11,849 --> 00:50:14,019
That Ms. Song
from three years ago came back?

823
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:17,590
Mr. Oh, forget about what I said, please?

824
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,289
I promised Ms. Seo.

825
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,719
Don't worry. I'm tight-lipped.

826
00:50:26,929 --> 00:50:28,300
Yes, Oh Hyung Man speaking.

827
00:50:29,869 --> 00:50:33,500
What? Why should I meet you?

828
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,010
Why did you want to see me?

829
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:40,280
If it's about taking your room key away,

830
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:42,579
I thought it was already dealt with.

831
00:50:42,579 --> 00:50:44,250
I totally understand why you did that.

832
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:49,219
Seoul Hotel was able to grow this much...

833
00:50:49,219 --> 00:50:51,789
because it had people like you
with the guts to do such things.

834
00:50:54,289 --> 00:50:56,530
You've worked at this hotel
for almost 20 years, right?

835
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,989
That's right. How...

836
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:00,699
After CEO Choi passed away,

837
00:51:00,699 --> 00:51:03,130
you should've been promoted
to the general manager,

838
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:05,730
but you were pushed back by Mr. Han
and are having a hard time, right?

839
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,239
Mr. Han has less experience than you,

840
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:14,710
and he was even fired from the hotel
due to a disgraceful incident.

841
00:51:14,809 --> 00:51:17,510
Stop beating around the bush
and get to the point.

842
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,250
If I take over Seoul Hotel,

843
00:51:23,889 --> 00:51:26,050
I want
to give you the general manager position.

844
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:30,059
But you need to help me in return.

845
00:51:30,929 --> 00:51:32,730
You need to check the state...

846
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,230
of the hotel with me.

847
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:37,000
Are you telling me to betray the hotel...

848
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,599
and even act as a spy?

849
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:40,369
That's the way to save the hotel.

850
00:51:40,699 --> 00:51:41,869
Excuse me, sir.

851
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:43,269
If things continue this way,

852
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:45,539
Seoul Hotel will go bankrupt.

853
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:46,980
I'm sure you know this better
than anyone else.

854
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:50,010
If that happens,

855
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:53,949
you and the 1,200 employees
of the hotel...

856
00:51:53,949 --> 00:51:55,949
will lose their jobs overnight.

857
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,190
Saving the hotel
by providing enough funds...

858
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:03,989
before it's too late is the way
for everyone to live.

859
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,590
Normalization of management.

860
00:52:05,929 --> 00:52:09,260
In other words,
whether Seoul Hotel dries up to death...

861
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:11,329
or revives...

862
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:13,969
is up to you, Mr. Oh.

863
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,019
I need some time to think through this.

864
00:52:30,019 --> 00:52:31,389
Everything else is fine but that.

865
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:34,260
We don't have much time.
We don't know when the hotel will dry up.

866
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,519
We need to water it quickly.

867
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:37,929
You'll understand
when you check the shares.

868
00:52:38,659 --> 00:52:41,599
It's over once we get three more percent.

869
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,269
We even know who has it.

870
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:44,670
We just need to find the person.

871
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:47,539
No matter how hard Tae Jun tries
to stop us,

872
00:52:47,769 --> 00:52:49,599
he won't be able to beat us.

873
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:53,210
If we get the three percent
of the shares that Ms. Song is holding,

874
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:56,780
Seoul Hotel's owner
will change immediately.

875
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:00,780
You'll become the general manager, Mr. Oh.

876
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:04,719
Leo.

877
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:14,300
Don't get me wrong. This isn't a bribe.

878
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:17,300
Consider this the expense
for many works...

879
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,829
you'll have to do from now on.

880
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:22,369
Don't worry about filing receipts.

881
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:38,550
Song... Ms. Song?

882
00:53:39,389 --> 00:53:41,090
Right, he said it was Ms. Song.

883
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,889
How do you know her, Yoon Hee?

884
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:46,090
I had dinner with my father yesterday.

885
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:47,760
Shin Dong Hyuk was there too.

886
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,829
You know him, right?
He's staying in the villa.

887
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,730
He said...

888
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,099
that as long as they get the three percent
that Song or whoever is holding,

889
00:53:56,639 --> 00:53:59,309
Seoul Hotel will be in my father's hands.

890
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:02,440
Yoon Hee. Why are you telling me this?

891
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,849
Father said he would change
the entire management...

892
00:54:04,849 --> 00:54:07,420
and even the general manager
once he takes over the hotel.

893
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,449
If that happens,

894
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:13,760
you'll have to leave.

895
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:18,230
I don't want that to happen.

896
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,059
If your father knows
about you doing this...

897
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:25,500
He is rich enough without Seoul Hotel.

898
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:27,869
But to CEO Yoon, the employees,

899
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:31,139
and you, Seoul Hotel is everything.

900
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:37,309
You don't have much time.
You need to find her now.

901
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:41,619
Who are you?

902
00:54:42,349 --> 00:54:45,849
Hi, I'm the one who called you earlier.

903
00:54:47,019 --> 00:54:48,960
You're Shin Dong Hyuk?

904
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:51,559
I'm Shin Dong Hyuk.

905
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:54,260
I see. Come in.

906
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:03,539
- Ms. Seo, where are you going?
- This.

907
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,639
You didn't put any frog
or spider in there, right?

908
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:08,110
Goodness.

909
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:10,780
(Current Financial Status of Seoul Hotel,
Status of May, 2001)

910
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:23,829
So you want me to hand over the shares
of Seoul Hotel I got from my husband...

911
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,960
to you?

912
00:55:25,329 --> 00:55:27,099
We'll pay you 20 percent higher
than the market price.

913
00:55:27,099 --> 00:55:28,599
You won't lose anything from this bargain.

914
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,500
Honestly, I'm not interested in shares...

915
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,239
or business and whatnot.

916
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:36,599
There's someone else managing my assets.

917
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:39,510
I know that you make the final decisions.

918
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,440
You stopped managing your assets
three months ago,

919
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,550
and you entrusted your shares
to a security company.

920
00:55:46,449 --> 00:55:48,480
You must've done a lot of research.

921
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,849
I can't help it. It's my job.
I hope you understand.

922
00:55:51,019 --> 00:55:53,690
- Shin Dong Hyuk, was it?
- Yes.

923
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:56,219
You're handsome.

924
00:55:58,389 --> 00:56:00,800
If I give you my shares,

925
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,630
what can you do for me?

926
00:56:02,929 --> 00:56:05,199
As I said before, 20 percent...

927
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:08,239
Let me tell you this clearly.
I'm not a playboy.

928
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,210
I have nothing more to discuss
about the terms of the deal.

929
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:19,349
Would treating you to a nice dinner
in thanks be enough?

930
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,650
Sure.

931
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:24,449
I can treat you to a drink too.

932
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,889
Keep quiet, mister.

933
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:32,090
Excuse me. Coming.

934
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:39,230
Ma'am,
here are your pantyhose and underwear.

935
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,300
Is that so?

936
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:44,639
I told you to buy the ones in the note.
What are all these?

937
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:46,980
The products you wrote down were sold out,

938
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,409
so I bought the new products.

939
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:51,280
Not all new products are good.
