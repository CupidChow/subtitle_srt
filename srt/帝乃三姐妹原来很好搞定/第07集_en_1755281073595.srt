00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 4

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,000
Why are you so relaxed, Miwa?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Studying in a hurry on the day of the exam is not beautiful.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,500
Miko-chan, you don't study at all.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,000
Shut up. You're just pretending to be physically strong.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,500
Miko-san, let's start the problem.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,500
Oh, you're already in the second class, right?

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Yes.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,000
You're in the wrong class.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,500
Oh, really?

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, this is it.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,500
I'm glad you looked at it again.

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,500
What?

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,500
You're so loud.

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
You're the same age as me.

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,500
You can talk like that.

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,500
Then, in English, it's...

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,500
What?

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,500
My bag!

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,500
It's a hit!

21
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
You're a nuisance!

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,500
Wait!

23
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,500
What's wrong with him?

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,500
He's slow.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's a mistake!

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,500
I'll beat you more!

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
He's strong!

28
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Miko-san, you're against that man!

29
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,500
Don't panic, Yu.

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Don't underestimate my situation.

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,500
You're the man.

32
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,000
Shame on you, Yu.

33
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Oh, you're so cool!

34
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
Is that Miko from Karateka?

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,500
Yeah, we had a bad opponent.

36
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,500
Thank you very much.

37
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,000
Are you all right?

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,500
Yes.

39
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,000
How's the injury?

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm fine.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Niko-san!

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It looks like it hurts!

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You're bleeding!

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You just...

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You're exaggerating!

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm training hard!

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is just a scratch!

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No, no.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Even a scratch can hurt.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And even if you're strong,

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
you can still be scared.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Idiot.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm not scared of you.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You're all over the place.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
In the meantime...

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He's back!

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You're in the way!

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Move!

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
A sudden death?

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's...

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hey, that girl...

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Tatsumi Hayato from Iwayama High School?

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Iwayama is the place where the top of the Karate world is trained.

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That...

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The ace of that place is the chief!

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Tatsumi Hayato from Tensai Karate!

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
A Karate genius?

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And he's handsome!

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Has he ever been to my house?

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't remember.

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What are you doing here, Tatsumi-senpai?

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Hey, I'm here to see you.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Tatsumi-senpai!

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Hey, Nico.

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You called me?

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Nico, I'm here to pick you up.

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The love of the present world is a miracle, a wonderful miracle for you

136
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The dream of the rice you made, the dream of the hand you made with you

137
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The magic you made, I'm walking with a boredom

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So, for the first week from today, we, Iwayama High School,

139
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
have decided to train together with Saika Academy.

140
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm counting on you.

141
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm counting on you.

142
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Why are you here, Ayase?

143
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You're not in Karate Club, are you?

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Well, it's fine.

145
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's fine.

146
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Nico.

147
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Nico, I'm here to pick you up.

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What does that mean?

149
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
More importantly, that Nico-san is so stubborn.

150
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That senpai is really strong.

151
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yes?

152
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Before that, you two are from the same dojo.

153
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Don't pick on the person who's the culprit.

154
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's what I want to say, but be careful of that Tatsumi Hayato.

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Tatsumi Nao is so cool.

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
She's different from my old boys.

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You're so stubborn.

158
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Tatsumi-senpai.

159
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's been a while since we've had a hand-to-hand conversation.

160
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Nico, you're really strong as a man and a woman.

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Senpai, please.

162
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You haven't listened to me for a long time.

163
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Nico-san.

164
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Chief, please beat him up.

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I will.

166
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's enough.

167
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Seriously?

168
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
That chief...

169
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
A toast?

170
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Senpai is really different.

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
One more round!

172
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Stop!

173
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No, you can't.

174
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You're already tired.

175
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You should stop being so nice to your cute juniors.

176
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I know, but...

177
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Who?

178
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Don't be so mean.

179
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But...

180
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
To me, you're a hero.

181
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
When my dad took me to the dojo for the first time, I was able to beat the older boys.

182
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
My dad was beaten up and he got angry.

183
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
After that, he was almost beaten up.

184
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That's when Tatsumi-senpai helped me.

185
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He moved when he was in middle school.

186
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We'll see each other again at the national tournament.

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Senpai is encouraging me.

188
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I thought he was a high school student, but I didn't know he was a person I admired.

189
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I've learned about your skills, Nico.

190
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I knew you'd take me to my place.

191
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What's that supposed to mean?

192
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It means the same thing.

193
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll take you to Iwayama Karate Club.

194
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What are you talking about? That's a boys' school.

195
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
No, I've been in the school since this year.

196
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'll talk to Nico's father about it.

197
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If you want to get stronger than now, come to me.

198
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
After all, Nico is the strongest in the family.

199
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Is it meaningful to train with someone weaker than you?

200
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm not weak! I'm in the national top!

201
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We're trained by the headmaster every day!

202
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Then who's going to train Nico?

203
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's...

204
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
There's no merit to Nico being here.

205
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Could it be that we're relying on the headmaster...

206
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
...and pulling him?

207
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Don't say anything bad about the club.

208
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Shido is well trained.

209
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No, headmaster.

210
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's what Tatsumi-senpai said.

211
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We're fine with it, but the headmaster...

212
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You guys...

213
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
See? You guys understand, right?

214
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's aim for the top of the martial arts, Nico.

215
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Um...

216
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Nico-san!

217
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You're still here?

218
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Let's go home together.

219
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But it's amazing that you're pulling yourself into the martial arts.

220
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah.

221
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's about time we stopped talking about this.

222
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's right, but...

223
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I feel like I'm still a bit confused.

224
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's not your problem.

225
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But...

226
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I thought Nico-san wasn't listening to me.

227
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's an honor to hear that.

228
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Iwayama High School is a well-off school.

229
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
They manage meals, support the living, and hire professionals.

230
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's a perfect school that's perfect for the day.

231
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's amazing.

232
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But it's well-off?

233
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I see.

234
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's a well-off school.

235
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I should've accepted it long ago.

236
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But now...

237
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Nico's School

238
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Can I say something that's not my style?

239
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
No.

240
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I want to be with you.

241
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Me too!

242
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The chief felt the same way as we did!

243
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We want to be with you too!

244
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But...

245
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That bastard should go to Tasumi-senpai's school to improve the chief's talent!

246
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We'll be fine.

247
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Don't worry and come back!

248
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I want to tell him that!

249
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I want to tell him that!

250
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Did you have to wait for me?

251
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You're all idiots.

252
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Nico-san.

253
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The staff felt the same way as you did.

254
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Everyone wants to be with you.

255
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I didn't know you were so fond of me!

256
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Kazuki-san and the others are leaving.

257
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'll make dinner right away.

258
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Nico.

260
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You can use my shampoo today.

261
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's a treatment.

262
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
10,000 yen for one bottle?!

263
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah.

264
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I used it wrong the other day and it was torn apart!

265
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Nico-chan.

266
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Sashimi.

267
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Osowakesu.

268
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I can't even give up my favorite food!

269
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It was a terrible dinner.

270
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Those two are so nice.

271
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Nico-san's talk about being a drag was a rumor in school.

272
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It seems like it's not just the staff.

273
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I want to be with Nico-san.

274
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The next day

275
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Kazuki and Miwa are...

276
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yu.

277
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What do you think?

278
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
He's listening to everyone's feelings.

279
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I want to be with him.

280
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The people of Iwayama are strong.

281
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The chief will be gone soon.

282
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Let's keep our spirits up.

283
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Tatsumi-senpai.

284
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's about the drag.

285
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah.

286
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I can't.

287
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I can't go to see my senpai.

288
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Chief, are you serious?

289
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm disqualified, Nico.

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I can do karate in a place better than the Saika.

291
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I can teach you.

292
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Don't say such things like a fool.

293
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You have to follow the same path as me.

294
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But...

295
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
There's no choice.

296
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You're not the Nico I know.

297
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Why don't you want to go that far?

298
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's...

299
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Um...

300
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Anyway, come to my house after the practice period.

301
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You can't prioritize your talent.

302
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You're not a normal girl.

303
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I...

304
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What?

305
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I heard Nico-san's will.

306
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yu...

307
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You were in there all this time?

308
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I've made up my mind.

309
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
If Nico-san has a strong side in Tatsumi-senpai's theory,

310
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Nico-san will be fine here.

311
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Are you sure?

312
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yeah.

313
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But that strong guy, Saika...

314
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What's this?

315
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'll beat you!

316
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Then I'll be stronger than you!

317
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Beat you? Why?

318
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I want to be with Nico-san!

319
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'll win for sure to be with Nico-san!

320
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yu...

321
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Ayase...

322
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
No, it's not impossible to beat Tatsumi-senpai.

323
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Tatsumi-senpai is the best Karate player in the country.

324
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
He's been in the top three in the individual category.

325
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Look at his body.

326
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Wait! He's Ayase Subaru's son!

327
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That's right!

328
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I think I can beat him!

329
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Huh?

330
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The action is also done by the son of the actress.

331
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
As expected of the genius Saika Gakuen.

332
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
There's a great guy.

333
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Well...

334
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
But sorry, Ayase-kun.

335
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm more suitable for Nico's side.

336
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Senpai!

337
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yu, I appreciate your feelings, but...

338
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I can't let you beat Tatsumi-senpai.

339
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'll win!

340
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'll be by Nico-san's side!

341
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What?

342
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Well done, Ayase!

343
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Nico.

344
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Nico-san!

345
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Wait...

346
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I like you...

347
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I understand.

348
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I can't get away from you.

349
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Let's have a match on the last day of the practice.

350
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But if you lose, Nico will get it.

351
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Okay!

352
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's not okay.

353
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You're making a strange promise.

354
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yes. So please teach me, Nico-san.

355
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Of course.

356
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
My luck is on you.

357
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'll get a little stronger until the day of the match.

358
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Okay!

359
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Just a little warm-up.

360
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Step on the ball so you can move fast.

361
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Okay!

362
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That's a bad rhythm.

363
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's okay.

364
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Tatsumi-senpai's weapon is a long-distance kick.

365
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You'll only get into trouble if you do.

366
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Trouble?

367
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Like this?

368
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
The moon is coming, so be careful!

369
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Okay.

370
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You're such a fool.

371
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You're just like someone who would do something like that.

372
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Here, take a rest.

373
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm sorry.

374
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I know that you and I are different in power.

375
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But I don't want to make you a reason to not try to be talented.

376
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And I said it with all my might during the club activities.

377
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I want to be with you.

378
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Great!

379
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
With the three sisters.

380
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You're so naive, even though you're a good old man.

381
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I know you're being arrogant, but...

382
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The Three Sisters

383
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's not my fault.

384
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I should've seen them off earlier this morning.

385
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I see.

386
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Well, I've talked about everything.

387
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So, Niko-san, please tell me everything.

388
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Huh?

389
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Huh?

390
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Why do you want to stay here until you give up your power?

391
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm strong!

392
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But you're the one who's going to win!

393
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm fighting for you, Niko-san.

394
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Go.

395
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
That's a stupid reason.

396
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
That's why I want you to stay at home.

397
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's not stupid.

398
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's true that I want to be with the club members.

399
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But I want to stay at home...

400
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Well...

401
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's not your fault!

402
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Niko-san...

403
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And Kazuki and Miyama work hard every day.

404
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
When I see them, I get motivated.

405
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
See? I'm satisfied, but I won't say it twice.

406
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yes.

407
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Kazuki and Miyama, you were there, weren't you?

408
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
No, I just got here.

409
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You were there the whole time.

410
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's going to be a tough fight.

411
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'll help you out a little.

412
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'll cheer you on.

413
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'll cheer you on.

414
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yes, I'll do my best!

415
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm going to go to the club.

416
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm going to go to the club.

417
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm going to go to the club.

418
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm going to go to the club.

419
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm going to go to the club.

420
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm going to go to the club.

421
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm going to go to the club.

422
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm going to go to the club.

423
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm going to go to the club.

424
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm going to go to the club.

425
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm going to go to the club.

426
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm going to go to the club.

427
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm going to go to the club.

428
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm going to go to the club.

429
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The End

430
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Come on, Yu!

431
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Next up is the distance match!

432
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yes!

433
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
There's only five days left until the match!

434
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Let's do this!

435
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
We ran 10km together, but he's too energetic.

436
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
He's a genius.

437
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
He's so weird.

438
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yu, if you're this tired, you won't be able to win.

439
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm fine, Nico.

440
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
The strategy is set.

441
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I, Hayato Tatsumi,

442
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
will be playing karate.

443
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
If I win, please give up on your draw.

444
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Tatsumi Senpai, please don't use your leg muscles.

445
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Ayase Yu.

446
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Don't use your leg muscles?

447
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
That little girl is so cute.

448
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
She's so cute.

449
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm not going to let Nico win against her.

450
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You don't have pride?

451
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I've been using it in the bathroom for a while.

452
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Well, I can't help it.

453
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
If I know that I can't attack from the shoulder,

454
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I can easily build up my practice menu.

455
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'll do the right side's receive, kick, and moon's enhancement until the sun sets.

456
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yes, I won't let Nico win.

457
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
But it's not yours.

458
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm sorry.

459
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Then I won't let Nico win.

460
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
No, you haven't changed.

461
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'll definitely protect you.

462
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Don't say that.
