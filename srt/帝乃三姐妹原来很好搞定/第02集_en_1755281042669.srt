00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,000
Yu, I want you to help the girls.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,500
Help? Me?

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes. You're right.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,000
Kazuki is an audition for the south.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,500
Niko is a regular at the Karate World Championships.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,500
Miwa is a substitute for the title.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We'll overcome the wall together.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This will be a chance for you to talk to the girls.

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,500
Yes!

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
I'm counting on you, Yu.

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,500
Ah...

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Wait, my Delma is crying.

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not just a regular at sports and studying.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm a super-ordinary genius.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm already a top-class genius.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What can I do for you?

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
I'm working hard on my days off.

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,000
But...but what if...

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,500
What if...

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,500
What if those three fail the audition?

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,500
You're the son of the actress, Ayase Subaru, right?

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,000
You're not as talented as I thought you were.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You're disappointed in me, aren't you?

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That was tough for me, even though I'm an ordinary person.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I have no choice.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll do what I can.

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,500
First, we need to know more about each other.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For that,

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'll eat with those three!

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,000
Every day, we're together, once a day

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Without any fear, we're going to polish our abilities

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,000
I can't stop, it's impossible now

34
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Every day, we're together, once a day

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Please be careful, too

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The warmth in my heart won't stop

37
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,000
Like the rain in the cold, cold, cold rain

38
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,500
In my sweet and delicate heart

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I can't show it to anyone

40
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,500
To the blue future, a love like spring

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Like bitter coffee, I drop one of my heart

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm lost, I want you to think of me

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I want to reach you, ordinary happiness

44
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,500
A love miracle like a drama

45
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
A miracle that suits you

46
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,000
The dream of the meal you made

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,500
The dream of the home you made

48
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,000
The dream of the magic you made

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll carry it with me and walk away

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Welcome home.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, I forgot about this guy.

52
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,000
Nico-san, would you like to taste it?

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Taste it?

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So that's how you're going to feed me.

55
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,000
Too bad.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I bought my own food, so I don't need it.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You can have the taste of it.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh...

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You're getting serious!

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Next, I'll boil it in a vacuum pack for 30 minutes.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Keep the temperature at 65 degrees.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The way to get the soup stock is to soak it in water.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
When it's back, add bonito flakes and stand.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
After one minute, rub it with a cloth.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The next one is fine. It smells.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The amount of the recipe book is terrible!

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This bastard.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He's trying to say that I refused to eat.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Huh? Nico-chan?

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Welcome home, Miwa-san.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Please wait, you two.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Today, I'll make the best dish for you.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What's that?

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's useless.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's useless to be distracted.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't need it.

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Why?

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I made it with high-quality ingredients from the first-class chefs.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
If it's a normal child, everyone will be happy.

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Why don't you eat it?

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I manage what goes into my body.

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I manage it.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Minerals and calcium and vitamin C are in the protein of low fat.

84
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's perfect.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
There's no one.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Just look at it.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What's this balanced athlete meal?

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's 32.4 grams of protein.

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Vitamin C is 72 milligrams.

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Calcium is about 50 milligrams.

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And there's plenty of miso to help digest.

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Considering Nico-san's physical activity level,

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
it's not enough for the regular training period.

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I know! I know!

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I know!

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I arranged the recipe for Nico-san for the regular nutritionist.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This perfect nutrition balance...

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Nico-san should be satisfied.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Just for me?

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Don't decide on your own.

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Just a bite...

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I know! I just have to eat it.

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's not bad.

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You're a good nutritionist.

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What are you imagining?

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Shuri.

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
DGA 662 milligrams!

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I made a rice meal.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I know! I know!

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I know! I know!

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm going to eat it quietly.

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
DGA...

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Is Miya's meat a special dish?

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm going over there.

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's hard to eat if you're watching.

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't want to.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Why?

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's been a while since I've seen Nico-chan in this seat.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah.

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You look a lot better from the front.

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Shut up! You too!

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm talking about myself.

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You're always talking about your lack of exercise.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's okay.

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Calories are good for brain work.

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What's up, you two?

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You're early today.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What's wrong with you guys?

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's a risotto with brown rice and green vegetables.

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Vitamin A and B2 are cells that make healthy skin.

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The acid in the marina of this salmon is said to have a antioxidant effect.

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's a beauty-making ingredient that's good for beauty.

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You're so clumsy.

134
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You're being treated like a foodie.

135
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Hey, he doesn't have any bad feelings.

136
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You have a bad look on your face.

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's like a normal family dining scene.

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What?

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't deserve it.

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That place and the food that a stranger made.

141
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Give it to me.

142
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The selfish prince doesn't deserve this meal.

143
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If you eat that, you'll be overweight by 48.5 grams.

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
If you let your emotions take over and eat less, you'll really become a foodie.

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That's not where you're supposed to eat.

146
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But don't worry.

147
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'll take care of everything that's going to get into Nico.

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You're the one who's talking nonsense.

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I was taken away by the Mikado family.

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's been three days already.

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Good morning, Kazuki.

153
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The food is ready.

154
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Kazuki is the same as always.

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yu, I want you to help my daughters.

156
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If I stay here, I can't even get close to them.

157
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
If that's the case...

158
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
All right!

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I have to go first.

160
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Kazuki!

161
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You're more shiny than anyone else today.

162
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Kenta and Ruruko, do your best at the park.

163
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah, I'll be counting on you.

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
He's so popular.

165
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He's the best entertainer.

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
All right!

167
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Kazuki!

168
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Who is it?

169
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Who is he?

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Look, he's a big actor.

171
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
He's not talented.

172
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What do you think he's doing?

173
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Don't let a fool like you get close.

174
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
My light will be on.

175
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Kazuki!

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's terrible!

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I want you to look at me.

178
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I can't sleep at night.

179
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'll make you like me.

180
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You're going to make a mistake in front of the school.

181
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Remember it when you get home.

182
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
When I get home?

183
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Kazuki!

184
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What's your relationship with that high school student?

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Wait!

186
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Answer me!

187
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Wait, high school student!

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'll ask Nico about it.

189
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'll ask him how to get along with Kazuki.

190
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Chief, please check the training menu.

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Chief Mikado, please help me with today's club activity.

192
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The karate club is really relying on you, Nico.

193
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
All right!

194
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Nico!

195
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
A transfer student?

196
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'll take care of everything that's going to be in your head.

197
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Damn it!

198
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm so pissed off!

199
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You bastard!

200
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
How could you call the chief Nico?

201
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm used to it, you stupid!

202
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Watch out!

203
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If I get close, I'll get killed!

204
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Then I'll have to rely on...

205
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Miwa, the high school student!

206
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Did you do the five-line homework?

207
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's not working at all.

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The new school is really too high.

209
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
3 to the power of 17.

210
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The first one is 3 to the power of 17.

211
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's easy.

212
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's about time to go to school.

213
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You're right.

214
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Chief Mikado, don't you want to solve everything?

215
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You're really something.

216
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You're different from us.

217
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You're right.

218
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Miwa!

219
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
If you're not going to eat lunch, why don't you join us?

220
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Let's go to school!

221
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Damn it.

222
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Are you sure you can't?

223
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's too far.

224
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Miwa!

225
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm being watched.

226
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Miwa!

227
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Please wait!

228
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Wait!

229
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Don't follow me!

230
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Let's eat lunch!

231
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Stop it!

232
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Why?

233
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Let's eat lunch together!

234
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't want to!

235
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I burnt my hand at a place where there was nothing.

236
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I give up!

237
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I give up!

238
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I won't give up!

239
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Wait!

240
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You're so annoying!

241
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Don't follow me!

242
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You're running with me.

243
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Miwa!

244
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You're not good at sports.

245
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm better than you.

246
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You're more quiet in class.

247
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't match the level.

248
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I can't keep up with the talk about girls' productivity.

249
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I can't keep up with it.

250
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I agree.

251
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm different from everyone.

252
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I understand.

253
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What do you understand?

254
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Miwa, I agree.

255
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Mental health, low academic ability, low muscle strength.

256
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Agree?

257
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And my mother's face.

258
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's a complete fraud.

259
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm not good at being unique.

261
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm not good at being different from everyone.

262
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm not good at understanding.

263
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm not good at being far from people.

264
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm not good at understanding.

265
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What am I talking about?

266
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
If you don't agree, I'll take you to school!

267
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm sorry!

268
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Miwa?

269
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Idiot.

270
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I see.

271
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's your strategy.

272
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yes.

273
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
If you have any tips...

274
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I remember.

275
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What?

276
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
When I was three years old,

277
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I secretly asked my mother to make my own special dish.

278
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Kaz was very happy at that time.

279
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Is it related?

280
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Kazuki was three years old?

281
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I remember when Miwa was a few years old.

282
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Anyway, thanks to Miwa, I found a hint.

283
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What Kazuki wants to eat is a special dish made by his mother.

284
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But what is that dish?

285
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's about Kazuki, so is it a special ingredient?

286
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Kazuki!

287
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Look!

288
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
This time, I'll turn to Kazuki!

289
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Kazuki!

290
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Kazuki!

291
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
They're too much.

292
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm just a little tired.

293
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
No problem.

294
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Ouch!

295
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You're so cool!

296
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Stop it! I can do it myself!

297
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Kazuki, I'm an old man.

298
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Please eat if you like.

299
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I have plenty of vegetables and nutrients.

300
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You and this guy!

301
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You're too noisy! Get out!

302
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Darn it.

303
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I can't even manage my health.

304
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm so tired.

305
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm tired of it.

306
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm tired of it.

307
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I can't even do it without you.

308
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Darn it.

309
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I used to be weak.

310
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's like the main character's performance this time.

311
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's like a stage rehearsal.

312
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's okay.

313
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
If you eat rice, get warm, and get well,

314
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
most of your body's problems will soon be solved.

315
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I didn't eat at all.

316
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Kazuki!

317
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Tonight, I'll give you plenty of vitamins and a high vitality carrot soup!

318
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That's enough!

319
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You're taking too much care of me.

320
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Give me enough vitamins.

321
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Don't push yourself too hard.

322
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Ouch.

323
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
If you don't have the stamina to support me,

324
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
can you leave me alone?

325
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'll get the supplements.

326
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
If I stay like this, I'll be late for the rehearsal.

327
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I know!

328
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'll be your opponent at home until I can go back to training.

329
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What?

330
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm the eldest daughter, Ayase Subaru's son.

331
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm sure I have a lot to learn.

332
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But you...

333
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I debuted when I was two years old.

334
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Senpai!

335
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Even though she's a married woman, she can perform well.

336
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah, yeah.

337
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
All right.

338
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You'll be the prince.

339
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'll be the princess of the marriage.

340
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm going.

341
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Please.

342
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Then...

343
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Prince, please wait.

344
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's nothing! It's nothing!

345
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
How did you debut when you were two years old?

346
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm sorry. My parents' name is Hikari.

347
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I've been taking the audition for that girl.

348
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Next time, I'll do it more...

349
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Next time, I'll do it more...

350
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's better to do it alone!

351
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Go!

352
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I've lived on my parents' power.

353
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You're a person who doesn't know what to do.

354
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That's why everyone's going to make fun of me.

355
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Kazuki, I've read the script.

356
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Thank you.

357
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's the same as yesterday! Get out!

358
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm sorry.

359
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I've read the script. I'll get my revenge.

360
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Take me with you.

361
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
The school arts world is better!

362
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm going!

363
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Get out!

364
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Give me another chance, Kazuki!

365
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Don't come any closer, you stupid!

366
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The amateur is completely underestimating the professional world.

367
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You're always perfect and lovely.

368
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Voice, appearance, acting skills...

369
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You're a genius who's blessed by everything.

370
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The lead is the flower of the stage.

371
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Your performance will make it work.

372
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Well, it's about Mikado, so I'm not worried.

373
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I can't do anything wrong.

374
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I can't fail.

375
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I can't let this look down on me.

376
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I have to fix it quickly.

377
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Wait.

378
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I was looking for a woman like you.

379
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You're not the right person to be here.

380
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Let's go.

381
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'll be waiting for you, Datoe Arashi.

382
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Is this the tone of your voice?

383
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
All right! I got it from yesterday!

384
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
This guy...

385
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
He's done his homework and school work, so he practices every night for me.

386
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
He does that every night!

387
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
There are people who can't do it.

388
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Wait, Prince.

389
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'll come with you.

390
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Well, I won't deny it.

391
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I did my best.

392
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Here's your bow, Princess.

393
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Thank you very much.

394
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That was...

395
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
That was... didn't work?

396
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I was just noticing, but my emotions were a little troubled.

397
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I've been doing this for 14 years!

398
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I did it too!

399
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I did it!

400
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I did it!

401
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I did it!

402
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm so proud of you!

403
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I mean, this is my practice!

404
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I know, but I'm so happy!

405
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
He's so naive.

406
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
He's so moved by just one line.

407
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm so jealous.

408
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I want to go back to the stage as soon as possible.

409
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Tenkousen.

410
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Yes?

411
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm going to eat your food.

412
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Really?

413
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Leave it to me!

414
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'll make something delicious and nutritious!

415
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Wait.

416
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
But I have a condition.

417
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'll make a request.

418
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yes? What is it, Kazuki?

419
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That's...

420
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Yes?

421
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Ni?

422
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Kazuki?

423
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Kazuki?

424
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Don't put...

425
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
the carrots in.

426
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And...

427
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
pepper, shiitake, eggplant, and...

428
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
chikurage too.

429
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Did you just hide your dislike for them?

430
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Are you a child, Kazuki?

431
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Did you say something just now?

432
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Deep inside my heart

433
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
What is it that is born?

434
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Family is not a word

435
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's like a puzzle

436
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I can't tell you, but I'll say it.

437
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Stabbed in the back of my head

438
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm confused in the middle of the night

439
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's a line I can say on stage

440
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I wonder why

441
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Everyone is looking for the one who is destined

442
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm still alive today

443
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Let's start the happy prologue now

444
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm my gravity

445
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
The next line

446
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I find my own words

447
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Hey, even if I don't know

448
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I believe I'll find it someday

449
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Let's fly

450
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm my gravity

451
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
What I want to be

452
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Is it a princess?

453
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Is it a prince?

454
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You made me realize that I could be anything

455
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You too

456
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Thank you

457
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Let's deliver

458
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Thank you for watching
