1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I want to go on a date with you, transfer student.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You're free on Sunday, right? Then go on a date with me.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Ka-Kazuki-san...

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Why are you going out with me at night?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Could it be the effect of the kiss the other day?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
D-Date?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm going to decide where to go on a date and then we'll go out...

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Don't be so dramatic! It's that date!

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That date?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's that date!

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Will the transfer student agree?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
D-Don't ask!

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Come on, let's go back to our room, Miwa!

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Wait a minute! I'm not sure about this...

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Not sure about this?

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is the same as the other role...

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's right.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
For me, who is a male role, I can't understand the heroine's heart and actions.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But I was told that the private life has an effect on acting.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I see! So you want to get the heroine's heart through a date!

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Ka-Kazuki-san, you're already a male role, but you're trying a new role...

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's a genius that you can't keep going!

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I understand. If you're okay with me, I'll be your partner.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah. You two can keep quiet.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes!

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Just don't misunderstand!

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I understand.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But if you don't go on a date in earnest, you won't be able to understand the heroine's feelings.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll have to get a little nervous.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'll prepare the best date for you, Kazuki-san!

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The next day

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
T-Tenkousen!

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Niiko-san!

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Do you have something on Sunday?

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No, it's just your support as usual.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You lied!

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Lying means having a guilty conscience, right?

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's right! I'll be your partner!

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll be your partner!

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
After that...

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll prepare the best date!

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The best... The best...

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I can't imagine anything better than my knowledge!

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The next day

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's been a while since we've had dinner together. What's with this atmosphere?

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
T-Tenkousen...

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You know about tomorrow, don't you?

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's a date. I'm ready to go!

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Did they have an important meeting tomorrow?

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The next day

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
T-Tenkousen...

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Next time...

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Who is it?

67
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,680
I can't concentrate unless I see it.

68
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,680
Yeah, you have to see it and feel refreshed.

69
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,720
Even so, I thought I'd choose a suitable outfit and smile at you.

70
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
It looks surprisingly good on you.

71
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,200
W-Why are you staring at me?

72
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
You too!

73
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,800
I was just meeting Kazuki, and he's making a funny face.

74
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,000
I can't imagine Kazu dating a guy.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,800
Yeah, he's probably escorting her.

76
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
Tenkotsu.

77
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,000
Kazuki!

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,800
K-Kazuki!

79
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Sorry to keep you waiting.

80
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
No!

81
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
S-Sorry to keep you waiting.

82
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,200
It looks great on you, Kazuki!

83
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,200
This is what a real heroine looks like.

84
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,600
She's got a lot of disguise and looks like a queen.

85
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,200
Come on, Tenkotsu, let's go!

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
No...

87
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,400
I'll call you by your name today.

88
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
No...

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yes!

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't say it today, just call me by my name!

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Let's go to the aquarium first.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll make the special plan I prepared for Kazuki succeed!

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Kazuki's so obsessed with her,

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
he's thinking that the prince is being looked at cutely.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He's so serious.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's the stairs. Be careful of your steps.

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Kazuki, you're doing the opposite!

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Sorry! I'm always like this!

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Here, take this.

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You're smart.

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You're better than me.

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I wonder how it was just now.

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I wonder if I was able to react cutely.

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The cuteness I'm looking for is...

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Kazuki, enjoy yourself more normally.

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Please be careful of the previous customers.

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Are you okay, Yu?

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But it's the opposite, Kazuki.

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
She's so cool!

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
She's not cool!

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You're showing me.

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I was going for a perfect date.

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I failed because I couldn't carry my luggage.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I got the wrong order.

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm not used to wearing shoes.

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm not used to wearing shoes.

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm not used to wearing shoes.

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You're not doing well.

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I can't watch.

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Excuse me. I need to go to the bathroom.

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What I did was not good like him today.

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll prepare the best date.

123
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I was so focused on this day.

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Did I disappear?

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm so...

126
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You're so stylish.

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Can you listen to me for a moment?

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You're a youkai? Are you a scout?

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
This is bad.

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
If I find out that you're wearing a disguise and going on a date...

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm not interested in that kind of thing.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
No, you're not interested?

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You're the first one.

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Anyway, why aren't you in a critical moment?

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So please, let's talk a little...

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What do you want?

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yu...

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What? Brother?

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm on a date.

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Besides, she's already decided what she wants to be.

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Excuse me.

142
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What? What do you want to be?

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That's...

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
A great actor.

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You're not interested.

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You should ask my agency.

147
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm not an actor.

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm a person who works at an agency.

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Agency?

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The model is definitely more interested.

151
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You're too blunt.

152
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Don't talk, Yu.

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I refuse.

154
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
She...

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll be your wife.

156
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Katsuken is too childish.

157
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm not serious about that face.

158
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yu...

159
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm serious.

160
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I and Kazuki will have fun and have a hard time together.

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I got it.

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You two are happy.

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's a proposal.

164
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm sorry, Kazuki.

165
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Please forget everything.

166
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I can't.

167
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's time to go to the next place.

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
My hands are hot.

169
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Please go right away when you're tired.

170
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Idiot.

171
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's a good atmosphere.

172
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I think this date will be a success.

173
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I was too fast to hold hands.

174
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We're connected.

175
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We're close.

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We're close.

177
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
They're looking at us as brothers.

178
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm on a date with Kazuki's role.

179
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's meaningless if the couple doesn't look at us.

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Why?

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm sweating.

182
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If you hold hands during a date,

183
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
will the girl react like this?

184
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll learn a lot.

185
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Do something more romantic.

186
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yu!

187
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Kazuki, you're so motivated.

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I got it.

189
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I see.

190
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's why you were worried about the time.

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yes.

192
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
If you want to see it, make it a love story.

193
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Of course.

194
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is it for today.

195
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
This movie...

196
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm sorry to have to talk to the theater team today.

197
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's a waste.

198
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The second most popular male actor is a female actor.

199
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'll do my best over there.

200
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's my first time watching a movie.

201
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I was afraid to know what the result would be.

202
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I didn't dare to watch it.

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
An old movie theater actor is on the show.

204
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Did you know?

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Well...

206
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm sure it'll be a reference to the audition.

207
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The first movie theater actor is a female actor.

208
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
He's a male actor.

209
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's rare.

210
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What's wrong?

211
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Senpai, you're not good at playing a man.

212
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You're a big star who's good at acting.

213
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You have a strong eye.

214
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You have a big voice.

215
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
When I was in the theater team,

216
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I was a bad guy.

217
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I was more attractive than a real man.

218
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm a powerful person, but I can't call myself a heroine.

219
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You're not wrong.

220
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I knew it.

221
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Heroine is so subtle.

222
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
She wasn't cute at all, and she didn't fit in.

223
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I thought she was a role that could do anything.

224
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You're a genius, Kazuki.

225
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
If you're a genius, you can play any role.

226
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
A genius can't afford to fail.

227
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I messed up!

228
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I know I didn't play a good role,

229
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
but it's hard to challenge Kazuki's role as a woman.

230
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I knew this would happen, but I'm an idiot!

231
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The mood is ruined because of the movie.

232
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Is he going to be able to get out of here?

233
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm going to go check on Kazuki.

234
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This is the last one, Kazuki.

235
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Is this going to work?

236
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yes.

237
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I don't feel like it's going to work.

238
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The next one was a very boring date course.

239
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm going to show Kazuki a beautiful view and fix his mood.

240
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I wonder if a transfer student can do such a good job.

241
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Hey, do you know?

242
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
This is a famous book for confessing.

243
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
If you hide it on the top, it's very successful.

244
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Kazuki, this is the last data plan.

245
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I've never heard of such a jinx!

246
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,920
Kazuki's

247
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I said I'd prepare the best date for my role,

248
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
but I've done too much.

249
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Heroine audition?

250
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I was tall when I was little.

251
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I like short hair shorter than my neck.

252
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm more likely to be in my pants than in my skirt.

253
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I was a little different from the other girls around me,

254
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
but I've never thought I didn't like it.

255
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
This is Kazuki Mikado.

256
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's me.

257
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I started modeling at the age of 6.

258
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I was scouted by the current theater troupe when I was 6 years old.

259
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I debuted as a young actor.

260
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's where my talent for gayism was deformed,

261
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
but it was just the result of doing what I liked.

262
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But it was something I had to do.

263
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm sorry, Kazuki!

264
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
There's no way you can be on stage!

265
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Kazuki, try to play the role of a woman.

266
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It was something I had to do.

267
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I can't do it.

268
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I can't be forgiven.

269
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There's no value in a star that doesn't shine.

270
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Of course, I'm a heroine who keeps failing.

271
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's why I can't be a heroine.

272
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
If I fail, I'll quit the audition.

273
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Why are you trembling?

274
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
No, I'm not worried.

275
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Are you scared because it's so high?

276
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
No, I'm not afraid of heights.

277
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
But this floor is...

278
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You idiot.

279
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You didn't have to ride it.

280
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
No!

281
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm the last one!

282
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm the last one!

283
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm the last one!

284
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm the last one!

285
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
No!

286
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm the last one!

287
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Wait a minute!

288
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'll make you the best heroine!

289
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Master?

290
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I got you!

291
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Sit down.

292
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
This guy always fails.

293
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He keeps failing and getting disappointed from everyone.

294
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Damn it!

295
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's ridiculous!

296
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Even if a human fails, he's envious of it.

297
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes!

298
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
My life is a failure!

299
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Damn it!

300
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But Kazuki, there's value in something you can't do.

301
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Hey.

302
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Look.

303
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
When did you take a picture of my stupid moment?

304
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Are you being bullied?

305
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
This is me.

306
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Kazuki, you look like you're making up things,

307
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
but you look good when you're upset.

308
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I know some people get disappointed when they fail,

309
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
and some get separated from them.

310
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But people like the things that are bad for others.

311
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
He's just being ridiculous.

312
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I can't do it without thinking that way.

313
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But let's do our best for the audition.

314
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Of course.

315
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
He's coming out!

316
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What happened?

317
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Thank you for today, Yu.

318
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Did you understand the heroine's feelings?

319
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Yeah.

320
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I've been doing a lot of acting that people would be watching.

321
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm actually a character.

322
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You can act with your feelings first.

323
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Even if you're not dressed up.

324
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I realized that there might be people who would like that.

325
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Even if you're in trouble...

326
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Please remember our date.

327
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm not as depressed as I was before the audition!

328
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Kaz, you've gotten so close to the first grader.

329
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You've gotten so different from yesterday.

330
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You're still with him now?

331
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm so happy.

332
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I wonder what kind of face he'll make when he's with me at home.

333
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You have to do your best for the audition.

334
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Even if you fail, I'll be myself.

335
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yes! You're amazing, Kazuki!

336
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You're really stupid, Yu.

337
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You changed me just like that.

338
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You're a fool who's always been disappointed when you fail.

339
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yu.

340
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yes?

341
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
K-Kazuki...

342
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Um, we're close, but...

343
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Yu, the kiss before that...

344
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That was my first kiss.

345
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I can't do it without it.

346
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm sorry.

347
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Why did you say that?!

348
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Now then...

349
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's time for the prince to leave.

350
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'll practice at the training center.

351
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Sorry, but that's all for the date.

352
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'll leave the bath to you.

353
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm back to my usual Kazune.

354
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You're wrong.

355
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
He's changed.

356
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I knew it.

357
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Sorry, I'm late.

358
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'll get the food ready.

359
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What took you so long?

360
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What were you doing?

361
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That's...

362
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Welcome back, Yu.

363
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Welcome back, Yu.

364
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yu.

365
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
