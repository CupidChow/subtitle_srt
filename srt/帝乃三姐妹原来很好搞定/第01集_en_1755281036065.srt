1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This is a family story that seems to be connected and separated, and seems to be connected like a split.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Psycho Academy. A school where talented students polish themselves.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
They provide the highest level of education in each field, including entertainment, physical education, and psychology.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now, speaking of me, who joined such a super prestigious school...

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Who is this?!

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You're weak! You're too weak, Ayase Yu!

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Are you still Ayase Subaru's son?!

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So that's the son of a genius actress.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The test for the new student is not going well.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
How will she get back on her feet?

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
A genius hides her skills.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's a common thing.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yes. My mother is Ayase Subaru.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
A famous actress abroad.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Her beauty and acting were more important than anything else.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
She did dangerous actions herself.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:31,480
She graduated from a prestigious university abroad with a master's degree in

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not her mother!

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Don't cry!

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Could it be that guy?

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Are you underestimating me?!

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You're a jerk!

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
A jerk?

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That Ayase Subaru's son?

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What a surprise!

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
A genius son is a genius.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He's expected on his own, and he's disappointed on his own.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This series of events is my course of choice.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm 17 this year.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm used to it.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Geez...

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Do you know this phrase?

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You're as talented as Bonjin.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You're as talented as Bonjin.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The power of the great actress's eyes...

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Her face is strong!

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't say it!

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't say it in that outfit!

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But you're the best in here!

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Of course.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's why I can say it.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I've seen talent up close before.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Then I'll go.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Asari?!

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I-I'm used to losing.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This is bad, Vice-Chairman.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I was expecting that guy to be a jerk in the gym.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This is bad!

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If this continues, I'll have to do something...

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll beat you to death!

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Don't be so arrogant, amateur.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's a shame for the martial arts.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What?!

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
As expected of the great actress's son.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He's worth the attention.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Did you get the test results?

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hey, that person is...

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
A talent show star, Kanzuki!

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The performance will be sold out in a second!

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
A movie star with high ratings from overseas!

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's Miwa from the new school!

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The new school's Miwa!

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
A top student of the new school!

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
A title holder for the junior year!

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
A new student of the Shogi Club!

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
A meat-sauce student!

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
A monster who's been winning all kinds of martial arts competitions since childhood!

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He's a great student!

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
A third-grader!

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
A third-grader has gathered!

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
A third-grader?

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Could it be the top student of each school?

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
These three are the kings of the school?

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Hey, transfer students.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
All of them are girls?

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So, what are the test results?

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
T-That's Kanzuki.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
A talent show star with zero talent.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Um...

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I thought I'd train you with a gym.

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You're so boring.

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm sorry, but you don't have a place to go.

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You're useless if you can't do anything.

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't worry.

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I've decided to go to the second grade from the beginning.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Second grade...

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Second grade...

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You said?

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Did you say second grade?

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I forgot!

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You don't have to do anything else, do you?

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Goodbye.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Wait!

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What?

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
There's still cleaning left in the dojo.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You're the ones who tested me here, aren't you?

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Why do I have to do it?

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Hurry up and do it.

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The last step is the role of the loser.

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Even if you're a loser, clean up.

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't be like a loser.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm going home.

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah.

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It was a waste of time.

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sorry to hear that Ayase Seibaru's son is a loser.

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm a little disappointed.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay, let's train.

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay!

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What?

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's so clean.

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Wow!

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The tatami mat looks like a new one.

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm disappointed.

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well, I've always thought so.

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
When I was little, I wanted my mother's child to be recognized.

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Everyone, what are you doing?

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll do something about it.

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Leave it to me.

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay, let's go.

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's go.

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah.

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You're the one I've been looking for all this time.

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'll give you everything.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Until the end.

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I realized.

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
My mother and I are different.

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The more I knew the reality, the more I kept my distance from my mother.

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
My mother and I are just two families.

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I didn't notice anything.

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
At that time, my mother often watched my play.

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It was a home drama where my mother played the role of a mother.

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:54,000
My mother was a little bit of a

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We eat together every time we meet.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We laugh happily while talking about something that's not true.

140
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Isn't that nice, Saka?

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah.

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I felt like I was with my mother for the first time in a few years.

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
At this time, I finally realized.

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
My mother has always been longing for a family like this drama.

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The End

146
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What a happy family.

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't know what kind of thing it is.

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Let's do our best.

149
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let's do our best to make up for the time that my mother and I didn't make it in time.

150
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Mikado's...

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Here it is.

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Wow, it's a big house.

153
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Excuse me.

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Mikado said you could come in, right?

155
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Wow, it's a big house.

156
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Wow, it's a big house.

157
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Who is Mikado?

158
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Let's get the gift of greetings.

159
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You're a thief!

160
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Hey.

161
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Who is it?

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The person from the house?

163
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Is he thought to be a thief?

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm not a suspicious person.

166
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What are you doing here?

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You, transfer student!

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Niko-san?

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Niko-san?

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Good evening.

172
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What are you doing? I'm asking you!

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Well...

174
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Stay there for now!

175
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Are you okay?

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That's how a genius is so smart.

177
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You!

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Don't panic.

179
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm just wearing it.

180
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Don't be silly!

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Why are you...

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Niko-san.

183
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You're in the field of martial arts.

184
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Damn it.

185
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Blow it up.

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It hurts.

187
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Let go!

189
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
My obi is tight.

190
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I want to take it off.

191
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's a job to wear a kimono.

192
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's so tight.

193
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Get used to it.

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You...

195
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You look familiar.

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You're a transfer student.

197
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Why are you here?

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He came in without permission!

199
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
No, that's why!

200
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Or rather...

201
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Three people?

202
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Why are there three people in this house?

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yes?

204
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Oh, Mikado-san.

205
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Have you arrived home yet, Yu-kun?

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yes.

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm counting on you from now on.

208
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You're no longer my family.

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll take responsibility for her talent.

210
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You didn't notice...

211
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
By the way, did you meet your daughters?

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Daughters?

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Did I not tell you?

214
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I have a daughter.

215
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
A daughter?

216
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
She's the third sister of the three daughters,

217
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Kazuki, Niko, and Miwa.

218
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So, Yu-kun,

219
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm counting on you from now on.

220
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Third sister?

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's my mother's last wish as a talented actress.

222
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I want my son to have a happy family.

223
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
This is the story of Ayase Yu and Mikado-san's third sister

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
until they become a family.

225
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Huh?

226
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What?

227
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
After my mother died,

228
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I was left alone with a beautiful sister and a roof.

229
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What a dreamy life!

230
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I wish...

231
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I really want it to be a dream.

232
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Tsk.

233
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm not going to kick you out because it's something my father decided.

234
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm sorry for taking care of a fool like you.

235
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm sorry for taking care of a fool like you.

236
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm not being welcomed at all.

237
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
No, I'm not going to take a nap.

238
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm going to sleep.

239
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm not being welcomed at all.

240
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
No, don't take a nap.

241
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Because my partner is that third sister.

242
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm going to make a happy family here.

243
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Nice to meet you again.

244
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm Ayase Yu.

245
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm going to take care of Mikado's family from today.

246
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Thank you.

247
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
First, I'll pack my luggage.

248
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I feel like I'm going to...

249
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Um...

250
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Wait a minute.

251
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
This house...

252
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's really messy.

253
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Shut up!

254
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Wait, what about that?

255
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's Kazuki's turn to clean the dishes.

256
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There's no choice. We didn't have time.

257
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Kazuki seems to be busy with the training of the Kageki-dan.

258
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That's right.

259
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't have time to do chores.

260
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Then I'll clean up this broken dish.

261
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm so excited.

262
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What? Were you doing it?

263
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I ran away because I was sick on the way.

264
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Who's the laundry lady?

265
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's Miwa.

266
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I can't remember how to wash because Kazune wears colorful clothes.

267
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's easier than learning the rules of Shogi.

268
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Then you'll do the laundry.

269
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'll do it.

270
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's okay.

271
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But it's a waste of time to do it.

272
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So you're the laundry lady.

273
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm glad I found my weakness.

274
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Your academic score is 45 points.

275
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
42 points.

276
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
My subordinate was also given a score of 5 points.

277
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The new student's test was below average for all classes.

278
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I heard that the new student's test was also above average.

279
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Are you listening?

280
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You're a fool.

281
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The room is...

282
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's so clean.

283
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
While everyone was talking, it was over.

284
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
By the way, this guy is cleaning the dojo.

285
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll do it anytime.

286
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
He's so mean.

287
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Just his face is fine.

288
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Don't be fooled.

289
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The inside is a mess.

290
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Gross.

291
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Today is a holiday, so I'll take it easy.

292
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Let's eat breakfast together and get to know each other.

293
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Because I'm going to tell my family and those three sisters...

294
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What's going on?

295
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Come on!

296
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
At 7 a.m., the secretary was at the dojo at home.

297
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm going to use the data to collect the data.

298
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Do you want to delete it?

299
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
The three sisters were talking to the AI.

300
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The girl is opening the drug store.

301
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Kazuki, what are you doing?

302
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What?

303
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
No...

304
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What? It's a morning routine.

305
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You wash your face and brush your teeth, right?

306
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's similar to that.

307
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Me and the seniors.

308
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's not similar, is it?

309
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Anyway, we're going out now.

310
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You should stay in your room.

311
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's a holiday today.

312
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm a trainee of the Kagekidan.

313
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The two of us are in a club.

314
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Miwa is on a leave.

315
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Let's all have breakfast together.

316
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Go away.

317
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'll send you to the training center.

318
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm sorry.

319
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But Miwa is eating snacks together.

320
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
She's drinking a lot of juice.

321
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Miwa, if you eat so much before dinner...

322
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Miwa's Mom

323
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
My mom was like this all the time.

324
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Even when I made her breakfast, she didn't touch it.

325
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
When I think about it, she's always prepared for what she eats.

326
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I don't know what genius is thinking.

327
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It was impossible to be with my real family.

328
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And I wonder if I can do it with those three.

329
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Where did you get that rice?

330
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I made it with ingredients that could be bad.

331
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm thinking about it, but do you want to eat it?

332
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Is that okay?

333
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I don't want to!

334
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
If you don't be honest, I'll be lonely.

335
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Look.

336
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I said I don't want to!

337
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That's not a good food for balance.

338
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Balance?

339
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Too much sugar and fat.

340
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Vitamin B1 is low.

341
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I need to put in 20 grams of meat or fish protein.

342
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's a hassle.

343
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You calculate and eat every meal?

344
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Of course.

345
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's as important as training to make a body with food.

346
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You can't get the best result unless you get your body ready.

347
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm going to be late!

348
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You're going to be late!

349
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's a hassle.

350
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I can't believe I'm putting the result first and being patient with what I really want to eat.

351
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I see.

352
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
My mom was adjusting it for the medicine.

353
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Kazuki is the top star of the family.

354
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Miwa wants sweets to make her head spin.

355
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
She'll be so selfish that she can't see the surroundings.

356
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
The geniuses are desperate.

357
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But since when did I stop talking to my mom, who I don't understand?

358
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Kaz, you're late for your shoes.

359
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Give it to me.

360
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm going to be late.

361
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Stop it.

362
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Wait!

363
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What?

364
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I forgot something.

365
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
We didn't forget anything.

367
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
We have everything we need.

368
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Don't say that.

369
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
See you later.

370
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Get out of my way!

371
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You're so annoying.

372
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's a nuisance.

373
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Don't surprise me, idiot.

374
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It didn't reach me at all.

375
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Well, whatever.

376
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Let's start with the family I can do.

377
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Is she trying to say that?

378
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
What's with this stupid crane?

379
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm sorry.

380
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
She said, see you later.

381
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It was just a greeting.

382
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
But...

383
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It wasn't bad.

384
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yes?

385
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Good morning, Yu.

386
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Good morning, Mikado.

387
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
How was your first morning?

388
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm finally used to it.

389
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That's good.

390
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm actually busy with work.

391
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm sorry, but I can't go home.

392
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That means you're going to be with your sisters for a while?

393
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
That's right.

394
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But I have a favor to ask you.

395
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
A favor?

396
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Yes.

397
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
My sisters will soon be hit by a wall.

398
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's a genius's fate.

399
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
That's right, Yu.

400
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I want you to help my sisters.

401
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
If you can overcome that wall, my sisters will open their hearts to you.

402
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm going to help those three genius sisters?

403
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm the only one left?

404
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I can't stop the warmth in my heart.

405
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Like the rain in a tight bag.

406
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
In my sweet and delicate heart, I can't show it to anyone.

407
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
A blue future, a love like spring.

408
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
A bitter coffee-like day.

409
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I dropped one of my shoulders and lost my way.

410
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I want to make you think of me.

411
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I want to measure the happiness of ordinary people.

412
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
A love like a drama.

413
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
A miracle, a miracle that suits you.

414
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The dream of the meal you made.

415
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
The dream of the home you made.

416
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
The magic you made.

417
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I want to carry it with me.
