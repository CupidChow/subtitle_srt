00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Wow, you're running away!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm hungry!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Please don't go too far.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's a cold!

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I was completely fooled!

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
As expected of the top star of the theater troupe!

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I didn't expect to be exposed to a disease...

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Today's performance was the best!

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I didn't expect to be at the festival!

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What a beautiful appearance!

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Thank you.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I want to enjoy the festival without looking at the three sisters today,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
but I'm completely in work mode.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But I never let go of the posture of the star Mikado Kazuki.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
As expected of professionals.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I can't help but talk to them.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's so delicious!

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Mikado, I'll give you a bite later.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Kazuki-sama, can I take a picture?

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Kazuki is good at this.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I like being teased.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I want to be a goldfish.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let's have a match!

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Thank you very much.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Me too.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Excuse me.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Excuse me.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Can I join you?

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hey, wait a minute.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Of course.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What?

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
She's cool, but she's a girl.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm going first.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Don't be hurt.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let's play until we get sucked into something.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes!

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Kazuki-sama!

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's so nice.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's like a princess hug.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's like a real princess.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
There's no way to get in.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
At least I have to make sure I don't lose sight of it.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The warmth in my heart won't stop.

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Like the rain in a tight-fitting bag.

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
In my sweet and delicate heart,

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I can't show it to anyone.

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
In the blue future,

78
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Love like spring

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
is like a bitter time.

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I drop one of my heart

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and I'm lost.

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I want to make you think of me.

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I want to follow you.

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The happiness of ordinary.

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Love like a drama is a miracle.

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
A miracle that suits you.

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The dream of the meal you made.

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The dream of the wind you made.

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The magic you made.

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll carry it in my heart.

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thank you very much.

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Be careful.

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes!

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Why are you being held?

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Kazuki-sama is here!

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Kazuki-sama!

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Huh?

98
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Where's Kazuki-sama?

99
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Where are you?

100
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Kazuki-sama!

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
She's gone, right?

102
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah.

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Where could she be?

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Kazuki-sama!

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The transfer student!

106
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes.

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I've found a good place to stay.

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Please enjoy yourself, Kazuki-san.

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't need it.

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You're just a food for people again.

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And this too.

112
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The way you walk was more awkward than usual,

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
but you're wearing shoes, right?

114
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're observing me one by one,

115
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
you disgusting guy.

116
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If you don't get enough, I'll do it.

117
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Hey!

118
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Hey!

119
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That looks painful!

120
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You're using these feet to suck people up?

121
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I injured my foot.

122
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Does anyone have a bandage?

123
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You could say that.

124
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You're a fool.

125
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm the prince of all people.

126
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's nonsense for a prince who's on the side of the rescue to ask for help.

127
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Doesn't that make it better?

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I think it's okay for a prince to be a princess.

129
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I think it's okay for him to be the one he wants to be.

130
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes, please step out.

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The End

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're so bad, Nico!

133
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm not drinking alcohol!

134
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Nico-san, Miwa-san!

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Please let us join you.

136
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What are you doing with that stupid mask, Kazuki?

137
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's a preventive measure to prevent people from seeing you.

138
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's play a team match.

139
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Kazuki-san vs. Nico-san and Miwa-san.

140
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Do whatever you want.

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Kaz, you should always wear that Nico-Nico mask.

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You look scary when you're with us.

143
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You're wrong.

144
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Now, it's time to play.

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I got it!

146
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You're so bad.

147
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You're a fool.

148
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I got it again!

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You're so bad, Miwa!

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You haven't lost at all since earlier.

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You're so bad.

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You're so bad.

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You're both so bad.

154
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
These three...

155
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
They're always like this when it comes to a match.

156
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Your Highness, I'm not that serious.

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Please enjoy the game without me.

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay, while these three are playing...

159
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We're here!

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The annual Yozakura Festival is here!

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We're going to have a festival at Hatsunoha!

162
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If you can get to the goal after the horse you saw at Hatsunoha,

163
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
you'll get the best prize!

164
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And the secret of the shrine!

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
A rights-based machine that can take pictures with a golden dog!

166
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
If you set it up on your smartphone wallpaper, you'll definitely get lucky!

167
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This is it!

168
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The three of them took pictures at this shrine.

169
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The one holding it is a dog from the shop!

170
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay, I'll get to the goal after I get to Hatsunoha,

171
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and get a photo-taking license!

172
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'll have the three sisters take the same picture as when they were kids!

173
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That way, they'll remember the good times when they were friends!

174
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What the heck?

175
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There's a sinkhole too?

176
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
They're going to find a sinkhole and get to the goal?

177
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No, that's impossible!

178
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
They're struggling again this year.

179
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
No one has succeeded in the past ten years.

180
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I remember now.

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Ten years ago, they found the right horse,

182
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and the three sisters arrived at the shrine with beautiful faces.

183
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Now, the next challenger, please!

184
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Here!

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay, you failed.

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You can try again and again!

187
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Do you want to try again?

188
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No, I want to see the festival again.

189
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll try around here too.

190
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Then, who else wants to try?

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
One more time!

192
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Please!

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That won't be easy.

194
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Oh, your beautiful face is all dirty.

195
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You should have stopped.

196
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
If it's that dirty,

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you'll slip and fall even if you choose the right route.

198
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Now, the next challenger...

199
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Please!

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The rain has stopped. Let's stop.

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Not yet!

202
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm not the type to work hard.

203
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'll let you take a picture of me!

204
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm sure the three sisters were children.

205
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm sure Miwa-san, who's smart,

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
will lead the right route.

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm sure she'll be able to do it.

208
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm sure she'll be able to do it.

209
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm sure she'll be able to do it.

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm sure she'll be able to do it.

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Miwa-san will lead the right route.

212
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Niko-san, who has a lot of stamina, will lead the way to the goal.

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Kazuki-san, who was watching them, will cross the yuyu

214
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
and beautifully reach the goal.

215
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'll catch the goal that the three of them have gained by working together.

216
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The Three Sisters

217
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Goal!

218
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Congratulations.

219
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Thank you very much.

220
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Then, let's take a picture.

221
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Please wait.

222
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll call the other three.

223
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The Yosakura Festival will soon be over for the weather.

224
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Please be careful and return safely.

225
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
If I touch it again, it's all about me.

226
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The Yosakura Festival

227
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's no good.

228
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What festival?

229
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We're going to have a party tomorrow.

230
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm going to go too.

231
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm staying in my room.

232
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I brought her here and made her feel at ease.

233
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
She's really angry and went home.

234
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Now, we're all going to be separated again.

235
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I wanted to make the Three Sisters get along,

236
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
but I got in the way of others' anger.

237
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's a good place to be.

238
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You were in a place like this.

239
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You said you were going to get a little out of it, but you're covered in mud.

240
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Are you sick?

241
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Why did you leave me and go home?

242
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
How innocent of us are you?

243
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You're a festival conductor, aren't you?

244
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Take responsibility and take me to the hotel.

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm sorry, but your umbrella was sold out.

246
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So...

247
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'll go in.

248
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I couldn't hear you because you were talking at the same time.

250
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's nothing.

251
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Don't be so careless at a time like this.

252
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's the one that's been spilled.

253
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You're so annoying.

254
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You're noisy.

255
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You're more noisy than Kazune.

256
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Sometimes it's not bad to have a big hot spring.

257
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Kazune and Nico are here, so it feels weird.

258
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
If you want to do that, you can give it to Nico.

259
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What? That's not true.

260
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't mind.

261
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Then let's play rock-paper-scissors.

262
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The loser will put in the transfer student.

263
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
All right.

264
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm on it.

265
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Is this a punishment game?

266
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Let's go.

267
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The first one is you.

268
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm sorry, Nico.

269
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Shut up.

270
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's weird.

271
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm just walking.

272
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It looks like my heart has run.

273
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm not used to it.

274
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Maybe it's because I'm wearing a kimono.

275
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But it's weird right now.

276
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What is he doing in the public place?

277
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You're so cute.

278
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Well, you're finally a woman.

279
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well, if it's not as beautiful as me.

280
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's not as big as me.

281
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's a normal boobs.

282
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Transfer student.

283
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Everyone, please do your best tomorrow.

284
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm going to tell you that.

285
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
By the way, you're still in the bath.

286
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm not a guest.

287
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I forgot to take my own room.

288
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The hotel around the festival is full.

289
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'll go to sleep.

290
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I knew it was a mess.

291
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's the ultimate mess.

292
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Bye.

294
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Wait.

295
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm really sorry.

296
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Not again.

297
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What am I doing?

298
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It was a plan for the three sisters to spend time together.

299
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It can't be helped.

300
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's a shame to leave that.

301
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's right.

302
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The store is kind to the people.

303
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's raining outside.

304
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That wet cat will catch a cold soon.

305
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That's right.

306
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
We're usually friends.

307
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's weird not to talk to you here.

308
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That's right.

309
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
We're friends.

310
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm really sorry.

311
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Please think of me as the dust on the floor.

312
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Oh, right.

313
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I forgot my roomwear before I took a shower.

314
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Four people in a room is too small.

316
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
We forgot our roomwear.

317
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
That's right.

318
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I didn't bring my clothes.

319
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You're so stupid.

320
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Japanese hotels are well-known.

321
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
For example, in this kind of shelf...

322
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Is there?

323
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It looks delicious.

324
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's not good.

325
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I should have contacted the front desk.

326
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
There is.

327
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Where?

328
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I can't see Nico's messenger.

329
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'll take it.

330
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

331
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'll take a shower.

332
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'll take a shower.

333
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Oh, okay.

334
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Four people are small, as the front desk says.

335
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's right.

336
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's too different from the house.

337
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The share of one person per room is the share of one person per room.

338
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Everyone.

339
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

340
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Please take a rest without worrying about me.

341
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I don't feel like resting.

342
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Neren

343
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's strange.

344
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
My eyes are strangely closed.

345
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It should be lying down, but the pulse is 1.2 times that of Anseiji.

346
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
My face is hot.

347
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It doesn't seem to have a fever.

348
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
This is...

349
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
A nervous feeling for the last song.

350
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
A sense of excitement for the game.

351
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
A feeling of excitement for the stage.

352
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
A sense of excitement for the stage.

353
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The process has started!

354
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
There were a lot of things today, but...

355
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
My expression is hard.

356
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Smile more like a child.

357
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What should I do?

358
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
He won't go home until I take it.

359
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's right.

360
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Relax.

361
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What?

362
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Don't make a fuss by yourself.

363
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I was able to take pictures like before.

364
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's like when we were good friends.

365
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
No way.

366
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Why?

367
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't have any old pictures!

368
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
We've been together all this time.

369
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
All three of them said they didn't know whose picture it was.

370
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Well, I'm glad I got back to my owner safely.

371
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
He just fell asleep.

372
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's been two minutes.

373
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Were you both awake?

374
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I can sleep whenever I want.

375
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You can't talk about people.

376
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm going to sleep now.

377
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's been a while since I've been to a festival like this.

378
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm so excited that I can't sleep.

379
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That's true.

380
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The transfer student is a weirdo.

381
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
He chose a flower-shaped kimono for Niko.

382
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Well, I'm glad.

383
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I don't know what to do now.

384
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You liked things like that when you were a kid, right?

385
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Kazuki was a star, too.

386
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
He was always with his fans.

387
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
But he was playing with them today.

388
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
He was a kid and he was a goldfish.

389
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
We've grown up.

390
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You haven't changed at all.

391
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I was excited about choosing a kimono.

392
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That's fine.

393
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I couldn't wear it when I was a kid.

394
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Well, I guess.

395
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But...

396
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I said something and the competition was over.

397
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I was a good throw and a good shot.

398
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That's right.

399
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I was a good shot at that time, too.

400
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I think that was the peak of my physical ability.

401
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's a shooting story.

402
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Kazuki hit me in the back and hit me.

403
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What?

404
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Was that so?

405
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You'll cry if you lose.

406
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What's wrong with this random memory talk?

407
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's not like that.

408
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's certainly random.

409
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
But I wasn't in a hurry.

410
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I live in the same house every day.

411
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I knew this was the aim of the party.

412
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It doesn't matter if we get along or not.

413
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
He's a weird guy.

414
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
That's true.

415
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He's a red man.

416
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Let's go to the festival.

417
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'd like to ask you to wear a kimono that suits these three.

418
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Smile more.

419
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
For this photo...

420
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You're a stupid guy.

421
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Thank you.

422
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
The three sisters of Mikado are back.

423
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Kazuki's performance was a huge success.

424
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Miko and Miwa also achieved great results at the festival.

425
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
They're geniuses.

426
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
They played so much.

427
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The festival is over.

428
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

429
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

430
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

431
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

432
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

433
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

434
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

435
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

436
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

437
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

438
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

439
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

440
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

441
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

442
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

443
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

444
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

445
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

446
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

447
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

448
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

449
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

450
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

451
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

452
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

453
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

454
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm going to go to the festival.

455
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Let's put our hands on the river or so

456
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Gosh, where did that transfer student go?

457
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I don't know his contact details either.

458
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,640
Oh, right. I'll call on Kazune's social media to search for a transfer student.

459
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,180
I see.

460
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,980
It seems like there are a lot of followers who come to this festival.

461
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,820
Then I'll post the characteristics of a transfer student.

462
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,840
Well, a high school boy,

463
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,220
with a small body and deep eyes, and a deep red...

464
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,820
You're being a bit rough.

465
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,700
There are a lot of small high school students.

466
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,860
Even though you live together, you only know that much?

467
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,020
Don't make fun of me!

468
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,700
That smile with a deep heart is a characteristic of a transfer student.

469
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,340
Well, I don't think you've ever seen it in person.

470
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,900
I know the characteristics of a transfer student, too.

471
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,980
They make me snacks and late-night meals.

472
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,740
They're kind.

473
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,240
You two don't know that they're always on a diet, right?

474
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,180
If you say that,

475
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,180
I bought some stock while I was cutting protein and taping.

476
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,340
It's good for you and it's thinking about me.

477
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,580
Let's find it ourselves.

478
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,120
Yeah, I think I can post it.

479
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,160
I can't ask for a transfer student to search for a transfer student!
