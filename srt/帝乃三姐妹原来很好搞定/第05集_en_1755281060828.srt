1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Since the Yosakura festival we spent together, the three sisters have gotten along somehow.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Nico, the collar is bent.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Oh, yeah.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Everyone, I forgot the print.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Thank you, Nico-chan.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's how it's supposed to look.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Oh, by the way, I'll make you a meal when I get home.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Did I make that promise?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I guess I have no choice.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm gonna get my hair done today!

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Huh? That's rare.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
All three of them are already home.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Who's there?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Um...

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You, huh?

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That voice! It's Mikado!

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Nice to meet you! I'm Ayase Yu!

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm really grateful for your help!

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh, Mom.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry about Subaru-kun.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh, no.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But don't worry.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Huh?

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
His talent will never die.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
As long as you keep it up.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Ah...

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What's going on?

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Now, let's continue the conversation.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
How did it go, Kazuki?

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The stage was full of people.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The popularity is rising.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We have a press conference tomorrow.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Nico.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I won as usual.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
There's another competition coming up, so I can't relax.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Mia.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I got through the preliminary round again.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'll go as far as I can.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I see.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
As if you're going to encourage me.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Mikado-san? Um...

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I've finished reporting the results.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll be going now.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm going to make dinner now.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Would you like to come with me?

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Sorry.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, that.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We went to a festival together the other day.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Festival?

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Who suggested it?

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Me.

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The three of us went to the same place miraculously.

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And we went to a festival that the three of us used to go to.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yukon.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Huh?

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Why are you getting in the way of the girls who are aiming to be the top?

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That shrine has a special purpose.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We're going to sell it to the three of them.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Are you asking God for your own business?

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll do my best so that I don't need to.

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's the best.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But...

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's why I've raised my daughters with strong and hard work.

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Even if they're talented, it's meaningless if they're weak.

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yukon.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I've looked into you a little bit.

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You haven't left any results so far.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Even though you're the son of that genius actress, Ayase Subaru.

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Then you're like...

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're just a nobody.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yukon.

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't need a girl who can't do it.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What's with your eyes?

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I can't let you bring in a lazy mind like yours to my house.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Wait!

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I haven't left any results that the world will judge.

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But I'm doing my best.

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're a clumsy and a failure.

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You're thinking about cleaning, washing, cooking, and the three of us.

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's why we're dedicated to improving our talents.

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You guys are covering for others.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Do you really need Yu?

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I mean, I need him.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It'll be useful if you can help me a little.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's better to be here than not being here.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry, Subaru.

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But I don't think you and Yu are getting along.

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's not true.

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We're getting along.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
We're in the same...

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No, I mean...

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No, I mean...

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yu...

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yu...

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yu...

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I can't stop it.

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's impossible.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Every day, we spend together.

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Please be careful today.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
My heart can't stop the warmth.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Like the rain in my tight pocket.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
In my sweet and fragile heart,

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I can't show it to anyone.

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
A blue future, a love like spring.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
A bitter time, a day like that.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:49,880
I drop one of my

107
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,880
The miracle of love, the miracle of love.

108
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,880
The miracle of love, the miracle of love.

109
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,880
The dream of the meal you made.

110
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,880
The dream of the meal you made.

111
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
The dream of the meal you made.

112
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,880
I'll take good care of it.

113
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,880
I'm getting along with Yu, Dad.

114
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,880
I see.

115
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,880
But you don't need to get along with the Mikado family.

116
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,880
You're not a kid anymore.

117
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,880
Don't go to festivals again.

118
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
Yes.

119
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,880
I want to see more results.

120
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
Excuse me!

121
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,880
Everyone, I'm going to eat today.

122
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,880
Please look forward to it.

123
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,880
Sorry, Tenkousei.

124
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,880
I don't have time to eat with Yu.

125
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,880
A week has passed since then.

126
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,880
When I came to the Mikado family, I returned.

127
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,880
I finally met Mikado and learned something.

128
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,880
My three sisters polished their talents so much.

129
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,880
I learned the strength of not letting others get close to me.

130
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,880
It's the influence of my parents.

131
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,880
Mikado looks like a great person.

132
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,880
I feel like my three sisters' faces were cloudy.

133
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,880
I was finally getting along with them.

134
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,880
You're so brave.

135
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,880
The chief is still here.

136
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,880
Chief, excuse me.

137
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,880
You've been home recently.

138
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,880
Yeah.

139
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,880
I'll have some food.

140
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,880
It doesn't taste good.

141
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,880
I should have been satisfied with this every day.

142
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,880
Great Amikado.

143
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,880
Let's take a 10-minute break.

144
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:15,880
I don't feel like drinking the smoothie that perfectly combines the nutrients I need today.

145
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,880
The sweets aren't that good.

146
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,880
I don't have time to think about unnecessary things.

148
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,880
I should have just returned to my previous life.

149
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Don't go out.

150
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Why are you getting in the way of my daughters?

151
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,880
I just want to get along and eat together.

152
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,880
We laugh while talking about things that don't exist.

153
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,880
It's a good idea to have a family like a drama.

154
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,880
I like this home drama the most.

155
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,880
Isn't that nice, Saka?

156
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,880
No, I want to have a family that I can be with.

157
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,880
See you later!

158
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,880
She's gone.

159
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,880
Chief, are you having salad chicken again?

160
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,880
You're not hungry.

161
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,880
And you're eating it yourself.

162
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,880
It's more nutritious than the taste.

163
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
I'll have a protein bar after this.

164
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,880
What's this?

165
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,880
It's obitual! And it's homemade!

166
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,880
It looks delicious!

167
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,880
The first day of the school year.

168
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,880
The first day of the school year.

169
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,880
Chief.

170
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,880
Do you have any food you don't like?

171
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,880
I'll eat it for you.

172
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,880
No, I'll eat it.

173
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,880
What? That's too bad.

174
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,880
That idiot.

175
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,880
If he does this to me, I'll be so full that I can't even eat.

176
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,880
He ate it so cleanly.

177
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,880
Tenkousen, come here.

178
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,880
Yes, sir!

179
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,880
Let's form a treaty, Tenkousen.

180
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,880
A treaty?

181
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,880
Your father told you, didn't he?

182
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,880
If you don't come up with a result, you'll be kicked out of the house.

183
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,880
Yes, sir.

184
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,880
That's where it's at.

185
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,880
As our supporter, we'll accept you as a whole.

186
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
I have an audition for a male role.

187
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Support me with all your might.

188
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,880
I'm also going to have a tournament.

189
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,880
I have to win a title, too.

190
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,880
I'm counting on you, Tenkousen.

191
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
Yes, sir!

192
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,880
I'm going to make lunch every day!

193
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
I'm family!

194
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,880
We're not family! We're supporters!

195
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,880
Here's your lunch for today.

196
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
Thank you.

197
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Let's have some.

198
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,880
Thank you.

199
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880
I'm planning to return everyone at 7.

200
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
That's all for today.

201
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
Understood.

202
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,880
Have a good day!

203
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,880
As I thought, he said, have a good day.

204
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,880
That's nice.

205
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,880
This is all I can do.

206
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,880
Let's do our best!

207
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,880
The second round is in the afternoon.

208
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,880
Kazuki, are you ready?

209
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,880
Yes, I'll be right there.

210
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,880
No, this isn't what I meant.

211
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Next, enter the first year!

212
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
Yes, sir!

213
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,880
Sir, your phone is ringing.

214
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,880
Who is it during practice?

215
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,880
Hello?

216
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Long time no see!

217
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
Hey, Nico.

218
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,880
You seem to be doing well.

219
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Yes, sir!

220
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
No, it's nothing.

221
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,880
As usual.

222
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,880
We just finished our overseas tour.

223
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,880
I'm looking forward to seeing you grow in the next tournament.

224
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,880
Yes, sir!

225
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
You're reading the script.

226
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,880
I'm ready.

227
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
Hey, Miwa.

228
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,880
Are you still not determined?

229
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,880
Decide which path you should take.

230
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Yes, sir.

231
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,880
The first audition for a female role.

232
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,880
She's also competing in tournaments.

233
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,880
Is it a challenge to the title?

234
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,880
Or...

235
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
As expected of the judge.

236
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,880
I'm looking forward to it.

237
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
Give me more results.

238
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
Welcome back!

239
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
What are you doing?

240
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
I'm making udon for the new menu.

241
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,880
It's a full-fledged menu with high nutritional value.

242
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,880
It also helps to keep the blood sugar level up.

243
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,880
Everyone's early today.

244
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,880
I'll go out with you for lunch.

245
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
Yes, sir!

246
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Hey, wait up!

247
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,880
Miwa's Iwashi Tororo Udon.

248
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Thank you.

249
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
But...

250
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,880
I wonder what her cooking skills are.

251
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,880
But...

252
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,880
It tastes really normal.

253
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
As expected!

254
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
That's right!

255
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,880
It looks normal, but it's too normal.

256
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,880
It's normal, but...

257
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,880
The standard is evil.

258
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,880
It's better than anyone else.

259
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,880
That's the mission of Mikado.

260
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,880
It's normal...

261
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,880
I never thought about it.

262
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
I'm glad we can eat together.

263
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
Azuki?

264
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Kase, I'll help you.

265
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
What's with that face?

266
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
It's not for you.

267
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,880
I was going to polish my female vision.

268
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,880
I don't think there are any men or women in the world who can wash their own dishes.

269
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
Shut up!

270
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
Kase!

271
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,880
How was the internal medicine audition?

272
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
Ah...

273
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
I don't know.

274
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,880
It's my first time acting.

275
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,880
To be honest, I'm a little...

276
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,880
No, I'm pretty anxious.

277
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,880
But when I came home earlier,

278
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,880
I forgot what I was so anxious about.

279
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
So...

280
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,880
I might be okay.

281
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,880
It's not because you were there!

282
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,880
I know.

283
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
What happened to your finger?

284
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,880
I actually cut it often.

285
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,880
You look cute.

286
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
It's not that.

287
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,880
I forgot the hot pot and got burned.

288
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880
Hey!

289
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,880
It's not broken.

290
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,880
This house has a lot of expensive dishes, so I changed it to high-quality plastic.

291
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,880
So you can drop it anytime.

292
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,880
Don't be ridiculous!

293
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
Geez...

294
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,880
But I guess I'm doing it right.

295
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,880
Are you okay?

296
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
My nose...

297
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
Look this way.

298
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,880
The Next Day

299
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,880
My lips are warm and soft right now.

300
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,880
I kissed you, Kazuki!

301
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
I'm sorry, Kazuki!

302
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
I'm so sorry!

303
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

304
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
Stop it.

305
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,880
You're being too arrogant.

306
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
It's an accident.

307
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,880
You can't go into Kiss's house.

308
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Yes, it's an accident.

309
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Stop it already.

310
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
Bye.

311
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Just as usual.

312
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,880
You're amazing, Kazuki.

313
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,880
I'm sorry, though.

314
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,880
I didn't expect to have to talk to you and kiss you.

315
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,880
But I'm sure you don't mind.

316
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,880
You've done a lot of scenes like that on stage.

317
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,880
My first kiss was a taste of blood.

318
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,880
The Next Day

319
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,880
It looks like it's going to rain today.

320
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,880
I'll keep an eye on the forecast.

321
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,880
Monday's drama, First Kiss!

322
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,880
Hey, where's Tenkyou?

323
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
Search online!

324
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,880
You look delicious, Miwa.

325
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
Are you jealous?

326
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Tenkou made me a snack.

327
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,880
It's like a mouthful of urutsuya.

328
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,880
You can have a bite.

329
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,880
Kazuki.

330
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,880
Stop it!

331
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,880
I'm sorry.

332
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,880
I'm sorry.

333
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,880
Kazuki, I'll tell you this.

334
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
What is it?

335
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,880
It's the kiss we had the other day.

336
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,880
I can't believe you're going to kiss Kazuki.

337
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,880
Of course.

338
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,880
So let's pretend we didn't kiss.

339
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,880
I'm sorry.

340
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,880
We didn't kiss?

341
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
We didn't kiss?

342
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,880
That guy!

343
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
Damn it!

344
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,880
But as Tenkou said,

345
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,880
we have to focus on this now.

346
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,880
The role of a woman?

347
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,880
You're not enough to play a man in a drama.

348
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,880
You're a genius at any role.

349
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
As the daughter of Mikado,

350
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,880
show me your talent.

351
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,880
I like you.

352
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,880
You're clearly a prince.

353
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,880
I'm just a woman.

354
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,880
What kind of woman is that?

355
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,880
Let's observe carefully.

356
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,880
I'm sure we can steal it from the other person's play.

357
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,880
Please wait.

358
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,880
I love you, Prince.

359
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,880
A cute voice in the eyes of the other person.

360
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
I see.

361
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,880
So this is what a woman is like.

362
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,880
I love you too.

363
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
Okay, stop.

364
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,880
Mikado, what's wrong today?

365
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
Did something happen in your private life?

366
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,880
No, nothing.

367
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
Really?

368
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,880
But be careful.

369
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,880
Your daily life will be affected by your acting.

370
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Yes.

371
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,880
Tenkousen.

372
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,880
Kasuki, welcome back.

373
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,880
The training has gotten harder.

374
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,880
I want you to make a dish that will give me stamina.

375
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
Okay.

376
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,880
I think I can use my own treatment.

377
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,880
I'll make it up to you.

378
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,880
This is what I call my daily life.

379
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Do you have a day off this week?

380
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,880
I'm free all year long.

381
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,880
Do you want me to do something?

382
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,880
Tenkousen, I want to go on a date with you.

383
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,880
If you're free on Sunday, then go on a date with me.

384
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,880
I can't tell you, but you're so vivid.

385
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,880
You're confusing me.

386
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,880
I can say that on stage, but...

387
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,880
Why?

388
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,880
I'm so lucky.

389
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,880
I'll find my words in the next line.

390
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:16,880
Even if I don't know, I believe I'll find them someday.

391
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
I'll fly.

392
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,880
I'm so lucky.

393
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,880
Is it a princess that I want to be?

394
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,880
Is it a prince?

395
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,880
You made me realize that I could be anything.

396
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,880
Thank you.

397
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,880
I'll deliver it.
