1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,220
Theдеando

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,580
Kazuki's...

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,800
She's eating the Apples!!

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,680
We're finally done with the soup.

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,460
What can we do without carrots in it?

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,200
You,lusen

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It was so long...

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I didn't know it was this hard to get food.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's raining in my head.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's sweet and it's in my weak heart.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I can't show it to anyone.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
A blue future, a spring-like love.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
In bitter coffee-like days,

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I drop one of my thoughts.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm lost.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You made me think of you.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I want to reach you.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
A normal happiness.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
A love miracle like a drama.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
A miracle that's right for you.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The dream of the meal you made.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The dream of the wind you made.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The memories you made.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll take them with me.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You don't want dinner?

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The tournament is coming soon.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll be late for the training.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't want it either.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Nice!

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The rehearsal has started.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'll be over there for a while.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
See you later.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We finally got to eat together.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm used to it.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
My mom was always saying that she'd open the door for a month.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We were always apart.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Those three are all born geniuses just like my mom.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm just a loser who can't do anything when you're born.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I want you to help my daughters.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's what they say.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yu.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You made a happy family.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What's a happy family?

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Damn it!

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm home!

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Welcome back.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm so moved by this story.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's just a normal story.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's not a big deal, but it's nothing.

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's not a big deal, but it's nothing.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's just a normal day.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We can all laugh and have fun.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I love that kind of family.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Shiki?

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
See? We haven't even had our wedding yet.

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's why.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Mom, you're so beautiful!

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Thank you.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm so happy to be a bride.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This drama makes me feel complicated.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I made a happy family.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Reality doesn't go like a drama, Mom.

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm so tired.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You're so lazy.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You're not athletic enough.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You don't need muscles for shogi.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Welcome back.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why are you crying?

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I was watching a drama.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Home drama?

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Did you watch all of it?

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yes.

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Subaru?

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I can't believe he misses his mom.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This drama is the best.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Hey, Tenkousen.

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You don't have to be so hard on us.

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Right.

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's no use trying so hard.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You don't have to do that.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You're a wimp.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
A wimp?

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Who?

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You!

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I don't think so!

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I've been running away from my mom.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I thought she was a genius and different from me.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I realized it was too late, but there was no difference.

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So I want to face her.

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I want to get along with you and be a happy family.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
A happy family?

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You're so lame.

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You're watching too much drama, Tenkousen.

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's not a good thing.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You're not a family.

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
How do you become a family?

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Let me propose again.

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let's be a happy family.

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's...

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What?

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That's...

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What was that dream?

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's not a dream!

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm a wimp's wife!

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You're so stupid to be so heartless.

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's a reunion.

109
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's a drama that's going on behind you.

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's a super liminal.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Let's make it clear here.

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Miko.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Me?

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes.

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Me and Miko...

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Which one of us will be the first one to have a birthday?

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What?

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What's that?

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We'll be a family.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We're in the same school year.

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Miko will be the older sister and the younger sister on our birthdays.

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We should make it clear here.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
When were you born?

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
By the way, I was born in December.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Shut up.

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You're a second-rate for life!

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Damn it.

128
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's what happened.

129
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But he's an old man.

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He's living with the three of them.

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't understand.

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I can't understand.

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What's wrong?

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I forgot to buy bread for tomorrow.

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I was going to make sandwiches.

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's all?

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't yell at me for nothing.

138
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
To me, it's the most important thing...

139
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Miko.

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You're going to catch a cold again.

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's because you're going to yell at me.

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Miko.

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Miko.

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Why is your face so red?

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's the sunset.

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's only been five minutes since we entered.

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
When I was a freshman, I was usually naked.

148
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't think I need to be embarrassed now.

149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That means...

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Why are you so serious?

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You're not naked.

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Miwa.

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I've washed the laundry.

154
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Thank you.

155
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Ouch!

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm going to retake it!

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
A cold?

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What was that?

159
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Hey, aren't you red too?

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
My cheeks are red from birth!

161
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's all my fault!

162
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I see.

163
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You too.

164
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Are you a little bit like a transfer student?

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You too?

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I said I'm not!

167
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You're just talking nonsense!

168
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You're mistaken!

169
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's easy to get angry when you're mistaken.

170
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You're going to die!

171
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You're going to get your ass kicked!

172
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You're so annoying!

173
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You're so annoying!

174
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What's with the fight?

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're so old that you're so ugly.

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Kazuki.

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm glad you're here.

178
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Can you put this in the upper shelf?

179
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I can't reach it.

180
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm in a good mood right now.

181
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Thank you.

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Is that all?

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yes, thank you.

185
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Thank you, Kazuki.

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What's with those eyes?

187
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Kazuki!

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You look like you've never seen it!

189
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
My cheeks are red too!

190
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Where did you get it from?

191
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What are you doing?

192
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm your sister, so please be nice to me!

193
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I don't know why you're fighting with me!

194
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Those three...

195
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
They're making me work harder!

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I guess reality doesn't work like a drama.

197
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But when the four of us ate together for the first time,

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't know why, but it was so much fun.

199
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I wish I could spend more time with the three sisters.

200
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It would take time for a genius like us to fight.

201
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This is...

202
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Three sisters from when we were kids?

203
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So cute!

204
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What is this?

205
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
They look so close and smile!

206
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
They're angels!

207
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Why?

208
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Why did it happen?

209
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But those three had a time like this too.

210
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yosakura and Komainu...

211
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Where did they get them?

212
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Who left them behind?

213
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm not interested in old memories.

214
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Who has their family photos?

215
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's not like I don't know the three of them.

216
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That means...

217
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Someone is lying!

218
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Someone among the three of them had this photo.

219
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm sure that person wants to go back to the three sisters.

220
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I was trying to get along with the three of them,

221
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
but I have to think about the three sisters if I want to be a family.

222
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But...

223
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The weekend is in the countryside.

224
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's a tournament.

225
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I asked for a lesson, transfer student.

226
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Oh, no!

227
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
They're going to be separated soon.

228
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But all three of them are active all over the country.

229
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
They're geniuses.

230
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This is what Miho was talking about.

231
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The location is in the Tohoku region.

232
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And Kazuki's park is...

233
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Oh, right.

234
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What's the event for Niko?

235
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
This is it!

236
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Everyone, you're going on a trip tomorrow, right?

237
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I brought hot milk so you can sleep early.

238
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Don't get distracted.

239
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh, no!

240
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
We have to reserve a place to stay.

241
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's so annoying.

242
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I always end up late.

243
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's okay.

244
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I've prepared the place for you.

245
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What?

246
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Here.

247
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The map and contact information of the hotel.

248
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's a popular hotel.

249
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Please look forward to it.

250
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I can't get the hang of it.

251
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Eating a hotel's food that's not good for two days.

252
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That means...

253
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You miss my food, Miwa?

254
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I didn't talk about your food!

255
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That was close.

256
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Maybe I should have said something.

257
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'll make you a meal when I get back.

258
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It didn't even take a second to say it.

259
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I read through the opponent's hand.

260
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
This is the sign of the Mika Dono Juryu.

261
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm a genius, but I'm a genius today.

262
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Mr. Mika!

263
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Huh?

264
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Congratulations on your first day.

265
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Thank you.

266
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You have a match tomorrow.

267
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Here, a gift for the Juryu.

268
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Oh.

269
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm looking forward to a good match.

270
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
A southern enemy?

271
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll get an AI at the hotel.

272
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
This place...

273
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm going to get a good AI.

274
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
This place...

275
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's a bit nostalgic.

276
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It doesn't matter to me anymore.

277
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The check-in is...

278
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Thank you for waiting, Mr. Mika.

279
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Huh?

280
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
This is the room key.

281
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Thank you.

282
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Kazune!

283
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Miwa!

284
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Why are you here?

285
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I was at a theater near here.

286
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Why are you here?

287
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm here too!

288
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What are you doing?

289
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Nico!

290
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Is Nico's tournament near here?

291
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Oh.

292
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Geez.

293
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
We live in the same house, but you don't know where we live?

294
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We should talk more.

295
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
All students!

296
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Huh?

297
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What does it mean to be in the same room with three people?

298
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
What kind of harassment is this?

299
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Please make it more fun.

300
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The places we went to were strange.

301
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
We live apart from each other.

302
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
We spend time together in the same room with three sisters.

303
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
We talk a lot and understand each other.

304
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
What is she imagining?

305
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I don't want to imagine.

306
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What are you doing here, transfer student?

307
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What are you talking about?

308
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm a festival conductor.

309
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Huh?

310
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Tonight!

311
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
There's a festival near here.

312
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Let's go together.

313
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'll show you around.

314
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
A festival where a picture was taken by chance.

315
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The owner of the picture must be dying to go.

316
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What festival?

317
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I don't care!

318
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm staying in my room to get my condition back.

319
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I thought so.

320
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But the temple of the Yosakura Festival is famous for its Shobun.

321
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I can't say that.

322
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You're a good actor?

323
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm not confident that I can ask God to win or lose.

324
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'll practice so hard that I don't have to rely on anyone.

325
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That's the best.

326
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You don't know?

327
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The world champion of martial arts.

328
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The stage actress who is active in Hollywood.

329
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
The master of the Shogi of the Year.

330
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The famous geniuses are also praying here.

331
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I know you're a stoic person,

332
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
but you're confident that you can get there by praying.

333
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
If you're so tense, you can't get serious when you get home.

334
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Breathing is also important.

335
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And look!

336
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The sea is close, so there are many seafood stalls.

337
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It looks more delicious than the hotel food.

338
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That's true.

339
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You're so free.

340
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'll tell you.

341
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Kazune!

342
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Is that okay?

343
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't think I'll be bothered with SNS.

344
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But you guys, that's all you have to wear?

345
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You're walking with me, and you're not allowed to wear such a lame costume.

346
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Please leave it to me!

347
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'll go to this festival conductor!

348
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Welcome!

349
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm sorry!

350
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'd like a kimono hat that suits these three.

352
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What a beautiful aura!

353
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The sisters are wearing that, but the material is top-notch.

354
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Leave it to me!

355
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'll make you the best kimono!

356
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Not bad.

357
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
As expected of Kazuki!

358
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The kimono suits you too!

359
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Of course.

360
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
With a monotone and chic style,

361
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
you can create a luxurious face with a big-sized Kanegiku pattern.

362
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's a dress that can be worn by a tall and mature girl!

363
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Look, Kazune!

364
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm a cat's glass!

365
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You're a good student!

366
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You're so tricky.

367
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Miwa.

368
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
A cat with a flower of travel,

369
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
a unique pattern full of playfulness,

370
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
but she's perfect for a different cuteness.

371
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Then, Nico-san, what about you?

372
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You don't like kimonos?

373
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
No, I don't.

374
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You're so green and bright.

375
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Do you have anything you like?

376
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I told you to leave it to me.

377
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Kimono doesn't suit me.

378
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That's not true.

379
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What about this?

380
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
A pattern of a monotone and chic style,

381
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
a rough and straightforward design.

382
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's perfect for a strong and cool Nico-san.

383
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Wow!

384
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Nico.

385
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I look better in this.

386
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You like it easier to move, don't you?

387
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Nico is a god-like woman.

388
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm...

389
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Huh?

390
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You already chose one?

391
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
A transfer student.

392
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Is that for Nico?

393
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
A flower on a pink paper.

394
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's a pretty dress for Nico-chan.

395
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
That's not true.

396
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Nico-san, you're small and cute.

397
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You're cute, but I'm cooler.

398
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You're pretty too, but...

399
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Nico-san!

400
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Please choose the dress you like.

401
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You're late!

402
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Hurry up, Nico.

403
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Shut up.

404
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You're the one who's doing the paper.

405
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's not a rose after all.

406
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Y-You're the one!

407
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
What's going on?

408
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm sorry.

409
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm sorry.

410
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm sorry.

411
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm sorry.

412
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm sorry.

413
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm sorry.

414
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm sorry.

415
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm sorry.

416
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm sorry.

417
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm sorry.

418
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm sorry.

419
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm sorry.

420
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm sorry.

421
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm sorry.

422
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm sorry.

423
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm sorry.

424
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm sorry.

425
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm sorry.

426
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm sorry.
