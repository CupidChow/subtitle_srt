You must be nuts!

168
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:57,029
- Dumped again. It's obvious! 
 - Shut up!

then I'll propose to Haebom.

- Taesung, what a romantic! 
 - So corny!

When you first confessed your feelings for me…

00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:30,582
it wasn't that I didn't believe you.

252
00:19:30,582 --> 00:19:33,144
I was just worried…

253
00:19:33,144 --> 00:19:36,411
that you'd get hurt if my feelings

254
00:19:36,411 --> 00:19:39,613
happened to be different from yours.

255
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:41,865
So I was nervous.

256
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:44,631
And now?

257
00:19:45,816 --> 00:19:48,629

comes in many forms, and is different for everyone.

259
