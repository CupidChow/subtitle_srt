00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,646
My dream?

36
00:02:50,646 --> 00:02:54,205
For example, what you want to do for work,

37
00:02:54,205 --> 00:02:56,765
or what kind of life you'll lead…

Got it.

89
00:06:45,691 --> 00:06:47,796
Don't treat me like a baby brother.

00:07:06,348 --> 00:07:07,945
- I'm scared. 
 - I can watch it with Taesung.

Taesung!

00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:13,632
Oh, Cho Taesung!

100
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:16,552
Seri booked the tickets so pay her back.

00:07:16,552 --> 00:07:18,320
Cool.

102
00:07:23,724 --> 00:07:25,145
What's up?

103
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,713
I don't have my wallet.

104
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,882
Have you lost it?

105
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,352
I'm not sure. Wait a sec.

106
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,802
It's Taesung.

107
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,367

Hey.

109
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:50,794
Can you check if my wallet's at home?

110
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:53,090
Okay.

111
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:01,470
There's one here, is this it?

112
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,217
- Don't touch it. 
 - Okay.

113
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:11,190
Now I've checked that it's at home, you can just leave it.

114
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,787
Okay.

115
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:20,264
It's lucky that it's at home.

116
00:08:20,264 --> 00:08:22,759
I think I'll just go home.

117
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,546
I don't have my wallet.

118
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,995
What are you talking about? This is my first time out in ages.

119
00:08:26,995 --> 00:08:29,806
Yeah, come on! I'll lend you some money.

120
00:08:29,806 --> 00:08:31,635
Exactly! She's loaded.

121
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:34,366
Shut it.

122
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,379
Sorry.

123
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:47,260
Taesung!

124
00:08:48,473 --> 00:08:50,660
Why are you home so early?

125
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,220
Where's my wallet?

126
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,405
Over there on the table.

127
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:08,715
You didn't open it, right?

128
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,571
Yeah, I didn't touch it.

129
00:09:10,571 --> 00:09:12,678
Count your money.

130
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:15,027
I didn't mean it like that.

131
00:09:16,494 --> 00:09:18,386
Here.

132
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:22,311
You forgot your wallet, how…

133
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,626
I borrowed some money.

134
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:27,512
What? You didn't have to do that.

135
00:09:55,973 --> 00:09:59,226
Hello! My name is Haebom.

136
00:09:59,226 --> 00:10:00,733
I see.

137
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,466
You're so polite.

138
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:05,930
You must be Taesung.

139
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,993
Nice to meet you.

140
00:10:07,993 --> 00:10:10,599
You have to say hello, too, Haebom.

141
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,343
He's like this sometimes.

142
00:10:17,343 --> 00:10:20,053
Taesung, you have to say hello.

143
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:26,227
From now on, we're friends.

144
00:10:26,227 --> 00:10:30,354
At that time, I was acting out because my parents weren't getting along.

145
00:10:30,354 --> 00:10:32,898
You were my first friend.

146
00:10:33,685 --> 00:10:38,718
I've liked you since then, Haebom.

147
00:10:43,431 --> 00:10:45,446
Taesung!

148
00:10:55,314 --> 00:10:57,229
Time for dinner.

149
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,253
Did something happen?

150
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:12,930
Let me hold you for a moment.

151
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,286
Anything happen today?

152
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,792
Nah, everything was great today.

153
00:11:31,822 --> 00:11:33,361
That's good.

154
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:36,249
Taesung! Haebom!

155
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:37,222
Hi!

156
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:39,755
Where are you two sneaking off to?

157
00:11:39,755 --> 00:11:42,608
Are you ditching us again?

158
00:11:42,608 --> 00:11:43,746
Of course not.

159
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:44,958
We're off on a date.

160
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,239
- Is that how it is? 
 - Barf!

161
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,317
Just the two of you are going to hang out.

162
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:51,202
We're running an errand at the supermarket.

163
00:11:52,075 --> 00:11:53,718
See you tomorrow.

164
00:11:53,718 --> 00:11:55,651
- Bye! 
 - Bye!

165
00:11:55,651 --> 00:11:56,643
See you tomorrow.

166
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,579
Later!

167
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:01,907
What a cute couple.
