Relative pronouns…

45
00:03:56,088 --> 00:04:00,022
However, when we look at the antecedent, it's a person.

46
00:04:00,847 --> 00:04:03,880
And the verb comes directly after.

47
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,445
So we need a subject.

48
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:11,472
You can understand it as modifying the noun that came before it.

49
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:14,686
That's what a relative pronoun is.

Well…

110

She told me she liked me.

Yeah, it's definitely him.

It's been a long time since I've seen him laugh like that. Right?

163
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:32,351
Maybe it's because they live together, but they look like brothers.

164

I don't think so.

00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:50,271
And place a perilla leaf on top.

169
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:53,521
Then, add a piece of meat.

170
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,479
Just like that.

171
00:12:57,479 --> 00:13:00,445
And then another cabbage leaf.

172
00:13:01,985 --> 00:13:04,184
It's harder than it looks.

173
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,151
Take your time.

174
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,487
Taesung, teach me how to do it.

175
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:12,500
Teach you what?

176
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,680
I just copied what Haebom did.

177
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:20,699
Haebom, looks like you're a good cook.

178
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,902
Not really. I just help out at home.

179
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:28,040
Hey, Seo Haebom!

180
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,442
You'll make a good wife for someone.

181
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,411
I'll be well-loved, right?

182
00:13:33,817 --> 00:13:36,799
Taesung, Haebom is doing a great job on his own.

183
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,178
You and I can go make fishcake skewers.

184
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:42,876
Good idea. It will save us some time.

Who wants to go buy some snacks?

192
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,196
I'll go with Taesung.

193
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,749
- You want to? 
 - Yup.

194
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:27,790
You guys made a delicious dinner, so we'll go.

195
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,402
No, let me go with Taesung.

196
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,575
This is guys' work.

197
00:14:32,575 --> 00:14:35,599
What's gotten into you, Jo Yonghee?

198
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:39,219
Let's go, Taesung.

199
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,816
Okay.

200
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:54,847
It's quite chilly at night.

201
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:56,713
You're right.

202
00:14:56,713 --> 00:14:59,398
Want me to grab some blankets from the car?

203
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,168
It's okay, I'll grab them on my way back from the bathroom.

204
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:03,969
Okay.

205
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,085
- Get one for me, too! 
 - Okay.

206
00:15:21,556 --> 00:15:24,909
Hey! Just say what you want to say.

207
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:27,703
You've had something to say to me since earlier, right?

208
00:15:27,703 --> 00:15:29,795
Something to say?

209
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,932
What is it?

210
00:15:33,175 --> 00:15:37,389
What's going on between you and Haebom?

211
00:15:39,536 --> 00:15:41,956
I told you, we're friends.

212
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,437
Friends like you and me?

213
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,601
May I ask…

214
00:15:53,358 --> 00:15:56,385
The girl that Taesung dated…

215
00:15:56,385 --> 00:15:57,800
was it Seri?

216
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,462
No way.

217
00:16:02,813 --> 00:16:04,920
This is just my feeling,

218
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,600
but I think Seri just has an unrequited crush on Taesung.

219
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,587
Unrequited?

220
00:16:10,587 --> 00:16:12,077
Yeah.

221
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:16,364
Seri is not Taesung's style at all.

222
00:16:19,056 --> 00:16:20,623
Then…

223
00:16:20,623 --> 00:16:24,516
What kind of person does Taesung like?

224
00:16:26,672 --> 00:16:28,692
Let me think.

225
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:31,323
Someone like me?

226
00:16:32,502 --> 00:16:34,802
I'm just kidding.

227
00:16:34,802 --> 00:16:37,375
- A female version of you? 
 - What?

228
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,419
Don't joke around like that.

229
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:41,825
I'm not.

230
00:16:41,825 --> 00:16:45,357
A while back, Taesung told me about what kind of person he likes.

231
00:16:46,126 --> 00:16:47,766
And it's just like you.

232
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:49,152
Me?

233
00:16:49,152 --> 00:16:50,909
Yeah.

234
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:55,030
Someone who smiles often and is caring.

235
00:16:55,758 --> 00:16:57,805
What else did he say?

236
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:02,222
I see.

237
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,968
Yonghee,

238
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:12,989
don't assume you know what I'm feeling.

239
00:17:12,989 --> 00:17:16,149
I'm just worried because I'm your friend.

240
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:18,350
Just like you're my close friend,

241
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,844
if Haebom is your close friend,

242
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:24,455
then… take good care of him.

243
00:17:26,141 --> 00:17:27,876
Don't overthink it.

244
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:29,962
I know, but…

245
00:17:29,962 --> 00:17:32,950
my feelings for Haebom aren't going away!

246
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:36,767
Up until now, I've ignored him in order to hide my feelings.

247
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:41,052
Haebom…

248
00:17:41,052 --> 00:17:43,127
When he graduates, he's going to move out.

249
00:17:43,127 --> 00:17:46,152
I don't know if I'll ever see him again!

250
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:49,400
I want to confess my feelings and keep him by my side.

251
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,779
Do you think he feels the same way?

252
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,363
What if he gets hurt?

253
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:03,616
- I… 
 - Whether he likes me or not…

254
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:07,450
I think it'll be better if he decides.

255
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:13,372

00:19:08,678 --> 00:19:11,123
Let's go to sleep.

00:19:11,123 --> 00:19:13,036
Shall we?

269
00:19:14,906 --> 00:19:16,186
Where's Haebom?

270
00:19:16,186 --> 00:19:17,719
Huh?

271
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:20,396
He was just here.

272
00:19:20,396 --> 00:19:22,971
Maybe he went to the bathroom?

273
00:19:22,971 --> 00:19:25,193
I guess so.

274
00:19:25,193 --> 00:19:27,370
I'll go look for him.

275
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:35,396
Coffee to go.

276
00:19:36,892 --> 00:19:38,846
That's my boy!

277
00:19:40,386 --> 00:19:42,446
So nice.

278
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:44,645
You're working, even now?

279
00:19:44,645 --> 00:19:48,173
I have an important meeting on Monday.

280
00:19:48,173 --> 00:19:50,785
I was dying for a cup of coffee.

281
00:19:50,785 --> 00:19:53,202
You know me so well.

282
00:19:57,646 --> 00:20:00,373
It's so nice here.

283
00:20:03,087 --> 00:20:06,570
It's been a long time since the three of us did something together.

284
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:13,123
When you were in elementary school, we used to go to the amusement park.

285
00:20:13,123 --> 00:20:17,420
I've been too focused on work recently and have neglected you.

286
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,412
Not at all.

287
00:20:23,634 --> 00:20:25,447
Haebom,

288
00:20:27,013 --> 00:20:31,447
if you ever want to talk about anything,

289
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:35,730
I'm always here for you. Don't hold back, okay?

290
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,970
Me, you, and Taesung…

291
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,948
We're a family.

292
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,760
Got it?

293
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,290
Yes.

294
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:50,920
Oh! Here comes a third wheel.

295
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:00,030
What are you two up to?

296
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,790
Can't you see? We're on a date.

297
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,660
Let's go. I have something to show you.

298
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,630
Me?

299
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,390
What about me?

300
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,540
It's bedtime for my sweet mother.

301
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,480
What, you little…

302
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,476
I'll show you now.

303
00:21:29,363 --> 00:21:31,130
It's so beautiful.

304
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,561
I wanted to look at them with you.

305
00:22:00,003 --> 00:22:01,857
Taesung!

306
00:22:01,857 --> 00:22:04,034
Yeah?

307
00:22:04,034 --> 00:22:09,471
I thought you hated me.

308
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:14,513
Isn't that why you ignored me all this time?

309
00:22:14,513 --> 00:22:16,873
I didn't hate you.

310
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:22,778
I just couldn't express my feelings.

311
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:28,019
I see.

312
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,364
Just a stupid misunderstanding.

313
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,852
I'm a dummy, right?

319
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,856
Hello, my name is Haebom.

320
00:23:23,856 --> 00:23:25,412
Eunseon,

321
00:23:25,412 --> 00:23:27,445
I won't let…

322
00:23:27,445 --> 00:23:31,244
Haebom grow up without a mom and dad.

323
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:36,546
Make a choice that is right for you and that will make you happy.

324
00:23:37,554 --> 00:23:38,831
Yes.

325
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:41,436
- I don't have my wallet. 
 - What?

326
00:23:41,436 --> 00:23:43,198
Did you lose it?

327
00:23:43,198 --> 00:23:46,800
You didn't look inside, did you?

328
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,399
That's how you became my first friend.

329
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,770
Did something happen?

330
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,266
The older you get, the more you see.

331
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:04,566
Sorry?

00:24:04,566 --> 00:24:05,704
You don't want to?

333
00:24:05,704 --> 00:24:09,150
No. I'd love to.

334
00:24:12,181 --> 00:24:14,392
Taesung!

335
00:24:14,392 --> 00:24:17,205
You're not going to disappear, are you?

336
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,962
You'll stay by my side, won't you?

337
00:24:21,137 --> 00:24:23,465
I'll stay by your side.
