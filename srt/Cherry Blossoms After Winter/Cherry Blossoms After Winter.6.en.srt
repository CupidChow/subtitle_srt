00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:16,221
Since it was last minute, I didn't have time to buy a present.

334
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:20,893
My present is me paying for this with Jia's card.

335
00:25:20,893 --> 00:25:22,040
It's okay.

336
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,606
I'm just grateful that you're even here.

337
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:30,360
When Taesung asked me to recommend him a nice cakeshop, I was surprised.

338
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,865
Thanks, you guys.

339
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:34,244
It's nothing.

340
00:25:34,244 --> 00:25:35,992
Let's eat!

[CHERRY BLOSSOMS AFTER WINTER]

348
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,140
Do you think she's sick?

349
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,410
She's just busy.

350
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,975
Aren't you here to meet Haebom?

351
00:26:53,975 --> 00:26:56,135
I came after I promised I wouldn't interrupt him.

352
00:26:56,135 --> 00:26:59,880
I'm just taking Hyejoo to the bus stop.

353
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,111
Okay.

354
00:27:02,111 --> 00:27:04,797
Oh my gosh!

355
00:27:04,797 --> 00:27:10,384
I can't imagine my life without Haebom.

356
00:27:10,384 --> 00:27:13,855
Your father and grandfather will never accept it.

357
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:16,716
Even if you can take it, Haebom can't.

358
00:27:16,716 --> 00:27:18,828
I'm not going to tell him.

359
00:27:18,828 --> 00:27:20,298
Why not?

360
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,433
He has a right to know.

361
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:25,030
As long as I have him, it's okay.

362
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:29,963
All I need is Haebom.
