I've lived here with his family since I was orphaned at the age of seven.

00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:52,761
It was his mom who decided to take me in.

00:03:52,761 --> 00:03:56,548
He probably didn't have any say in it.

I've imposed on them enough.

He is top of the class.

Not just that. He's great at sports, too.

Like he was about to piss his pants.

He always just says "okay" or "fine."

He only gives me good answers.

I'm grateful he's so laid-back, but on the other hand, it makes me worry.

Even if something's up, he'll just deal with it by himself.

Now that you're in the same class, you can look out for him.

You don't have much time left with him.

Why is there not enough time left?

Once you go to university, you're bound to drift apart.

113
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,320
Haebom will probably want to live alone.

00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:24,720
Why are we having this for breakfast today?

169
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,714
It's his birthday.

170
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:28,268
Bingo!

171
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,090
Happy birthday, Haebom!

172
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,343
Thank you, Ma'am.

173
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,569
I'll eat it all.

174
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,803
- Help yourself. 
 - Thanks.

175
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:03,554
Mom!

176
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
It's my birthday today.

177
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,100
I've grown up big and strong.

178
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:18,287
Jeonghee.

179
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:22,714
Today is Haebom's 18th birthday.

180
00:18:22,714 --> 00:18:25,407
Hasn't he turned out well?

181
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:28,964
Here.

182
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:31,777
What's this?

183
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,598
Open it.

184
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,320
This much?

185
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,248
Why don't you buy something that you really want this year?

186
00:18:42,248 --> 00:18:44,335
You know that I care about you a lot?

187
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:47,348
Thanks, Ma'am.

188
00:18:47,348 --> 00:18:50,400
- You'll be late for school. 
 - Okay.

189
00:19:10,892 --> 00:19:12,779
Hey, Haebom!

190
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:15,066
Let me borrow some money.

191
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:19,725
I forgot my wallet today.

192
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,313
Really?

193
00:19:25,046 --> 00:19:27,212
What are you doing?

194
00:19:27,212 --> 00:19:32,085
Dude, I need some money urgently, so I'm borrowing some.

195
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,730
I didn't bring any.

196
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,560
What's up with him today?

197
00:19:45,254 --> 00:19:46,547
Haebom!

198
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:48,687
You brought all this for me?

199
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,160
You're the man.

200
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,586
- Give it back. 
 - I'll make good use of it.

201
00:19:53,586 --> 00:19:55,146
Please.

202
00:19:55,146 --> 00:19:56,606
Are you crazy?

203
00:19:56,606 --> 00:19:59,133
I said give it back!

♫ Fading to white ♫

205
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,093
♫ When my memories ♫

206
00:20:08,093 --> 00:20:13,819
♫ Are about to be erased ♫

207
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:17,173
♫ Those times when ♫

208
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:20,066
♫ We walked the snowy street ♫

209
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:25,426
♫ Come vividly to mind ♫

210

♫ The snow gently sweeps away ♫

211
00:20:30,653 --> 00:20:36,332
♫ The sorrow on my shoulders ♫

213
00:20:40,313 --> 00:20:42,973
Should I fight back?

214
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,733
Don't fight them.

215
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,683
But you've got to deal with it somehow.

216
00:20:48,683 --> 00:20:51,330
Please don't tell your mom.

217
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,650
If that's what you want.

218
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,216
What kind of asshole are you?

219
00:20:56,216 --> 00:20:58,590
Stop messing around and give it back.

220
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,856
You're not asking for this, are you?

221
00:21:02,856 --> 00:21:06,349
It's much better if the giver writes it themself.

222
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:10,142
It's more meaningful if it has a few lines straight from the heart.

223
00:21:10,142 --> 00:21:12,529
They were probably nervous.

224
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:16,742
Even if you're nervous, it's cute if you write from the heart.

225
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:20,020
A word-perfect confession of love lacks sincerity.
