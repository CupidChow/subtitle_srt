00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:34,675
I can't imagine my life without him.

168
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,500
Your father and grandfather will never accept it.

169
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,488
Even if you can take it, Haebom can't.

170
00:14:42,488 --> 00:14:45,817
Why does it matter what they think?

171
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:47,919
Taesung.

172
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:54,459
I think you're just confused because you've lived together since you were little.

173
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:58,078
It's my fault you grew up so lonely.

174
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,920
What you're saying…

175
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,019
is something I've thought about thousands of times.

176
00:15:08,035 --> 00:15:09,753
But it's not that.

177
00:15:10,515 --> 00:15:15,605
I love Haebom, and he loves me.

178
00:15:15,605 --> 00:15:20,004
No one will accept this relationship. You'll regret it in the end!

179
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:23,255
I'm different! I'm different from you!

180
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,801
What?

181
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,055
Mom!

182
00:15:33,034 --> 00:15:35,601
I know you regret having me.

183
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,205
Taesung.

184
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,474
What do you mean?

185
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:50,000
Also, don't talk about this to Haebom.

186
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,226
Don't hurt him with your questions. You know he's sensitive.

187
00:15:54,226 --> 00:15:55,931
Okay?

188
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,324
Taesung!

189
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,080
Hey, that's enough!

190
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,953
What's wrong?

191
00:16:07,953 --> 00:16:10,458
Say something, at least!

192
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,520
My mom found out about everything.

193
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,109
What?

194
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:47,914
Does Haebom know that she knows?

195
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:51,526
No.

196
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,904
I'm not going to tell him, either.

197
00:16:55,904 --> 00:16:57,331
Why not?

198
00:16:57,331 --> 00:16:59,471
He has a right to know.

199
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,660
If my mom tells Haebom to stop seeing me, then he will.

200
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,967
No, he wouldn't.

201
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,530
Haebom can't stand up to my mom.

202
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:18,490
He'll talk about everything my mom has done for him…

203
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,711
and say we have to follow her wishes.

204
00:17:21,711 --> 00:17:25,656
But this isn't just about you.

205
00:17:26,817 --> 00:17:30,580
Haebom needs to know, too.

206
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,980
I waited for him for 12 years.

207
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,886
He's only liked me for a year.

208
00:17:37,886 --> 00:17:41,125
I get that, but…

209
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,120
Haebom's feelings…

210
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,660
aren't as strong as my own.

211
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,250
If…

212
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,117
you have to give up everything you have for Haebom,

213
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,670
will you do it?

214
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:04,600
♫ I hope we'll be together forever ♫

215
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:13,530
♫ In this fateful moment, I will be holding your hand ♫

216
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,460
As long as I have him, it's okay.

217
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:20,744
All I need is Haebom.

218
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,244
Hi, Yonghee.

219
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,204
What?

220
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,212
Taesung's drunk?

221
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:48,022
I'll send you the address.

222
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:49,619
Okay.

223
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:57,144
- Jesus! 
 - Yonghee!

224
00:18:57,144 --> 00:18:58,491
Oh, Haebom!

225
00:18:58,491 --> 00:19:00,562
He drank too much.

226
00:19:00,562 --> 00:19:02,988
- How much did he drink? 
 - Want me to help him inside?

227
00:19:02,988 --> 00:19:06,110
- It's okay. 
 - Here you go.

228
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:10,186
- Sorry to put you through this. Thanks. 
 - It's okay. I'll be off, then.

229
00:19:10,186 --> 00:19:13,093
- Thanks, and sorry. 
 - Hey…

230
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:15,427
- Haebom. 
 - What?

231
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,980
It's nothing. Get him inside quickly.

232
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,694
- I'm so sorry. Get home safely. 
 - You too.

233
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,095
Let's go. Hey!

234
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,508
- Watch out, watch out! 
 - Dear me.

235
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,880
Slowly, slowly.

236
00:19:43,286 --> 00:19:45,605
Let's get your shoes off.

237
00:19:45,605 --> 00:19:48,330
Dear god, why did you drink so much?

238
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,627
You missed me, right?

239
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,630
Yeah, I missed you so much!

240
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:06,357
See?

241
00:20:06,357 --> 00:20:08,000
Now you know what it's like to wait.

242
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,400
Now you know how I feel.

243
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,005
What?

244
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:15,491
So you came this late on purpose?

245
00:20:17,904 --> 00:20:19,710
Nope.

246
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,266
Did something happen?

247
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:33,712
Why did you drink so much out of the blue?

248
00:20:34,436 --> 00:20:37,531
Some days you just have to.

249
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:39,812
Just have to get wasted.

250
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:50,817
Then we should get wasted together.

251
00:20:52,158 --> 00:20:54,193
Haebom!

252
00:20:54,193 --> 00:20:56,957
I'll never regret it.

253
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,544
Haebom!

254
00:20:59,544 --> 00:21:00,938
Yeah?

255
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,591
Give me a hug.

256
00:21:29,946 --> 00:21:32,465
- Are you okay? 
 - No, I'm not okay.

257
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:34,597
I can make you some food.

258
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:37,027
Like what?

259
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:40,530
- Ramen? 
 - Not ramen.

260
00:21:41,296 --> 00:21:43,183
Oh! It's your mom.

261
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,899
What are you doing?

262
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:52,340
Don't answer her. Just for a while.

263
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:55,455
Why?

264
00:21:55,455 --> 00:21:57,518
We had an argument.

265
00:21:59,433 --> 00:22:02,191
Is that why you drank so much?

266
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:03,548
Yeah.

267
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,397
You shouldn't do that.

268
00:22:07,397 --> 00:22:09,352
You're all that she has.

269
00:22:09,352 --> 00:22:12,248
Why would you want to upset her?

270
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:16,533
You know we've never gotten along.

271
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:19,624
You'll end up on Santa's naughty list!

272
00:22:19,624 --> 00:22:21,089
Apologize to her.

273
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,465
Otherwise, you're not allowed near me.

274
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:37,092
Why isn't Haebom answering my calls?

275
00:22:37,092 --> 00:22:39,569
He's never ignored me before.

276
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:43,271
What should I do?

277
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,565
Jeonghee!

278
00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:49,900
What should I do?

279
00:22:54,290 --> 00:23:04,280
♫ Your blue world spreads to my white heart ♫

280
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:13,850
♫ Purple poetry are written on my rosy cheeks ♫

281
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:22,730
♫ Every day, all throughout my heart is filled with you ♫

282
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:27,870
♫ A day like a painting and a night like a novel ♫

283
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,340
Are you drunk?

284
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,132
What are you doing?

285
00:23:32,132 --> 00:23:34,150
I'm not drunk.

286
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,316
Are you…

287
00:23:36,316 --> 00:23:38,880
trying to get me to see you as more than a friend?

288
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:43,850
You know what's up with Taesung, don't you?

289
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,860
He told me not to tell you.

290
00:23:48,424 --> 00:23:50,617
Don't be like that if it's because of me.

291
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:53,931
Right now,

292
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:56,380
Taesung's feelings

293
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,991
are the most important to me right now.

294
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:01,511
However,

295
00:24:01,511 --> 00:24:03,519
I don't want the love between the two of you

296
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,510
to wither away in the face of people's prejudices.

297
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,295
What?

298
00:24:08,295 --> 00:24:10,180
Why are you only telling me that now?

299
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,420
♫ to your blue heart ♫

300
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,120
Ma'am.

301
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,610
♫ I'll write blue poetry ♫

302
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,190
Haebom…

303
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:24,610
♫ that resemble your transparent eyes ♫

304
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:27,500
♫ My whole world is filled with you ♫
