Then, would that bastard consider you a friend?

169
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,854
Answer me, you asshole!

170
00:14:59,854 --> 00:15:01,000
Come on.

171
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,746
Enough with those questions.

172
00:15:02,746 --> 00:15:07,156
But you've never talked to him all this time.

173
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,942
Would Haebom call you a friend, too?

174
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:16,542
Of course.

175
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,890
Why are you always so curious?

176
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,142
Hey!

177
00:15:20,142 --> 00:15:22,667
I'm your best friend, so, of course, I'm curious.

178
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,358
Do you think I'd care if we weren't close?

179
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:28,942
This is between me and Haebom.

180
00:15:28,942 --> 00:15:31,520
So just leave it. Okay?

181
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:34,601
But…

182
00:15:36,223 --> 00:15:38,103
Is it wrong to care?

183
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,108
When did they even become friends?

184
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:43,342
What's got you upset?

185
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:46,300
He's not hanging out with us these days.

186
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,753
It's because of Haebom.

187
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,875
No wonder.

188
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:55,190
Hey! Don't you care at all?

189
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:00,234
Are you mad that he didn't mention it or are you mad that you lost him?

190
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:02,481
Neither, both, whatever!

191
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:04,228
There, there…

192
00:16:04,228 --> 00:16:05,783
Let's go.

193
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,614
I left my English book at home.

194
00:16:18,614 --> 00:16:22,023
Friends can borrow each other's textbooks, can't they?

195
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,270
So, this girl Andy, what kind of girl is she?

196
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,500
"I met some girl."

197
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,015
What kind of girl she is...

198
00:16:50,015 --> 00:16:54,567
You can think of it as modifying the noun that precedes it.

199
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:57,550
Let's finish here for today.

200
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,166
I really hate English.

201
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,773

May I ask you a favor?

204
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:22,340
Can I borrow your English book?

205
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:25,343
I was expecting something else.

206
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:26,987
Okay.

207
00:17:26,987 --> 00:17:28,795

- Taesung! 
 - Stop it!

- You fucking son of a bitch. 
 - What are you doing?

- Hey! 
 - What's up?

 - Stop, leave him alone.

Somewhere far, far away.

Nope.

No. I don't want to.
