165
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,156
I…

166

I...

167
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,208
I don't like you.

168
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:17,270
Don't lie!

169

Taesung.

171

Cho Taesung! Let go of him this instant!

172
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,398
I tried to force him.

173
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:42,543
I care about him so much. I didn't mean to do that to him.

174
00:18:50,493 --> 00:18:52,610
Is Haebom still in bed?

175
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,920
Make sure he eats something. I have a meeting, so I'm leaving early.

176
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,690
Enjoy!

177
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:13,137
Haebom!

178
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:18,846
I'm coming in.

179
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,542
Haebom!

180
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,363
Haebom!

181
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:32,983
Hey, where are you? Why aren't you at school?

182
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,936
Haebom is sick.

183
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,314
Haebom.

184
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,416
About what I did yesterday…

185
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,324
I'll apologize.

186

I'm sorry.

187
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,347
Why do you like me?

188
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:39,338
I don't have a particular reason.

189
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:43,127
I like you because you're you.

190
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:57,154
You were the first friend I made when I was lonely.

191
00:21:58,314 --> 00:22:03,624
I've liked you for a long time.

I wanted to be nice to you.

When you were having a hard time,

194

I wanted to help.

Out of sympathy?

It's not like that!

is making you suffer like this,

I'm sorry.

201
00:22:50,797 --> 00:22:52,940
You have nothing to apologize for.

202

What's up with those two?

Tell me about it.

00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:46,600
They've been eating separately and coming to school separately, too.

Okay.

207
00:23:56,633 --> 00:24:00,010
Taesung, did you have a fight with Haebom?

208
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,482
You fought, right?

209
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:06,118
- It's not like that. 
 - You have! They fought.
