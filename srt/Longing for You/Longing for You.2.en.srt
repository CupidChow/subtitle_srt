You met him at the restaurant earlier.

Why are you calling him at this hour?

It's likely that this murder case is the doing of an outsider.

That's classified information related to the investigation.

60

All right. Let's continue the meeting.

149
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,920
Let's first discuss the third murder that took place in Woojin.

150
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,740
We're in the process of checking out external vehicles that entered Woojin.

151
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,970
How are you so sure that the culprit is an outsider?

152
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,380
There have been eight criminal cases in Woojin in the past thirty years.

153
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,780
Those were on the level of burglary, assault, arson, and gang fights.

154
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,630
There hasn't been a single murder case in Woojin in the last thirty years.

155
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,230
Plus, the logical conclusion is that

156
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,590
a bizarre case like this is statistically impossible.

157
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,300
I agree with Detective Oh on this.

158
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,780
I know my hometown well.

00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,720
So, Prosecutor Go, you remain that Bae Min Gyu is the prime suspect?

160
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,990
Of course.

161

Here.

163
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,540
There's a luxury vacation villa near the crime scene in Woojin.

164
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:36,840
That villa is owned by Assemblyman Bae Tae Ook, Bae Min Gyu's father.

Yeah. I heard he's Go Young Joo's friend.

329
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,330
Yeah, maybe it's due to the regional culture of the town,

330
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,200
- but they somehow are similar.
- Aigoo...

331
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,180
He must have a temper.

332
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,220
That's Young Joo's selling point.

333
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,980
Is it?

334
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,630
Anyway, I hope the country detective doesn't interfere with the investigation.

335
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,510
- Surprisingly, he seems competent.
- Oh, yeah?

336
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,190
Sunbae.

337
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,580
Yeah, Young Joo. What's up?

338
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,960
Detective Oh.

339
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,350
You went too far.

340
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,510
If the lawyer sues us for unlawful arrest,

341
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,050
the investigation is over.

342
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:46,980
So it's okay for him to go back on his alibi in front of a detective?

343
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,420
Plus, he's a suspect in the murder!

344
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,370
I thought I made it clear.

345
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,040
No cursing is allowed here.

346
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,050
Gosh, nothing's allowed around here.

347
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:01,050
What does a prosecutor who's never caught a thief with his own hands know about investigations?

348
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:01,910
Detective Oh.

349
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:05,210
Who'll take responsibility once we lose everything after following the damn procedure?

350

Oh, by the way, Detective Oh.

365
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,810
You said Woojin hasn't seen a murder case in 50 years.

366
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:13,020
- And?
- Then...

367
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,530
wouldn't that mean this is your first murder case?

368
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,840
It's true I've never caught a thief on the scene.

369
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,480
But I don't think that means you can look down on my investigation methods.

Don't come at me for a silly joke I made.

373
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,720
I was kidding.

374

It's not funny.

Why do you think I've only been at the Woojin Police Station?

377
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,900
I started in violent crimes at a war zone port town infested with gangs.

378

you saw them but haven't caught them?

382
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,930
Whether it's a header or a penalty kick,

383

it's all a goal.

384

This vehicle was spotted in Woojin on the day of the murder.

385

You must've been in Woojin on the day of the incident.

I guess my car was there, yes.

But I was in Seoul.

388
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,940
The car drove itself to Woojin?

389
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,600
Prosecutor Go, I have many cars.

390

- Mr. Oh Jin Woo?
- Yes.

Can I see your knife?

Let's say Lee Eun Byul is telling the truth, and the sashimi knife that was gifted got stolen.

You could buy the same one and commit the crime twice, thrice.

The issue is,

Gosh. It was a premeditated crime. They must have used cash.

I can't.

Suspect Oh Jin Woo admitted that he visited

00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,630
the gallery where the first murder occurred. Of course...

534
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:21,540
his alibi at the time of the crime was not at all proven.

535

On the day of the second murder, he went to the cafe where the victim was killed.

536
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:29,910
He lives out of town, yet happened to be in Seoul that day.

The third murder also happened in the town Oh Jin Woo lives in.

At this point, doesn't it feel too contrived to say they were coincidences?

They switched you out from the main prosecutor role

I'm sorry.

I told you he has a hard time controlling his emotions.

621
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,150
How did someone like that pass the police temperament test?

622
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,290
Does he know someone high up?

623

Look at the situation at hand and the facts.

628
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:22,250
Okay. I understand it looks suspicious. I get it.

629
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:26,500
Well, but I've known Jin Woo since he was young.

630
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,590
Jin Woo is a really sweet kid.

631
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,790
That doesn't mean he's not a killer.

632
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,940
Of course.

633
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,230
But this case is a carefully premeditated series of murders.

634
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,620
So?

635
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,520
Think about the murder weapon.

636
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,600
If he wasn't deliberately trying to get caught,

637
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,840
why did Jin Woo use his beloved knife for the crime?

638
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,060
Was he trying to advertise, "I'm the perp"?

639
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,250
Jin Woo is smart.

640
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,420
He could have used reverse psychology to his advantage.

641
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,230
Like you said, he's a smart kid.

642
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,330
Jin Woo...

643
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:02,300
can't even kill an ant.

644
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,840
That's my experience of knowing Jin Woo.

645
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,910
Whether Oh Jin Woo is deemed guilty or freed,

646
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,190
the facts will determine that.

647
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,330
Oh Jin Sang.

648
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,460
Calm down, please.

649
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,630
No thanks.

650
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,490
I'll bring the evidence to put Bae Min Gyu behind bars.

651
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,360
Get a warrant ready for that asshole.

652
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,340
Oh Jin Sang!

653
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,070
Yes?

654
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,600
Hyung!

655
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,070
What happened?

656
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,510
There was a small scene, but it's no big deal.

657
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:45,910
And Assemblyman Bae's son is no longer a suspect.

658
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:49,550
It's been awkward with Assemblyman Bae, thank goodness.

659
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:52,680
So, how about the other suspect?

660
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,400
It will be handled soon.

661
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,680
I worked hard to raise him.

662
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,160
I really need to get his hands off of murder cases now.

663
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:08,990
[National Forensic Service]

664
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:13,860
Run the weapon simulation again with this knife.

665
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,980
We already sent over the results last time.

666
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,110
Why are you doing it again?

667
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,930
We need to look into something additionally.

668
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:23,160
I see. Sure.

669
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,390
Crazy bastard.

670
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,870
Excuse me?

671
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,450
Oh, no.

672
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:32,060
- Please get started.
- All right.

673
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,130
How dare you suspect my Jin Woo?

674
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,230
Excuse me, Hyung.

675
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,190
My older brother, I mean.

676
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,090
He has a hot temper.

677
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:02,890
Please try to understand.

678
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:06,240
You have an amazing brother.

679
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,080
If I were him, I would have done the same thing.

680
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,010
That's what brothers do.

681
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,840
If I don't understand Detective Oh,

682
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,820
do you think it's because I don't have any siblings?

683
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,710
Prosecutor...

684
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,450
I think you are a good person.

685
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,920
All right.

686
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,830
Mr. Oh Jin Woo, on the day of the first murder last May,

687
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,050
you said you went to a gallery exhibit, correct?

688
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,510
Yes. I did.

689
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,560
How about the cafe where the second murder occurred?

690
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,150
That was the last day of an exhibit by an artist I like.

691
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,650
After I checked out the exhibit,

692
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,900
I stopped by a cafe near where I was staying.

693
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,650
That was when someone died inside that cafe.

694
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,180
Can't you check the CCTVs and see?

695
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:54,880
Coincidentally, the CCTVs of the motel and the cafe

696
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,280
were not in service.

697
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:02,310
You said you purchased the Japanese sashimi knife from someone you met on an internet forum.

698
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,200
Did you meet them in person?

699
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,680
No.

700
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,030
I bought it online.

701
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,700
When was that?

702
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:12,760
- I think around May.
- Do you know the exact dates?

703
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,880
I don't really...

704
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:21,540
I bought it from someone with the username "lemontree."

705
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,780
If you look at the transaction, you'll see the dates.

706
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,750
"Lemontree" also told me about the exhibit.

707
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:30,910
I went to the cafe because they asked to meet there.

708
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:35,030
- Lemontree?
- Yes.

709
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:36,910
I met them in the chats.

710
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,180
I've never seen their face.

711
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,330
<i>And that day,</i>

712
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,790
<i>they never showed up.</i>

713
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,250
Young Joo!

714
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,980
Aigoo, what in the world is going on?

715
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:05,010
Which way do I go?

716
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,090
Where? Where?

717
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:07,460
- That way?
- This way?

718
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,060
Aigoo! They're saying Jin Woo is a murder suspect? No way!

719
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:15,700
As you see, the chats match up with Oh Jin Woo's testimony.

720
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,000
[I think you priced the knife too low. And you're selling it on a photo forum. Maybe you don't know much about knives?]

721
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,380
I sent officers to the internet cafe where lemontree's IP was tracked.

722
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,670
The dates for the wire transfer to purchase the knife...

723
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,840
I'll be able to find out when the bank opens.

724
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,320
Got it.

725
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:33,430
Okay, everyone...

726
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:49,300
That night, Ms. Hong, Jin Woo, and I

727
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,930
played Go-stop.

728
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:53,100
From what time were you together?

729
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,110
Well, I went to the restaurant around 7 p.m.

730
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:00,700
I think we played until 1 a.m.

731
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:04,730
When you were playing cards in the room that night,

732
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:08,230
could you sketch the seating spots where each of you was sitting?

733
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,650
This was me.

734
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:14,700
This was Jin Woo.

735
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,940
I go over to this house often,

736
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,990
so I know it well.

737
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:24,150
Their sofa is really nice.

738
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:27,780
Here, this is it.

739
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:34,040
(Identical)

740
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:40,390
Did I do it wrong?

741
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:46,490
Did Oh Jin Woo ever leave during the game?

742
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:47,920
Yes.

743
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:52,060
He said he was hungry and went to make mixed noodles.

744
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,180
He left for a bit.

745
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,500
How long was he gone?

746
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,500
Well... I think...

747
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,440
I don't really remember.

748
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:09,160
You had a late-night snack the night the high schooler died?

749
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,370
Yes. I made some mixed noodles.

750
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:16,730
Did you use that as an excuse to leave the restaurant?

751
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,160
Nagari! Darn.

752
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,580
- Let's go again.
- It's hard to get nagari unless you're very good.

753
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:34,080
Doc, aren't you guys hungry?

754
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,860
I guess I am a bit peckish.

755
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,120
Should I go make mixed noodles?

756
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,780
- Yes, please!
- Yes, please!

757
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,860
- Be right back.
- Jinx.

758
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:46,090
Should we go again?

759
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,800
[Hae Ju]
<i>Oppa, come to the pavilion quick. I need to talk to you tonight.</i>

760
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:10,740
[Mom]

761
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,750
Yeah, Mom.

762
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,470
<i>Hey! Did you get lost making noodles?</i>

763
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,830
<i>Hurry on back!</i>

764
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:19,070
<i>- We're starving!</i>
- Okay.

765
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,250
Got it.

766
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,350
[Hae Ju]

767
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,630
I'm telling the truth.

768
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:44,800
If I don't bring Mom food on time, she gets really mad.

769
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:50,340
He went out to make mixed noodles and didn't come back.

770
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,560
So I called him.

771
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,940
Maybe 20 minutes after I called...

772
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:01,420
He came back with mixed noodles pretty quickly.

773
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,010
See me for a sec.

774
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:23,450
Dr. Chu isn't family.

775
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:26,500
The alibi was cross-checked, right?

776
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,410
Let Jin Woo go, Sunbae.

777
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:31,980
He left for a while to make noodles, no?

778
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,360
Fine, let's say he left.

779
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,070
Thirty minutes? No...

780
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:39,980
let's make it generous and just say an hour.

781
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:42,460
It takes at least 10 minutes from the house to the crime scene.

782
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,150
Minus the travel time,

783
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:47,010
could he have committed murder, hung up the corpse to display,

784
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:49,440
and make noodles on top of that? Is he Superman?

785
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,540
No one has a perfect memory.

786
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,270
Maybe Oh Jin Woo left for longer than they thought.

787
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,950
Sunbae!

788
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:58,750
Jin Woo is not a flight risk.

789
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:01,170
Oh Jin Sang and I can prove his identity.

790
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:04,450
You're not justified in putting him in custody.

791
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:06,830
If you really need to, you can always call him back. So stop!

792
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:08,560
Hey.

793
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,640
I get it about Oh Jin Sang.

794
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,620
Why are you doing this?

795
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,300
Jin Woo...

796
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:19,160
- is my family.
- Go Young Joo!

797
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,570
I thought your strength was to be fair without exception.

798
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:25,490
Oh Jin Woo has an alibi for the third murder, but he's still a strong suspect.

799
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:29,040
Stop trying to convince me using your feelings. It won't work.

800
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,880
You might be leading the investigative team,

801
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,820
but I'm also a prosecutor on this case.

802
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:43,570
I think it's a stretch to put Oh Jin Woo into custody.

803
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:47,370
If you don't release him, I'll apply for the warrant to be examined.

804
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,190
How could they do this to him...

805
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,500
Aigoo, Young Joo, Young Joo!

806
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,850
Jin Woo will be free to go soon, right?

807
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:00,740
