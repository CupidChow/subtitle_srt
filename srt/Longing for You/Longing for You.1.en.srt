I would have one drink when it rained.

And two drinks when I saw lightning.

102
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,730
And three drinks when I saw a huge thunderstorm. That's what happened.

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,630
If I die, I die. There is no way I am going to jail!

162
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,810
If you come after me, you know what'll happen to this woman!

163
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,450
Put that knife down while I'm still asking nicely.

164
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,110
- I warned you.
- Don't come!

165
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,150
Don't come near me, you scum!

166
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,580
Let go.

167
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,960
I warned you!

168
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,970
- Are you okay?
- I almost died just now.

169
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,380
My... my neck... the knife...

170
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,690
That moron!

171
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,200
You now come to gambling houses after all that?

172
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,400
Huh?

173
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,950
You're shameless and don't know your place! I'm going nuts!

174
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,730
- This is crazy!
- Detective Oh!

175
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,900
- You!
- Detective Oh!

176
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,500
Yes... yes... you're okay...

177
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,320
Stay still... still... Just a little bit longer...

178
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,620
Don't exaggerate, man!

179
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,970
Detective Oh.

180
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,470
- What?
- Don't provoke!

181
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,720
Damn it...

182
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,140
Doctor, how is he?

183
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,130
Even in a gangster fight, there must be some type of ethical way of doing things.

184
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:52,480
So this scenario is similar to a pro martial arts athlete hitting a layperson,

185
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,410
or a heavyweight knocking out a lightweight boxer.

186
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,320
In a very cowardly manner, you know.

187
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,550
This type of violence should've been stopped from the start...

188
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,700
So what's the diagnosis?

189
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,690
Yes.

190
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,560
So this person's nasal bone...

191
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,190
His nasal septum has collapsed.

192
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,650
- He is in urgent need of a reduction surgery.
- Put it in simple terms!

193
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,950
He needs nose surgery right away.

194
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,730
Damn it!

195
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,150
Hey!

196
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,330
That bastard...

197
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,120
Hey, this is Dr. Chu's hospital.

198
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,390
Send an ambulance here.

199
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,470
I guess gangsters nowadays don't get tattoos.

200
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,550
Aigoo!

201
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,500
He's not a gangster.

202
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,410
I told you he's a gambler.

203
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,840
I see. A gambler.

204
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,310
Aigoo...

205
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,360
Moron...

206
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,500
Detective Oh, you are no help to me whatsoever.

207
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,970
Today...

208
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,790
do you even know how much money I won today?

209
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,330
I won three months of your salary, you idiot!

210
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,210
You ruined the game, so you pay up. Got it?

211
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,120
Your life was in danger, yet money is still the first thing on your mind?

212
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,270
So, what are you so proud of?

213
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,190
Your mother had a knife to her throat,

214
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,820
but you don't care if I die or not, huh?

215
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,240
All you care about is catching the criminals, right?

216
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,710
Once you raise your performance, that's it for you!

217
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,420
I should've just died right then and there!

218
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,760
Aigoo, my life is so tenacious!

219
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,840
They are a nationally-wanted professional gambling troupe.

220
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,710
You can go to prison for just breathing the same air as those crooked gamblers.

221
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,000
Did you want to get your protein fix by eating beans in prison?

222
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,120
- Know your facts before you come at me!
- Gosh, I didn't know!

223
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,720
We were all tricked!

224
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,740
Silence! Silence!

225
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,020
Anyone who tries to feed on others' money is all the same.

226
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,120
You're not even hungry for money, so why did you gamble?

227
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,470
I also...

228
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,900
wanted to go to a dermatologist for once...

229
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,480
- So what?
- Dermatologist?

230
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,080
Jang Mi got a year membership to the dermatologist, thanks to her talented daughter.

231
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,600
After all, a beautiful complexion is a woman's weapon.

232
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,840
Take a look at this with your own eyes.

233
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,180
H-Here. How can I compete against Jang Mi with these dark spots and blemishes?

234
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,940
So, you decided to gamble just so you could go to a dermatologist?

235
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,760
- Geez...
- How about you?

236
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,130
You beat people up while working your detective duty!

237
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,520
- What?
- Am I wrong?

238
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,360
Are you going to beat me up too?

239
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,570
Geez!

240
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,710
Aigoo...

241
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,250
You're screwed.

242
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,030
Here, take this.

243
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,990
[Complaint]

244
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,570
The treatment cost alone is 10 million won.

245
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,990
And also legally...

246
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,190
you were apprehended while committing the crime of assault.

247
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,640
You know you have to go behind bars for now, right?

248
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,140
- Aigoo...
- Geez, that bastard...

249
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,530
[Ms. Lee]

250
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,350
Looks like you've gained a bit of weight.

251
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,970
You must have gained your appetite since your wife's death.

252
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,310
You wish I were the culprit, don't you?

253
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,430
But you don't have any evidence...

254
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,590
- You know this guy, right?
- I don't have a clue...

255
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,130
It's your dead wife's lover.

256
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,570
I heard you slapped him in the face too.

257
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,340
Now I remember...

258
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,820
I did hit him once.

259
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,130
But he was a lot weaker than expected.

260
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,130
Your wife was a servant to you, right?

261
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,700
But she didn't serve the part and went off to get with another guy,

262
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,920
I bet you wanted to kill her so much.

263
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,280
You got sick and tired of hitting her with a golf club.

264
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,060
Is that why you killed her?

265
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,070
Prosecutor Yang Hee Joo, you must have majored in creative writing.

266
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,830
You really don't seem to suit the role of a prosecutor.

267
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,710
Why don't you consider changing your career?

268
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,860
Should I find a great place for you?

269
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,220
You're really sexy too...

270
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,480
What?

271
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,790
You are one crazy asshole!

272
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,640
Assholes like you need to be whacked to their senses.

273
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,630
Let's get you a good beating!

274
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,560
You dare to laugh? Make sure to hide your teeth.

275
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,130
You want to die?

276
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,680
Hey, let go of me!

277
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,650
Geez!

278
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,920
Mr. Bae Min Gyu, you have sexual dysfunction, right?

279
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,890
Come again?

280
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,300
Don't mind if you don't.

281
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,970
Statistically speaking, the majority of men with such dysfunctions flaunt their words.

282
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,320
- Who do you think you are?
- Me?

283
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,410
I'm helping with the case of Assemblyman Bae Tae Ook's son, Bae Min Gyu's murder of his wife.

284
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,600
I'm Prosecutor...

285
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,330
Go Young Joo.

286
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,010
Ms. Prosecutor Go Young Joo...

287
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,430
So what?

288
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,600
What incident?

289
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,270
Assemblyman Bae Tae Ook's son

290
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,180
Bae Min Gyu's murder case of his wife.

291
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,980
South Korea's prosecution system and media always

292
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,060
care more for the offender's rights than they do the victim's.

293
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,850
But I really don't like that.

294
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:24,720
Just know that's how our incident will be headlined in the news later.

295
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,820
I think you're relying on your Assemblyman father to get out of this.

296
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,940
I won't tolerate that.

297
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,810
But you do know that I have a perfect alibi, right?

298
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:38,050
- "Ms." Prosecutor Go Young Joo.
- Of course, I know.

299
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:42,100
You were at a club in Gangnam from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.

300
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,330
Exactly...

301
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,850
How many times do I have to tell you how much fun I was having?

302
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,690
Okay.

303
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,770
You definitely entered at 9 p.m. and left at 1 a.m.

304
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,300
But there is no evidence that you were at the club for four hours.

305
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,330
What about it?

306
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,760
I heard there's a secret back door accessible to VIP members of the club.

307
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,870
Without any CCTVs.

308
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,400
Back door? Was there a door like that?

309
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,400
- I didn't know.
- Of course, you didn't know.

310
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,520
About Lee Eun Byul...

311
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,910
She went abroad right after giving an alibi and still haven't returned.

312
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,440
As if she ran away.

313
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,620
She's an actress. She must have a busy schedule.

314
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,420
Of course, she must be busy.

315
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,640
But she returned to Korea this morning after finishing her busy schedule.

316
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,100
We brought her in to welcome her with a cup of morning coffee.

317
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,390
It's been a while since you've seen each other, right?

318
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,780
I wonder if you two had time to sync your words.

319
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,750
You were at the club for four hours from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.

320
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,870
How come you never went up to the stage?

321
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,010
You said you went to dance.

322
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,120
I told you I was just hanging out in the room.

323
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,900
Haven't you ever been to a club before?

324
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,870
Wait, no...

325
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,890
I guess you couldn't have gone...

326
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,480
Mr. Detective, people dance and have fun in the rooms too.

327
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,860
Because you can hear the music from there too.

328
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,850
Well, I get that you two went together.

329
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:11,350
But there is no evidence that Bae Min Gyu didn't leave the scene.

330
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,860
I heard you didn't call the waiters either to keep privacy?

331
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,740
Yes, that's what we did.

332
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,160
Gosh, why don't you believe me?

333
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,090
Ms. Lee Eun Byul, you are Bae Min Gyu's lover.

334
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,090
So, you have a special relationship.

335
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:27,960
We need some kind of evidence for us to believe that you two were together the whole time.

336
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,580
Geez, I am going to go nuts.

Give me one second.

This is a video Min Gyu oppa took of me that day.

You can check the time the video was taken.

This is enough, right?

I guess things didn't work out the way you planned.

You said you were Prosecutor Go Young Joo, right?

344
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,950
Wow. Looking at how proud you are to be a prosecutor,

345
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,540
you must have a high prosecution and winning rate.

346
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,750
- You know how to take a hint.
- But...

347
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:27,090
your method only works on those mediocre people.

348

It doesn't fly for people like me.

Hey, long time no see.

350
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,400
I thought cops stayed out once the case went to the prosecution.

351
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,900
Maybe you continue to play a lackey for our pretty prosecutor.

352
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,900
What?

353
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:54,640
I have a clear alibi, so stop calling me in.

354
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,620
Just catch the culprit now!

355
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,200
Okay. We shall do that.

356
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,390
But Mr. Bae Min Gyu,

357
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,220
the video doesn't show your face filming, so there's no proof.

358
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,870
Geez. Prosecutor Go.

359
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,350
You're a persistent one. Beautiful.

360
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,240
I tend to be that way.

361
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,770
So I guess you can return home today.

362
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,590
You're a bit scary, you know.

363
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,130
Ms. Prosecutor Go Young Joo.

364

That bastard...

365
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,540
You said Bae Min Gyu was definitely the culprit! What are you going to do now?

366
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,000
I'll be off of this case. You do as you please, Sunbae.

367
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,330
Hey, Yang Hee Joo. You know this is foul play.

368
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,640
This is originally your case. If you started it, you should finish it.

369
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,630
No, I don't!

370
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,290
I get goosebumps just from hearing the name Bae Min Gyu!

371
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,350
I get so annoyed, scared, and I feel disgusted!

372
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,220
Sunbae, you take care of the rest.

373

You're talented. Good luck, Go Young Joo!

[707 Video Recording Room]
We'll continue with it.

377
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,330
Bae Min Gyu raised his hands at his wife any chance he had, right?

378
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,100
On top of that, she had an affair, so there's plenty of motive for the killing.

379
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,680
Which is why you two prosecutors have a feeling he's the culprit.

380
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,770
- But-
- Sunbae...

381
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,680
Why are you so interested in our case?

382
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,080
Because Yang Hee Joo is being dragged around in this case.

383
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,200
And Lee Eun Byul submitted a new alibi for Bae Min Gyu today, right?

384
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,000
At this rate, this case may go unsolved even though you've been added as a relief pitcher.

385
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,330
Go Young Joo's pride wouldn't let a case go unsolved.

386
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,030
Thank you so very much.

387
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:51,750
But why do I keep feeling like you are interfering in this case?

388
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,980
It's cause you're really stressed.

389
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,350
That might be it.

390
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:00,280
The culprit injected anesthetics and severed the Achilles tendon before the murder,

391
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,210
then extracted the blood from the body,

392
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,520
and hung the dead body like a piece of laundry.

393
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,420
The anesthetic used was Ketamine.

394
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,190
It's a drug used for direct sleep therapy.

395
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:15,410
We're trying to compare and contrast it with Bae Min Gyu's medication,

396
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,600
but a warrant isn't being issued, no matter what.

397
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,790
Do you think this is unrelated to the fact that his father is an assemblyman?

398
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,610
Once a warrant is denied, there's a high chance it will happen again.

399
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,750
How about finding another breakthrough instead of clinging to a warrant?

What do you mean?

401
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,240
Every year, there are more than ten cold cases a year just in Seoul.

402
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,120
It might be much faster to find a similar crime among cold cases.

403
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,940
Since Bae Min Gyu is a violent husband,

404
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,940
- you might hold prejudice that it lead to murdering...
- Sunbae...

Are you saying I'm investigating this with prejudice?

That's not what I mean.

00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,700
That's right.

479
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,270
Since we are both here, I will go ahead and be straightforward.

480
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,870
Why are the prosecutors all suspecting my son?

481
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:54,010
The newly added prosecutor summoned my son again.

482
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,970
Change the prosecutor

483
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,080
or have higher-ups take action.

484
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,590
If anyone summons Min Gyu one more time,

485
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:04,470
I won't just sit back and watch!

486
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,490
Prosecutors can summon anyone if necessary.

487
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:12,150
It's the obligations and rights guaranteed by the law.

488
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,170
You don't need to get involved in this problem, Assemblyman.

489
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:23,000
- What did you say?
- Assemblyman, please calm down.

490
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,650
- Am I all right to take off now?
- Yes, of course.

491
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,250
All right, then.

492
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,110
Hey! That... that man...

493
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,820
Why is he so stiff?

494
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,430
Please take a seat.

495
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,260
Geez...

496
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:45,050
If you had waited in the VIP room, we would have reserved a proper meeting.

497
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,760
- Why are you in such a rush?
- Chairman Cha!

498
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,340
It's my own son I am talking about. Of course, I'll do everything I can.

499
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,470
You should be a lot more careful because it concerns your son.

500
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:59,540
And there is no further help we can provide in regard to your son's situation.

501
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,510
Wait, Dr. Yoo...

502
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:06,040
Assemblyman Bae, your son is already proven innocent,

503
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,340
so what problem can there be? It should soon be over, I'm sure.

504
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,660
Well... that is true...

505
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,390
[Woojin Police Station]
Look at this crappy food here.

506
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,080
Are we some traitors who sold off the country?

507
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,350
You wouldn't even feed dogs or pigs this crap.

508
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,050
Aigoo, geez...

509
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,710
Then what are we since we're eating this?

510
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,640
- Are we traitors, then?
- Hey, hey, Detective Lee.

511
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,890
Order something else. This is just wrong.

512
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:42,260
Mr. Wang Spicy Tangsuyook. 781-0012.

513
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,100
Mr. Wang's meat has been tough lately.

514
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,030
Really?

515
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,100
Then maybe... Braised spicy seafood?

516
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,350
Fisherman's Restaurant?

517
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,110
Their food is salty. You shouldn't eat salty food, Mom.

518
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,790
Then, how about...

519
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,440
Fresh tofu soup?

520
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,840
- How about octopus duruchigi?
- That's perfect!

521
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,100
Hey, Detective Lee! Hurry up and order two octopus duruchigi from Dolsum Restaurant!

522
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,080
Make it spicy with hot peppers!

523
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,310
Sunbaenim, please knock it off!

524
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:06,110
If you keep this up, I'll bring rice from the cafeteria!

525
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,850
Hey, you know how I am. You're really going to do this?

526
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,510
- You're making me really sad!
- Quiet!

527
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,590
Detective Oh, are you complaining about food even behind bars?

528
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,880
Geez...

529
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,500
Ma'am, step out.

530
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,440
What?

531
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,930
Am I free now?

532
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,630
It was a minor participation, so you're leaving only with a warning.

533
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,570
Oh, my goodness!

534
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,520
Thank you so much!

535
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,460
My oldest son, I'll get going first.

536
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,170
Hang in there a bit longer, okay?

537
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,510
Aigoo, I'm sorry.

538
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,960
This is your first meal since leaving jail.

539
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,110
It's my greatest regret that you are my son.

540
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,990
Please reincarnate as my husband in your next life.

541
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,620
Gosh, Mom.

542
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,540
- Go ahead and eat up.
- Okay.

543
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,450
Aigoo, my goodness...

544
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,760
Oh, my gosh!

545
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,600
Unni!

546
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,350
I brought you some organic tofu. Have some.

547
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,920
Hey, you think I would want to eat that?

548
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,490
Look at all this food my son made me.

549
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,040
Wow.

550
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,310
Some would think you won a gold medal.

551
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,180
Aren't you embarrassed in front of Jin Woo?

552
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,090
What the heck. Why should I be?

553
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,840
Please stop. Eat up.

554
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,960
You're the best, Jin Woo.

555
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,600
But what's going to happen to Jin Sang?

556
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,080
Will he be fired and go to jail?

557
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,080
It's his life. He'll figure it out.

558
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,220
It's not like he's a thug. He lives off of tax money.

559
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,320
How could he be so reckless and violent?

560
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,530
The rumor is going around in the neighborhood

561
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,890
saying your family will have one criminal after another.

562
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,650
Hey, are you here to add fuel to the fire?

563
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:04,040
Should I put in a call to Prosecutor Go Young Joo of the Central District Prosecutors' Office and ask for a favor?

564
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,390
Don't bother.

565
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,210
I'd rather die than

566
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:10,630
get help from you who took off her panty* at 17.
(Lose her virginity)

567
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,850
What? Is that all you've got to say?

568
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:18,170
Did you ever see with your own two eyes if I took off or put on my panty at 17?

569
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:22,300
Gosh, then, did you take it off at 16?

570
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,860
Today, I am most definitely going to rip your mouth off!

571
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,830
Let go of me! How dare you!

572
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,000
- Let go!
- Please!

573
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,870
- Stop this!
- I'll rip your mouth off!

574
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,090
You were the one who started it!

575
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,450
- Who do you think you are!
- Stop this!

576
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,690
- How dare you!
- Sir!

577
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,240
Hold on.

578
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,720
Gosh. Why are sophisticated ladies like you two fighting like this?

579
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,940
It's nothing. There was just a little misunderstanding.

580
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,990
- Right, Unni?
- Oh, of course.

581
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,060
We get along very well.

582
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,720
Dr. Chu, what should I prepare for your meal?

583
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,610
Unni, do you have the ingredients for the spicy seafood stew that Dr. Chu likes?

584
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,710
Of course, I do.

585
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,100
Jin Woo, what are you waiting for?

586
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,540
Hurry up and make some spicy seafood stew.

587
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,660
Okay, I'm on it now.

588
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,230
Please take a seat.

589
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,120
- Shall I?
- Kill it, kill it, kill it.

590
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,900
So strong.

591
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:17,080
Kill it. There you go.

592
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,110
Kill them off.

593
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,220
- Detective Oh.
- It hasn't even been 30 minutes.

594
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,880
- Let me play a little longer.
- Come out.

595
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,560
It hasn't been 48 hours yet.

596
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,710
They dropped the complaint.

597
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:33,250
- Who did?
- Obviously, the one who filed the complaint.

598
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,940
How much did they settle for?

599
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,480
Ten million won.

600
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:44,930
Hey, what do they gain by getting in the way of a detective's future?

601
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,020
They want to close the case by taking the settlement money.

602
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,420
These sons of bitches...

603
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:53,230
Hey, hey, hey. Careful, we don't have enough people on the force.

604
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,760
That punk.

605
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,450
Stop right there.

606
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,460
Buk Goo.

607
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,560
Chul Min.

608
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,960
Move.

609
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,510
Look at you move.

610
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,760
Look at you move!

611
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,050
You're totally fine, you bastard.

612
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,740
Okay. I am a bit sorry to your noses for throwing the punches first.

613
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,880
But you guys deserved to get beat up.

614
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,660
With that said, settlement money?

615
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,700
I can't give it to you.

616
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,660
We've already received the money, and it's been signed.

617
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,310
I know, but...

618
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,250
Throw it back up.

619
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,400
What?

620
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:50,710
<i>There, there. Let's calm down.</i>

621
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:53,430
According to Criminal Code Chapter 30 Article 284,

622
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:57,260
if one shows excessive force to a group or carries a dangerous weapon,

623
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,950
you can be subdued to confinement for less than 7 years or

624
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,340
due a 10 million won fine.

625
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,240
And this...

626
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,500
is a complaint.

627
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,570
I can also settle for you guys.

628
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,120
Or not.

629
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,640
Hyung...

630
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,420
I told you to stay out of my business.

631
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,000
Do I sound like a joke to you?

632
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,840
How dare you throw around money like that? Are you that rich?

633
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,170
So, how much longer will you pick up after me?

634
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,400
Are you a sucker?

635
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,940
You're like that. That's why you live like this, you punk!

636
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,530
Hyung...

637
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:46,390
Are you Buddha's cousin, or do you run a charity?

638
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:49,590
Just say you're sick and tired of Mom and me.

639
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,380
Ask to send you to college, buy you a car, and send you abroad, like others do.

640
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,300
At least try throwing a tantrum!

641
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,320
Or just burn this whole house down!

642
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,950
If you ever overstep one more time,

643
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:06,440
you're dead meat.

644
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,460
Put it back.

645
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,220
Hurry!

646
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,180
If you were me,

647
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:23,010
you would've done the same.

648
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,140
Oh, gosh...

649
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,540
What is all this?

650
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,690
Don't do it.

651
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,750
Don't you even dare touch it.

652
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,680
I said stop!

653
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:45,080
You crazy bastard. Then you clean it up!

654
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,620
You do it, Mom!

655
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,720
Why do you make Jin Woo do everything every day?

656
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,640
In this family, is the oldest the only son, and Jin Woo just a servant?

657
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,930
Have you been properly paying Jin Woo for working at the restaurant?

658
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:58,710
You've treated him unfairly since we were young, saying how you wouldn't send him to college.

659
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,300
So he received a zero on his test on purpose.

660
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,990
Do you even know how good he was with his studies?

661
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,940
If you discriminate between Jin Woo and me starting today,

662
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,660
everyone's dead meat.

663
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,780
But the oldest son will always be the oldest.

664
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,070
Oldest son?

665
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,200
Give me a break.

666
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,370
I won't hold a memorial service for you when you die.

667
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:21,820
I don't have the courage or the ability to fulfill the role of the oldest son!

668
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:25,400
So let's see what will happen if you dare to say the oldest son again!

669
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,170
That bastard... that...

670
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,690
My goodness!

671
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,330
He's gone crazy.

672
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,050
Aigoo.

673
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:49,900
My Jin Woo, you must've had some money you had saved up.

674
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,760
You saved your hyung.

675
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,410
Jin Sang, that punk, he's only doing that because he's embarrassed.

676
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,890
He's probably very thankful for what you did.

677
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,070
Mom...

678
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,920
I'm going to Seoul in a bit, so I'll be taking your car.

It's the last day of a photo exhibition I want to see.

681
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,800
I really wanted to see it.

682
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,430
But I kept putting it off.

683
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,260
- Okay.
- Sorry about that.

684
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,260
I will be back early tomorrow, so just prepare Hyung's dinner.

685
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,080
Jin Sang won't die from starving for a day.

Aigoo...

688

You love taking pictures and your hyung the most in this whole world, don't you?

00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,720
Yes, I do.

You can't even go near coffee.

712

I drink it often.

That's okay. We can wait a bit.

Yes, Detective.

- You're here.
- Yes.

723

Just like Prosecutor Go's case,

724
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,100
it's the same technique.

725
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:50,000
The dead body hung like laundry is too similar to say it's a coincidence.

726
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,670
Last May, Chungpi Gallery.

727
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,700
This is the body that was found in Wulmokdong.

728
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,420
In both cases, excessive bleeding is the cause of death.

729
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,570
Their ankles were severed by the weapon.

730
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:07,160
Also, the anesthetic Ketamine was used once again.

731
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,960
Both bodies were found hung up like laundry.

732
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,300
As if they were displaying them.

733
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:17,420
These aspects are the culprit's signature method. It's speculated to be a serial murder.

734
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,350
It becomes a bigger deal the moment it becomes a serial killer case.

735
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,610
It's dangerous to jump to conclusions.

736

We need your decision right now, Deputy Chief.

737
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:27,590
We need to tie both cases together to yield an answer.

738

- Yes.

Look at this.

781

First, severing the Achilles tendon.

00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:46,930
Second, the usage of anesthetic Ketamine.

783

Third...

784
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:50,340
The dead body hung up like laundry.

785
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:53,850
The method of murder, body disposal, and drugs used are all the same.

786
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:57,980
On top of that, the depth and width of the wounds on both bodies are identical.

787
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:01,430
There have been two cases of the same murder method in the past four months.

788

Unless South Korea turns into a nest of crazy murderers,

789
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:07,370
this doesn't make sense, probability-wise.

790
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:09,920
And to insist on Bae Min Gyu as the culprit...

791
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,350
I don't think that's right.

- Check.
- Okay.

00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,790
So you're the head, and I'm the second prosecutor?

798
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:26,100
Because I am the sunbae.

799
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,760
But I don't think that's really important.

800
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,340
You're right. It's not that important.

801
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:36,080
But I get this feeling that I'm being punished for doing the investigation wrong.

802
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,900
Of course, it must be my inferiority complex speaking.

803
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:42,100
- Hey, Go Young Joo.
- From this point on, this case is

804
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,220
Prosecutor Cha Young Woon's case.

805
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,250
Although it was short-lived, I almost wrestled with a useless suspect.

806
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:50,180
Now, I give up.

807
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:59,970
The indictment didn't seem easy...

808
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:02,020
Hello.

809
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,720
Hey, Prosecutor Go.

810
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,580
- I'll keep in touch.
- Okay, bye.

811
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:09,600
What happened? I heard Young Woon is tying the case as a serial killer case.

812
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,530
But don't you think a serial murder is taking it a little too far?

813
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,480
So what?

814
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,170
Young Woon, that guy is too adamant in his own ways.

815
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:19,250
It's because he's never failed in his attempts before.

816
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,080
And?

817
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,430
Go Young Joo.

818
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:25,300
In times like this, you should side with me,

819
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,840
and make a hit.

820
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,120
Despite that, I don't want to side with you, Reporter Park Ki Young.

821
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,160
- What can I do.
- Geez...

822
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,610
This is why you can't get very far in your career.

823
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:38,240
I guess that's part of my fate, too, then.

824
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,420
Prosecutor Go. Young Joo...

825
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,220

Please sit down.

829
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:59,640
The two recent cases will now be investigated as serial murder case.

830
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,800
They are, again, private cases, so please watch your mouths.

831

Until these cases are resolved, let's work hard together.

Hi, Prosecutor Go, what's up?

842
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,230
Good timing.

Why bother? Your mom would put them back up anyway.

I thought you were really busy with the murder case.

00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,590
But as you can see, I'm pretty free at the moment.

Jin Woo. Gosh, this is so delicious!

865
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:56,170
You can't eat anything like this in Seoul.

866
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,090
Sounds like life in Seoul is hard on you.

867

Everyone treats me well everywhere I go, saying, "Detective Oh."

869
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:04,780
It's too much pressure.

870
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:07,570
You screwed up, didn't you?

871
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,390
- Can you tell?
- Yeah.

872
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:11,400
It's really obvious.

873
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,290
Hyung, you couldn't be an actor.

874

I don't have any money.

Your mom and my mom just can't take enough money from their kids.

- I already took care of it.

Noona, we're all family here.

Hey! A brother who puts obstacles in your life isn't family but rather an enemy.

Yeah, I couldn't stand the sight of someone I know.

Why? Is someone bothering you?

Gosh, Prosecutor Cha...

891
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:15,700
He is such a know-it-all. He would claim to have created the Earth himself.

892
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,230
Does he think there are multiple Earths?

893
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:20,840
- What a crazy bastard.
- Whatever.

894

Anyway, today is for us. Cheers!

Cheers!

896
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,080
Except for the fact that they are both women,

897
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,560
the victims' occupation, age, life pattern...

898
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,450
They have nothing in common.

899
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:39,480
As you can see from the crime scenes, the assailant chose a gallery that is hard to access

900
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,610
to a cafe that is easily accessible to anyone.

901
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:44,520
You can presume he has a very bold personality.

902
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,080
What are your thoughts on signature moves?

903
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:50,400
There are no similar signatures found from the crimes in the last ten years.

904
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,100
So this is very unique.

905
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,920
From the way they hung up the bodies like laundry,

906
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,450
their extreme cruelty is blatant,

907
00:51:56,450 --> 00:52:01,280
and the sever on the ankle could be speculated as an ankle fetish.

908
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,410
Looking at how clean the cut was made,

909
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:08,540
the assailant could be a professional of hand work with a delicate touch.

910
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:11,660
Everyone saw the profiling results, right?

911
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:15,090
Was there anyone suspicious from CCTVs or witness statements?

912
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,880
According to the CCTV analysis of the area, there's nothing suspicious yet.

913
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,240
And no witnesses, either.

914
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,940
Great. We should keep looking for the suspect that fits the profiling.

915
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,520
And also, the murder weapon.

916
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,710
Can you flip to the back?

917
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:32,620
From the second victim's wound, the same salinity was found.

918
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,880
And a small amount of knife powder was also found.

919
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,680
Nihon Hagane. Therefore, it's Japanese steel.

920
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,200
The fact that they found salinity and Japanese steel...

921
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,630
What do you think this implies?

922
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:44,540
Japanese steel could mean a sashimi knife.

923
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,310
Wouldn't it be used mainly as a fish knife?

924
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:50,130
Besides regular kitchen knives or meat cutting knives,

925
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:53,140
we need to also include knives that are used to cut fish.

926
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:55,350
If they are to use a Japanese sashimi knife,

927
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:58,350
they must either be a professional or master chef.

928
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:00,630
You don't really see this in an ordinary household.

929
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:02,900
On top of that, it must be quite expensive.

930
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:07,270
Please investigate where it's usually sold and who buys them.

931
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:09,090

- Got it.

00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:28,030
I think it was just released as a short clip on YouTube.

957
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:31,510
The YouTube algorithm recommended it when I searched for a Japanese sashimi knife.

958
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,160
This is definitely Bae Min Gyu.

959
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,920
He's as good as a professional using the sashimi knife.

960
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,630
Hold on. Can you rewind a little bit?

961
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:39,880
Yes.

962
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,700
Right there.

963
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,730
Buy the same knife as that one,

964
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:47,160
and put it through a weapon prediction simulator.

965
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,630
You're suggesting we guess the murder weapon?

966
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:54,060
Once we get the results, let's request a search warrant and bring in Lee Eun Byul.

967
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:54,980
What about Bae Min Gyu?

968
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:58,950
We will have plenty of time to arrest him after Lee Eun Byul's interrogation.

969
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:00,760
I think we have a clue here.

970
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,100

974
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,020
The depth as well as the shape of the wound all match up.

975
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,010
The ingredient ratio of the knife is the same.

976
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:41,530
It is presumed to be the same knife as the weapon.

977
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:43,180
Yes!

978
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:47,000
Let's search Lee Eun Byul's house and attain the murder weapon.

979
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,380
So, how do you think Prosecutor Go Young Joo would feel if she heard of this news?

980
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,930
She wouldn't be able to contain her excitement.

981
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:57,480
Prosecutor Go adamantly claimed that Bae Min Gyu only took a picture at the club for his alibi

982
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,400
and went to the gallery to kill her and finally returned to the club.

983
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:02,970
Now that we've got the weapon as well, I think we can break his alibi.

984
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:05,530
I think we can break his alibi.

985
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:06,900
So...

986
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,400
- should I call her?
- No.

987
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:13,350
I'd better go see her myself.

988
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:16,930
I'll get going now.

989
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:18,800
Of course.

990
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,780
Gosh. He's actually quite sweet.

991
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:25,030
I guess he is.

992
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:47,950
This is pretty cool.

993
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:05,370

994
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:07,180
Stop staring at me.

995
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:10,090
Stop giving me that ambiguous glances.

Why not?

and all I've got is a bad temper.

- Yes.

1007
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:33,050
It's my first time in Woojin. The ocean is very beautiful.

1008
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:38,740
So, what are you doing over there?

1009
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:40,170
Oh, this?

1010
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:43,270
It looks like a typhoon is coming. So I was looking at my fish trap.

Even though the weather is this nice?

The ocean is telling me that there's a storm coming soon.

You can understand what the ocean is telling you?

1014
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,410
Wow, that's a really great talent you have.

1015
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:57,060
The ocean wouldn't be happy if you mock like that.

I see.

1017

- Ouch!
- Wow, are you okay?

1018
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,700
See, I told you. The ocean got angry at you.

1019
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,490
There you go.

1020
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,150
- It's done.
- Thank you very much.

Really, I feel much better.

1022

Who took all these pictures?

1023
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,760
I did.

1024
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,620
When I'm sad or having a hard time, the ocean comforts me.

1025
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:43,220
Maybe it's because you can communicate with the ocean,

1026
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:45,630
all the pictures look alive.

1027

So you have two jobs?

1040
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:27,380
I guess you can say that.

1041

Hold on, why are you here-

1049

Did you catch the serial killer?

1050

Oh, he must be the one that claims to have created the Earth himself.

Pardon?

1052
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:57,040
He said he couldn't get in touch with you, Noona.

1053
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,740

He's so high and mighty, receiving all the jealousy and envy from all his colleagues.

1064
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:30,840
An unrealistic man, Cha Young Woon.

1065
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:34,980
So what is this perfect Prosecutor Cha Young Woon doing in this backcountry?

1066
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,070
Prosecutor Go Young Joo.

1067
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:38,440
I need your help.

1068
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:41,440
What help can you get from a prosecutor who investigates with bias?

1069
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,500
You were right.

1070
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:47,150
We found crucial evidence that the weapon is directly linked to Bae Min Gyu.

1071
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:48,770
- Really?
- Yes.

1072
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:51,600

Hey, Oh Jin Sang, you heard that, right? My vacation is over.

1079
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,820

1080
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:09,860
Yeah. Thanks for the meal.

1081
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,040
Let's go, hurry.

1082
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,560
Hey! Hey, Go Young Joo!

1083
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:19,660
Why did that punk have to come now of all times?

1084
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:22,500
Does he like Go Young Joo?

1085
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,820
Four should be in a set, but the sashimi knife is missing.

1086
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:36,450
Where's the sashimi knife?

1087
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:39,040
- I lost it.
- Where at?

1088
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:42,070
It's been a while. Maybe it was last year?

1089
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:45,050
I must have lost it when a burglar broke in.

1090
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:48,450
Bae Min Gyu gave you this knife set as a gift, right?

1091
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,880
I don't really remember...

1092
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,280
Look, Ms. Lee Eun Byul!

1093
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:58,980
You even bragged about it on your YouTube channel that it was from your lover, Bae Min Gyu.

1094
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,680
Yes, it's true.

1095
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,730
I did receive it as a gift from Oppa.

1096
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:06,520
But I really lost this knife when the burglar broke in.

1097
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:09,430
- A burglar stole it...
- Yes!

1098
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:11,950
When exactly did the burglar break in?

1099
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,690
That's...

1100
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:19,580
So just the sashimi knife is missing from the set...

1101
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,140
When that's the murder weapon?

1102
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:24,800
Yeah, Lee Eun Byul seems to claim that it's been stolen.

1103
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,980
But Lee Eun Byul might be telling the truth.

1104
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:32,170
But why would a burglar leave an expensive set and take only the sashimi knife?

1105
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:33,850
It lacks credibility.

1106
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:35,180
That's true.

1107
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:38,140
You might find some other evidence when we interrogate Lee Eun Byul.

1108
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:39,900
Whatever it is...

1109
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:43,130
Facts always leave a trace.

1110
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,890
Thanks a lot.

1111
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:48,060
For what?

1112
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:50,650
For trusting me and joining the team.

1113
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:53,070
Who said I trust you, Sunbae?
