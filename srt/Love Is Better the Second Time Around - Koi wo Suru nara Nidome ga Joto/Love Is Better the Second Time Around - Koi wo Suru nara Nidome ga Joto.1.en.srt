1
00:00:06,664 --> 00:00:07,406
Senpai.

2
00:00:09,727 --> 00:00:10,555
Thanks.

3
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:38,307
Please take me.

4
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,463
Go wherever you want to go,

5
00:00:41,815 --> 00:00:42,854
no matter where it is.

6
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:07,620
Miyata-kun.

7
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,020
Shall we go further than this?

8
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:20,018
I...

9
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:22,893
About Hoshizawa-senpai...

10
00:01:43,456 --> 00:01:45,573
Who said Tokyo is difficult to live in?

11
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:47,932
I've been living there for 12 years.

12
00:01:47,957 --> 00:01:49,557
You'll just get used to it.

13
00:01:50,565 --> 00:01:51,463
Alright.

14
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:57,962
(Iwanaga Takashi)

15
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,365
Iwanaga Takashi-sensei

16
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,585
from the Faculty of Economics

17
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,891
at Tohou University.

18
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:03,322
Takashi...

19
00:02:08,986 --> 00:02:10,009
Alright.

20
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:12,704
I'm off.

21
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:13,861
Ah, good luck.

22
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:18,102
I'm gotten used to being a

23
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,922
magazine editor for eight years.

24
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:21,860
And even having meetings with professors

25
00:02:21,884 --> 00:02:23,110
and others for the first time,

26
00:02:23,135 --> 00:02:24,831
I've become accustomed to it all.

27
00:02:27,228 --> 00:02:28,048
Please come in.

28
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:29,478
Excuse me.

29
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:40,283
Nice to meet you.

30
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,931
I'm Miyata Akihiro from Tokyo Business.

31
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:44,798
Nice to meet you...

32
00:02:48,141 --> 00:02:50,072
I don't think so,

33
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:51,447
Miyata-kun.

34
00:02:55,478 --> 00:02:57,353
Hoshizawa-senpai...

35
00:03:38,173 --> 00:03:40,477
"Love is Better the Second Time Around"

36
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,600
"Episode 1"
We are targeting businessmen

37
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:44,392
in their thirties,

38
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:46,259
but from now on, we want to

39
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:48,079
approach the younger demographic

40
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:49,621
with themes that are not too formal,

41
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:51,001
and are easy to relate to,

42
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:52,064
And then...

43
00:03:54,894 --> 00:03:55,675
Is something wrong?

44
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:58,558
I thought you'd become more mature.

45
00:03:59,535 --> 00:04:01,035
Well, I'm already 30.

46
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:02,449
Miyata-kun.

47
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:03,683
So you did end up

48
00:04:03,715 --> 00:04:05,027
in publishing after all.

49
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:06,738
You always loved books.

50
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,902
Let's proceed with the meeting,

51
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:09,910
Iwanaga-sensei.

52
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:12,433
Sensei?

53
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,745
Just call me like you used to,

54
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:16,581
Hoshizawa-senpai.

55
00:04:19,394 --> 00:04:21,144
Your name has changed, hasn't it?

56
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:22,511
I was adopted

57
00:04:22,536 --> 00:04:24,637
right after graduating from high school.

58
00:04:26,144 --> 00:04:27,441
Is that so?

59
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:31,964
- About that...
- Ah...

60
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,519
It's been so long.

61
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,050
By the way,

62
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:38,863
That day,

63
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:41,644
why didn't you come?

64
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:45,988
I waited for so long, you know.

65
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:49,643
Easily breaking the promise we made

66
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:51,735
while holding hands like that.

67
00:04:57,503 --> 00:04:59,206
Why? Miyata-kun.

68
00:05:01,831 --> 00:05:04,831
I was wrong. I broke the promise.

69
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:09,652
But...

70
00:05:11,214 --> 00:05:12,355
But...

71
00:05:13,628 --> 00:05:15,378
And what about you?

72
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,206
I know.

73
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,448
You were just teasing

74
00:05:18,473 --> 00:05:19,495
and playing with me,

75
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:20,995
you didn't really like me.

76
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:25,995
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:28,941
I'll contact you through email later.

78
00:05:32,394 --> 00:05:33,222
Excuse me.

79
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,972
My dark history,

80
00:05:43,581 --> 00:05:45,527
Hoshizawa Takashi-senpai.

81
00:05:46,206 --> 00:05:47,660
He was such a well-known figure

82
00:05:47,775 --> 00:05:48,861
in our hometown that

83
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:50,953
hardly anyone didn't know him.

84
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:56,979
Isn't that Hoshizawa-senpai over there?

85
00:05:57,011 --> 00:05:57,988
How cool!

86
00:05:58,019 --> 00:05:59,026
What is he reading?

87
00:05:59,035 --> 00:06:00,823
- So smart.
- He's also the top of his year.

88
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,042
Wow, amazing.

89
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:06,964
A remarkably handsome guy.

90
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:08,440
Born into a prestigious family,

91
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:09,198
wealthy.

92
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:11,160
- Incredibly smart,
- Incredibly smart,

93
00:06:12,988 --> 00:06:13,800
but

94
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:16,261
he always liked being alone.

95
00:06:24,495 --> 00:06:25,245
Hey.

96
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,495
Why are you looking at me like that?

97
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:46,816
I was foolish.

98
00:06:47,464 --> 00:06:48,503
I was just a kid.

99
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:52,792
To think I was in love

100
00:06:52,817 --> 00:06:54,003
with a man like him.

101
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,050
Hoshizawa-senpai...

102
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,557
(A new message)

103
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,494
(Hiro-kun, can I go

104
00:07:16,518 --> 00:07:17,650
to your place today?)

105
00:07:23,432 --> 00:07:25,057
(Sorry, I'm still caught up with work.
Let's meet another time)

106
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:27,799
(Got it)

107
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:39,814
Yes.

108
00:07:39,846 --> 00:07:40,987
Excuse me.

109
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,220
For some reason,

110
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:48,533
the computer crashed and

111
00:07:48,564 --> 00:07:49,353
you couldn't send emails,

112
00:07:49,377 --> 00:07:50,666
I decided to come here to get the draft.

113
00:07:50,713 --> 00:07:51,948
Sorry about that.

114
00:07:51,987 --> 00:07:54,525
My computer just wouldn't work at all.

115
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:55,814
I guess analog methods are

116
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,947
the way to go in times like this.

117
00:07:56,971 --> 00:07:58,212
I think there are plenty of

118
00:07:58,237 --> 00:07:59,376
other methods available.

119
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:01,737
Here you go.

120
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:03,924
Thank you.

121
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,979
Since you're already here,

122
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:09,228
how about we grab lunch together?

123
00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:10,486
No, I need to submit

124
00:08:10,494 --> 00:08:11,822
this as soon as possible.

125
00:08:11,846 --> 00:08:12,658
You're joking.

126
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:14,065
It's not that urgent, is it?

127
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:15,080
If it's not, then I wouldn't

128
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:16,244
bother picking it up.

129
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,784
You can just hear me out a little.

130
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,354
No, I'd better not.

131
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:28,120
I've been curious ever since then.

132
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,713
Have we

133
00:08:31,064 --> 00:08:33,025
ever loved each other?

134
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:36,823
Excuse me.

135
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,573
Yes.

136
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:41,752
Ah, Shiraishi-kun, my assistant.

137
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:46,627
Nice to meet you,

138
00:08:46,948 --> 00:08:48,440
I'm the assistant, Shiraishi.

139
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:50,064
I'm really sorry about

140
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,291
Iwanaga-sensei,

141
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,159
I said I'd send it from my computer,

142
00:08:54,721 --> 00:08:56,291
but he said it's very important,

143
00:08:56,307 --> 00:08:58,275
so he wanted to deliver it in person.

144
00:08:59,643 --> 00:09:01,260
Sorry to trouble you.

145
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:02,674
No problem.

146
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:11,338
That's everything.

147
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:12,323
Thank you.

148
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:16,284
Sorry for interupting.

149
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:16,995
No worries.

150
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:29,369
Is he your young lover?

151
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,791
He's not my lover.

152
00:09:33,768 --> 00:09:35,088
I see.

153
00:09:36,385 --> 00:09:37,479
Actually, there's a

154
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:39,909
woman I'm interested in marrying.

155
00:09:40,604 --> 00:09:41,916
Huh...

156
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,471
Is that so?

157
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:45,823
Let's forget about the past

158
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,041
and focus on being business partners,

159
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:49,066
shall we?

160
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:51,893
I'll leave the rest to you.

161
00:09:52,307 --> 00:09:53,409
Miyata-kun.

162
00:09:54,534 --> 00:09:55,276
Well then.

163
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:08,487
Even though I said that to Senpai,

164
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:12,174
but about the marriage...

165
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,010
Hiro-kun.

166
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:17,182
Hiro-kun!

167
00:10:18,002 --> 00:10:18,635
Huh?

168
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:21,619
You seem too absent-minded lately.

169
00:10:22,065 --> 00:10:23,424
Sorry, sorry.

170
00:10:24,018 --> 00:10:25,682
Umm...

171
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:27,182
So, yeah...

172
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:30,346
Come to my house this time.

173
00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:32,212
My parents really want

174
00:10:32,244 --> 00:10:33,580
to see you too, Hiro-kun.

175
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:35,979
Ah... Yeah.

176
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:37,604
Of course, I'll come.

177
00:10:43,112 --> 00:10:44,580
If you're not enthusiastic about it,

178
00:10:44,596 --> 00:10:45,587
don't force yourself.

179
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,682
Huh? Why? I'll go.

180
00:10:53,104 --> 00:10:54,182
What's wrong?

181
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:56,729
No, it's nothing.

182
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,416
I'd better go home now.

183
00:11:01,346 --> 00:11:02,377
You're not coming over?

184
00:11:10,478 --> 00:11:12,447
(Iwanaga Takashi)

185
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,620
It's from a business partner.

186
00:11:17,612 --> 00:11:18,573
Pick it up.

187
00:11:18,932 --> 00:11:20,229
But...

188
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,502
Ah, he hung up.

189
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:26,604
It must be hard since it's this late.

190
00:11:27,143 --> 00:11:27,940
See you later.

191
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,674
Thank you for your support.

192
00:11:35,088 --> 00:11:37,299
I'm feeling a bit uneasy,

193
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,760
I'm in a bit of a bind right now.

194
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,533
Sorry to keep you waiting.

195
00:11:47,987 --> 00:11:48,642
(Ten thousand yen)

196
00:11:51,088 --> 00:11:52,120
I'm really sorry.

197
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:54,245
Well then.

198
00:11:55,073 --> 00:11:56,666
Hey, wait!

199
00:11:57,682 --> 00:12:00,143
Since you're here, let's have a drink.

200
00:12:01,018 --> 00:12:01,737
Huh?

201
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,815
After you just returned the money...

202
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:06,260
That's the thing...

203
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,588
I found it in my pocket.

204
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,995
Do you always come here to drink?

205
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,299
Yeah.

206
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:21,064
When I have things to think about,

207
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:22,128
I come alone.

208
00:12:22,635 --> 00:12:24,776
That's pretty cool.

209
00:12:25,268 --> 00:12:26,541
A glass of whiskey with

210
00:12:26,564 --> 00:12:27,705
water for 3000 yen...

211
00:12:27,729 --> 00:12:28,291
Heh.

212
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,479
But if this one drink

213
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,400
can make you stay

214
00:12:32,425 --> 00:12:34,105
with me a little longer,

215
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,392
then I'd say it's worth
the cost.

216
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,143
I don't know.

217
00:12:47,745 --> 00:12:49,112
Are you really getting married?

218
00:12:51,627 --> 00:12:53,143
Someday I think I will get married.

219
00:12:55,284 --> 00:12:56,338
Think twice.

220
00:12:57,205 --> 00:12:58,682
Why's that all of a sudden?

221
00:13:00,432 --> 00:13:01,580
You might regret it.

222
00:13:01,971 --> 00:13:02,924
Why?

223
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:05,143
Because

224
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,393
you can't love anyone other than me.

225
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,416
I've already booked a room.

226
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,135
Shall we talk over there?

227
00:13:42,306 --> 00:13:43,791
That way of asking me out,

228
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:45,526
are you a perverted old man?

229
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:48,471
I'll sue you for power harassment.

230
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:50,784
Not sexual harassment?

231
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:51,971
Besides,

232
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,330
that assistant of yours might cry.

233
00:13:55,495 --> 00:13:57,807
I only had one encounter with that boy.

234
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,596
That's seriously messed up.

235
00:14:00,377 --> 00:14:01,682
Excuse me.

236
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:07,807
See you later.

237
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:12,119
Teasing me like that again.

238
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:13,634
What's wrong with him?

239
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:15,549
Despite his age,

240
00:14:15,596 --> 00:14:16,861
he's still acting

241
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:18,384
like a high school kid.

242
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,071
Wow, Iwanaga-sensei's photo

243
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:22,705
really makes an impact.

244
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:23,205
Yes.

245
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,026
How many years since we had sold out?

246
00:14:25,127 --> 00:14:26,932
(Business Now)
Looks cool, doesn't it?

247
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:27,995
Yeah.

248
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:29,315
So old...

249
00:14:34,502 --> 00:14:35,096
Ah.

250
00:14:35,557 --> 00:14:36,690
Like...

251
00:14:36,955 --> 00:14:39,924
He's at this age but still so handsome.

252
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,713
Ah, I want to say it clearly.

253
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,784
The truth is, I was involved

254
00:14:47,823 --> 00:14:48,713
with him in the past,

255
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:50,409
and it was complicated.

256
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:53,377
It's not something

257
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:54,643
I can easily talk about!

258
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:03,931
Miyata-kun,

259
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:06,955
yo're not getting along
with sensei?

260
00:15:09,221 --> 00:15:10,580
Nothing's wrong.

261
00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:12,010
Oh, I see.

262
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:14,479
Well, there's something I want to ask

263
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:16,150
Iwanaga-sensei for help with.

264
00:15:16,174 --> 00:15:16,799
Huh?

265
00:15:16,823 --> 00:15:18,056
We still haven't finished printing,

266
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:19,158
you're thinking about the next one?

267
00:15:19,182 --> 00:15:20,447
Well, the response

268
00:15:20,472 --> 00:15:21,908
was beyond expectations.

269
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,275
I thought it'd be best to start

270
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,689
looking for the next opportunity.

271
00:15:25,604 --> 00:15:28,127
Can I count on you to approach him?

272
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:31,127
Isn't the sensei busy?

273
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:33,707
That's where your skills come in.

274
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,987
Then, I'll ask at the next meeting.

275
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,400
Yeah, thanks.

276
00:15:41,784 --> 00:15:42,799
Oh, by the way,

277
00:15:43,455 --> 00:15:44,682
once it's confirmed,

278
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,963
I'll have you handle it.

279
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:47,901
Please continue to coordinate

280
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:49,446
with the sensei.

281
00:15:57,643 --> 00:15:59,228
I understand. Let's try to move in

282
00:15:59,252 --> 00:16:00,650
this direction for the next phase.

283
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,603
By the way, Miyata-kun...

284
00:16:02,674 --> 00:16:04,057
- After this...
- Sensei.

285
00:16:04,502 --> 00:16:05,245
Yes?

286
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:06,611
I was thinking if

287
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:07,955
I could ask you to publish

288
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,780
the new article on the web?

289
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,080
On the web?

290
00:16:12,978 --> 00:16:14,330
Thank you for offer,

291
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:16,035
but I don't have time.

292
00:16:16,237 --> 00:16:17,291
I already have my main job to handle.

293
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,330
Thank you for your hard work.

294
00:16:18,338 --> 00:16:18,916
Ah.

295
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,385
Thank you for your hard work.

296
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,330
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

297
00:16:26,448 --> 00:16:27,861
- See you next time.
- Thank you for your hard work.

298
00:16:28,026 --> 00:16:28,807
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

299
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:29,987
Thank you for your hard work.

300
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:39,276
As expected, it's not possible.

301
00:16:39,854 --> 00:16:43,198
Well, it's a request from you,

302
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:43,971
right?

303
00:16:43,995 --> 00:16:44,651
No.

304
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:46,416
It's from the editorial department.

305
00:16:46,627 --> 00:16:48,385
It's not a personal request.

306
00:16:48,455 --> 00:16:49,807
Hmm...

307
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,416
I see.

308
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:53,213
It can't be helped.

309
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:55,213
I'll think about it.

310
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:00,870
Umm...

311
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,229
Professor.

312
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,073
Hmm?

313
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,495
I

314
00:17:12,284 --> 00:17:13,392
don't have confidence

315
00:17:13,424 --> 00:17:14,799
in handling your projects.

316
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,189
I'm thinking of asking the other
editor to take charge of you.

317
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,416
It's impossible after all.

318
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,245
Becoming business partners with you...

319
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:27,674
Why?

320
00:17:30,971 --> 00:17:32,557
Because you're reminded of the past?

321
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,354
No, it's not that.

322
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:35,315
I'm...

323
00:17:35,978 --> 00:17:37,994
not as popular as you.

324
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:39,517
I'm hopeless,

325
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:41,126
completely different from you.

326
00:17:41,245 --> 00:17:43,627
- Besides...
- If you dislike it, I understand.

327
00:17:44,002 --> 00:17:44,940
Fine then.

328
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,104
That's too bad.

329
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,338
I'm sorry.

330
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,923
I'll make sure to handle

331
00:17:50,932 --> 00:17:52,111
the handover properly.

332
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,034
Yeah. Let's go for dinner.

333
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,041
Huh?

334
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,026
There's a soba place nearby.

335
00:17:58,596 --> 00:18:00,111
You're probably going to have dinner,

336
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:01,260
why not join me?

337
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:03,338
You've been turning down my

338
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,900
invitations to dinner multiple times.

339
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:06,885
Well,

340
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:09,604
it might be the last time.

341
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,846
Let's just go get some soba.

342
00:18:13,307 --> 00:18:14,018
Okay?

343
00:18:39,393 --> 00:18:40,572
Two people alone in

344
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:42,261
a private room like this.

345
00:18:42,268 --> 00:18:43,447
Wouldn't it be a disaster

346
00:18:43,487 --> 00:18:44,861
if that kid sees us?

347
00:18:44,885 --> 00:18:46,213
You mean Shiraishi-kun?

348
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:47,737
Why?

349
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:52,174
You two did it already, yes?

350
00:18:55,252 --> 00:18:58,721
If you ask that, the answer is yes.

351
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,870
But it's been two years since then.

352
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:04,721
Besides, we already had an agreement

353
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:06,346
not to have a relationship.

354
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:09,745
You see,

355
00:19:09,846 --> 00:19:11,721
let me say this,

356
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:13,916
but you seem too detached

357
00:19:13,924 --> 00:19:15,858
from other people's feelings.

358
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:19,346
Such a young and innocent boy,

359
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,104
have you ever thought about

360
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:22,168
his feelings?

361
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,346
Well, but he was the one

362
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,051
who approached me first.

363
00:19:26,612 --> 00:19:28,166
Even so,

364
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:31,807
it's like adults deceiving children.

365
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,815
Senpai, you're completely at fault!

366
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:38,057
You're right.

367
00:19:38,455 --> 00:19:39,853
Even though he's old enough

368
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:41,017
to be working,

369
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,112
but I'm the one at fault here.

370
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,640
Exactly.

371
00:19:45,846 --> 00:19:47,150
You like toying with

372
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:48,855
other people's feelings.

373
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:54,260
It's not so bad being lectured by you.

374
00:19:55,135 --> 00:19:57,705
Are you a masochist?

375
00:20:01,862 --> 00:20:04,502
I don't think so, but maybe I am.

376
00:20:05,127 --> 00:20:07,666
You keep saying things like that.

377
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:11,517
But please take

378
00:20:11,526 --> 00:20:12,892
responsibility for your words.

379
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:14,400
Each and every one of them.

380
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:19,612
I liked the honest you from high school,

381
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,166
but I like you more now.

382
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,760
Really...

383
00:20:33,111 --> 00:20:34,854
Is that so?

384
00:21:06,924 --> 00:21:07,752
Huh?

385
00:21:09,455 --> 00:21:10,315
Good morning,

386
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,080
it's still midnight, though.

387
00:21:14,823 --> 00:21:16,932
Umm...

388
00:21:18,463 --> 00:21:19,948
This is my house.

389
00:21:20,268 --> 00:21:22,846
You were sleeping soundly,

390
00:21:23,252 --> 00:21:24,768
so I had to take you home.

391
00:21:27,948 --> 00:21:30,088
Oh, I'm so sorry!

392
00:21:30,862 --> 00:21:32,409
That was cute,

393
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:33,854
Miyata-kun's sleeping face.

394
00:21:37,768 --> 00:21:39,455
I'll come back later to apologise.

395
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,221
The last train left a while ago.

396
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,643
Stay the night.

397
00:21:45,729 --> 00:21:47,182
No, I'll call a taxi.

398
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:49,853
If you're this flustered,

399
00:21:49,877 --> 00:21:51,017
it makes me happy.

400
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:51,830
No, I'm not.

401
00:21:52,565 --> 00:21:53,892
It's outrageous to intrude

402
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,213
into a sensei's house.

403
00:21:56,354 --> 00:21:58,862
Earlier, you were calling me senpai.

404
00:21:59,346 --> 00:22:00,721
Stop calling me sensei.

405
00:22:03,854 --> 00:22:04,971
Senpai.

406
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:06,885
Even so...

407
00:22:07,448 --> 00:22:09,245
Why are you so alarmed

408
00:22:10,923 --> 00:22:12,493
with a man you haven't slept with?

409
00:22:13,096 --> 00:22:15,400
I've only kissed you once.

410
00:22:21,385 --> 00:22:22,909
I remember it.

411
00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:31,291
It was trembling,

412
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:33,651
enchanting,

413
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:35,604
warm,

414
00:22:37,776 --> 00:22:38,791
and tender.

415
00:23:33,098 --> 00:23:34,543
This is the worst.

416
00:23:35,161 --> 00:23:36,793
I didn't want to realize.

417
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,200
That deep down in my heart,

418
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:41,637
I've always wanted you, Senpai.

419
00:23:44,997 --> 00:23:45,802
(Next episode)

420
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:46,934
We kissed.

421
00:23:46,963 --> 00:23:48,409
Of course, it's not okay.

422
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:50,028
Stop messing with Sensei,

423
00:23:50,073 --> 00:23:51,316
you flirt.

424
00:23:51,356 --> 00:23:53,551
I don't want to be misled by Sensei.

425
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,262
I want to be misled by you.

426
00:23:55,422 --> 00:23:56,406
I've liked you

427
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,523
since I was in high school
