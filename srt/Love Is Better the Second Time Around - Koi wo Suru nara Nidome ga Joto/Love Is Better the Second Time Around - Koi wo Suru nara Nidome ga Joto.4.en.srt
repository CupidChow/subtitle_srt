00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:14,086
Oh.

- these are the past documents.
- Thank you.

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,752
When I was a newcomer,

8
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:33,908
in this editorial department,

9
00:00:34,627 --> 00:00:36,095
there was a senpai who had

10
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,595
a relationship with a sensei in charge.

11
00:00:40,197 --> 00:00:42,525
I didn't mean for it to happen.

12
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,853
Did you really do it?

13
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:53,416
Isn't that bad?

14
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:54,986
- I mean...
- Yeah.

15
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:57,119
It's an affair.

16
00:00:58,174 --> 00:00:59,697
Right.

17
00:01:00,955 --> 00:01:02,947
I'm aware,

18
00:01:05,057 --> 00:01:07,182
as a person, as a professional,

19
00:01:07,557 --> 00:01:08,853
that it was wrong.

20
00:01:11,377 --> 00:01:12,064
But

21
00:01:12,994 --> 00:01:14,072
by the time I realized,

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,041
I was already stuck in the swamp,

23
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,611
and I couldn't leave him.

24
00:01:23,634 --> 00:01:25,072
I can't forget

25
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:27,173
the beauty of her determination

26
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:28,329
at that time.

27
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,298
Ah,

28
00:01:32,252 --> 00:01:33,744
so this is what love feels like.

(Iwanaga Takashi

30
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:55,205
I'm sorry to ask,

31
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:57,322
but could you extend the deadline?

32
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,244
That's unusual.

36
00:02:13,322 --> 00:02:14,174
Old man.

37
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,549
That assistant is causing trouble again?

38
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:20,572
Just to be sure.

39
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:27,213
Hello.

40
00:02:27,705 --> 00:02:29,767
Thanks for your hard work. It's Miyata.

41
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:32,634
No, likewise.

42
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:36,572
Can't the deadline be postponed?

43
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,666
No,

44
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:40,682
it's fine as I replied in the email.

45
00:02:42,017 --> 00:02:42,885
Um,

46
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:44,861
could it be that you...

47
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:47,541
Yes?

48
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:49,963

Yes.

53

I'm sorry.

Well...

57

It's not a big deal,

58
00:03:57,345 --> 00:03:59,149
but this is for the sensei.

59
00:04:01,095 --> 00:04:02,782
Both of us gladly accept this.

60

61

Never mind that.

67
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:26,240
No, you're misunderstanding.

68
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,998
Ah, about Shiraishi-kun, right?

69
00:04:28,521 --> 00:04:30,138
He came to pick up some documents,

70
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,474
that's what he said and left.

71
00:04:35,154 --> 00:04:37,318
So you understand.

72
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:39,631
He was an honest and obedient boy.

73
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:41,818
You reap what you sow.

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,178
You made him like that, didn't you?

75
00:04:44,553 --> 00:04:45,693
Is it my fault?

76
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:47,411
I wonder.

77
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,498
Ah.

78
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:50,841
It wouldn't be good if

79
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:51,949
you caught a cold too.

80
00:04:51,974 --> 00:04:54,240
You should go home. Thanks for today.

81
00:04:57,654 --> 00:04:59,185
Are you sure you'll be okay alone?

82
00:05:00,178 --> 00:05:01,732
Yeah, I'll be fine.

83
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:04,428
I went to the doctor

84
00:05:04,444 --> 00:05:05,810
and got some medicine.

85
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:07,467
I'm feeling much better now.

86
00:05:08,412 --> 00:05:09,724
I'll be better after I sleep.

87
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:18,365
What?

88
00:05:29,943 --> 00:05:31,131
Stop staring.

89
00:05:31,787 --> 00:05:33,357
I'm just a messy old man, right?

If you look closely,

92
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:39,005
you're just an ordinary old man.

93
00:05:40,576 --> 00:05:42,247
When I knew you were coming,

94
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:44,028
at least I tidied up my hair.

95
00:05:45,435 --> 00:05:46,731
I noticed it even during

96
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,099
the hot spring trip.

97
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:49,685

98
00:05:51,107 --> 00:05:54,255
Your belongings seem cool and expensive,

99
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:56,068
your manners are refined.

100
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:58,084
Something like that.

101
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,442
I used to think

102
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:01,435
that kind of thing was special.

103
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,261
But...

104
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,324
just like me, you've aged

105
00:06:06,154 --> 00:06:08,138
and become an ordinary old guy.

106
00:06:10,623 --> 00:06:12,092
At a time like this,

107
00:06:12,576 --> 00:06:13,622
don't say things that

108
00:06:13,646 --> 00:06:14,896
make me want to kiss you.

109
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,131
You seem better than I thought.

110
00:06:21,498 --> 00:06:22,826
Then, I'll head home.

111
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:26,029

113
00:06:28,076 --> 00:06:30,053
I'll handle that.

114
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,888
How dependable.

115
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,310
Well then.

116
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:34,037
Yeah.

117
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:46,771
Geez...

118
00:06:50,545 --> 00:06:52,279
If you're going to make that face,

119
00:06:52,304 --> 00:06:53,576
just say it properly.

120
00:06:58,982 --> 00:07:01,115
I'll stay here until you fall asleep.

121
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:16,834

about something like this?

125
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,693
Senpai made that kind of face,

126
00:08:29,412 --> 00:08:30,873
I like him in the first place,

127
00:08:31,717 --> 00:08:32,998
and we already did it, too.

128
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,646

129

00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:42,356
I do like you.

193
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:44,536
- Then...
- But,

194
00:12:45,738 --> 00:12:47,199
I won't date you.

195
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:51,120
Why not?

196
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,557
Because we're not in

197
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:55,752
high school anymore.

198
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,776
If I mess things up,

199
00:12:58,268 --> 00:13:00,651
I could lose everything.

200
00:13:03,753 --> 00:13:05,573
Once you hit 30,

201
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:08,315
you start seeing reality too clearly.

202
00:13:20,805 --> 00:13:22,039
During those times,

203
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,226
I try to think that

204
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:24,703
I might die tomorrow.

205
00:13:26,008 --> 00:13:26,867
That way,

206
00:13:27,454 --> 00:13:28,725
Then I try to choose choices

207
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,953
that I won't regret.

208
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,414
Even if you say that,

209
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:36,250
I still won't go out with you.

210
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,883
You could have reassured me.

211
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:46,219
I'm quite into you, more than you think.

212
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:01,071
Ugh,

213
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:04,563
maybe I should quit drinking after all.

214
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:06,329
Oh, you.

215
00:14:08,985 --> 00:14:10,461
This is really bad.

216
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:13,586
I can't escape from Senpai anymore.

217
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:17,875
That's what scares me the most.

218
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:21,414
Hey,

219
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,116
let's go somewhere next time?

220
00:14:23,156 --> 00:14:24,883
I want to thank you for visiting me.

221
00:14:25,172 --> 00:14:27,375
There's no need to repay.

222
00:14:27,438 --> 00:14:28,868
What about dinner?

223
00:14:29,164 --> 00:14:30,993
A restaurant with a pretty night view?

224
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,375
Are you even listening to me?

225
00:14:33,657 --> 00:14:35,149
Is it a no-go after all?

226
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:38,250
I want to do various things for you.

227
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,383
- I'm trying to win you over...
- I understand.

228
00:14:45,032 --> 00:14:45,922
Well then...

229
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:55,039
Are you sure about this place?

230
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,499
- Maybe a proper restaurant...
- This place is fine.

231
00:14:58,422 --> 00:15:00,133
Here, thanks for your hard work.

232
00:15:00,946 --> 00:15:02,282
Thanks for your hard work.

233
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:04,789
Just don't drink too much.

234
00:15:05,243 --> 00:15:07,664
- Well, tipsy Miyata-kun is cute too.
- Excuse me!

235
00:15:07,664 --> 00:15:08,266
Yes?

236
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:09,336
I'll have the liver cutlet, please!

237
00:15:09,352 --> 00:15:10,828
Alright, coming right up.

238
00:15:12,336 --> 00:15:13,594
The liver cutlet here is so delicious,

239
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:16,165
I've dreamt about it before.

240
00:15:16,204 --> 00:15:17,094
Really?

241
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,047
I see.

242
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:20,774
Order as much as you like.

243
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,157
Then,

244
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:24,532
I'll go all out.

245
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:26,944
Can I order 1700 yen grilled fish head?

246
00:15:26,946 --> 00:15:27,836
Go ahead.

247
00:15:28,735 --> 00:15:29,688
And also,

248
00:15:29,868 --> 00:15:31,329
thick omelet.

249
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:33,649
And tako wasabi.

250
00:15:36,547 --> 00:15:38,963
And definitely, crab cream croquette.

251
00:15:37,663 --> 00:15:39,163
(Crab cream croquette 630 yen)

252
00:15:40,414 --> 00:15:42,704
And...

253
00:15:43,102 --> 00:15:44,922
Crab cream croquette

254
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:47,844
used to be in your lunchbox quite often.

255
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,455
Huh?

256
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,267
Delicious!

257
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:00,588
Is it?

258
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:01,931
Give me a bite.

259
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:02,853
Huh?

260
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,213
Come on.

261
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:15,472
You're right,

262
00:16:16,003 --> 00:16:16,956
it really is delicious.

263
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:25,597
I like it.

264
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:28,566
I've always loved

265
00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:30,972
crab cream croquette.

266
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:34,152
What's wrong with that?

267
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:36,995
You haven't changed at all.

268
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:39,167
That's right.

269
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:46,253
But looking back now,

270
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:49,902
I don't think the frozen crab croquettes

271
00:16:50,355 --> 00:16:52,323
were that delicious after all.

272
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,222
Is that so?

273
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,081
I've tried many different kinds,

274
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,377
but I still feel like the ones

275
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:01,935
I had back in school were the best.

276
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:04,925
I understand.

277
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:07,003
Because I had them with you.

278
00:17:15,253 --> 00:17:16,542
Thanks for the treat.

279
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,409
I'm so full now.

280
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:19,816
I'm glad.

281
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,870
Miyata-kun, you know some great places.

282
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:23,894
- I know, right?
- Yeah.

283
00:17:27,691 --> 00:17:28,542
Miyata-kun.

284
00:17:28,644 --> 00:17:29,339
Stop.

285
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,316
Don't say that.

286
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:34,527
I haven't said anything yet.

287
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:35,940
It's probably

288
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:37,244
something like 'I like you'

289
00:17:37,268 --> 00:17:39,010
or 'I want to win you over, ' right?

290
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,019
You're correct.

291
00:17:40,237 --> 00:17:41,331
Are you an esper?

292
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:43,183
Can you stop doing that?

293
00:17:43,878 --> 00:17:45,011
It's pointless.

294
00:17:47,862 --> 00:17:50,042
Calling it pointless is a bit harsh, no?

295
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:54,980
I don't want to waste

296
00:17:54,996 --> 00:17:56,440
the rest of my life.

297
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:58,933
It's just a temporary fling, isn't it?

298
00:17:59,737 --> 00:18:01,347
I don't like that.

299
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:02,737
I've been telling you

300
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:03,909
it's different all along.

301
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:05,347
Then,

302
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:07,058
did you feel so regretful that

303
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,612
you cried when I rejected you?

304
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:12,432
I cried enough to soak my pillow.

305
00:18:12,495 --> 00:18:14,448
I didn't soak my pillow.

306
00:18:14,448 --> 00:18:15,104
See?

307
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:16,666
It was just that much

308
00:18:16,691 --> 00:18:18,494
for you, wasn't it?

309
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,316
But I miss you,

310
00:18:20,847 --> 00:18:22,808
I sighed for you 20 000 times.

311
00:18:23,456 --> 00:18:25,816
When you were alone,

312
00:18:26,097 --> 00:18:28,057
did you ever accidentally say my name?

313
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:28,800
Yes,

314
00:18:28,995 --> 00:18:29,980
a lot.

315
00:18:31,183 --> 00:18:32,605
When you're eating,

316
00:18:33,144 --> 00:18:34,065
do you ever wish

317
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:35,495
you could eat with me?

318
00:18:35,612 --> 00:18:37,127
I do, many times recently.

319
00:18:37,191 --> 00:18:38,307
Do you suddenly miss me

320
00:18:38,323 --> 00:18:39,589
in the middle of the night

321
00:18:40,284 --> 00:18:41,596
and go to a convenience store

322
00:18:41,612 --> 00:18:42,495
to buy stuff?

323
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:43,995
Of course I do.

324
00:18:45,237 --> 00:18:46,745
Have you ever thought about me

325
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:48,605
while you pleasure yourself?

326
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:50,065
I have.

327
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:51,527
Yes,

328
00:18:52,784 --> 00:18:53,878
a lot.

329
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:57,675
Miyata-kun...

330
00:18:58,097 --> 00:19:00,081
I think you like me quite a lot.

331
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:03,227
Well, yes.

332
00:19:05,876 --> 00:19:07,829
But if it's not equal, I don't need it.

333
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,484
I may not be able to show

334
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:11,766
the weight of my love,

335
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:13,102
so I don't know if

336
00:19:13,126 --> 00:19:14,508
it comes across as equal.

337
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:17,009
But I want to

338
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:18,954
spend the rest of my life with you.

339
00:19:22,102 --> 00:19:23,086
First of all,

340
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:26,219
please fall in love with me.

341
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:47,876
Just so you know,

342
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,524
there won't be a third time,

343
00:19:51,188 --> 00:19:52,110
Senpai.

344
00:20:33,477 --> 00:20:34,368
Senpai.

345
00:20:37,313 --> 00:20:37,930
Hmm?

346
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:46,871
I was wondering if you were good at sex.

347
00:21:55,152 --> 00:21:56,223
It pisses me off.

348
00:22:12,394 --> 00:22:13,402
I love you,

349
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:14,785
Miyata-kun.

350
00:22:17,191 --> 00:22:18,355
Me too.

351
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:09,183
Thank you very much for

352
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:10,784
coming all the way here to Tokyo.

353
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:12,215
Not at all. It's my pleasure.

354
00:23:12,394 --> 00:23:13,566
Nice to meet you.

355
00:23:13,832 --> 00:23:15,558
I'm representing Sugimoto Winery.

356
00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:16,863
My name is Sugimoto.

357
00:23:17,207 --> 00:23:19,644
I'm Miyata from Tokyo Business.

358
00:23:22,472 --> 00:23:23,988
(Business Now Miyata Akihiro)

359
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:25,926
Miyata Akihiro-san.

360
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:30,276
We're from the same hometown.

361
00:23:30,346 --> 00:23:31,010
Yes.

362
00:23:31,088 --> 00:23:32,260
The same prefecture, right?

363
00:23:32,338 --> 00:23:34,157
We even attended the same middle school.

364
00:23:34,182 --> 00:23:35,877
Though I was four grades above you.

365
00:23:35,932 --> 00:23:36,962
Is that so?

366
00:23:36,963 --> 00:23:38,104
Actually, I

367
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:39,885
have a very close relationship

368
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,430
with Hoshizawa-kun.

369
00:23:44,971 --> 00:23:45,830
(Next episode)

370
00:23:45,846 --> 00:23:47,854
Should we break up?

371
00:23:47,855 --> 00:23:49,565
Takashi won't be yours.

372
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:51,385
You love brother, right?

373
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,455
You're an outsider,

374
00:23:52,471 --> 00:23:53,618
you don't need to know.

375
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:55,299
I'm not an outsider.

376
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:59,320
I've always liked Senpai.
