1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Shouldn't we consider breaking up?

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Maybe so.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Huh?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's take some time apart.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I have analyzed trends

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
over the past few years.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
- Notably...
- What's up with that?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Ah, sorry.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In 2024, particularly in Asia Pacific

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and Latin America...

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Miyata-kun,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
can I talk to you for a moment?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Sure.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry about earlier.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's good to work hard,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
but are you okay?

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
By the way, Iwanaga-sensei also...

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
supports you, right?

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
He asked for a change in editor.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I thought something was up.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
He said you were excellent and

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
wanted you to focus on

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
your job as vice chief editor,

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Is that so?

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He even sent these flowers.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It made me happy to see that you've

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
built a good relationship with him

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and that you have also grown.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Is it really going to end like this?

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
"Love is Better the Second Time Around"

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
"Final episode"

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
he hasn't contacted me at all.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Since then,

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Because I couldn't say 'I love you'.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Was that all I was to Senpai?

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Where's Sensei?

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
As I mentioned in the email.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He is quite busy at the moment,

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
so he would like to take a break.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That's...

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Where is Sensei now?

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't know.

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I see,

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
well then.

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You and the Sensei broke up, right?

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Did Senpai say that?

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Did I hit the mark?

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's not like we broke up.

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
When I look at Sensei's face,

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I can understand his feelings, you know.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I really don't understand.

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's not because your love is lacking.

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Sensei

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
has returned to Yamanashi due to

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
family circumstances.

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I knew it.

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Haa...

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I was told not to say anything,

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
but his expression at that time

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
seemed like he wanted me to tell you.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You really understand him well.

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I envy you.

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I've been watching Sensei

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
for a long time.

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But now I only have respect for him.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Because Sensei

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
doesn't look at others except from you.

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Thank you.

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
For having sent you away for adoption,

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I truly feel sorry about it.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But I had no choice at that time.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I was desperate too.

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't you understand even a little bit

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
about what it means to live here?

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
When I said I liked men,

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Mom, you suddenly became distant

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and only told me never to tell anyone.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
In the end,

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Mom, you cared more about appearances.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Back then, I understood.

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
To be accepted by others,

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
you have to hide who you are.

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
In a way, I'm grateful.

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Since leaving this house,

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I've been able to hide myself well

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and always be admired by people.

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But to suddenly ask me to

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
inherit the household now,

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
do you realize how absurd that sounds?

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Kyosuke-san.

92
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's been how many years

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
since you entered this room?

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Who knows.

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We used to play together a lot.

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's tough for you too, Takashi.

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Toyoko-san

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
had to be strict to keep things going.

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
After your father passed away,

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
she was entrusted with the company and

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
the headship of the Hoshizawa family.

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You're taking my mother's side,

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
is it because you were close to her?

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Well, I'm a part of this family.

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Kyosuke-san,

106
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
is that alright with you?

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Being made to serve my mother

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
like her errand boy.

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You should have been able

110
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
to live more freely.

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Miyata-kun...

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You were the one who told him

113
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
about the bet, right?

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What's wrong?

115
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Today, I'm leaving this house.

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I was planning to leave

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
without telling anyone,

118
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
but I wanted to tell Kyosuke-san.

119
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Will he come?

120
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Huh?

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He's just running away

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
with temporary romantic feelings.

123
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Then, let's make a bet.

124
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll bet on Miyata-kun coming.

125
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I want to believe

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
he's prepared for that.

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Takashi, what about you?

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I understand.

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll bet on him not coming.

130
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Alright,

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
blame me if you want.

132
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No,

133
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
it's fine.

134
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's the truth that I...

135
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I made a bet with Kyosuke-san

136
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and played with his feelings.

137
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I bet on him not coming

138
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
so I wouldn't get hurt.

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Even if Kyosuke-san

140
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
hadn't sent that photo,

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I think we still wouldn't

142
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
have worked out.

143
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
This was for the best.

144
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Why couldn't I believe him back then?

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Why couldn't I face him properly?

146
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I should have just checked.

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What was that photo all about?

148
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Peaceful, isn't it?

149
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Sometimes, when I

150
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
really want to be alone,

151
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I just come here.

152
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Is it okay for you to tell me that?

153
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah. It's okay.

154
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Even though Senpai usually seemed cool,

155
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
he sometimes had a sad expression.

156
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That matter has always bothered me.

157
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That was the only time I saw Senpai

158
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
in a vulnerable state.

159
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Senpai who won't allow

160
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
others to hear his cry,

161
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
has nothing changed since then?

162
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Ah, you picked up. Are you okay?

163
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I wonder.

164
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I've been wanting to have

165
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
a proper talk with you for a while.

166
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Me too.

167
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm glad.

168
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So when should we do it?

169
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
We'll meet soon.

170
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm actually on my way

171
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
to Senpai's family home.

172
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I think it's better not to.

173
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
If you care about Takashi.

174
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Why?

175
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Because I'm an outsider?

176
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You say it's none of my business

177
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
because it's about your family,

178
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
but I also have my share of

179
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
responsibility in this mess.

180
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Takashi really loves Miyata-kun.

181
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Even when his elopement was exposed,

182
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
or when he was sent away to be adopted,

183
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Takashi never mentioned your name.

184
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
He didn't want to involve you

185
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
in the family's troubles.

186
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Because you couldn't handle it, right?

187
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
He wanted to protect you.

188
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
- Even now, Takashi...
- I'm no longer a child.

189
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm going.

190
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I see.

191
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm relieved to hear that.

192
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Senpai is always like this,

193
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
pretending to be cool

194
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
and trying to carry everything alone.

195
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Mother.

196
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm going home after all.

197
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Our conversation isn't over yet, is it?

198
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I can't inherit this household.

199
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I love my current job,

200
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
the one I've chosen.

201
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And...

202
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I have someone I love.

203
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What kind of person is your partner?

204
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What are you going to do once you know?

205
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Don't tell me it's that person.

206
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It'll be troublesome if we're found out.

207
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'll bring Takashi,

208
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
so just stay here for now.

209
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Please wait.

210
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Sugimoto-san.

211
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Did you like Senpai?

212
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You're asking me that now?

213
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I just wanted to make sure.

214
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yes.

215
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But I never expressed my feelings.

216
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Well, we're relatives, after all.

217
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Looking back,

218
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm not even sure

219
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
if that was romantic affection.

220
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Sorry

221
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
about that photo.

222
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Takashi was serious about eloping.

223
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I think he regretted it a lot

224
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
for hurting you.

225
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Well, I don't know.

226
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Takashi.

227
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Did you talk to Toyoko-san properly?

228
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
No.

229
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I see.

230
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Just wait a moment.

231
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Hmm?

232
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Kyosuke-san, this book...

233
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Senpai.

234
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Miyata-kun.

235
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Why?

236
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I came to see you.

237
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
- What will you do if mother finds out?
- I'm prepared for that.

238
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I should have come earlier, really.

239
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Please let me talk to your mother.

240
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Are you saying I'm unrelated?

241
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I don't want to be an outsider anymore.

242
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Senpai, please.

243
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I...

244
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm the one from 14 years ago.

245
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
The one who made a promise

246
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
to elope with Takashi.

247
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
My name is Miyata.

248
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Later on,

249
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
we coincidentally met again in Tokyo,

250
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
both professionally and personally,

251
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
we're hoping to

252
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
continue our relationship.

253
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Why still...

254
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm truly sorry.

255
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Because my impulsive actions

256
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
that tore apart your family.

257
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I won't make the same

258
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
mistake again.

259
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
As adults, we...

260
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
we have enough responsibility

261
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
to be by each other's side.

262
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's too late now.

263
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Our family

264
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
broke apart because of that incident.

265
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Mother...

266
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I want to be with Miyata-kun.

267
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You

268
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
gave me the freedom to leave this house.

269
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
From now on...

270
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
both of us will live together.

271
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Regarding how you don't want

272
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
to take over the household,

273
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and both your desire,

274
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I understand now.

275
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Do as you wish.

276
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Once things settle down,

277
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'll come back to talk to Mother again.

278
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll still be by his side

279
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
when that happens.

280
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Mm.

281
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Miyata-kun,

282
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
take care of Takashi.

283
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yes.

284
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Mm.

285
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Senpai.

286
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Hmm?

287
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I...

288
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
will always be by your side.

289
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I love you.

290
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I've always admired your cool side,

291
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
the way you handle everything with ease.

292
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
But,

293
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
your weaknesses

294
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
and embarrassing moments,

295
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
please show me every side of you.

296
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Back in high school

297
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
whenever I saw you looking sad,

298
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I always felt that

299
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I wanted to protect you.

300
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I've loved you since then, Senpai.

301
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Hey, Miyata-kun.

302
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Shall we go far away right now?

303
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
We're just going back to Tokyo, right?

304
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Again, you...

305
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I will follow you.

306
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Forever,

307
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
all of my life.

308
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
No matter where it is.

309
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
(This is a fictional work)
