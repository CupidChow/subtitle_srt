1
00:00:24,857 --> 00:00:26,178
Please take me.

2
00:00:27,334 --> 00:00:28,623
Go wherever you want to go,

3
00:00:29,013 --> 00:00:30,201
no matter where it is.

4
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:35,763
Your eyes and warmth were so pure

5
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:37,599
that they could make me

6
00:00:38,717 --> 00:00:40,568
earnestly dream of such

7
00:00:40,576 --> 00:00:42,115
a childish idea like eloping.

8
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:00,725
Somewhere far away,

9
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,639
where nobody would berate us,

10
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,201
I just wanted to tell you

11
00:01:05,217 --> 00:01:06,138
that I like you.

12
00:01:36,874 --> 00:01:38,311
I guess you're not coming.

13
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:22,708
"Love is Better the Second Time Around"

14
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,110
"Episode 2"

15
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,310
I did it.

16
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,100
Chief Editor!

17
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,700
Umm...

18
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,390
Please assign someone else

19
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:49,538
for Iwanaga-sensei.

20
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:52,649
Huh? Is there a problem?

21
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:58,405
It seems that

22
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,179
they don't like me over there.

23
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:03,470
No, our personalities don't match.

24
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:04,609
Ah, about that,

25
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:05,835
I just got a call from

26
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,406
Iwanaga-sensei a while ago.

27
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,313
Huh?

28
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:10,961
There's no editor as splendid as

29
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:12,532
Miyata-kun.

30
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,961
I look forward to continuing

31
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:15,313
to work with him in the future.

32
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:17,907
Well,

33
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:21,235
seems like he's quite taken with you.

34
00:03:22,383 --> 00:03:23,195
Huh?

35
00:03:24,376 --> 00:03:25,735
Aren't you looking a bit pale?

36
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,438
Just a lack of sleep.

37
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:30,758
Oh well,

38
00:03:30,954 --> 00:03:32,720
are you okay?

39
00:03:33,586 --> 00:03:35,053
Iwanaga-sensei is a writer

40
00:03:35,078 --> 00:03:36,866
who can bring in good numbers.

41
00:03:37,352 --> 00:03:38,352
So we'll continue to rely

42
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,430
on you for the job.

43
00:03:40,673 --> 00:03:41,845
- Yes.
- Alright then.

44
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:51,024
What's going on?

45
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,359
You agreed to change to someone else,

46
00:03:53,384 --> 00:03:54,384
didn't you?

47
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,391
After kissing me,

48
00:03:56,859 --> 00:03:58,781
there's no way that's okay.

49
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,650
(Business Now)

50
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,690
Dammit.

51
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:06,344
He's got a nice face.

52
00:04:06,806 --> 00:04:08,961
Talking to that pretty face

53
00:04:09,126 --> 00:04:11,259
throws me off my game.

54
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,218
(A new message)

55
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,660
(When can we meet this week?)

56
00:04:25,992 --> 00:04:27,757
I have my own life.

57
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:31,007
I have work. I have a life.

58
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:33,968
I'm not in high school anymore,

59
00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:37,296
I won't conform to your pace.

60
00:04:43,913 --> 00:04:44,538
(Iwanaga Takashi
Regarding the next meeting)

61
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:45,562
(Regarding the next meeting)

62
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:47,345
Regarding the next meeting.

63
00:04:49,366 --> 00:04:50,639
I'd prefer to have

64
00:04:50,663 --> 00:04:52,452
a face-to-face meeting if possible.

65
00:04:59,742 --> 00:05:00,742
Every single time,

66
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:01,937
calling me for something that

67
00:05:01,945 --> 00:05:03,343
could have been handled through email.

68
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:04,281
Miyata-san,

69
00:05:04,663 --> 00:05:05,906
sorry to keep you waiting.

70
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:07,648
Iwanaga's running late

71
00:05:07,656 --> 00:05:09,210
due to an unexpected visitor.

72
00:05:09,882 --> 00:05:11,820
Can you wait a bit longer?

73
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:12,913
Sure.

74
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,562
If you'd like...

75
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:15,765
Thank you very much.

76
00:05:15,835 --> 00:05:16,804
I'll accept it.

77
00:05:27,984 --> 00:05:30,328
Um... so,

78
00:05:31,992 --> 00:05:33,163
have you been at

79
00:05:33,188 --> 00:05:34,718
the university for a long time?

80
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:37,038
From my student days.

81
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,773
I wasn't sure what to do,

82
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,132
and after failing to find a job,

83
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:42,039
Iwanaga-sensei picked me up.

84
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:44,663
He's my benefactor.

85
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:46,921
I see...

86
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:49,351
Miyata-san, you're an old acquaintance

87
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,882
of Iwanaga-sensei, right?

88
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:52,835
So you're aware.

89
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:54,976
I heard it from sensei.

90
00:05:55,234 --> 00:05:56,781
You were his junior in high school.

91
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,343
Oh yeah, that's right.

92
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,929
I moved away midway though.

93
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:03,867
I heard you were very cute.

94
00:06:04,382 --> 00:06:06,085
Oh no, no, that's not true.

95
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:07,546
Just average, really!

96
00:06:07,796 --> 00:06:09,054
Just average.

97
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:12,569
Well, Iwanaga-sensei

98
00:06:12,594 --> 00:06:14,594
was a famous person back then.

99
00:06:15,734 --> 00:06:16,710
I suppose so.

100
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:21,054
Miyata-san.

101
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:21,937
Yes?

102
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:24,257
You bitch.

103
00:06:24,742 --> 00:06:26,585
Don't you dare lay a hand on sensei.

104
00:06:29,296 --> 00:06:30,015
Huh?

105
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:33,882
Don't be fooled by lip service

106
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:37,726
and fall for his invitations so easily.

107
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:39,867
You should know your place,

108
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,061
you're just a editor, nothing more.

109
00:06:54,632 --> 00:06:56,992
Sensei seems like he's coming now.

110
00:07:00,358 --> 00:07:01,382
Excuse me.

111
00:07:08,171 --> 00:07:08,882
B...

112
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,437
Bitch?

113
00:07:12,054 --> 00:07:12,945
Me?

114
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,734
Bitch?

115
00:07:16,398 --> 00:07:17,780
Why did he have to

116
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,485
say it to that extent?

117
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:22,734
Hey.

118
00:07:23,148 --> 00:07:24,406
Sorry for being late.

119
00:07:26,218 --> 00:07:27,609
Shall we begin?

120
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:30,367
It's you! You're the cause!

121
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:38,490
I'm definitely going to

122
00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:42,077
get changed in assignment.

123
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:43,468
- Miyata-kun!
- Definitely going to...

124
00:07:43,843 --> 00:07:44,898
Caught up with you.

125
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:46,499
What is it?

126
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:49,671
We've had enough of our meeting.

127
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:51,765
Here, you forgot this.

128
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:53,671
Ah...

129
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:55,413
Sorry about that.

130
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:08,398
Geez...

131
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:10,156
Look at your face.

132
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:11,992
Face?

133
00:08:13,929 --> 00:08:15,077
Even if you make a face

134
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:16,561
like you want to be kissed,

135
00:08:16,585 --> 00:08:18,139
I can't fulfill your expectations

136
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:19,163
at school.

137
00:08:20,468 --> 00:08:21,569
Please refrain from

138
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:23,109
joking around too much.

139
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,007
I really don't want to be misunderstood.

140
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:30,812
I don't want to be called a bitch again.

141
00:08:31,413 --> 00:08:33,578
A bitch? Miyata-kun?

142
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:35,788
That's what he said.

143
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:37,624
Could it be...

144
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:39,523
Shiraishi-kun?

145
00:08:40,132 --> 00:08:40,984
Yes.

146
00:08:41,109 --> 00:08:42,874
Ah, I see,

147
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:44,453
sorry about that.

148
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,593
Maybe he misunderstood something,

149
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:48,452
even though we're not lovers.

150
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:50,382
But you two already did it.

151
00:08:50,507 --> 00:08:51,937
Of course he would misunderstood.

152
00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:55,421
That was a long time ago.

153
00:08:55,554 --> 00:08:57,835
Miyata-kun, hey.

154
00:09:06,163 --> 00:09:08,421
I've had enough of being pushed around.

155
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:11,781
What I should be focusing on now is

156
00:09:12,117 --> 00:09:13,756
enriching the life

157
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:15,647
I've built up until this point.

158
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,397
(Everything about marriage proposals)

159
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,230
(Engagement ring)

160
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,230
I used to think vaguely about

161
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:28,133
being with her eventually...

162
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,983
but after three years of dating,

163
00:09:29,992 --> 00:09:30,968
at 30 years old,

164
00:09:31,476 --> 00:09:33,515
maybe now is the best time.

165
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,867
This is quite unusual,

166
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,679
a restaurant with this atmosphere.

167
00:09:52,617 --> 00:09:54,382
Thought it might be nice for a change.

168
00:09:55,117 --> 00:09:55,906
Yeah...

169
00:10:10,851 --> 00:10:11,851
Ako-chan.

170
00:10:13,984 --> 00:10:16,210
Will you marry m...

171
00:10:27,398 --> 00:10:28,468
Hiro-kun!

172
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:30,992
Huh?

173
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:36,484
They say love and marriage are separate,

174
00:10:38,062 --> 00:10:40,687
but for me, I want to marry after love.

175
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:50,187
Thank you for everything until now.

176
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,546
I loved you.

177
00:11:05,061 --> 00:11:07,100
(Please marry me)

178
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:15,023
Sorry to keep you waiting.

179
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:19,851
I'm glad you contacted me.

180
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,117
So, what's up?

181
00:11:24,656 --> 00:11:26,999
It's all your fault, senpai.

182
00:11:41,624 --> 00:11:42,741
A proposal?

183
00:11:43,257 --> 00:11:44,796
Wow, I'm so happy.

184
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,929
That's three months' worth of salary.

185
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,453
Mm.

186
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:56,882
Got rejected.

187
00:11:58,882 --> 00:11:59,679
Mm.

188
00:12:00,945 --> 00:12:02,953
Since reuniting with senpai,

189
00:12:03,695 --> 00:12:05,281
everything's been messed up.

190
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:10,234
My life is a mess.

191
00:12:15,382 --> 00:12:16,483
How are you going to

192
00:12:16,508 --> 00:12:17,906
take responsibility for this?

193
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:46,351
I'll take responsibility.

194
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:48,859
Go out with me,

195
00:12:49,296 --> 00:12:50,218
Miyata-kun.

196
00:12:52,617 --> 00:12:54,538
Stop fooling around!

197
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:57,437
How much more will you ridicule me?

198
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,648
Go out with you?

199
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:02,405
And if I accept,

200
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:04,013
will you laugh like last time?

201
00:13:04,038 --> 00:13:06,390
Did you make a bet with that assistant?

202
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:08,445
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:11,788
I didn't realize I hurt you so much.

204
00:13:13,163 --> 00:13:15,195
Well, I've said what I wanted to.

205
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:16,335
Excuse me.

206
00:13:20,624 --> 00:13:21,648
About us going out,

207
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:23,130
I'm definitely saying no to that,

208
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:24,617
so please understand.

209
00:13:31,984 --> 00:13:33,210
Got rejected.

210
00:13:55,187 --> 00:13:58,031
It's okay, work is proceeding as usual.

211
00:13:58,703 --> 00:14:00,828
I can manage just fine on my own.

212
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,662
I'll take responsibility.

213
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:04,726
Go out with me.

214
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,460
Could it be was he serious?

215
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:11,585
No, no, impossible.

216
00:14:11,804 --> 00:14:13,343
He's just teasing me again,

217
00:14:13,984 --> 00:14:15,359
there's no way he was serious.

218
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:37,327
Sensei.

219
00:14:37,788 --> 00:14:38,499
Hmm?

220
00:14:45,357 --> 00:14:46,232
No.

221
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:50,522
Why not?

222
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,780
You said you're single now, sensei?

223
00:14:53,046 --> 00:14:55,663
I told you we wouldn't do that anymore.

224
00:14:56,749 --> 00:14:58,311
Let's forget about what just happened,

225
00:14:58,327 --> 00:14:59,366
and please leave.

226
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:03,108
I'm fine with a

227
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:04,789
no-strings-attached relationship.

228
00:15:05,077 --> 00:15:06,686
I just want to be held by you, sensei.

229
00:15:07,944 --> 00:15:09,053
I won't ask for

230
00:15:09,062 --> 00:15:10,319
a romantic relationship.

231
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,257
Just call me whenever you feel like it.

232
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:19,764
You're okay with being a casual hookup?

233
00:15:20,444 --> 00:15:21,092
Yes.

234
00:15:26,507 --> 00:15:28,757
I've never wanted someone like that.

235
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:31,561
Even at that previous time,

236
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:34,233
I didn't treat it as just a hookup.

237
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,545
I like you, Sensei.

238
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:52,733
I've always liked you,

239
00:15:53,123 --> 00:15:55,201
always, forever...

240
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,724
At that time, I was swayed

241
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:11,005
by your desperation...

242
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:16,123
But I regret it now,

243
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:18,069
I'm sorry.

244
00:16:19,342 --> 00:16:20,225
Besides,

245
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,654
just because I won't be yours,

246
00:16:24,037 --> 00:16:26,592
it doesn't mean I can overlook
you insulting Miyata-kun.

247
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,373
I won't forgive it next time.

248
00:16:37,303 --> 00:16:38,537
Sensei, you've been

249
00:16:38,545 --> 00:16:39,740
acting strange lately.

250
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:43,045
Is it because of that person?

251
00:16:48,412 --> 00:16:49,975
It's none of your concern.

252
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,748
Just go home.

253
00:17:13,451 --> 00:17:15,389
Since reuniting with senpai,

254
00:17:16,264 --> 00:17:18,201
everything has gotten weird.

255
00:17:21,186 --> 00:17:22,694
Things has gotten weird.

256
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:25,787
That's my line.

257
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:28,256
But

258
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:30,647
we're not kids anymore.

259
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,201
We won't be shaken by

260
00:17:32,226 --> 00:17:33,343
something like this.

261
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,493
Please stop posing.

262
00:17:58,587 --> 00:17:59,947
It's beautiful.

263
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,774
Come over here.

264
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:11,447
This is still a business meeting, right?

265
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,618
Of course.

266
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:14,861
It's also a part of our research

267
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,626
for the first web article,

268
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:18,784
'The Economics of Dating Spots'.

269
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:30,173
Should we hold hands too?

270
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:32,322
Huh?

271
00:18:33,314 --> 00:18:35,751
I'm not joking.

272
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:44,766
What should be the theme

273
00:18:44,774 --> 00:18:46,125
for our next magazine article?

274
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:48,673
Right.

275
00:18:49,446 --> 00:18:51,303
How about 'The weak yen currency

276
00:18:51,328 --> 00:18:52,858
and Honeymoon Destinations'

277
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,509
or 'Is Inflation Always Bad?'

278
00:18:54,689 --> 00:18:55,946
Something like these?

279
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:59,001
Hmm, either one works for me.

280
00:19:00,321 --> 00:19:01,704
I think a softer theme with

281
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:03,430
broader appeal would be better.

282
00:19:03,657 --> 00:19:05,157
Thanks to your looks,

283
00:19:05,407 --> 00:19:07,603
we might attract a new audience.

284
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:09,478
Oh, really?

285
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:11,180
Do you like my appearance,

286
00:19:11,204 --> 00:19:12,484
even just a bit?

287
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:15,743
Come on, tell me.

288
00:19:17,774 --> 00:19:18,649
I like it!

289
00:19:18,985 --> 00:19:20,931
Since high school,

290
00:19:21,423 --> 00:19:22,477
I've always thought

291
00:19:22,502 --> 00:19:23,781
your face was beautiful.

292
00:19:24,657 --> 00:19:25,860
Really,

293
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:28,532
your face is just amazing,

294
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:30,876
just your face alone.

295
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:47,509
That was fun, wasn't it?

296
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:50,587
Please, just stop it.

297
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:53,321
I don't want to be pushed around by you.

298
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:55,751
I want to be pushed around by you.

299
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:06,392
Stick to the agenda for next meeting.

300
00:20:06,454 --> 00:20:07,610
Come on, come on.

301
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,634
Do you have some time after this?

302
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,235
Let's take a walk.

303
00:20:11,618 --> 00:20:13,064
I think that's enough.

304
00:20:13,485 --> 00:20:14,196
You

305
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,032
have things you want to ask, right?

306
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:19,298
There are things I want to tell you too.

307
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,454
Remember when

308
00:20:25,735 --> 00:20:27,571
we went to the local river together?

309
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:29,829
Yes,

310
00:20:30,173 --> 00:20:31,806
That's an embarrassing memory.

311
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,524
I can't forget the you from back then.

312
00:20:35,556 --> 00:20:37,782
Please, forget it. Right now.

313
00:20:40,103 --> 00:20:40,814
Mm...

314
00:20:41,884 --> 00:20:43,689
Your lips were so soft.

315
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:54,399
Back then,

316
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:56,985
I actually made a bet with a friend

317
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,055
whether you'd run away with me or not.

318
00:21:00,345 --> 00:21:01,579
Right.

319
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:03,884
Senpai, you're heartless, after all.

320
00:21:05,337 --> 00:21:06,110
But

321
00:21:07,774 --> 00:21:09,305
it's true that I also felt affection

322
00:21:09,322 --> 00:21:10,368
for you back then.

323
00:21:15,337 --> 00:21:16,384
That time...

324
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:17,899
I was a little shocked

325
00:21:17,907 --> 00:21:19,133
when you didn't show up.

326
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,149
I hid my own guilt.

327
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:26,534
If we could get somewhere far away,

328
00:21:29,807 --> 00:21:30,947
I had so many things

329
00:21:30,972 --> 00:21:32,049
I wanted to tell you.

330
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:36,495
What about you?

331
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,307
You wanted to ask me something, right?

332
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,713
Which side did you bet on?

333
00:21:47,838 --> 00:21:49,159
Did you expect me to come

334
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:50,667
or not?

335
00:21:55,393 --> 00:21:56,307
Not to come.

336
00:21:57,909 --> 00:21:58,940
I was afraid of

337
00:21:59,565 --> 00:22:00,955
getting hurt if I expected it

338
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:02,283
and you didn't show up.

339
00:22:04,354 --> 00:22:05,213
I'm sorry,

340
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:07,917
I was young then.

341
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:12,651
So,

342
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,307
let's start over.

343
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:22,987
We're adults now,

344
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,916
we can make it work this time.

345
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,401
Is it okay?

346
00:22:32,432 --> 00:22:33,674
Is it really okay?

347
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:36,799
Is it really okay for me?

348
00:22:43,221 --> 00:22:44,651
I won't be fooled,

349
00:22:45,604 --> 00:22:46,791
I'm an adult now.

350
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,987
We're both in our 30s,

351
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:53,119
what's this about starting over

352
00:22:53,213 --> 00:22:54,276
and making it work?

353
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,228
Life isn't that sweet,

354
00:22:56,253 --> 00:22:58,010
I know that well enough.

355
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,814
A fleeting romance

356
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:01,025
that only last a moment,

357
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:02,932
I don't need it!

358
00:23:03,604 --> 00:23:04,869
Don't think that you can say

359
00:23:04,893 --> 00:23:06,439
anything with a melancholic expression

360
00:23:06,455 --> 00:23:07,611
and a beautiful face,

361
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:10,557
and I'll accept it all!

362
00:23:10,674 --> 00:23:12,026
And also, the deadline!

363
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:14,979
It's until next Wednesday at 3 p.m.,

364
00:23:15,643 --> 00:23:16,721
so excuse me!

365
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:25,416
I got rejected again.

366
00:23:28,026 --> 00:23:29,534
How thrilling.

367
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:32,830
I'm the one who wants you

368
00:23:32,855 --> 00:23:34,049
to take responsibility.

369
00:23:35,737 --> 00:23:37,127
You were deep inside my heart,

370
00:23:37,135 --> 00:23:38,760
and now that you've reappeared,

371
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:40,463
stirring up my feelings

372
00:23:40,488 --> 00:23:41,791
for you once more.

373
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,978
(This is a fictional work)

374
00:23:44,994 --> 00:23:45,557
(Next episode)

375
00:23:45,565 --> 00:23:46,893
Isn't that my relationship

376
00:23:46,901 --> 00:23:47,978
with you, sensei?

377
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:48,971
That we're lovers?

378
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:50,227
Apparently, he couldn't

379
00:23:50,236 --> 00:23:51,509
contact Iwanaka-sensei.

380
00:23:51,658 --> 00:23:53,095
Why do you have to mess with me?

381
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:55,078
We're not high school students anymore.
