1
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,260
(Deposit balance)

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:10,930
Alright.

3
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:13,361
With this,

4
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:15,252
I can go anywhere with Senpai,

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,203
and we should be okay for a while.

6
00:00:18,078 --> 00:00:20,164
It was good to save New Year's money!

7
00:00:23,313 --> 00:00:24,595
Since Hoshizawa Senpai

8
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:25,983
is the son of a wealthy family,

9
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:27,713
he probably doesn't even think

10
00:00:27,738 --> 00:00:29,258
about money, right?

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:38,940
(From K)

12
00:00:38,965 --> 00:00:40,585
Dear Miyata-kun,

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,840
you got played.

14
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:44,777
- I made a bet...
- I made a bet

15
00:00:44,802 --> 00:00:46,472
where you'd run off with him.

16
00:01:09,255 --> 00:01:11,575
Before anger or sadness,

17
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:13,123
what came first was

18
00:01:13,148 --> 00:01:14,373
intense embarrassment.

19
00:01:15,248 --> 00:01:18,490
I wanted to disappear from this world.

20
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:03,660
"Love is Better the Second Time Around"

21
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,970
"Episode 5"

22
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,460
I heard you started your own business

23
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:07,506
while still in university.

24
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,080
Yes.

25
00:02:08,418 --> 00:02:09,208
At the time,

26
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,437
I thought I could do anything

27
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:11,676
just because I liked it.

28
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,989
It was like I was running

29
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:14,278
with just my feelings.

30
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:16,411
That's remarkable initiative.

31
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:19,028
What was the motivation

32
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:20,550
behind starting a winery?

33
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:21,645
Ah...

34
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:24,669
I fell in love.

35
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:29,067
My relatives owned a sake brewery,

36
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:31,872
and initially, I helped out there.

37
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:33,950
But during my study abroad in France,

38
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:35,481
I encountered wine.

39
00:02:36,192 --> 00:02:38,348
And the moment I tasted it,

40
00:02:38,794 --> 00:02:41,083
I knew I couldn't love anything else.

41
00:02:41,403 --> 00:02:42,746
What are your future goals?

42
00:02:42,794 --> 00:02:44,075
My current dream is to

43
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,301
elevate the brand value of Koshu wine

44
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,488
and let it soar

45
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:48,926
even further into the world.

46
00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:51,005
You have a wonderful dream.

47
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:53,364
Well, having a vision is important.

48
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:55,285
At first, you may be able to

49
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:56,223
run on love alone,

50
00:02:56,247 --> 00:02:57,809
but that won't last for a long time.

51
00:02:58,418 --> 00:03:00,325
To protect what you love,

52
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,004
you have to be prepared

53
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:03,238
and have a clear vision.

54
00:03:03,872 --> 00:03:05,723
You think so too, don't you, Miyata-san.

55
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:06,715
Yes.

56
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,950
That's right.

57
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:13,606
I believe in you...

58
00:03:14,755 --> 00:03:15,739
in my wine.

59
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:19,676
I'm sorry, you even gave me your wine.

60
00:03:19,715 --> 00:03:20,598
No, no.

61
00:03:20,973 --> 00:03:22,473
Oh, Miyata-san.

62
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:26,637
Takashi will never be yours.

63
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:27,981
Give up.

64
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:29,403
Huh?

65
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,075
(Until we meet again)
Au revoir.

66
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:36,442
It's a French-style farewell.

67
00:03:40,723 --> 00:03:42,083
Wait, please.

68
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:44,044
You'll be abandoned again,

69
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:46,325
just like that time.

70
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:49,176
You saw that photo, right?

71
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,653
I bet that you would come.

72
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:56,114
Sugimoto-san is...

73
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:59,122
You didn't come that day.

74
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:01,098
And in the end,

75
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,324
because rumors spread about

76
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:04,910
him running off with another guy,

77
00:04:04,934 --> 00:04:06,520
Takashi was put up for adoption.

78
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,887
Au revoir.

79
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:21,949
He's the one

80
00:04:22,598 --> 00:04:24,551
who sent that photo.

81
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,262
What is he to Senpai?

82
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:34,637
(Is Sugimoto-san Senpai's...)
Is Sugimoto-san Senpai's...

83
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,489
Let's stop.

84
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:40,262
He's probably just another fling.

85
00:04:43,274 --> 00:04:44,488
I won't forgive you

86
00:04:44,496 --> 00:04:46,168
if you're still involved with him,

87
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:48,383
Senpai.

88
00:04:49,493 --> 00:04:50,625
Miyata-san,

89
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:52,241
thank you very much for today,

90
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:53,305
it was reassuring to

91
00:04:53,313 --> 00:04:54,554
have you by my side.

92
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:56,141
Ah, yeah.

93
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:59,430
Sugimoto-san was wonderful, wasn't he?

94
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:00,852
As expected of someone

95
00:05:00,877 --> 00:05:01,952
who studied in France,

96
00:05:01,977 --> 00:05:03,188
he was so passionate.

97
00:05:03,813 --> 00:05:06,758
Oh, was my interview okay?

98
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,938
I think it was good.

99
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:09,586
So next time, you can do it alone...

100
00:05:09,587 --> 00:05:10,954
Miyata-kun,

101
00:05:11,383 --> 00:05:13,030
I'll count on you for the next time too.

102
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:14,758
It's the duty of a deputy editor

103
00:05:14,783 --> 00:05:16,500
to train Sato-san properly.

104
00:05:19,726 --> 00:05:20,335
Alright.

105
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:31,146
(Porthill Yokohama)

106
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,522
Miyata-kun, you're the

107
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:33,796
deputy chief editor now.

108
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:35,077
Congratulations.

109
00:05:35,427 --> 00:05:36,880
Thank you.

110
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:39,108
But coming to such

111
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:40,890
a luxurious restaurant like this...

112
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:42,491
Don't I seem out of place?

113
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:46,163
You fit right in.

114
00:05:48,109 --> 00:05:49,452
Seriously, the night view

115
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:50,499
here is stunning.

116
00:05:51,624 --> 00:05:52,999
Makes you feel like you're really

117
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:54,062
working in the city.

118
00:05:55,226 --> 00:05:56,030
Excuse me.

119
00:05:57,421 --> 00:05:58,093
Thank you.

120
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:06,890
Huh?

121
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:11,374
Congratulations again, Miyata-kun.

122
00:06:21,124 --> 00:06:22,718
Shall I take a photo for you?

123
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,765
Please do.

124
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:28,241
Over here, over here.

125
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:34,616
Let me take your picture.

126
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:37,898
Alright. Cheese.

127
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:42,460
Thank you.

128
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:52,136
Yeah.

129
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:58,981
I'm not happy at all.

130
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,817
I like your face,

131
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:03,317
it's great!

132
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:06,317
You're seriously the worst, Senpai.

133
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:08,293
I'm the type who

134
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:10,168
feeds bait to caught fish.

135
00:07:12,285 --> 00:07:13,551
I was starting to

136
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:15,473
like you a bit recently,

137
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:19,027
but now I think I hate you.

138
00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:23,528
Seems like I messed up.

139
00:07:23,707 --> 00:07:25,121
Hey...

140
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:36,239
Hey, Miyata-kun.

141
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,285
Do you want to live together?

142
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:45,067
Ah. Sorry,

143
00:07:45,356 --> 00:07:46,363
living together is

144
00:07:46,372 --> 00:07:47,441
a bit too much for me.

145
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:49,301
I've had a bad experience before,

146
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:50,449
so I'm a bit wary.

147
00:07:52,176 --> 00:07:55,910
You casually talk about your ex, huh?

148
00:07:58,309 --> 00:08:01,020
So, I can't accept this.

149
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:04,785
Keep it.

150
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:06,871
You can use it when you

151
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,910
come visit me.

152
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,598
For now, it's enough.

153
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,739
I got it.

154
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,918
I was actually happy.

155
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:30,864
But

156
00:08:31,723 --> 00:08:32,972
if I rush forward with

157
00:08:32,997 --> 00:08:34,340
just feelings of love

158
00:08:34,793 --> 00:08:35,886
and end up experiencing

159
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:37,121
the same feelings as before...

160
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:48,410
(Cheers)
Sante.

161
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,981
Mmm,

162
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:00,154
becoming more of a fine man,

163
00:09:00,163 --> 00:09:01,522
aren't you, young master?

164
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,035
Your brother is delighted.

165
00:09:04,465 --> 00:09:05,871
I said it before.

166
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:08,324
I hate being called that.

167
00:09:08,457 --> 00:09:09,738
It's been a while,

168
00:09:09,763 --> 00:09:11,425
can't you be a bit happier?

169
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,238
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

170
00:09:14,777 --> 00:09:15,964
Did something happen

171
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,316
at Hoshizawa's house?

172
00:09:18,215 --> 00:09:21,433
Toyoko-san wants you to come back home.

173
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:25,238
After sending me away as an adoptee,

174
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:26,263
why now?

175
00:09:26,496 --> 00:09:27,793
Reina-san is apparently

176
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,066
getting married soon.

177
00:09:29,121 --> 00:09:30,074
Reina?

178
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:32,817
That's good.

179
00:09:33,223 --> 00:09:36,355
It seems her partner is from overseas.

180
00:09:36,465 --> 00:09:38,926
Reina-san also strongly wishes

181
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,434
to live in that country.

182
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:44,137
I see.

183
00:09:48,957 --> 00:09:50,074
So the son-in-law

184
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,620
can't take over the family?

185
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:52,528
Yes.

186
00:09:53,598 --> 00:09:55,370
They want you to come back home

187
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,339
and take over the family business.

188
00:09:59,871 --> 00:10:02,879
For all the trouble you've caused,

189
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:04,378
isn't it about time

190
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:05,628
you repaid the family?

191
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:08,394
Big brother.

192
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:18,168
Geez, you're too serious.

193
00:10:18,832 --> 00:10:20,160
If it's anything other than

194
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:21,191
returning to the family,

195
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:22,973
let me know how I can help.

196
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,106
Oh right.

197
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:26,988
The other day,

198
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:29,754
I met someone nostalgic.

199
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,280
(Business Now Miyata Akihiro)

200
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,089
He looked delicious growing up,

201
00:10:34,114 --> 00:10:35,114
didn't he?

202
00:10:35,621 --> 00:10:36,801
Should I try tasting him?

203
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,363
Kyosuke-san,

204
00:10:39,418 --> 00:10:40,113
Hmm?

205
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:42,824
Do you really want to anger me?

206
00:10:43,348 --> 00:10:45,512
How scary,

207
00:10:45,606 --> 00:10:47,184
young master.

208
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:08,113
I was waiting for you.

209
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:10,410
Is something wrong?

210
00:11:11,473 --> 00:11:12,832
It's nothing.

211
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:18,574
What's this? A5 rank beef.

212
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:19,770
It's Koshu beef.

213
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:21,840
Sent from my house.

214
00:11:22,113 --> 00:11:24,434
Your family sure is rich.

215
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:26,371
But this doesn't suit curry.

216
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:27,317
Huh?

217
00:11:27,504 --> 00:11:30,231
I wanted to eat your curry though.

218
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:32,176
It'd be a waste.

219
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:34,653
Let's make teppanyaki.

220
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,184
Teppanyaki...

221
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:38,800
Look, there's an

222
00:11:38,816 --> 00:11:40,535
expensive-looking wine here...

223
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:40,848
too...

224
00:11:40,848 --> 00:11:41,660
(Sugimoto Winery)
too...

225
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,160
too...

226
00:11:43,293 --> 00:11:45,496
Oh, that's a gift.

227
00:11:48,738 --> 00:11:49,800
I also met Sugimoto-san

228
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:50,785
during an interview.

229
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:51,317
Mmm.

230
00:11:51,348 --> 00:11:53,184
I don't need excuses.

231
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:54,934
I can guess what kind of

232
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,170
relationship you have.

233
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,793
It's not like that.

234
00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:01,965
He's from a branch family

235
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,105
of the Hoshizawa clan

236
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:04,667
and was like a mentor to me,

237
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:05,824
like an older brother.

238
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:09,488
What did he teach you?

239
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,003
It's not like that.

240
00:12:12,473 --> 00:12:14,082
He was someone who understands me

241
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:16,371
and helped me a lot in the past.

242
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:19,137
It's a story from a distant past.

243
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:21,481
The past, huh.

244
00:12:22,723 --> 00:12:24,043
I don't care.

245
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,457
Really?

246
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:30,059
Really.

247
00:12:43,574 --> 00:12:44,840
What is it?

248
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,410
Miyata-kun, you're so cute.

249
00:12:48,543 --> 00:12:50,574
It's just onion irritation.

250
00:12:51,324 --> 00:12:52,309
Hmm.

251
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,692
Cute.

252
00:12:55,528 --> 00:12:57,793
Hearing 'cute' to a 30-year-old man...

253
00:12:59,176 --> 00:13:01,309
even if it's flattery, it's still nice.

254
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,270
So, I was turned down.

255
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:07,941
I understand.

256
00:13:08,113 --> 00:13:09,770
I'll think of another plan.

257
00:13:11,011 --> 00:13:11,628
Yes.

258
00:13:17,113 --> 00:13:18,542
I just want what's truly best

259
00:13:18,558 --> 00:13:19,613
for Takashi...

260
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,670
(Sugimoto Kyosuke
Regarding the next meeting)

261
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,670
Sugimoto Kyosuke
Regarding the next meeting.

262
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,848
(Type C room Type D room)

263
00:13:36,934 --> 00:13:38,348
Oh, the bathroom here

264
00:13:38,373 --> 00:13:40,053
looks spacious and nice.

265
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,395
If you have no business here,

266
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:42,223
please leave.

267
00:13:42,248 --> 00:13:43,177
I'll leave soon.

268
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,005
Once I get a favorable
response from you.

269
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:53,887
Hello. Miyata from

270
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:55,465
Tokyo Business Company.

271
00:13:55,489 --> 00:13:58,794
Miyata-san, I've been expecting you.

272
00:13:59,044 --> 00:13:59,801
Why...

273
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:01,419
Sugimoto-san designated

274
00:14:01,444 --> 00:14:03,092
this place for the meeting.

275
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,028
Thank you for accommodating

276
00:14:05,036 --> 00:14:06,448
the sudden change.

277
00:14:06,473 --> 00:14:07,473
Likewise.

278
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,653
In fact, thank you for

279
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:10,113
choosing such a wonderful place.

280
00:14:10,137 --> 00:14:11,098
I'm glad you like it.

281
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,934
Please, have a seat here.

282
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,570
(Where dreams and wine are cultivated)
This is the proof.

283
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:18,395
(Where dreams and wine are cultivated)

284
00:14:18,748 --> 00:14:19,770
Hmm, nice colors.

285
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:21,653
I'm glad I chose this suit.

286
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,270
Right, Iwanaga-san?

287
00:14:23,887 --> 00:14:24,879
It suits you.

288
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,380
I think I'll go with navy blue

289
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:29,068
for the next interview.

290
00:14:29,364 --> 00:14:32,864
I don't want my muscles to look obvious.

291
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,262
That's right.

292
00:14:34,301 --> 00:14:35,770
Actually, navy blue can be

293
00:14:35,795 --> 00:14:37,475
tricky to print.

294
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:39,934
You mean...

295
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:42,348
This kind of color?

296
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,169
Stop it.

297
00:14:45,575 --> 00:14:46,661
Are you planning to involve

298
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,832
Miyata-kun who's unrelated?

299
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:49,028
It's relevant.

300
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,426
Miyata-san,

301
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:52,981
would you mind if Takashi-san

302
00:14:53,006 --> 00:14:54,137
returns to his family home?

303
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,544
Huh?

304
00:14:56,005 --> 00:14:57,270
Oh?

305
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:00,247
Oh? You didn't know?

306
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:02,864
His mother strongly wishes

307
00:15:02,926 --> 00:15:04,160
for Takashi-san to

308
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:05,833
inherit the family household.

309
00:15:06,075 --> 00:15:08,044
After that incident, she's the one who

310
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:10,559
sent Takashi away for adoption.

311
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,825
She's the one who's against

312
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,973
his relationship with you.

313
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:14,059
Enough.

314
00:15:14,286 --> 00:15:16,005
I never agreed to it.

315
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,981
Miyata-kun, you're an outsider,

316
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,551
you don't need to hear this.

317
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:23,403
I'm not an outsider.

318
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:26,301
I'm your lover.

319
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:32,997
Senpai is my lover.

320
00:15:33,637 --> 00:15:34,903
I won't break up with him,

321
00:15:35,036 --> 00:15:36,325
whether it's family or not,

322
00:15:36,387 --> 00:15:37,590
I won't allow anyone

323
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:39,295
to manipulate his life.

324
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:41,200
Wow.

325
00:15:41,262 --> 00:15:43,091
How cool.

326
00:15:44,872 --> 00:15:45,481
Well,

327
00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:47,473
I have to go back there today,

328
00:15:47,497 --> 00:15:48,770
so I'll leave now.

329
00:15:48,934 --> 00:15:50,301
I'll report today's events

330
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:51,526
to your mother.

331
00:16:05,473 --> 00:16:06,544
Senpai,

332
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:10,348
if we ever break up in the future,

333
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:12,591
feel free to do as you please,

334
00:16:15,091 --> 00:16:16,887
even if I'll be an outsider then.

335
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,880
Being an outsider isn't what you think.

336
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:23,325
Is that so?

337
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:25,637
Miyata-kun.

338
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:28,739
Yes?

339
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:31,277
I love you.

340
00:16:42,762 --> 00:16:44,544
Even if you said you didn't care,

341
00:16:46,317 --> 00:16:48,325
but were you actually feeling jealous?

342
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:56,411
Do you want to find out?

343
00:16:57,348 --> 00:16:58,403
In bed.

344
00:17:05,426 --> 00:17:06,630
He says he loves me,

345
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,005
he talks about living together,

346
00:17:10,036 --> 00:17:11,246
but he never tells me

347
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:12,879
the important things.

348
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,094
Am I just an outsider?

349
00:17:35,757 --> 00:17:37,124
Mmm!

350
00:17:38,686 --> 00:17:39,733
I could eat your

351
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,991
homemade curry every day, Miyata-kun.

352
00:17:42,632 --> 00:17:44,022
Your way of seducing someone

353
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:45,132
is so old-fashioned.

354
00:17:45,905 --> 00:17:47,241
Is it?

355
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:49,819
Well, Miyata-kun,

356
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:55,679
you're not in high school anymore.

357
00:17:57,311 --> 00:17:58,623
You're probably embarrassed

358
00:17:58,655 --> 00:18:00,123
about doing stuff like this, right?

359
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:01,007
No,

360
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:02,780
it's cute.

361
00:18:06,827 --> 00:18:07,991
Mmm...

362
00:18:13,781 --> 00:18:14,803
Is the sake from

363
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,280
your family's house good?

364
00:18:16,632 --> 00:18:17,710
Well...

365
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:19,749
I wouldn't really recommend it.

366
00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:21,515
Why not?

367
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:22,679
Oh!

368
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:29,140
Well, it doesn't concern me, I guess.

369
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:30,983
Let's drop it.

370
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:32,897
Right now, I want to savor

371
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:34,482
Miyata-kun's love curry.

372
00:18:34,507 --> 00:18:35,601
Don't avoid the question.

373
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,780
Maybe it's you who's avoiding.

374
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:46,483
Huh?

375
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:48,225
I've been thinking about you all along.

376
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:49,491
- If...
- What?

377
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,202
I just want you to do nothing

378
00:18:52,663 --> 00:18:53,561
for now, okay?

379
00:19:03,765 --> 00:19:04,671
Mmm.

380
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:13,452
It's on your mouth. How cute.

381
00:19:13,491 --> 00:19:14,499
Don't touch me.

382
00:19:15,397 --> 00:19:16,475
Please stop.

383
00:19:16,843 --> 00:19:17,850
It's still stuck.

384
00:19:22,046 --> 00:19:22,655
Reina.

385
00:19:22,968 --> 00:19:24,843
It's been a while, big brother.

386
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:27,600
I said I'd refrain from coming today,

387
00:19:27,757 --> 00:19:29,038
but Sugimoto-san...

388
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,358
It's fine.

389
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,960
But my lover is here.

390
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,835
Nice to meet you, I'm Miyata.

391
00:19:44,624 --> 00:19:45,397
Reina.

392
00:19:46,374 --> 00:19:47,577
Congratulations on your marriage.

393
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:50,202
I'm sorry

394
00:19:50,671 --> 00:19:51,897
for all this.

395
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:55,092
You don't have to return

396
00:19:55,108 --> 00:19:56,334
to the family home.

397
00:19:58,241 --> 00:20:01,569
I could never forgive Mom.

398
00:20:02,155 --> 00:20:04,163
Once I decided to leave home,

399
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:06,421
she ordered you to return.

400
00:20:07,468 --> 00:20:08,835
She's so self-centered.

401
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:12,194
Reina,

402
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:14,498
just focus on being happy

403
00:20:14,522 --> 00:20:16,038
with the person you love.

404
00:20:16,772 --> 00:20:18,624
I'll take care of everything else.

405
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:27,413
Shall I make some warm tea?

406
00:20:28,288 --> 00:20:28,999
I'll help.

407
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,882
Oh, me too...

408
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:30,835
Miyata-san.

409
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:32,983
Yes?

410
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,890
Please take care

411
00:20:43,148 --> 00:20:44,348
of my brother.

412
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:47,866
Um...

413
00:20:48,983 --> 00:20:50,319
I was actually the cause of

414
00:20:50,344 --> 00:20:51,741
what happened back then.

415
00:20:53,499 --> 00:20:54,741
You're the one who was

416
00:20:54,765 --> 00:20:56,092
going to run away with him?

417
00:20:57,077 --> 00:20:58,288
I'm sorry.

418
00:20:58,741 --> 00:21:00,038
Because of me

419
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:01,991
things became strained between

420
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:03,287
your mother and him,

421
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:06,741
and he ended up separated from you.

422
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:12,999
Do you love my brother?

423
00:21:27,227 --> 00:21:27,868
Here you go.

424
00:21:31,086 --> 00:21:31,788
Here you go.

425
00:21:37,788 --> 00:21:39,843
We're still exploring whether

426
00:21:40,608 --> 00:21:42,585
we can continue to love each other.

427
00:21:42,804 --> 00:21:43,835
But...

428
00:21:49,054 --> 00:21:50,179
Don't worry.

429
00:21:51,725 --> 00:21:54,475
Because I love Miyata-kun.

430
00:22:13,647 --> 00:22:14,866
I'm sorry.

431
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:17,022
I...

432
00:22:26,522 --> 00:22:27,475
It's okay.

433
00:22:29,358 --> 00:22:31,163
Why are you making that face?

434
00:22:31,459 --> 00:22:32,397
What face?

435
00:22:34,288 --> 00:22:35,374
Because...

436
00:22:44,444 --> 00:22:46,686
Shouldn't we consider breaking up?

437
00:22:50,116 --> 00:22:50,960
Maybe so.

438
00:22:53,077 --> 00:22:53,655
Huh?

439
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,440
Let's take some time apart.

440
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:26,554
I've always loved Senpai.

441
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:30,093
Always.

442
00:23:44,952 --> 00:23:45,701
(Final episode)

443
00:23:45,702 --> 00:23:47,826
Miyata-san and Sensei have broken up.

444
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:50,124
It's better not to follow Takashi.

445
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:50,929
Why not?

446
00:23:50,936 --> 00:23:51,952
You're an outsider.

447
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,655
I can't inherit the family household,

448
00:23:53,718 --> 00:23:55,061
I have a lover.

449
00:23:55,344 --> 00:23:56,656
Senpai is always like this.

450
00:23:56,711 --> 00:23:57,914
You like to act cool and

451
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,570
bear everything by yourself.
