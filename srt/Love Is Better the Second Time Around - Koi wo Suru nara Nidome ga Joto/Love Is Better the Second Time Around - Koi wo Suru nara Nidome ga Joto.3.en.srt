1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,429
Oh, you're went to Indonesia

2
00:00:02,438 --> 00:00:03,734
for the conference?

3
00:00:03,758 --> 00:00:04,609
That sounds great.

4
00:00:04,813 --> 00:00:05,547
Yeah,

5
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:08,602
the schedule was tight and hectic.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,664
Ah,

7
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,102
here,

8
00:00:14,758 --> 00:00:16,328
- a souvenir.
- Huh?

9
00:00:16,898 --> 00:00:18,344
You really shouldn't have.

10
00:00:18,805 --> 00:00:21,047
- But wait, is this…
- Come on,

11
00:00:21,727 --> 00:00:22,719
just take it.

12
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:24,781
Pure white pearls.

13
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:27,672
I can't accept this.

14
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:30,031
- Why not?
- Think about it sensibly.

15
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:31,242
Giving a pricey gift

16
00:00:31,258 --> 00:00:32,185
to a business partner...

17
00:00:32,218 --> 00:00:33,358
What are you talking about?

18
00:00:33,594 --> 00:00:36,031
I'm a man trying to win you over.

19
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,938
Huh?

20
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:40,906
Just seeing your reaction

21
00:00:41,343 --> 00:00:43,336
made it worth it, cost-wise.

22
00:00:46,758 --> 00:00:48,828
I'll respectfully return this.

23
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,938
I thought it would suit you.

24
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:56,930
Oh well.

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,007
Alright!

26
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:01,062
- How about lunch together after this?
- I'm going home.

27
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,366
No time for lunch?

28
00:01:07,382 --> 00:01:08,999
What kind of management system

29
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:10,475
does your company have?

30
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:12,350
You needn't worry.

31
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:13,608
We operate ethically.

32
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,413
Miyata-kun, you're too upright.

33
00:01:17,554 --> 00:01:19,249
Even though we've kissed before.

34
00:01:19,507 --> 00:01:20,694
That remark is a perfect case

35
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,866
of sexual harassment.

36
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:22,991
I can sue you.

37
00:01:26,944 --> 00:01:27,890
Good job.

38
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,374
Going out for lunch for a bit.

39
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:31,358
Understood.

40
00:01:33,335 --> 00:01:34,492
Hmm?

41
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:36,405
How about something ethnic?

42
00:01:36,577 --> 00:01:37,608
There's a delicious

43
00:01:37,624 --> 00:01:39,116
Vietnamese restaurant nearby.

44
00:01:39,937 --> 00:01:41,679
I already told you I'm going home.

45
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:43,498
Haa...

46
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,263
Poor thing...

47
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,114
No, wait, who am I to judge?

48
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,568
Nothing's going to happen between

49
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:07,196
me and Senpai.

50
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,847
"Love is Better the Second Time Around"

51
00:02:51,848 --> 00:02:52,567
"Episode 3"

52
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:53,949
I can't believe Sasaki-san

53
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,765
is leaving for another job.

54
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:57,527
We're losing another colleague

55
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:58,731
who shares our age.

56
00:02:58,756 --> 00:03:00,192
Looks like the group is dwindling

57
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,488
down to just Miyata-san.

58
00:03:01,701 --> 00:03:03,434
Talk about bad luck.

59
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:05,286
Well,

60
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:07,419
if you're so particular about editing,

61
00:03:07,497 --> 00:03:09,606
wouldn't it be better to go freelance?

62
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:11,731
I'm considering it too.

63
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:13,645
I prefer running around instead of

64
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:15,216
being buried in paperwork.

65
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:18,417
Thinking about changing jobs?

66
00:03:18,442 --> 00:03:19,278
That's right

67
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:21,864
thirty is that kind of age.

68
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,918
'Late twenties' is just a fluffy term to

69
00:03:25,317 --> 00:03:26,757
deceive yourself.

70
00:03:27,114 --> 00:03:28,223
It's not an age where

71
00:03:28,248 --> 00:03:29,403
you can play around with

72
00:03:29,428 --> 00:03:30,512
love and romance.

73
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,278
Hmm, it's tough.

74
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,739
Printing paper is more

75
00:03:35,763 --> 00:03:37,192
challenging than expected.

76
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,636
With the main East Business

77
00:03:38,661 --> 00:03:40,041
magazine sales dropping like this.

78
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:41,520
And considering our target audience

79
00:03:41,528 --> 00:03:42,895
is mostly in their 40's or older.

80
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:46,526
How long can we keep publishing "Business
Now" for younger audiences in print...

81
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:48,497
True.

82
00:03:48,614 --> 00:03:50,544
So, with that said,

83
00:03:50,786 --> 00:03:52,341
the new web magazine,

84
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,481
Miyata-kun will lead it.

85
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:55,286
Oh.

86
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:56,928
You'll still have to do Business Now.

87
00:03:56,997 --> 00:03:58,348
Huh? Me?

88
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:00,402
The target is young career women, right?

89
00:04:00,403 --> 00:04:02,028
Don't worry.

90
00:04:02,356 --> 00:04:03,762
But if it fails,

91
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:05,223
it'll be on you, Miyata-kun.

92
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,699
Also,

93
00:04:07,731 --> 00:04:10,867
ask Iwanaga-sensei for a new serial.

94
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,598
Huh?

95
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:13,091
Again?

96
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,044
Yes.

97
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:16,809
Sensei,

98
00:04:17,106 --> 00:04:18,481
please, I'm counting on you.

99
00:04:19,598 --> 00:04:22,052
Hmm, what should I do?

100
00:04:22,598 --> 00:04:23,769
Lately, I've been getting

101
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:24,887
some recognition,

102
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:27,114
and I have other offers too.

103
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:29,872
But, sensei, we are close, right?

104
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,450
As lovers?

105
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,348
No.

106
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,606
Hmm...

107
00:04:35,887 --> 00:04:37,262
alright,

108
00:04:38,434 --> 00:04:39,450
let's do it.

109
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:41,270
Thank you so much!

110
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:43,301
It'll also give me more chances

111
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,294
to see Miyata-kun.

112
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:46,122
It's an honor.

113
00:04:46,614 --> 00:04:47,216
Ah.

114
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:50,825
Sorry, can I take this?

115
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:51,731
Of course.

116
00:04:53,716 --> 00:04:54,395
Hello.

117
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:56,161
Yes.

118
00:04:56,536 --> 00:04:57,052
Yes.

119
00:04:57,825 --> 00:04:59,200
Yes, this is Takashi.

120
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:00,809
Aha.

121
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:02,919
Oh, thank you for calling me.

122
00:05:04,473 --> 00:05:06,052
Yeah. Did you check my email?

123
00:05:06,543 --> 00:05:07,255
Okay.

124
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:09,574
I'm also concerned about

125
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,644
the impact of the change in government.

126
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:13,277
It'll be great if

127
00:05:13,285 --> 00:05:14,738
we can discuss that further.

128
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:17,028
About that, right?

129
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:19,958
Let me just double-check.

130
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:22,755
I have that papers here.

131
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:24,880
Sorry, can we call it a day?

132
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:25,739
Yes.

133
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:28,762
Sorry, what were you saying?

134
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:31,153
Ah, a moment, please.

135
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:33,106
Oh, Shiraishi-kun. Perfect timing.

136
00:05:33,286 --> 00:05:34,731
Can you see Miyata-kun off for me?

137
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,380
Understood.

138
00:05:38,016 --> 00:05:38,993
Sorry.

139
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:51,694
Miyata-san, hello.

140
00:05:52,413 --> 00:05:53,413
Would you like to have

141
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:54,358
a chat if you like?

142
00:05:55,827 --> 00:05:56,663
Yes.

143
00:05:57,632 --> 00:05:58,765
Come on,

144
00:05:59,085 --> 00:06:01,405
don't be so wary of me.

145
00:06:02,023 --> 00:06:02,929
Ah...

146
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:09,054
Being an editor seems tough.

147
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:10,944
Weekly meetings and all.

148
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:12,108
Well, no.

149
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,382
Personally, I hope

150
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,272
he'll focus more on his main job

151
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:17,522
than magazine serials.

152
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:19,851
Sensei is so busy that I wonder

153
00:06:20,335 --> 00:06:23,194
when he sleeps or rests.

154
00:06:23,726 --> 00:06:26,273
Well, we're grateful for your support.

155
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:36,812
Well then.

156
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:40,710
Miyata-san.

157
00:06:42,358 --> 00:06:43,202
I...

158
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:45,905
have decided to give up on Sensei.

159
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,640
Huh?

160
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:51,194
Is that so...

161
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:52,740
Because no matter

162
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:54,592
how much I try to approach sensei,

163
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:57,577
he just doesn't respond at all.

164
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:00,679
I'm a bit tired of it.

165
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:04,085
Well,

166
00:07:04,515 --> 00:07:06,210
I'm not entirely sure...

167
00:07:06,765 --> 00:07:08,413
but is that a good thing for you?

168
00:07:11,202 --> 00:07:12,858
Who would say that,

169
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:13,952
old man?

170
00:07:16,132 --> 00:07:16,882
Huh?

171
00:07:19,312 --> 00:07:20,327
I'm saying

172
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:22,553
you're not the one welcomed here.

173
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:23,999
Goodbye.

174
00:07:30,671 --> 00:07:31,929
What's with that guy...

175
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:54,077
It's amazing,

176
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,905
the power some people have

177
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:57,100
when it comes to love.

178
00:08:03,304 --> 00:08:05,468
I had that too once,

179
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:06,804
the power of youthful,

180
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:08,332
passionate love...

181
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:24,327
Hoshizawa-senpai,

182
00:08:24,898 --> 00:08:26,507
what are your plans for the future?

183
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,427
Probably Tohoku University.

184
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:31,506
I knew it,

185
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,023
that's amazing.

186
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:36,015
But...

187
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:38,218
Right...

188
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,163
You'll be leaving your hometown,

189
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:44,406
won't you?

190
00:08:45,577 --> 00:08:47,257
Well, I have not

191
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,319
completely decided yet.

192
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:51,701
Still unsure about which department.

193
00:08:51,873 --> 00:08:53,459
Senpai, you can become

194
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:55,928
anything you want to be.

195
00:08:56,812 --> 00:09:00,702
I'll always be rooting for you.

196
00:09:05,218 --> 00:09:06,194
Hey,

197
00:09:07,593 --> 00:09:09,233
why do you cheer for me?

198
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:14,991
Because I like you.

199
00:09:17,937 --> 00:09:19,108
Senpai,

200
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:22,808
how do you feel about me?

201
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:26,718
Come to think of it,

202
00:09:26,952 --> 00:09:29,483
even back then, I was being teased.

203
00:09:30,554 --> 00:09:32,890
Poor high school me.

204
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:37,452
Well, we're still working.

205
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:39,265
Looks like someone's motivated.

206
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:41,333
Well, just a little.

207
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:42,520
Just a little?

208
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,624
Oh!

209
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:45,053
Miyata-kun, looks like

210
00:09:45,077 --> 00:09:46,459
things are going smoothly.

211
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:47,249
Thank you.

212
00:09:47,288 --> 00:09:49,343
Wow, you've been working hard.

213
00:09:49,601 --> 00:09:50,437
Thank you.

214
00:09:54,964 --> 00:09:55,823
Chief Editor.

215
00:10:02,748 --> 00:10:04,092
(February)

216
00:10:04,099 --> 00:10:06,099
(Deadline for the serialization)

217
00:10:07,382 --> 00:10:08,273
Huh?

218
00:10:19,124 --> 00:10:20,413
Oh no.

219
00:10:22,546 --> 00:10:23,592
What's wrong?

220
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,249
Hmm?

221
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,538
Seems like he can't

222
00:10:26,554 --> 00:10:27,991
reach Iwanaga-sensei.

223
00:10:28,116 --> 00:10:30,663
- Huh?
- It's about the column for the serial.

224
00:10:31,585 --> 00:10:32,616
Is everything okay?

225
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:34,967
I already told the assistant

226
00:10:34,976 --> 00:10:36,420
about the deadline over the phone.

227
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:42,351
You're not the one welcomed here.

228
00:10:42,788 --> 00:10:44,874
That guy... Don't tell me...

229
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:47,288
I should have contacted him directly!

230
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,374
Hello?

231
00:10:52,476 --> 00:10:55,257
This is Miyata from Tokyo Business.

232
00:10:55,624 --> 00:10:57,303
I'm trying to reach Iwanaga-sensei

233
00:10:57,335 --> 00:10:58,920
from the Economics Department...

234
00:11:00,163 --> 00:11:01,592
I've tried calling his mobile

235
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:02,952
but couldn't reach him.

236
00:11:05,218 --> 00:11:06,023
Yes.

237
00:11:08,148 --> 00:11:08,868
Yes.

238
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:10,131
(Lecture. Plans to stay overnight)

239
00:11:10,132 --> 00:11:11,054
(Inn Kikori)
Yes.

240
00:11:11,062 --> 00:11:11,655
(From 13 to 14)

241
00:11:12,014 --> 00:11:13,523
Alright. Thank you.

242
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:16,507
Chief Editor, I'll be right back!

243
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:18,647
There might be no signal,

244
00:11:18,694 --> 00:11:19,998
I'll make sure to contact regularly!

245
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:21,452
You'll get the submission, right?

246
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:23,921
I'll defend it with my life! Definitely!

247
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:34,499
Iwanaga-sensei!

248
00:11:37,476 --> 00:11:38,187
Huh?

249
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:39,976
What a coincidence to

250
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,217
meet here in the mountains.

251
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:42,366
Please, write the column

252
00:11:42,382 --> 00:11:43,522
manuscript right now!

253
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:46,882
Yes.

254
00:11:47,843 --> 00:11:48,577
Yes.

255
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:52,952
Iwanaga-sensei is urgently writing it.

256
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,132
I'll contact you again.

257
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:01,905
I heard this time it's going on hiatus.

258
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,023
No, it's business as usual.

259
00:12:04,046 --> 00:12:04,749
Really?

260
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:06,374
Did Shiraishi-kun do it on purpose?

261
00:12:06,398 --> 00:12:08,194
That doesn't matter right now.

262
00:12:09,273 --> 00:12:10,413
Miyata-kun, sometimes you

263
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:11,716
have a sharp tongue.

264
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:13,077
Quite different from the cuteness

265
00:12:13,086 --> 00:12:14,116
you had in the past.

266
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,335
Please focus!

267
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:19,163
Is that how you ask someone for help?

268
00:12:21,124 --> 00:12:22,718
Alright, alright, alright.

269
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:24,304
It's at five, right?

270
00:12:25,123 --> 00:12:26,389
I can make it.

271
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:28,319
Relax.

272
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:29,835
Take a deep breath.

273
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:40,451
There, it's done. Please check it.

274
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:41,858
Thank you so much!

275
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:49,663
I'll thank you properly another time.

276
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,296
Excuse me for intruding.

277
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,429
Take care...

278
00:12:57,656 --> 00:12:59,023
Ah...

279
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:02,843
He's already gone.

280
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:07,718
Haa...

281
00:13:08,156 --> 00:13:09,531
I'm exhausted.

282
00:13:13,023 --> 00:13:13,968
Senpai.

283
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:16,858
You see...

284
00:13:24,124 --> 00:13:25,304
I'm really sorry about this.

285
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:27,764
Well, at least the manuscript

286
00:13:27,788 --> 00:13:28,694
made it on time.

287
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,764
I never expected to be stranded

288
00:13:30,788 --> 00:13:32,202
due to road closures.

289
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:33,787
It's a common occurrence

290
00:13:33,804 --> 00:13:34,873
in the countryside.

291
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,631
And I'm sorry for inconveniencing you

292
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,655
by staying over.

293
00:13:39,288 --> 00:13:40,460
I'm sorry.

294
00:13:40,773 --> 00:13:42,226
I was actually planning to

295
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:43,601
invite you over sometime.

296
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:48,312
Let's take it easy,

297
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,155
since we're here.

298
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,210
Yes.

299
00:14:04,788 --> 00:14:07,101
I knew it would be like this.

300
00:14:07,632 --> 00:14:09,584
There weren't any other rooms available,

301
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:10,866
so it can't be helped.

302
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:14,765
Then, good night.

303
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,679
Sleeping already?

304
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:17,546
That's early.

305
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,405
Ah...

306
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,163
I'm just a bit tired.

307
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:21,194
Yeah.

308
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,015
Good night.

309
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,710
Sweet dreams.

310
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,288
Senpai.

311
00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:16,483
Hmm?

312
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,132
I'm wondering

313
00:15:24,343 --> 00:15:26,171
why are you bothering me?

314
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,468
It's not amusing to tease me, right?

315
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:33,530
Someone like me.

316
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:40,640
Because you're cute.

317
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:42,749
I've had enough of that.

318
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:57,976
I'm serious.

319
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:16,366
Yeah yeah, I understand.

320
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:21,194
Any more and I'll get angry.

321
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:06,578
I have to push him away.

322
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:08,531
Right now!

323
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:14,086
Ah, it's no good.

324
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:35,250
Do you hate me?

325
00:18:37,235 --> 00:18:38,727
I don't hate you,

326
00:18:40,274 --> 00:18:41,914
but I'm not sure.

327
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:53,031
Is this your first time?

328
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:55,781
Yes.

329
00:18:59,281 --> 00:19:00,164
I'm sorry.

330
00:19:01,438 --> 00:19:03,000
Why are you apologizing?

331
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,719
Are you alright?

332
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:11,195
Sorry.

333
00:19:12,711 --> 00:19:13,899
Don't be sorry.

334
00:19:14,836 --> 00:19:16,766
If you like me, don't be sorry.

335
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,078
I couldn't run away.

336
00:19:24,953 --> 00:19:26,569
I don't want to hope

337
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,703
for Senpai's feelings

338
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:29,187
like I did back then.

339
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,390
If I get carried away

340
00:19:31,414 --> 00:19:32,835
with my feelings any further...

341
00:19:51,328 --> 00:19:53,953
Well then, I'll be heading out soon.

342
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:54,852
Yeah.

343
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,563
I'm sorry.

344
00:19:57,024 --> 00:19:58,828
I'll talk to Shiraishi-kun too.

345
00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:00,641
Since I made it on time,

346
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:02,133
no need to worry.

347
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:04,360
Well then, excuse me.

348
00:20:04,477 --> 00:20:05,203
Yeah.

349
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:15,110
Senpai.

350
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:16,438
Hmm?

351
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,938
We might have done it,

352
00:20:23,297 --> 00:20:24,593
but I haven't thought about

353
00:20:24,617 --> 00:20:25,726
wanting to date you.

354
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:28,774
Well then, good work.

355
00:20:34,727 --> 00:20:36,578
So that's how it goes.

356
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,813
Hello,

357
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,078
Miyata-san.

358
00:20:51,047 --> 00:20:52,334
Another meeting?

359
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:53,805
Yes.

360
00:20:54,508 --> 00:20:55,274
By the way,

361
00:20:55,445 --> 00:20:57,141
was the hot spring enjoyable?

362
00:20:58,063 --> 00:20:59,078
Must have been tough.

363
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:01,164
You had to stay over too.

364
00:21:05,672 --> 00:21:06,328
Hey.

365
00:21:07,156 --> 00:21:09,242
Don't joke about about staying over.

366
00:21:09,555 --> 00:21:10,688
It's pointless to make

367
00:21:10,696 --> 00:21:11,930
sarcastic remarks to me.

368
00:21:14,617 --> 00:21:15,367
By the way,

369
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:18,336
don't underestimate the work.

370
00:21:19,163 --> 00:21:20,694
How many people do you think

371
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:21,702
were inconvenienced by

372
00:21:21,718 --> 00:21:22,772
your childish pranks!

373
00:21:23,524 --> 00:21:24,492
That's all.

374
00:21:24,977 --> 00:21:26,242
Reflect on that.

Congratulations,

377
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,367
Your serial article ranked first

378
00:21:33,477 --> 00:21:35,500
in the reader survey by a landslide.

379
00:21:35,735 --> 00:21:37,711
I'm glad I could be of help to you.

380
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,063
Ah.

381
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:48,140
Oh, our girls' team said

382
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:49,875
they'd love to give you this.

383
00:21:50,274 --> 00:21:51,352
Huh?

384
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:56,203
How cute.

385
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,258
Thank you.

386
00:21:59,946 --> 00:22:00,836
Mm!

387
00:22:03,172 --> 00:22:04,250
By the way,

388
00:22:06,672 --> 00:22:08,516
you're not going to dating me, huh?

389
00:22:10,727 --> 00:22:11,438
Yes.

390
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:14,133
You're not conscious of me?

391
00:22:16,672 --> 00:22:18,367
Of course I am.

392
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,266
I have little experience,

393
00:22:21,711 --> 00:22:23,086
and that was my first time

394
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:24,695
with someone of the same sex...

395
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,922
But...

396
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,344
I won't become your lover.

397
00:22:30,336 --> 00:22:31,930
Why not?

398
00:22:34,641 --> 00:22:35,516
Because I'm...

399
00:22:37,195 --> 00:22:38,945
losing to you.

400
00:22:39,742 --> 00:22:41,024
In work,

401
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,031
in feelings,

402
00:22:43,578 --> 00:22:45,289
even in that thing we did the other day.

403
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:46,578
I can't compete with you.

404
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:48,679
My high school self

405
00:22:48,687 --> 00:22:49,757
would be disappointed.

406
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:51,922
I was seriously going to elope with you!

407
00:22:52,516 --> 00:22:53,360
I was serious.

408
00:22:54,227 --> 00:22:55,336
Do you understand

409
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:57,727
how much you hurt me by betraying me?

410
00:22:58,063 --> 00:22:59,617
I was still in high school.

411
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,891
You didn't put in any effort.

412
00:23:03,055 --> 00:23:05,149
You think everything comes easy.

413
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:09,938
That's why,

414
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,586
from now on, let's be

415
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:13,822
good business partners.

416
00:23:15,078 --> 00:23:16,156
Thanks for your hard work.

417
00:23:26,844 --> 00:23:29,656
I didn't put in any effort?

418
00:23:32,656 --> 00:23:34,195
It's always been that way,

419
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,257
It was probably even written

420
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:37,320
on my notebook.

421
00:23:38,274 --> 00:23:40,102
In reality, deep down,

422
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,498
I thought everything would come easy.

423
00:23:44,921 --> 00:23:46,671
(Next episode)
It was just a one time thing,

424
00:23:46,703 --> 00:23:47,773
I don't need it.

425
00:23:47,797 --> 00:23:49,208
I want to try spending

426
00:23:49,224 --> 00:23:50,929
the rest of my life with you.

427
00:23:50,953 --> 00:23:52,130
If we made a mistake,

428
00:23:52,154 --> 00:23:53,679
we may lose everything.

429
00:23:53,703 --> 00:23:55,320
Please try to love me.

430
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,156
I really like you.
