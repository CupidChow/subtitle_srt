1
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,854
What the hell? It's my company!

2
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,778
What is going on?

3
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:48,752
Jimmy.

4
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:55,008
I'm home.

5
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,183
I saw the news.

6
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,314
Maybe,

7
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,359
it's for the best.

8
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,779
You've kept yourself so busy in Taipei.

9
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:18,574
Sometimes…

10
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,244
it's important to take a break.

11
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,081
Like they say…

12
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,503
"Rest paves the long road ahead."

13
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,645
Yeah.

14
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,606
I can accompany you to Tokyo.

15
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:54,234
But it's not my company now,

16
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,153
so this is the last time.

17
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,113
No matter what.

18
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,741
All right?

19
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:02,618
Bye.

20
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:18,175
18 years have passed
since I left this city.

21
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:24,306
I stayed focused,

22
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,684
trying to realize my dream.

23
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,646
I gave my all.

24
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:36,276
But I've lost everything.

25
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,625
Where did I go wrong?

26
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:54,920
Or maybe…

27
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,549
I was wrong from the start?

28
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,822
SLAM DUNK

29
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:28,787
JAPANESE CONVERSATION

30
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:46,054
MOVIE EXCHANGE COUPON

31
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,727
Hello. How are you?

32
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:38,857
I'm back home for a little while
between trips.

33
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,485
Lots of snow over here.

34
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,238
Wish you could see it someday.

35
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:49,743
Can't wait to see you again
after your dream has come true.

36
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,360
We apologize for what happened.

37
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,237
We apologize.

38
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,949
Oh, no problem.

39
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,577
Though that video
did make me a bit nervous.

40
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,871
I'm glad you got it sorted out.

41
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,041
Thank you.

42
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:44,506
I think it's great how two
college classmates made it big together.

43
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,343
How do you feel now?

44
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,224
We're a gaming company
that started in a dorm.

45
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,976
We got this far

46
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,936
because Jimmy's talents were recognized.

47
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:03,066
Already have an idea for the next one?

48
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,278
Jimmy?

49
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,698
No, not really.

50
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,452
Of course, you've been so busy.

51
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,496
Oh, yeah. Do you have plans tomorrow?

52
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,624
It's cherry blossom season,

53
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,876
so let me show you around Tokyo.

54
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:24,838
Yes!

55
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,340
What do you say, Jimmy?

56
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:31,887
Sorry, but I've got plans.

57
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,681
Oh? You're working?

58
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:35,766
No.

59
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,311
I'm thinking of traveling.

60
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,147
Oh, you're traveling?

61
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,524
Yes.

62
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,275
That sounds nice.

63
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,694
A trip? Where to?

64
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,072
Nowhere in particular.

65
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,075
You can't be serious.

66
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,746
Traveling is fun

67
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,540
because you never know what will happen.

68
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:01,959
Huh?

69
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,423
Do you remember?

70
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:11,176
I was walking and playing my game,
when you walked right into me.

71
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,637
No, you walked into me, Aaron.

72
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,722
We were playing the same game.

73
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,355
It's been 18 years.

74
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,148
Yeah.

75
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,359
It's been a long time.

76
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,069
No,

77
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,905
it was a blink of an eye.

78
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,450
I'm sorry…

79
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,412
Bothering you at the last minute…

80
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:42,666
Don't worry about it.

81
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,174
Glad I could make myself useful
in the end.

82
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,384
I mean it.

83
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,140
I'm so sorry

84
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,559
I couldn't stand up for you.

85
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,396
It's fine.

86
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,773
I…

87
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,818
I was too caught up with myself.

88
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:17,868
Jimmy.

89
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:22,414
I don't know what to make of myself.

90
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,219
18 years ago…

91
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:22,057
how did you feel
when you started your journey?

92
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,996
Damn it!

93
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:34,004
I'm late again!

94
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,631
Mom! Why didn't you wake me up?

95
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,759
I don't make your schedule.

96
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,886
I'll get in trouble again!

97
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:42,846
Make sure to drop by the temple.

98
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,097
I know.

99
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,015
See you later.

100
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,288
Miss, do you want to take a break first?

101
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,207
Sorry!

102
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,167
Just a bit more.

103
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,803
Help me get into university.

104
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,096
Please.

105
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,102
Please.

106
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,608
18 years ago,

107
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:38,902
I worked part-time
at a karaoke bar in Tainan

108
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,613
during the summer.

109
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,827
KARAOKE KOBE

110
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:53,083
You've been late so many times!

111
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:56,003
Entrance exams ended
so I played games and…

112
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,838
Don't make excuses! Work!

113
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,131
Work!

114
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:02,593
Moron… Stop shooting me!

115
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:03,927
Asshole…

116
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:05,554
Out of my way.

117
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:06,638
Get a move on.

118
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,433
Little Miss Cranky.

119
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:11,810
Jimmy.

120
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:14,021
Late again? He'll fire you soon.

121
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:15,063
I know.

122
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:16,148
Shimada.

123
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:18,066
Hey, I'm coming.

124
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,443
Hurry up.

125
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:23,197
Jimmy. Get to work. We're busy.

126
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,409
Busy playing mahjong.

127
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,327
Exactly.

128
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,038
He only cares about mahjong.

129
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:31,997
Jimmy.

130
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,542
Take this to Room 3.

131
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:36,752
Okay, got it.

132
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:37,753
Be careful.

133
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:41,673
Wait.

134
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:45,302
I shouldn't have listened to you.

135
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,345
Why not?

136
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:49,014
You said there'd be cute girls here.

137
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,600
Where are they?

138
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:53,560
I only see a mahjong addict,

139
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:54,978
an older lady,

140
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,147
and a smartass delinquent.

141
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,150
Who's a delinquent?

142
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:01,610
Tardy idiot.

143
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,072
You're a tardy idiot.

144
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,414
And a weird mural.

145
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:17,584
I gave up on my co-workers

146
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,754
and hoped a dream girl would show up, but…

147
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,901
The part-time job I began with high hopes

148
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:45,654
was mundane and boring.

149
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:49,491
What? Put it down and go away.

150
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:55,372
I thought the summer would end
without anything happening.

151
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,960
I'm going to the store!

152
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,044
OK.

153
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:11,972
Hello!

154
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:36,830
Hi. Nǐ hǎo.

155
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,544
Konnichiwa.

156
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:44,630
Japanese!

157
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:46,715
Do you work here?

158
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:50,844
One person?

159
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:53,347
Oh, that's not why I came.

160
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:56,975
I want to work here.

161
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,519
Huh?

162
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,356
How to say "work"…

163
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:05,484
Gōngzuò.

164
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,736
- Work!
- Yeah, work!

165
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,864
- Here?
- Yes. Is the manager here?

166
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:12,324
- The boss.
- Boss.

167
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,576
The boss. Is he around?

168
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,494
Wait a sec.

169
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:16,620
Yes!

170
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:17,871
Wait a moment!

171
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:35,681
And?

172
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:40,185
I've been backpacking for about a month

173
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:44,189
and arrived in Tainan,
but I lost my wallet.

174
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:48,569
I thought maybe you'd hire me.

175
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,657
Would that be possible?

176
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,500
I feel like I'm seeing myself
from 20 years ago.

177
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,043
Sorry?

178
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,838
I came from Kobe to Taiwan.

179
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,841
The people here were so kind to me.

180
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:14,636
Fell in love with the rénqíngwèi,
human warmth.

181
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,346
Rénqíngwèi?

182
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,806
You're hired!

183
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,474
You can work here.

184
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:22,019
Stay as long as you want.

185
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,188
Thank you so much.

186
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,356
Love at first sight?

187
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,441
Shut up.

188
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:28,400
Jimmy.

189
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:30,944
Show her to the spare room.

190
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,447
Teach her the ropes.

191
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,115
Me?

192
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:37,367
He's Jimmy.

193
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,494
Speaks a bit of Japanese.
Ask him anything.

194
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:40,662
Oh, OK.

195
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:42,122
Nice to meet you, Jimmy.

196
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,791
Nice to meet you.

197
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:49,004
OK, then. Work hard.

198
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,923
- Thank you.
- I'm still kind of busy.

199
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:51,840
Thank you so much.

200
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,677
I'm busy. Work hard.

201
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,555
Bye.

202
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,100
Here.

203
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,445
A karaoke room. Nice.

204
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:15,614
Reeks of cigarettes, but…

205
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:21,912
Thank goodness.

206
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,414
I'll get going.

207
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:26,208
Hey.

208
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,503
Why do you speak Japanese?

209
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:38,387
I like Japanese anime and games.

210
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:40,556
For example?

211
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:42,975
For example?

212
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,059
For example…

213
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,443
Slam Dunk!

214
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:55,404
"I'm a genius."

215
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,031
"The left hand stays relaxed."

216
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:00,909
"I love it. I'm not lying this time."

217
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:03,453
The lines from the comics!

218
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:05,914
That's amazing!

219
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:07,916
Thank you.

220
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,350
Tasty.

221
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:27,769
Not tasty…

222
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:29,521
My grandma gave it to me.

223
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,817
It's called L'air du Temps.

224
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,778
It means "flow of time."

225
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,531
"Flow of time."

226
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,429
Ami-san.

227
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:06,099
How long in Tainan?

228
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,227
Just Ami is fine.

229
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,147
Until I save up enough to move on.

230
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:16,109
The goal of trip?

231
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:17,986
The goal?

232
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,904
Yes.

233
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:23,534
There is no goal.

234
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:30,874
Traveling is fun because
you never know what will happen.

235
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:52,354
The next stop is Kamakura High School.

236
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,648
The doors on the left will open.

237
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:01,738
I left Tokyo and first headed
to the Shonan area

238
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:04,533
because I remembered
a place I wanted to see.

239
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:11,748
The iconic setting of Slam Dunk.

240
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:14,501
Kamakura High School train station.

241
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:25,304
Excuse me.

242
00:22:26,305 --> 00:22:27,764
Ready?

243
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:29,808
Thank you.

244
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:30,809
No problem.

245
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:02,883
TADAMI

246
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:20,419
REST PAVES THE LONG ROAD AHEAD

247
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:31,221
Welcome.

248
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:35,225
Sit wherever you like.

249
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:43,859
It's so cold.

250
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:51,366
Excuse me. Welcome.

251
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:54,661
Thank you.

252
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,251
Here on business?

253
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,088
Yes.

254
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:06,757
Where from?

255
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,883
Taiwan.

256
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,052
Taiwan? Me too.

257
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,346
Really?

258
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:14,473
What a coincidence.

259
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,974
I'm Liu.

260
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:18,018
Jimmy.

261
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:19,019
Jimmy.

262
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:20,270
Yes, Jimmy.

263
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:23,899
What a coincidence.

264
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:27,736
Looks delicious.

265
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:30,280
It's really cold out, isn't it?

266
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:33,700
Yes, more so for a guy from Tainan.

267
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:35,619
Tainan?

268
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:36,745
Yes.

269
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:39,790
- You too?
- Me too.

270
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:41,834
What are the odds?

271
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,168
Which high school?

272
00:25:43,252 --> 00:25:44,795
Pao-An Senior High.

273
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,338
I'm Nan-Hsing Senior High.

274
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:48,006
That's close by.

275
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,800
Great basketball team.

276
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:52,261
I'd see athletic-looking guys

277
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:54,596
file out after school, looking fierce.

278
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:01,019
Have you seen the local sights?

279
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:04,147
No, I just got here.

280
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:06,191
Shall I show you around later?

281
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,653
Are you sure?

282
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,029
Of course.

283
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:13,198
I'll hurry, then.

284
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:14,491
No, take your time.

285
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,493
I have to clean up.

286
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:18,161
Thank you.

287
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:27,462
Where did you learn Japanese?

288
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:33,218
A Japanese friend taught me long ago.

289
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:38,056
Have you been here long?

290
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,184
It's been 15 years.

291
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,311
Came on business

292
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:45,230
and never left.

293
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:50,402
I liked how time flows slowly here.

294
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:53,363
I was a workaholic back in Taipei.

295
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:58,660
Is that why the sign says,

296
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:01,330
"Rest paves the long road ahead"?

297
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:07,002
Taking a breather

298
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:11,548
gives us perspective about
what's important in our lives.

299
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:14,134
That's what I think, anyway.

300
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:23,727
She taught you Japanese?

301
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:25,646
Yes.

302
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:27,689
18 years ago.

303
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:32,611
What's this scent?

304
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,154
It's a perfume.

305
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:37,824
Called "flow of time."

306
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:46,083
You said you had no goal,

307
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,337
but you're going to see her, right?

308
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:53,549
Yes.

309
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:56,718
I do miss her.

310
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:00,722
Even if I can't see her,

311
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:03,141
I want to see the town where she grew up.

312
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,478
Fukushima?

313
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:08,689
That's the other way.

314
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,441
Yes.

315
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:14,903
I keep taking detours…

316
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,949
I regret it now.

317
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:28,709
I wonder

318
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:32,629
if this trip will change anything.

319
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:37,551
It needn't be the sole purpose.

320
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:40,095
Sometimes

321
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:44,641
you can travel to reassess your own life.

322
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,775
I'm going this way.

323
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:55,986
My own life…

324
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,865
If I'd told her

325
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:03,452
how I felt about her back then,

326
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:10,125
would the future have been different?

327
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:26,850
Could I have spent…

328
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:31,146
more time with Ami?

329
00:29:45,661 --> 00:29:47,454
SUCCESSFUL APPLICANTS

330
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:52,042
Stop hesitating. Click on it!

331
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:03,554
I got in.

332
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:06,932
I got in!

333
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,810
I got in!

334
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,812
Good luck, son!

335
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,275
People in town heard about Ami

336
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:18,902
and we became busier than ever.

337
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,365
We got another order.

338
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:25,367
Why is it so busy?

339
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:27,578
They all want to see Ami.

340
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:31,582
Everyone seemed curious
about the new Japanese girl,

341
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:34,710
and Ami became a sensation in Tainan.

342
00:30:39,256 --> 00:30:40,340
I'm exhausted.

343
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:42,718
Good work, guys!

344
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:44,761
Business is booming!

345
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:47,681
Ami, you really came to our rescue.

346
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:51,643
Oh, please. Jimmy's a good mentor.

347
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:53,478
She says it's thanks to you.

348
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:54,730
Not me.

349
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,899
He's done nothing.

350
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:58,609
But he's never late anymore.

351
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:01,069
Is that so?

352
00:31:01,153 --> 00:31:02,362
Stop it.

353
00:31:02,446 --> 00:31:04,281
It's great to be young.

354
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:06,867
Boss.

355
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,870
Let's throw a welcome party for Ami.

356
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:11,163
Good idea.

357
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:13,040
Yeah, why not.

358
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:15,250
Ami, we want to welcome you.

359
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:16,960
Anything you want to eat?

360
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:19,880
Taiwanese food!

361
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:21,507
I'll take you to an awesome place.

362
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,424
Yay!

363
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:26,136
OK, let's go throw
a welcome party for Ami!

364
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:31,725
Good work!

365
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:34,061
Cheers!

366
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:39,858
It's great that our joint
has been so busy since you came.

367
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:40,776
Thanks!

368
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:43,153
The pleasure is mine. It's been so fun.

369
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:44,154
Ami,

370
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:47,032
you're welcome to stay forever.

371
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,326
She says, "You can stay forever."

372
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:50,452
Xiè xie.

373
00:31:50,536 --> 00:31:52,496
Thank you.

374
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,582
Hey, why did you decide to travel?

375
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,918
Soul-searching?

376
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:00,921
Not exactly.

377
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:04,132
I wanted to reassess my own life.

378
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:06,176
What do you mean?

379
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,057
I wanted to go to various places
and meet various people

380
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,561
to confirm that I'm OK the way I am.

381
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,896
That sounds deep.

382
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,940
Care to share a bit more?

383
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:22,985
What did she say?

384
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,821
I asked her why she's traveling,

385
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:28,824
she says she wants to
visit places and people,

386
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:31,159
and get to know herself better.

387
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:33,745
Oh, what's that?

388
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:43,088
Ami, did you draw those?

389
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:44,464
You drew these?

390
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:45,465
Yeah.

391
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:48,427
You're really good!

392
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,803
It's beautiful!

393
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:50,971
It's so good!

394
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:52,639
I want to travel the world

395
00:32:52,723 --> 00:32:55,475
and draw only what I can draw.

396
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,269
That's my dream.

397
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:59,897
Her dream is to travel the world

398
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,442
and draw only what she can draw.

399
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:08,113
So, that's it.

400
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:11,575
- You're so good.
- It's very pretty.

401
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:13,327
You can sell these.

402
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,244
Hey.

403
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:20,459
That weird mural at the joint.

404
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:22,669
Maybe she could repaint it.

405
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:23,795
True.

406
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:25,631
Jimmy.

407
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:28,383
You say good things sometimes.

408
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:30,761
Just drink your beer, man.

409
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:33,597
Ami, this is kind of sudden,

410
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,766
but could you paint over that mural?

411
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:37,684
What? May I?

412
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:38,894
Yes, of course.

413
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:40,103
You all agree, right?

414
00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:41,355
- Of course!
- Yeah!

415
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:43,398
- That thing's awful.
- Yeah!

416
00:33:43,482 --> 00:33:45,150
We all ask you to do it.

417
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,778
Thank you.

418
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:49,112
I'll do my best.

419
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:50,864
She said yes!

420
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:53,158
A celebration! Let's raise our glasses.

421
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:55,035
Cheers!

422
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,330
Cheers!

423
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:00,958
Here's your soup.

424
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:01,917
Great!

425
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:05,587
It's so late.

426
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:07,047
I have to go home.

427
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:09,842
- Let's go together.
- Hey!

428
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:11,885
What about Ami?

429
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,053
Jimmy,

430
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:15,764
make sure you see her home.

431
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:17,724
- Ami.
- Good luck.

432
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:19,351
See you!

433
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:21,019
Bye!

434
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:26,567
Sorry about those two.

435
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,860
Sorry.

436
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:31,280
Bye!

437
00:34:31,864 --> 00:34:32,948
Bye!

438
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:46,461
HAO CHEN DU COOKING

439
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:55,137
Jimmy, would you do me a favor?

440
00:34:56,930 --> 00:35:00,517
I've always wanted to ride tandem
on a scooter in Taiwan.

441
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,191
Let's go.

442
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,486
All right.

443
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,447
Yay!

444
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,378
This feels so good!
Just like in the Taiwanese movies!

445
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:30,547
Where to?

446
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,676
The place you like best in this city.

447
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,886
OK.

448
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:38,263
Go!

449
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:48,607
Whoa, this is awesome! So fun!

450
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:50,943
So fun!

451
00:35:53,195 --> 00:35:54,863
Wow!

452
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,616
This song again.

453
00:35:57,699 --> 00:35:59,618
I keep hearing it at karaoke.

454
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:03,455
Wǔ Yuè Tiān. Mayday.

455
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:04,373
Mayday?

456
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,085
A Taiwanese rock band. They're huge here.

457
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:11,630
Kind of like Japan's Mr.Children?

458
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:16,927
Right. Mr.Children are big in Taiwan, too.

459
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,223
I see. Mayday. I'll check them out later.

460
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:26,144
This feels great!

461
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,188
"Sóng-lah"… Feels great.

462
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:30,315
Sóng-lah?

463
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:33,944
Sóng-lah!

464
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,321
Sóng-lah!

465
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,533
Sóng-lah!

466
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:51,879
So beautiful!

467
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:53,505
Wow!

468
00:36:56,842 --> 00:36:59,303
You come here with your girlfriend?

469
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:00,304
Huh?

470
00:37:01,722 --> 00:37:05,475
I don't have a girlfriend.

471
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:08,103
Yeah, I can tell. I thought so.

472
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,316
That's rude, Ami.

473
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:13,692
Sorry.

474
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,366
What about you?

475
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:26,663
So you're curious?

476
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:28,498
No.

477
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:31,919
Oh, wow!

478
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,796
The stars are so beautiful, too!

479
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:41,553
It's amazing.

480
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:50,145
So you're going to university in Taipei?

481
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:52,022
Yes.

482
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:54,566
You must be excited.

483
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:59,071
Do you have a dream?

484
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:01,615
A dream.

485
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:03,075
"Dream".

486
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:06,995
I know! A basketball player.

487
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:18,090
Before, yes.

488
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:24,388
But now, I don't know.

489
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:31,144
I see.

490
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,857
Life is long.

491
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:38,151
I'll take my time figuring it out.

492
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:43,240
You never know if it's long or not.

493
00:38:45,534 --> 00:38:46,952
What?

494
00:38:49,371 --> 00:38:52,416
Tell me your dream when you find it.

495
00:38:56,545 --> 00:38:57,713
Yeah.

496
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:06,346
Jimmy.

497
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:08,724
Hmm?

498
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:16,190
I wonder what we'll be like
when we grow older.

499
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:41,089
Good luck.

500
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:42,049
Thanks.

501
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:47,513
Ami!

502
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:49,890
Over there, want to try?

503
00:39:49,973 --> 00:39:51,892
Tasty, tasty!

504
00:39:57,648 --> 00:39:59,107
I'll take the cabbage.

505
00:39:59,191 --> 00:40:01,693
200 NTD? That's cheap!

506
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:14,206
"Sorry I'm late."

507
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:19,336
"Sorry I'm late."

508
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:27,427
Watch your feet!

509
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:39,565
OK, here we go. One, two, three.

510
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:42,359
Another one.

511
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:44,278
Jimmy!

512
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,029
Why are you here?

513
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:47,406
Don't! It's embarrassing!

514
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:48,574
Just one more.

515
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:50,284
What's the big deal?

516
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:57,666
How do you say, "handsome"?

517
00:40:57,749 --> 00:41:00,460
Shuài.

518
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:03,255
Nǐ hěn shuài.

519
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:06,383
- Thanks!
- Don't be silly!

520
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,135
"You're…

521
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:09,970
very…

522
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,681
handsome."

523
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:03,398
Excuse me. Where is the Iiyama line?

524
00:42:03,482 --> 00:42:06,068
- It departs from platform 4.
- Platform 4?

525
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:07,402
Yes.

526
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:08,654
Thank you.

527
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:40,602
Whoa! This is so Instagrammable!

528
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:41,687
Awesome!

529
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:48,193
This is good.

530
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:54,199
Hey! No, a tunnel. Oh, man…

531
00:42:58,412 --> 00:42:59,288
Hey.

532
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:03,959
You a traveler too?

533
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,420
Yes. From Taiwan.

534
00:43:06,503 --> 00:43:09,006
Taiwan? Whoa, for real?

535
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:10,966
I'm Koji.

536
00:43:12,593 --> 00:43:13,886
I'm Jimmy.

537
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:15,846
- Your Japanese is great.
- Not really.

538
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:18,390
Mind if I take one?

539
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:19,641
Here we go!

540
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:28,066
The tunnel! Too boring.

541
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:30,194
Another one later.

542
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:31,361
Yes.

543
00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:39,620
Traveling is awesome, huh?

544
00:43:40,162 --> 00:43:43,790
So many new encounters
and discoveries. It's great!

545
00:43:47,085 --> 00:43:49,505
Do you travel a lot?

546
00:43:49,588 --> 00:43:50,881
Nope, my first time.

547
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:53,926
Nothing fancy, just staying in necafés.

548
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:56,220
"Necafés"?

549
00:43:56,887 --> 00:43:58,347
Internet cafés.

550
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:01,141
They have everything, so try it.

551
00:44:01,225 --> 00:44:03,477
Discounts for students, too.

552
00:44:05,103 --> 00:44:06,355
You're a student?

553
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:08,148
Yeah. I'll be 18 this year.

554
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:10,609
I don't look it, do I?

555
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:13,570
People tell me I look older than I am.

556
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:15,447
What about you?

557
00:44:16,698 --> 00:44:19,409
Twice your age. I'm 36.

558
00:44:19,493 --> 00:44:20,911
For real? You don't look it.

559
00:44:21,703 --> 00:44:22,788
I thought maybe 20 plus.

560
00:44:22,871 --> 00:44:24,206
No way.

561
00:44:25,832 --> 00:44:29,837
Traveling alone at your age is amazing.

562
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,340
It never occurred to me
to do that when I was 18.

563
00:44:35,801 --> 00:44:37,427
The way I see it…

564
00:44:38,136 --> 00:44:41,390
You know how people go on trips
to soul-search?

565
00:44:41,473 --> 00:44:43,851
But I am what I am,

566
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:46,937
and you only live once
so I want to enjoy my life.

567
00:44:51,108 --> 00:44:53,318
Jimmy, we're almost there.

568
00:44:53,402 --> 00:44:57,447
Hurry, stand up! Come on.

569
00:44:57,531 --> 00:44:59,491
Ready? Let's not use cameras

570
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:01,702
and imprint this in our minds.

571
00:45:01,785 --> 00:45:02,619
Ready?

572
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:04,246
Three,

573
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:05,581
two,

574
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,416
one…

575
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:09,168
Now!

576
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:30,397
"The train came out of the long tunnel
into the snow country."

577
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:33,692
OK! That's enough imprinting.

578
00:45:33,775 --> 00:45:35,652
Use your camera now.

579
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:39,990
You all right?

580
00:45:42,534 --> 00:45:44,494
It's just like Love Letter.

581
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:47,539
Hey, Jimmy?

582
00:45:47,623 --> 00:45:48,790
Oh, um…

583
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:52,544
I've always wanted to see this.

584
00:46:00,886 --> 00:46:02,387
Jimmy.

585
00:46:02,471 --> 00:46:03,472
Yes.

586
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:05,599
Wanna get off?

587
00:46:11,355 --> 00:46:12,731
Wow!

588
00:46:13,565 --> 00:46:14,608
Jimmy,

589
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:16,944
isn't this awesome? The snow!

590
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:19,363
Wow!

591
00:46:22,074 --> 00:46:23,784
So much snow!

592
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:29,414
Landing!

593
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:40,425
Good work.

594
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:41,635
Thanks.

595
00:46:46,807 --> 00:46:47,933
Ami.

596
00:46:49,893 --> 00:46:50,936
- Ami.
- Nǐ hǎo.

597
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:52,980
Konnichiwa.

598
00:46:53,063 --> 00:46:54,273
What was that word again?

599
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:56,692
Sugoi!

600
00:46:56,775 --> 00:46:58,610
- Thank you.
- Sugoi. Awesome.

601
00:46:58,694 --> 00:47:01,196
I'll paint it for you.

602
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,447
Sorry?

603
00:47:02,531 --> 00:47:05,659
I'll help you paint. I'm very good.

604
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:07,494
Hold on.

605
00:47:07,578 --> 00:47:08,495
Bùxíng. You can't.

606
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:10,122
I can't? No, it's OK.

607
00:47:10,205 --> 00:47:12,332
This place is for everyone.

608
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:13,500
I'm very good at this.

609
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:16,170
I'm good, aren't I?

610
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:19,798
Karaoke Kobe belongs to everyone.

611
00:47:19,882 --> 00:47:21,425
What are you doing? She said no!

612
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:23,635
- Why are you still painting?
- I'm good at painting.

613
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:25,804
What was that for?

614
00:47:28,765 --> 00:47:30,726
You hit my nose!

615
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:31,935
Stop it!

616
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:33,854
- Cool it, guys!
- Come on!

617
00:47:36,023 --> 00:47:37,399
You've been reading too much manga!

618
00:47:37,482 --> 00:47:38,984
Stop trying to act cool!

619
00:47:39,776 --> 00:47:42,404
But they were destroying Ami's mural…

620
00:47:42,487 --> 00:47:43,864
Shut up.

621
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,742
Jimmy, xiè xie.

622
00:47:47,284 --> 00:47:48,535
Nǐ hěn shuài.

623
00:47:50,287 --> 00:47:52,039
Let's eat.

624
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:57,419
That asshole was trying to get
Ami's attention that way.

625
00:47:57,503 --> 00:47:58,879
Yeah.

626
00:47:58,962 --> 00:48:01,840
Why would she be interested
in those drunks?

627
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:06,220
Time to eat.

628
00:48:06,303 --> 00:48:08,972
Ami, what kind of guy is your type?

629
00:48:09,056 --> 00:48:10,432
What did she say, Jimmy?

630
00:48:14,436 --> 00:48:18,524
She wants to know your type.

631
00:48:19,983 --> 00:48:22,027
Well…

632
00:48:23,278 --> 00:48:27,032
Someone active and four years older.

633
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:31,370
What did she say?

634
00:48:33,372 --> 00:48:37,751
A guy four years older

635
00:48:37,835 --> 00:48:39,503
and proactive.

636
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:44,258
The opposite of you.

637
00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:46,718
I guess so.

638
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:48,554
What about you?

639
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:52,766
Short hair.

640
00:48:53,725 --> 00:48:54,601
Younger.

641
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,438
I see.

642
00:49:03,527 --> 00:49:04,820
See you.

643
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:05,988
Thanks for today!

644
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:15,914
I forgot my keys.

645
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:18,208
- Hurry up.
- OK.

646
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:23,005
You're being selfish, too!

647
00:49:30,846 --> 00:49:32,723
I know that!

648
00:49:33,891 --> 00:49:35,475
I know, but…

649
00:49:42,482 --> 00:49:44,026
I'm sorry.

650
00:49:45,736 --> 00:49:47,738
I just need more time.

651
00:49:57,497 --> 00:49:59,041
Knock out!

652
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:13,972
People don't necessarily fall for
their ideal type.

653
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:17,184
What, all of a sudden?

654
00:50:18,268 --> 00:50:21,605
"The game isn't over yet,"
is what I'm saying.

655
00:50:23,774 --> 00:50:25,234
Not possible.

656
00:50:26,443 --> 00:50:29,071
She probably has a nice boyfriend in Japan

657
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:30,948
who's four years older.

658
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,244
You idiot.

659
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:36,537
I get how you feel.

660
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,038
But think about it.

661
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:39,957
She's in Tainan right now.

662
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:43,293
So what?

663
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:51,802
You have me here in Tainan,
your point guard Ryota Miyagi.

664
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:53,387
What are you talking about?

665
00:51:00,811 --> 00:51:01,854
What's this?

666
00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:04,565
Tickets to a Japanese movie.

667
00:51:04,648 --> 00:51:06,149
My dad got them at work.

668
00:51:06,233 --> 00:51:08,902
It's a love story
that was popular in Japan.

669
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:14,449
If she goes with you,

670
00:51:14,533 --> 00:51:16,159
that means she likes you.

671
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:19,496
Take more initiative.

672
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,999
You never know if she's going back soon.

673
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:46,190
No, wait after you knock!

674
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,201
What is it, Jimmy?

675
00:51:57,993 --> 00:51:59,036
I'm sorry!

676
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,287
No, it's OK.

677
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:04,958
This is for you.

678
00:52:06,126 --> 00:52:07,169
Thank you.

679
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,879
Yeah.

680
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,106
What's this?

681
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,400
It's a Japanese movie,

682
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:32,569
Love Letter.

683
00:52:33,487 --> 00:52:35,113
Love Letter!

684
00:52:35,197 --> 00:52:37,449
I've always wanted to see this.

685
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:38,450
How nice.

686
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:43,539
Sounds great.

687
00:52:44,081 --> 00:52:45,082
Let's go.

688
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:46,875
It's a date.

689
00:52:48,377 --> 00:52:50,128
Not really…

690
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:53,590
Looking forward to it.

691
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:55,175
Yeah.

692
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:56,885
- See you.
- See you.

693
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,646
Don't take it without permission!

694
00:53:08,647 --> 00:53:10,232
Give it back!

695
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:14,236
Lin Chia-ming.

696
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:17,447
I like you.

697
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:21,368
"I like… I like you."

698
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:22,578
"I like you."

699
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:24,288
Be mine.

700
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:25,539
"Mine… Be mine…"

701
00:53:27,165 --> 00:53:32,045
HOLDING HANDS - TIPS TO BECOME A LOVER

702
00:53:40,179 --> 00:53:41,138
"Holding hands…"

703
00:53:42,014 --> 00:53:43,098
Dad!

704
00:53:43,182 --> 00:53:45,017
Don't look!

705
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,059
Go to bed.

706
00:54:22,304 --> 00:54:23,138
Mom!

707
00:54:23,222 --> 00:54:25,349
Why didn't you wake me?

708
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:33,315
I'm so sorry!

709
00:54:33,398 --> 00:54:34,525
You're late.

710
00:54:35,651 --> 00:54:37,361
And your hair's a mess.

711
00:54:44,409 --> 00:54:45,327
Be careful.

712
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:46,537
Let's go!

713
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,580
Yes, let's go.

714
00:54:58,173 --> 00:54:59,967
Here we are.

715
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:01,051
Xiè xie.

716
00:55:04,555 --> 00:55:06,765
It's so retro!

717
00:55:06,849 --> 00:55:08,392
Lovely!

718
00:55:21,446 --> 00:55:23,699
Jimmy, I want some popcorn.

719
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:27,619
One popcorn, please.

720
00:55:35,878 --> 00:55:36,920
Xiè xie.

721
00:55:38,213 --> 00:55:39,715
No problem.

722
00:55:46,763 --> 00:55:48,557
I know this!

723
00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:51,810
Fly it and your wish comes true, right?

724
00:55:52,895 --> 00:55:53,729
Yes.

725
00:55:54,354 --> 00:55:58,525
But it's a bit far.

726
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:04,072
I want to go, though.

727
00:56:05,741 --> 00:56:07,034
Take me someday.

728
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:11,330
Yes.

729
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:33,352
Here.

730
00:56:33,435 --> 00:56:34,394
Thanks.

731
00:56:44,071 --> 00:56:45,280
Want some?

732
00:56:50,327 --> 00:56:51,161
Yeah.

733
00:56:51,745 --> 00:56:54,248
- Here, open up.
- What?

734
00:56:54,331 --> 00:56:55,207
Hey…

735
00:57:39,084 --> 00:57:41,545
"How are you?"

736
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,381
What was that?

737
00:57:48,552 --> 00:57:51,263
Come on, Jimmy! Snowball fight!

738
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:04,193
You OK?

739
00:58:04,276 --> 00:58:05,152
I'm OK!

740
00:58:06,862 --> 00:58:08,030
Take that!

741
00:58:08,113 --> 00:58:09,198
Whoa, big one!

742
00:58:11,283 --> 00:58:12,576
Love Letter?

743
00:58:13,285 --> 00:58:14,953
Shunji Iwai.

744
00:58:16,413 --> 00:58:18,165
It's rated really high online.

745
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:21,668
You saw a Japanese movie in Taiwan?

746
00:58:23,629 --> 00:58:26,924
Shunji Iwai is really popular.

747
00:58:28,926 --> 00:58:30,052
Cool, I'll check it out.

748
00:58:31,929 --> 00:58:32,971
So,

749
00:58:34,389 --> 00:58:35,557
did you hold her hand?

750
00:58:36,808 --> 00:58:42,022
No. Unfortunately,
that plan didn't work out.

751
00:58:42,105 --> 00:58:43,232
What? Why?

752
00:58:45,734 --> 00:58:48,654
The movie blew me away.

753
00:58:50,864 --> 00:58:52,866
You're too pure, man.

754
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:28,402
Don't look.

755
00:59:29,778 --> 00:59:31,196
No, I…

756
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:36,743
Let's go.

757
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:44,418
Itsuki and Hiroko were the same.

758
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:47,087
Miho Nakayama was amazing.

759
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:54,928
Is something wrong?

760
00:59:58,807 --> 01:00:00,225
No, it's nothing.

761
01:00:02,561 --> 01:00:07,482
That scenery.
It looked like the town where I was born.

762
01:00:10,027 --> 01:00:13,655
The town where you were born?

763
01:00:14,573 --> 01:00:15,616
Yeah.

764
01:00:17,034 --> 01:00:21,747
It snows a lot in the winter
like in that movie.

765
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:27,211
We couldn't even leave the house
on days of heavy snow.

766
01:00:28,837 --> 01:00:32,382
It was boring and stifling…

767
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:38,055
But that scenery raised me.

768
01:00:43,977 --> 01:00:45,896
I left it all behind.

769
01:01:12,381 --> 01:01:14,132
It's OK.

770
01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:35,279
Thank you, Jimmy.

771
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:43,328
The movie was really great.

772
01:01:43,412 --> 01:01:44,496
Xiè xie.

773
01:01:47,291 --> 01:01:50,335
I think it's time for me to go to bed.
I'm a bit tired.

774
01:01:51,503 --> 01:01:53,088
Good night, Jimmy.

775
01:01:53,172 --> 01:01:54,339
Yes.

776
01:01:55,966 --> 01:01:57,718
See you tomorrow.

777
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:18,780
KOJI HERE.

778
01:02:21,074 --> 01:02:22,868
Hope we meet again somewhere.

779
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:24,912
Contact me anytime.

780
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:32,336
I'll check out Love Letter.

781
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:33,295
OK.

782
01:02:36,715 --> 01:02:38,175
Take care of yourself.

783
01:02:38,258 --> 01:02:40,052
You too, Jimmy. Bye Bye.

784
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:53,232
After we parted ways,

785
01:02:54,191 --> 01:02:57,611
I thought I might never see him again.

786
01:03:01,114 --> 01:03:03,158
Friends we never see again.

787
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:07,329
Scenery we'll never revisit.

788
01:03:08,956 --> 01:03:12,209
But I'll never forget
the time we spent together.

789
01:03:13,001 --> 01:03:15,921
LIU: DID YOU FIND GOOD SCENERY?

790
01:03:16,004 --> 01:03:21,426
JIMMY: I GOT TO SEE SNOW FOR THE FIRST
TIME AND MADE A YOUNG FRIEND!

791
01:03:37,234 --> 01:03:39,862
The people we meet on our travels

792
01:03:39,945 --> 01:03:42,155
leave something in our hearts.

793
01:03:47,536 --> 01:03:48,954
I wonder if

794
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:51,707
I was able to

795
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:54,710
leave anything in Ami's?

796
01:04:19,443 --> 01:04:22,362
NET CAFÉ

797
01:04:23,322 --> 01:04:24,656
Necafé.

798
01:04:34,416 --> 01:04:36,126
Welcome.

799
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:37,711
Uh, hi.

800
01:04:46,595 --> 01:04:47,930
Welcome.

801
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:02,402
The cups are under there.

802
01:05:02,486 --> 01:05:03,320
Yes.

803
01:05:03,403 --> 01:05:04,905
It's all-you-can-drink.

804
01:05:05,656 --> 01:05:06,907
Thank you.

805
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:08,825
Oh!

806
01:05:10,452 --> 01:05:11,370
What?

807
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,498
Nothing. Never mind.

808
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:18,794
Come on. Now you have to tell me.

809
01:05:21,421 --> 01:05:23,715
That game…

810
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:28,428
I made it.

811
01:05:30,889 --> 01:05:32,891
This? Really?

812
01:05:32,975 --> 01:05:33,934
Yes.

813
01:05:49,867 --> 01:05:50,742
You're Jimmy?

814
01:05:51,326 --> 01:05:54,288
No way, you're famous!

815
01:05:54,371 --> 01:05:55,414
Not at all.

816
01:05:56,832 --> 01:05:59,168
Hey, found some wild footage.

817
01:06:01,336 --> 01:06:02,629
No,

818
01:06:02,713 --> 01:06:04,089
don't!

819
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:10,304
You're interesting, Jimmy.

820
01:06:13,473 --> 01:06:15,517
Look behind that tree there.

821
01:06:15,601 --> 01:06:17,019
- Here?
- Yes.

822
01:06:21,231 --> 01:06:23,233
Whoa, the Soul Stone!

823
01:06:23,317 --> 01:06:25,068
Of course you'd know!

824
01:06:25,152 --> 01:06:28,530
FAY: EVEN SO, THAT'S OK.

825
01:06:28,614 --> 01:06:33,952
JOHAN: ALL RIGHT… WE'LL BE OK.

826
01:06:38,332 --> 01:06:41,585
That was so moving.

827
01:06:41,668 --> 01:06:43,045
You're a genius.

828
01:06:43,128 --> 01:06:44,505
No.

829
01:07:01,396 --> 01:07:02,898
NIIGATA LANTERN FESTIVAL

830
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:05,150
Oh, the lanterns. Do you know?

831
01:07:05,234 --> 01:07:08,362
Yes, they're famous in Taiwan, too.

832
01:07:09,738 --> 01:07:12,366
You write wishes on them, right?

833
01:07:12,449 --> 01:07:13,617
Yes.

834
01:07:20,832 --> 01:07:22,501
Wait, are you thinking of going?

835
01:07:23,794 --> 01:07:25,754
I might be able to make it.

836
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,758
But it's pretty far away.

837
01:07:32,427 --> 01:07:34,263
Oh, is that so.

838
01:07:40,602 --> 01:07:41,979
Boss,

839
01:07:42,062 --> 01:07:43,480
mind if I help this guy out?

840
01:07:43,564 --> 01:07:45,065
I'm gonna, OK?

841
01:07:45,649 --> 01:07:46,733
It's fine,

842
01:07:46,817 --> 01:07:48,527
nobody's coming anyway.

843
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:50,821
The car's tiny though, OK?

844
01:07:50,904 --> 01:07:52,698
- Thank you!
- Hang on a sec.

845
01:07:52,781 --> 01:07:53,740
Yes.

846
01:07:55,868 --> 01:07:58,704
Wow, that's some story.
A special moment in your youth.

847
01:07:59,288 --> 01:08:01,248
It really was.

848
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:04,751
You still can't forget her.

849
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:15,179
I found my dream thanks to her.

850
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:20,184
You know, though…

851
01:08:21,935 --> 01:08:26,440
Only a handful of people
can find their dreams

852
01:08:26,523 --> 01:08:28,108
and make them come true.

853
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:30,611
You're amazing.

854
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:34,031
No, I'm not amazing at all.

855
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:41,121
Tadami in Fukushima isn't far from here.

856
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:43,665
Yes.

857
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:47,336
I'm thinking of going tomorrow.

858
01:08:47,419 --> 01:08:48,921
Hope you can see her.

859
01:08:50,547 --> 01:08:51,381
Yeah.

860
01:08:55,886 --> 01:08:59,014
But why did you break up with her?

861
01:09:06,313 --> 01:09:08,690
Maybe

862
01:09:08,774 --> 01:09:12,027
the love had never begun
in the first place.

863
01:09:36,802 --> 01:09:39,513
Ami, what's going on?

864
01:09:40,556 --> 01:09:44,142
Jimmy, I've decided to go back to Japan.

865
01:09:44,226 --> 01:09:45,978
Thank you for everything.

866
01:09:48,772 --> 01:09:51,859
I'll finish the mural,
so look forward to it.

867
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:55,946
A week later is too soon, Ami.

868
01:09:57,531 --> 01:09:58,866
I'm sorry.

869
01:10:00,325 --> 01:10:02,911
Thank you all

870
01:10:02,995 --> 01:10:05,289
for being so good to me.

871
01:10:06,999 --> 01:10:08,500
Ami…

872
01:10:11,044 --> 01:10:14,214
Your Chinese has improved so much!

873
01:10:15,757 --> 01:10:16,925
Well…

874
01:10:17,009 --> 01:10:20,179
We'll miss you,
but we'll have fun until the end.

875
01:10:20,262 --> 01:10:21,096
Right?

876
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:24,183
Why?

877
01:10:26,768 --> 01:10:28,020
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

878
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:29,688
My trip is over for now.

879
01:10:29,771 --> 01:10:30,939
Exactly,

880
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:32,065
why?

881
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:34,943
There's a lot to being an adult.

882
01:10:38,739 --> 01:10:40,073
Is it for your boyfriend?

883
01:10:47,748 --> 01:10:48,874
Yeah…

884
01:10:50,083 --> 01:10:51,752
That's right.

885
01:10:57,132 --> 01:10:58,550
I see.

886
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,265
I'm happy for you.

887
01:11:59,695 --> 01:12:02,155
FOR AMI

888
01:13:14,144 --> 01:13:15,187
Finished!

889
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:17,856
It's finished!

890
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,650
- Well done!
- It's beautiful!

891
01:13:19,733 --> 01:13:21,568
Wait. Ami, sign it.

892
01:13:21,652 --> 01:13:22,528
Oh, right.

893
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:23,612
Yes, sign it.

894
01:13:24,905 --> 01:13:26,782
Not bad!

895
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:29,701
Boss, that's you!

896
01:13:29,785 --> 01:13:31,328
Oh yeah, on the right.

897
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:32,412
It's you!

898
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:39,294
It's great!
It'll be the gem of this place!

899
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:40,963
Jimmy.

900
01:13:41,046 --> 01:13:42,005
How is it?

901
01:13:42,089 --> 01:13:43,131
Compliment it.

902
01:13:46,802 --> 01:13:49,847
I think it's OK.

903
01:13:50,681 --> 01:13:52,850
Why are you acting like that?

904
01:13:52,933 --> 01:13:54,059
Say more.

905
01:13:54,142 --> 01:13:56,270
Give him a break. He's shy.

906
01:13:56,353 --> 01:13:58,564
Shy? What for?

907
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,626
Jimmy.

908
01:14:23,255 --> 01:14:24,715
What?

909
01:14:24,798 --> 01:14:25,966
Sit.

910
01:14:35,434 --> 01:14:36,894
You look pale.

911
01:14:38,353 --> 01:14:41,064
Like that time you gave up basketball.

912
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:43,192
Leave me alone.

913
01:14:49,489 --> 01:14:51,283
I was glad, you know?

914
01:14:53,994 --> 01:14:55,871
You started working part-time,

915
01:14:55,954 --> 01:14:57,581
made new friends…

916
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:00,125
It was great seeing you come alive again.

917
01:15:03,629 --> 01:15:04,546
Oh.

918
01:15:05,255 --> 01:15:07,466
Those kinds of encounters

919
01:15:07,549 --> 01:15:10,093
don't happen often in life.

920
01:15:13,222 --> 01:15:15,307
You only live once,

921
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:17,059
so don't leave any regrets.

922
01:15:22,022 --> 01:15:23,357
Here,

923
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:26,151
have some fruit.

924
01:15:59,017 --> 01:16:00,185
Yes?

925
01:16:03,981 --> 01:16:04,815
Ami.

926
01:16:07,818 --> 01:16:11,029
I want to take you somewhere.

927
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:44,646
Want to listen to Mr.Children?

928
01:16:47,733 --> 01:16:48,775
Sure.

929
01:17:36,907 --> 01:17:38,158
Ami…

930
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:44,706
Don't go.

931
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:09,773
Sorry, it's almost over.

932
01:18:09,857 --> 01:18:11,024
It's okay.

933
01:18:11,108 --> 01:18:12,985
- You go, I'll park the car.
- Yes.

934
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:14,820
Later, then.

935
01:18:35,757 --> 01:18:37,301
So many people here…

936
01:18:40,179 --> 01:18:41,722
Lanterns…

937
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:42,699
Wow!

938
01:19:43,242 --> 01:19:44,368
Be careful.

939
01:19:59,258 --> 01:20:00,634
What did you write?

940
01:20:03,011 --> 01:20:04,805
I hope to find my dream

941
01:20:04,888 --> 01:20:07,891
and make it come true.

942
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:10,936
Nice.

943
01:20:12,437 --> 01:20:13,605
And you?

944
01:20:16,024 --> 01:20:19,278
My dream is always the same.

945
01:20:19,361 --> 01:20:24,408
MAY MY TRAVELS NEVER END.

946
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:28,036
Cool.

947
01:20:30,581 --> 01:20:32,416
Here we go!

948
01:20:32,499 --> 01:20:33,750
OK.

949
01:20:33,834 --> 01:20:35,627
- Got it?
- OK.

950
01:20:38,422 --> 01:20:42,384
I hope I can land a real job
and get a boyfriend this year!

951
01:20:46,096 --> 01:20:47,389
Lower it.

952
01:20:48,599 --> 01:20:50,517
Wait for it to fill up.

953
01:20:53,645 --> 01:20:54,771
Jimmy.

954
01:20:57,649 --> 01:20:59,109
Let's make a promise.

955
01:21:00,819 --> 01:21:04,531
Let's meet again
after we realize our dreams.

956
01:21:06,283 --> 01:21:08,911
Until then,
no matter how hard things become,

957
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:11,705
we won't give up…

958
01:21:13,832 --> 01:21:16,210
We'll never, ever give up.

959
01:21:22,341 --> 01:21:23,634
OK.

960
01:21:25,344 --> 01:21:26,929
Promise.

961
01:21:29,181 --> 01:21:30,724
Hold the base.

962
01:21:31,975 --> 01:21:34,144
Let go on the count of three.

963
01:21:34,895 --> 01:21:35,812
Get ready.

964
01:21:35,896 --> 01:21:36,772
- Ready?
- Let's do it.

965
01:21:40,901 --> 01:21:42,653
Three…

966
01:21:43,362 --> 01:21:44,404
two,

967
01:21:45,155 --> 01:21:46,240
one.

968
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:02,297
Jimmy.

969
01:22:06,593 --> 01:22:07,427
Thank you.

970
01:22:49,052 --> 01:22:55,475
MAY OUR TRAVELS CONTINUE.

971
01:23:19,208 --> 01:23:20,083
Here.

972
01:23:28,008 --> 01:23:28,842
Ami.

973
01:23:28,926 --> 01:23:30,761
I'll come visit you.

974
01:23:31,345 --> 01:23:32,596
Xiè xie.

975
01:23:33,222 --> 01:23:35,057
You, too.

976
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:36,016
Thank you.

977
01:23:36,099 --> 01:23:37,893
- Thank you.
- All right.

978
01:23:37,976 --> 01:23:41,688
You drew me thinner than I am.

979
01:23:41,772 --> 01:23:44,107
Thank you, Ami!

980
01:23:44,191 --> 01:23:45,776
Thank you.

981
01:23:45,859 --> 01:23:47,319
Thanks, Ami.

982
01:23:47,402 --> 01:23:49,196
Thank you so much.

983
01:23:51,114 --> 01:23:52,074
Thank you.

984
01:23:52,157 --> 01:23:54,117
Jimmy, hurry.

985
01:23:59,206 --> 01:24:04,211
FOR AMI

986
01:24:04,753 --> 01:24:07,464
WHAT A GREAT MONTH IT WAS!
TAKE CARE, KARAOKE KOBE

987
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:13,595
Thank you, everyone.

988
01:24:17,558 --> 01:24:18,642
Jimmy.

989
01:24:21,186 --> 01:24:22,771
See you.

990
01:24:23,772 --> 01:24:25,148
See you.

991
01:24:33,699 --> 01:24:35,075
Come back anytime.

992
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:36,326
Thank you.

993
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:38,078
Come see us again.

994
01:24:38,161 --> 01:24:39,413
- Thank you.
- Bye.

995
01:24:39,496 --> 01:24:42,207
- Take care.
- Bye, Ami.

996
01:24:44,293 --> 01:24:45,210
Bye.

997
01:24:48,881 --> 01:24:50,674
Bye.

998
01:24:58,348 --> 01:24:59,808
Goodbye.

999
01:26:02,412 --> 01:26:05,749
Next stop, Tadami. Tadami.

1000
01:26:05,832 --> 01:26:08,502
The doors on the right will open.

1001
01:26:32,317 --> 01:26:34,236
Tadami, Fukushima.

1002
01:26:36,113 --> 01:26:37,573
The town

1003
01:26:38,365 --> 01:26:40,325
where Ami was born and raised.

1004
01:27:06,602 --> 01:27:08,478
Excuse me.

1005
01:27:08,562 --> 01:27:09,688
Yeah?

1006
01:27:09,771 --> 01:27:11,231
I'm lost.

1007
01:27:12,024 --> 01:27:14,109
I want to go here.

1008
01:27:14,985 --> 01:27:16,236
Where?

1009
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:20,908
You know Ami?

1010
01:27:23,327 --> 01:27:24,578
Yes.

1011
01:27:25,746 --> 01:27:26,663
I see.

1012
01:27:27,748 --> 01:27:29,458
It's quite a walk from here.

1013
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:31,251
Want a ride?

1014
01:27:32,794 --> 01:27:33,670
What, really?

1015
01:27:33,754 --> 01:27:34,671
Yeah.

1016
01:27:35,714 --> 01:27:37,007
Thank you.

1017
01:27:37,591 --> 01:27:38,467
Hop in.

1018
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:39,426
Oh, yes.

1019
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:55,150
Ami told me so much
about her trip to Taiwan.

1020
01:27:56,527 --> 01:27:59,446
I began to feel like I went there myself.

1021
01:28:01,448 --> 01:28:05,619
Like how she lost her wallet
and worked at a karaoke joint.

1022
01:28:05,702 --> 01:28:09,331
I worked there, too.

1023
01:28:10,207 --> 01:28:11,708
Is that so?

1024
01:28:14,586 --> 01:28:16,213
Trips are great, aren't they?

1025
01:28:17,673 --> 01:28:20,300
She said she was going to Brazil next.

1026
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:25,389
Hard to put into words, but…

1027
01:28:26,807 --> 01:28:29,101
God can be so cruel.

1028
01:28:38,318 --> 01:28:39,695
Hello?

1029
01:28:41,405 --> 01:28:42,739
Jimmy?

1030
01:28:42,823 --> 01:28:44,449
Ami.

1031
01:28:45,742 --> 01:28:47,494
It's been a while.

1032
01:28:48,704 --> 01:28:51,415
It has been a while.

1033
01:28:53,208 --> 01:28:55,627
Thank you for your letter.

1034
01:28:57,129 --> 01:29:00,215
So you got it. Great.

1035
01:29:01,842 --> 01:29:05,679
Winter vacation starts next week.

1036
01:29:06,555 --> 01:29:07,973
I want to go to Japan.

1037
01:29:10,475 --> 01:29:15,314
Maybe I'll go see the snow in Tadami.

1038
01:29:19,902 --> 01:29:22,279
Not yet.

1039
01:29:25,365 --> 01:29:26,575
What?

1040
01:29:26,658 --> 01:29:29,411
Have you forgotten our promise?

1041
01:29:31,955 --> 01:29:33,332
No, but…

1042
01:29:35,876 --> 01:29:38,212
And I'm traveling again from next week.

1043
01:29:41,465 --> 01:29:42,549
Where to?

1044
01:29:43,425 --> 01:29:45,219
The other side of the world.

1045
01:29:46,428 --> 01:29:47,471
With my boyfriend.

1046
01:29:52,017 --> 01:29:53,310
I see.

1047
01:29:57,356 --> 01:30:00,400
I'll write you again. Bye.

1048
01:30:20,963 --> 01:30:22,339
Yuko.

1049
01:30:23,632 --> 01:30:25,008
You have a visitor.

1050
01:30:25,092 --> 01:30:26,301
Coming.

1051
01:30:29,263 --> 01:30:30,264
Mr. Nakazato.

1052
01:30:30,347 --> 01:30:32,474
Says he's Ami's friend.

1053
01:30:32,558 --> 01:30:34,017
He was lost, so I brought him.

1054
01:30:34,101 --> 01:30:35,519
Thanks.

1055
01:30:37,104 --> 01:30:38,605
He's from Taiwan.

1056
01:30:46,029 --> 01:30:50,617
Are you Jimmy, by any chance?

1057
01:30:54,663 --> 01:30:55,873
Yes.

1058
01:31:02,129 --> 01:31:03,964
So we meet at last.

1059
01:31:06,925 --> 01:31:10,596
I'm sorry it took so long.

1060
01:31:20,439 --> 01:31:23,358
Thank you for coming from so far.

1061
01:31:24,234 --> 01:31:25,068
No.

1062
01:31:25,152 --> 01:31:28,113
All this snow must have surprised you.

1063
01:31:35,579 --> 01:31:37,080
Thank you.

1064
01:31:39,499 --> 01:31:40,667
Thank you.

1065
01:31:42,503 --> 01:31:44,254
Sorry to come without notice.

1066
01:31:44,338 --> 01:31:46,965
Don't be. I'm so glad you came.

1067
01:31:48,717 --> 01:31:52,888
I'm amazed at how well you speak Japanese.

1068
01:31:54,264 --> 01:31:56,600
Did Ami teach you?

1069
01:31:58,644 --> 01:31:59,728
Yes.

1070
01:32:00,979 --> 01:32:04,608
And I kept studying after she left.

1071
01:32:04,691 --> 01:32:05,943
I see.

1072
01:32:14,993 --> 01:32:19,164
She used to say that her shy boyfriend

1073
01:32:19,248 --> 01:32:21,708
who is four years younger
was waiting for her in Taiwan.

1074
01:32:23,001 --> 01:32:25,671
So she had to hang in there.

1075
01:32:36,473 --> 01:32:41,436
Please show her your face.

1076
01:32:48,193 --> 01:32:49,486
Yes.

1077
01:34:04,937 --> 01:34:07,523
Such a messy room, isn't it?

1078
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:11,860
It's so like her.

1079
01:34:20,077 --> 01:34:23,539
She insisted on traveling
despite her condition…

1080
01:34:23,622 --> 01:34:24,873
HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY

1081
01:34:24,957 --> 01:34:26,875
…though we told her not to.

1082
01:34:28,043 --> 01:34:31,839
Then she suddenly came home
one day and said

1083
01:34:31,922 --> 01:34:36,885
she wanted to pursue other treatment
options after all.

1084
01:34:38,971 --> 01:34:41,473
Just did whatever she wanted.

1085
01:35:04,037 --> 01:35:07,457
She said she wanted to travel
around the world,

1086
01:35:09,084 --> 01:35:12,379
but Taiwan ended up being
the only place she went.

1087
01:35:12,462 --> 01:35:14,673
LET'S MEET AGAIN AFTER
WE REALIZE OUR DREAMS. FROM JIMMY

1088
01:35:14,756 --> 01:35:19,803
She used to say
she was so glad she chose Taiwan,

1089
01:35:21,847 --> 01:35:25,976
and seemed so happy until the end.

1090
01:35:36,778 --> 01:35:38,113
Here.

1091
01:35:39,907 --> 01:35:41,742
BOOK OF TAIWAN

1092
01:35:41,825 --> 01:35:43,327
It's for you.

1093
01:35:46,455 --> 01:35:47,873
Are you sure?

1094
01:35:49,041 --> 01:35:54,421
I think it's a love letter
she left for you.

1095
01:36:50,978 --> 01:36:53,939
Traveling solo at last.

1096
01:36:54,022 --> 01:36:57,818
Hope to keep drawing pictures
that only I can draw.

1097
01:37:00,571 --> 01:37:04,700
First stop, Taiwan. Looking forward to it!

1098
01:37:09,371 --> 01:37:10,205
Hello.

1099
01:37:10,873 --> 01:37:13,292
Tainan at last!

1100
01:37:13,375 --> 01:37:16,962
It's my first visit,
but the scenic city has a nostalgic feel.

1101
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:27,472
Miss, do you want to take a break first?

1102
01:37:27,556 --> 01:37:29,057
I'm sorry!

1103
01:37:29,141 --> 01:37:30,517
Just a bit more.

1104
01:37:35,230 --> 01:37:37,399
I used poe divination.

1105
01:37:37,482 --> 01:37:41,069
Wished for a good trip until the end,

1106
01:37:41,153 --> 01:37:42,863
but then I lost my wallet.

1107
01:37:42,946 --> 01:37:44,281
I don't get it.

1108
01:37:58,170 --> 01:37:59,755
Hello!

1109
01:38:10,349 --> 01:38:11,350
- The boss.
- Boss.

1110
01:38:11,433 --> 01:38:15,521
Boys from the south have mysterious grace.

1111
01:38:16,855 --> 01:38:19,650
Happy to work here, Karaoke Kobe!

1112
01:38:42,923 --> 01:38:44,132
Jimmy.

1113
01:38:46,593 --> 01:38:51,265
I wonder what we'll be like
when we grow older.

1114
01:38:55,269 --> 01:38:59,398
I wish this moment would last forever.

1115
01:39:12,286 --> 01:39:14,830
So I should just sit still
and wait to die?

1116
01:39:14,913 --> 01:39:17,165
You're being selfish, too!

1117
01:39:17,249 --> 01:39:19,585
I'm worried about your condition!

1118
01:39:19,668 --> 01:39:22,254
I know that!

1119
01:39:22,337 --> 01:39:24,298
I know, but…

1120
01:39:30,721 --> 01:39:32,139
I'm sorry.

1121
01:39:34,892 --> 01:39:36,602
I just need more time.

1122
01:39:37,561 --> 01:39:38,645
Ami…

1123
01:39:55,996 --> 01:39:57,789
No, wait after you knock!

1124
01:40:05,547 --> 01:40:08,258
MOVIE EXCHANGE COUPON

1125
01:40:25,317 --> 01:40:27,027
It's OK.

1126
01:40:27,819 --> 01:40:30,239
Thank you, Jimmy.

1127
01:41:46,648 --> 01:41:47,524
Ami…

1128
01:41:47,608 --> 01:41:49,067
Don't go.

1129
01:42:20,265 --> 01:42:21,600
Jimmy.

1130
01:42:24,269 --> 01:42:25,771
Thank you.

1131
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:07,354
LET'S MEET AGAIN AFTER
WE REALIZE OUR DREAMS. FROM JIMMY

1132
01:43:32,838 --> 01:43:33,839
Jimmy?

1133
01:43:33,922 --> 01:43:34,756
Ami.

1134
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:38,010
Have you forgotten our promise?

1135
01:43:38,093 --> 01:43:40,721
And I'm traveling again from next week.

1136
01:43:43,348 --> 01:43:44,516
Where to?

1137
01:43:46,518 --> 01:43:48,312
The other side of the world.

1138
01:43:51,148 --> 01:43:52,608
With my boyfriend.

1139
01:43:56,987 --> 01:43:58,155
I see.

1140
01:44:10,959 --> 01:44:13,003
I'll write you again.

1141
01:44:19,009 --> 01:44:20,302
Bye.

1142
01:44:44,785 --> 01:44:50,040
I wonder if
you've found your dream, Jimmy.

1143
01:44:52,042 --> 01:44:53,919
I'm sure you're working hard.

1144
01:45:53,812 --> 01:45:57,316
I miss you, Jimmy.

1145
01:46:24,718 --> 01:46:27,346
I'll always be rooting

1146
01:46:27,429 --> 01:46:30,224
for your dream to come true.

1147
01:46:32,434 --> 01:46:36,355
Thank you for coming into my life,

1148
01:46:36,438 --> 01:46:37,773
Jimmy.

1149
01:47:56,852 --> 01:48:00,439
DEAR AMI

1150
01:48:10,949 --> 01:48:12,993
Dear Ami,

1151
01:48:13,076 --> 01:48:15,120
This is my first letter to you.

1152
01:48:18,165 --> 01:48:19,875
18 long years

1153
01:48:20,626 --> 01:48:22,961
have passed since the day

1154
01:48:23,795 --> 01:48:25,756
we flew that lantern together.

1155
01:48:29,551 --> 01:48:31,386
After you went home,

1156
01:48:33,138 --> 01:48:34,806
I went to university in Taipei.

1157
01:48:34,890 --> 01:48:36,725
- Bye!
- Visit often!

1158
01:48:38,894 --> 01:48:41,438
Taipei was full of all kinds of things,

1159
01:48:41,522 --> 01:48:44,816
it was fresh and dazzling,

1160
01:48:45,692 --> 01:48:47,903
and I was a bit overwhelmed.

1161
01:48:48,779 --> 01:48:49,655
But

1162
01:48:49,738 --> 01:48:51,740
I wanted to be someone like you,

1163
01:48:51,823 --> 01:48:54,826
the kind of person who inspires others…

1164
01:48:54,910 --> 01:48:56,328
What game are you playing?

1165
01:48:56,411 --> 01:48:57,454
…so I lived every day earnestly.

1166
01:48:57,538 --> 01:48:58,580
It's the same game!

1167
01:48:58,664 --> 01:49:00,374
- The same one?
- Yes.

1168
01:49:00,457 --> 01:49:02,042
I'm Lin Chia-ming.

1169
01:49:02,125 --> 01:49:02,960
Call me Jimmy.

1170
01:49:03,043 --> 01:49:04,211
I'm Aaron.

1171
01:49:04,962 --> 01:49:08,882
I got into game programming around then

1172
01:49:08,966 --> 01:49:11,051
and devoted myself to it.

1173
01:49:13,762 --> 01:49:15,180
DRAGON VEIN LEGEND

1174
01:49:15,264 --> 01:49:16,932
Awesome!

1175
01:49:18,892 --> 01:49:21,395
Couldn't graduate because of that.

1176
01:49:22,312 --> 01:49:23,146
Put the whiteboard over there…

1177
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:24,398
This is great!

1178
01:49:24,481 --> 01:49:26,358
Help me over here, please.

1179
01:49:27,192 --> 01:49:28,527
I became so wrapped up in it that

1180
01:49:28,610 --> 01:49:31,905
I had no time to reminisce my past.

1181
01:49:31,989 --> 01:49:32,948
Put more heart into it!

1182
01:49:35,993 --> 01:49:37,953
- We can do this!
- One more time.

1183
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:40,581
Got my first girlfriend

1184
01:49:40,664 --> 01:49:42,291
when I was 25 years old.

1185
01:49:42,374 --> 01:49:43,959
I don't want to see you again.

1186
01:49:45,210 --> 01:49:48,297
But I was too caught up in my work

1187
01:49:49,089 --> 01:49:50,299
so she dumped me after 3 months.

1188
01:49:54,178 --> 01:49:55,971
And

1189
01:49:56,054 --> 01:49:58,765
when our game was completed,

1190
01:50:04,313 --> 01:50:05,898
I called you.

1191
01:50:13,947 --> 01:50:15,115
Hello?

1192
01:50:16,116 --> 01:50:17,159
Ami.

1193
01:51:05,874 --> 01:51:09,127
I was afraid to confront your death.

1194
01:51:10,254 --> 01:51:11,880
Losing you

1195
01:51:11,964 --> 01:51:13,715
made me lose control,

1196
01:51:13,799 --> 01:51:14,883
How many times must I repeat?

1197
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:18,262
and I had to immerse myself in work.

1198
01:51:22,099 --> 01:51:24,601
Our company grew and grew,

1199
01:51:26,562 --> 01:51:30,190
but I gradually lost all emotion.

1200
01:51:30,274 --> 01:51:31,483
I can fix it.

1201
01:51:31,567 --> 01:51:33,026
Get up, I'll do it myself.

1202
01:51:33,110 --> 01:51:35,112
This is the investor,
Li, I told you about.

1203
01:51:35,195 --> 01:51:36,655
We finally meet.

1204
01:51:36,738 --> 01:51:38,532
Look here, 1, 2, 3.

1205
01:51:41,618 --> 01:51:43,328
Next thing I knew,

1206
01:51:44,288 --> 01:51:46,123
I was alone.

1207
01:51:46,206 --> 01:51:50,043
Your approach will pile up deficits.

1208
01:51:50,127 --> 01:51:51,920
The times are changing.

1209
01:51:52,004 --> 01:51:54,339
I founded Jam Games!

1210
01:52:08,145 --> 01:52:11,481
That's when your postcard

1211
01:52:15,194 --> 01:52:17,237
inspired me to travel.

1212
01:52:32,669 --> 01:52:34,880
I remember when you said,

1213
01:52:36,298 --> 01:52:39,968
"I wonder what we'll be like
when we grow older."

1214
01:52:42,971 --> 01:52:44,348
I met you,

1215
01:52:46,350 --> 01:52:48,018
fell in love,

1216
01:52:49,853 --> 01:52:51,522
and now…

1217
01:52:52,731 --> 01:52:55,317
I'm saying goodbye
to that moment in my youth.

1218
01:52:56,818 --> 01:52:58,529
That alone

1219
01:53:00,405 --> 01:53:02,741
made this trip meaningful.

1220
01:53:06,286 --> 01:53:08,872
AARON: BEST OF LUCK IN THE FUTURE.
SEE YOU.

1221
01:53:08,956 --> 01:53:14,169
JIMMY: THANKS, MAN. SEE YOU AROUND.

1222
01:53:19,758 --> 01:53:21,426
Like you said,

1223
01:53:23,345 --> 01:53:26,431
there doesn't have to be an end goal.

1224
01:53:28,350 --> 01:53:30,602
I'll keep traveling.

1225
01:53:32,771 --> 01:53:34,815
I'm sorry

1226
01:53:34,898 --> 01:53:36,191
it took me so long.

1227
01:53:38,026 --> 01:53:39,152
Ami.

1228
01:53:42,030 --> 01:53:43,532
Thank you.

1229
01:54:07,055 --> 01:54:08,015
How is it?

1230
01:54:08,682 --> 01:54:10,475
It's not big,

1231
01:54:10,559 --> 01:54:11,560
but enough space

1232
01:54:11,643 --> 01:54:13,270
for one.

1233
01:54:18,734 --> 01:54:19,943
True.

1234
01:54:21,195 --> 01:54:22,321
I'll take it.

1235
01:54:22,404 --> 01:54:23,614
Great!

1236
01:54:33,415 --> 01:54:36,043
So what's next for you?

1237
01:54:42,132 --> 01:54:44,426
I'm not sure yet.

1238
01:54:49,389 --> 01:54:51,725
I'll be

1239
01:54:51,808 --> 01:54:54,686
on your side no matter what happens…

1240
01:54:54,770 --> 01:54:55,896
Maybe.

1241
01:54:55,979 --> 01:54:56,980
Maybe?

1242
01:54:58,148 --> 01:54:59,316
Really?

1243
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:07,074
KARAOKE KOBE

1244
01:56:21,523 --> 01:56:22,816
Jimmy.

1245
01:56:36,747 --> 01:56:37,998
Ami.

1246
