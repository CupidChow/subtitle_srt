00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,329
Self Introduction

00:01:13,196 --> 00:01:15,263
RESUME

3
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:40,130
Hear Me: Our Summer

4
00:01:48,763 --> 00:01:49,763
Done.

5
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:50,963
Do it.

6
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:52,629
I won't.

7
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:54,163
Do it.

8
00:01:59,163 --> 00:02:01,763
I'll find a job mom.

9
00:02:01,963 --> 00:02:03,129
I just need to find a job, right?

10
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:07,296
With this?

11
00:02:07,297 --> 00:02:08,596
RESUME

12
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:09,796
Yeah.

13
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,596
Where?

14
00:02:12,163 --> 00:02:13,329
Somewhere but here.

15
00:02:15,963 --> 00:02:19,429
For now... I'd like to...

16
00:02:19,863 --> 00:02:22,496
Isn't doing nothing what you want to do?

17
00:02:23,096 --> 00:02:24,096
Perhaps.

18
00:02:24,363 --> 00:02:27,829
You said you don't know
what you want to do?

19
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:29,063
For now, just do it.

20
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:31,362
But mom, this is not it.

21
00:02:31,363 --> 00:02:33,163
Can you not get an office job?

22
00:02:33,963 --> 00:02:35,463
Philosophy isn't really popular these days.

23
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:36,629
Unpopu-losophy.
(makeshift korean wordplay in english).

24
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:41,603
What about civil service?

25
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,363
It's stable.

26
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,196
It doesn't suit my personality.

27
00:02:45,663 --> 00:02:46,929
What's your personality?

28
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:48,429
That, from now on, I'll have to...

29
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:52,063
Figure out slowly.

30
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:54,229
Figure out or not, I don't care.

31
00:02:56,029 --> 00:02:57,129
Start working from today.

32
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:58,329
Mom...

33
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,862
Just do it for 3 months.

34
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:01,563
Find what you want to do while working.

35
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:07,103
In return, I'll raise your allowance.

36
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:09,429
Hurry. There are a lot of deliveries left.

37
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,229
Go.

38
00:03:25,263 --> 00:03:26,263
Mom.

39
00:03:26,863 --> 00:03:27,863
What's that?

40
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:30,663
Who allowed that ugly thing to be installed?

41
00:03:31,496 --> 00:03:32,496
I did.

42
00:03:32,563 --> 00:03:35,029
Mom, that scooter's not for deliveries.

43
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:36,763
If I say it is, then it is.

44
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:38,229
Aren't you leaving?

45
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:52,363
No, this is...

46
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:54,596
How about this?

47
00:03:54,663 --> 00:03:55,763
VEGETABLE RICE LUNCHBOXES

48
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:57,196
It's good.

49
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:58,663
Good? Did I do a good job?

50
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:04,463
Did I? Yong Jun saw it too.

51
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:07,596
Oh my, good job!

52
00:04:15,996 --> 00:04:18,563
At least tell me beforehand.

53
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:42,196
SPORTS CENTER

54
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,096
Where is the swimming pool?

55
00:04:59,163 --> 00:05:01,529
I can't hear.

56
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:08,663
I never imagined I'd use this, 
not even in my dreams

57
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:11,829
What was it again?

58
00:05:14,663 --> 00:05:16,663
Swimming pool...

59
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:20,496
Where?

60
00:05:21,429 --> 00:05:22,629
Entrance.

61
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:29,795
Thank You.

62
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:30,996
Goodbye.

63
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,762
Ga Eul, you finally broke 30 seconds.

64
00:06:30,763 --> 00:06:33,063
- Really? - Yeah, nice work.

65
00:06:43,763 --> 00:06:45,128
You finally broke the record.

66
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,428
I've always been fast.

67
00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:47,429
You're so cocky.

68
00:06:56,929 --> 00:06:59,129
I'll leave first. I'm late for my part-time job.

69
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:04,363
Please check if everything's there.

70
00:07:07,063 --> 00:07:09,596
Let me check.

71
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:20,229
It checks out, thank you.

72
00:07:36,996 --> 00:07:38,896
Hello.

73
00:07:39,796 --> 00:07:41,096
Hello.

74
00:07:42,063 --> 00:07:43,728
I was

75
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,195
Over there

76
00:07:45,196 --> 00:07:46,729
Delivering food.

77
00:07:47,663 --> 00:07:48,729
I saw.

78
00:07:52,996 --> 00:07:56,029
Just now

79
00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:00,363
Is she a swimmer too?

80
00:08:01,363 --> 00:08:02,363
Who?

81
00:08:02,364 --> 00:08:04,928
From there

82
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:08,095
She came with a stopwatch

83
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:10,095
The one who was with you.

84
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:11,096
No, she's not.

85
00:08:11,563 --> 00:08:12,662
Then, friend?

86
00:08:12,663 --> 00:08:14,963
No, she's my older sister.

87
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:18,296
What's her name?

88
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:21,229
Are you trying to pick up girls?

89
00:08:22,663 --> 00:08:24,896
No, that's not..

90
00:08:26,196 --> 00:08:27,696
No.

91
00:08:28,563 --> 00:08:30,429
You're right.

92
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:34,763
My name? Or my sister's name?

93
00:08:35,196 --> 00:08:36,862
Your sister's.

94
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,829
No, both.

95
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,128
Both...

96
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:44,129
Are you flirting right now?

97
00:08:44,763 --> 00:08:46,796
No, that's not it.

98
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:58,928
My name is Seo Ga Eul.

99
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:00,763
This is my face name (her name in sign language).

100
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:04,228
My sister's name is Seo Yeo Reum.

101
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:06,229
This is her face name.

102
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:09,763
Phone number...

103
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:14,196
Your sister's...

104
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:22,563
Ask her yourself.

105
00:09:36,063 --> 00:09:37,363
I'm back.

106
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:40,063
Nice work.

107
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:41,763
Just wait.

108
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:53,063
- Mom. 
- What?

109
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:56,329
- That has to be delivered, right? 
- Yes.

110
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,229
Then, I'll do it.

111
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:15,063
Hello.

112
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:16,396
- Take care. 
- Yeah.

113
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:51,863
Hello.

114
00:10:54,096 --> 00:10:55,996
Swimming pool...

115
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:57,429
Food delivery.

116
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,096
Hello.

117
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:09,263
Can I take a look at it?

118
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:11,428
I might not be good at anything,

119
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:13,196
But there's nothing I can't do.

120
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:17,696
Please help me if you don't mind.

121
00:11:32,463 --> 00:11:35,595
This is a carburetor engine.

122
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:38,862
When you use old oil, dirt accumulates.

123
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:40,862
If you clean it, it will start.

124
00:11:40,863 --> 00:11:41,995
Thank You.

125
00:11:41,996 --> 00:11:44,063
Umm... will it take a long time?

126
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:45,795
About an hour?

127
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:47,629
We can't do it here...

128
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:50,529
Are you in a hurry?

129
00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:00,428
Then, take mine and go.

130
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,328
I'll fix this.

131
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:03,895
No.

132
00:12:03,896 --> 00:12:05,263
You must be busy too...

133
00:12:05,563 --> 00:12:06,662
Not at all!

134
00:12:06,663 --> 00:12:11,496
Use mine, let's swap next time we meet.

135
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:18,829
Thank You.

136
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:31,663
No...

137
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:33,696
We have to exchange scooters.

138
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:36,563
Your phone, I'll give you my number.

139
00:12:36,963 --> 00:12:37,963
Sorry.

140
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:51,128
Make sure you contact me.

141
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:52,129
Okay.

142
00:13:08,096 --> 00:13:09,096
Save this scooter.

143
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:12,063
Where'd you get this ancient scooter from?

144
00:13:12,763 --> 00:13:13,763
The engine is dirty.

145
00:13:14,296 --> 00:13:15,596
The coil is almost gone.

146
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:22,429
This pad needs to be replaced as well.

147
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:24,329
You can do it, right?

148
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:25,363
Of course.

149
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:26,829
Tomorrow.

150
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:28,896
Tomorrow.

151
00:13:29,363 --> 00:13:30,363
Tomorrow?

152
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:32,296
Morning.

153
00:13:33,196 --> 00:13:35,196
- Is it urgent? 
- Yeah.

154
00:13:36,296 --> 00:13:37,296
And...

155
00:13:38,296 --> 00:13:39,763
Make it look brand new.

156
00:13:40,563 --> 00:13:41,563
I'll get going.

157
00:13:42,563 --> 00:13:43,563
Hey.

158
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,063
What?

159
00:13:45,663 --> 00:13:46,663
What is it?

160
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:49,929
Something's up with you.

161
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,496
- What? 
- What is it?

162
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:52,496
Nothing.

163
00:13:52,763 --> 00:13:53,996
There is something.

164
00:13:54,563 --> 00:13:55,696
There's absolutely nothing.

165
00:13:57,496 --> 00:13:58,829
Something's definitely up.

166
00:14:05,263 --> 00:14:10,228
THE SCOOTER WILL BE READY 
TOMORROW MORNING.

167
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:17,129
WHEN AND WHERE SHOULD WE MEET?

168
00:14:17,163 --> 00:14:17,763
Brat.

169
00:14:18,163 --> 00:14:19,862
- You're slacking off. 
- You scared me.

170
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:20,863
Go deliver this.

171
00:14:21,863 --> 00:14:23,095
Why are you giving this to me?

172
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,096
Because you ditched work,

173
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,663
- Your mom asked me to it. 
- But...

174
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:27,096
Why did the scooter's color change?

175
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:29,729
Good grief.

176
00:14:33,563 --> 00:14:38,363
Is there a place you want to visit by plane?

177
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:43,729
I'd like to get on a plane

178
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:49,096
With my sister, to participate in the Olympics.

179
00:14:49,863 --> 00:14:50,995
That's nice.

180
00:14:50,996 --> 00:14:52,563
Thank you.

181
00:14:58,363 --> 00:15:00,428
THE SCOOTER WILL BE READY
TOMORROW MORNING

182
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:02,862
ARE YOU BUSY?

183
00:15:02,863 --> 00:15:05,029
PLEASE CONTACT ME

184
00:15:05,063 --> 00:15:07,096
YEO REUM?

185
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:13,829
Hey.

186
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,195
Why do you keep coming to my place?

187
00:15:16,196 --> 00:15:17,995
Because my home is my workplace now.

188
00:15:17,996 --> 00:15:19,828
Even after leaving work, 
I'm still at my workplace.

189
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:21,363
I need a break too.

190
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:24,629
You...

191
00:15:25,163 --> 00:15:26,663
Will you continue working part time?

192
00:15:27,063 --> 00:15:28,596
Yeah, for now.

193
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,563
I'll sort out my thoughts.

194
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:33,496
And help my parents a bit.

195
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:34,196
Right.

196
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:37,963
You have to earn money to 
live without getting scolded.

197
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:40,329
Is the scooter ready?

198
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:42,929
Yeah it is.

199
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:44,229
- Take it when you leave. 
- Okay.

200
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:46,829
Hey, that scooter...

201
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:48,663
Did the owner lend it to you?

202
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:55,829
Who is it?

203
00:15:58,196 --> 00:15:58,729
Hey.

204
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,896
I'm not even that curious.

205
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:02,596
For real.

206
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:12,229
You look stupid.

207
00:16:14,396 --> 00:16:15,563
What's that?

208
00:16:16,063 --> 00:16:17,628
Do you do deliveries as well?

209
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:20,128
No, mine broke. So I borrowed it.

210
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:21,496
Mine sucks.

211
00:16:22,796 --> 00:16:23,963
Are you tired?

212
00:16:24,296 --> 00:16:26,429
You broke your record today.

213
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:29,496
I'm not tired at all.

214
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:33,263
Sis, what about international sign language?

215
00:16:33,596 --> 00:16:35,296
I found it really difficult.

216
00:16:35,463 --> 00:16:37,162
It's confusing.

217
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,462
But you can learn it quickly.

218
00:16:39,463 --> 00:16:41,463
I have to go the Olympics with you.

219
00:16:43,163 --> 00:16:45,595
The Olympics is just a dream.

220
00:16:45,596 --> 00:16:48,036
I'd be grateful if I could reach the tryouts.

221
00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:51,062
No! you can definitely do it.

222
00:16:51,063 --> 00:16:52,329
Okaaay...

223
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:54,695
Really?

224
00:16:54,696 --> 00:16:56,863
Yeah, let's go. I'm hungry.

225
00:16:57,563 --> 00:16:59,163
Are you not listening to me?

226
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:01,429
In one ear and out the other.

227
00:17:02,496 --> 00:17:03,629
You're so annoying.

228
00:18:11,963 --> 00:18:13,803
THE SCOOTER WILL BE READY 
TOMORROW MORNING.

229
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:14,963
HELLO?

230
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:17,129
YOUR SCOOTER IS READY.

231
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:18,829
DID I GET SCAMMED?

232
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:26,663
SORRY, I WAS VERY BUSY YESTERDAY.

233
00:18:27,063 --> 00:18:28,963
IT'S OKAY, YOUR SCOOTER IS READY.

234
00:18:29,663 --> 00:18:32,296
REALLY? THANK YOU SO MUCH.

235
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:34,829
Who?

236
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:36,196
The scooter owner?

237
00:18:37,263 --> 00:18:37,796
Is it a woman?

238
00:18:38,163 --> 00:18:39,563
WHEN DO WE SWAP??

239
00:18:39,696 --> 00:18:40,696
It must be a woman.

240
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:43,396
Is she pretty?

241
00:18:43,729 --> 00:18:44,429
Wait.

242
00:18:44,496 --> 00:18:46,896
- Is she pretty? 
- Just wait.

243
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:48,628
HOW ABOUT 10 0'CLOCK LATER?

244
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,996
LET'S MEET AT THAT ALLEY FROM YESTERDAY!

245
00:18:54,863 --> 00:18:56,329
What is it?

246
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:58,563
Nothing, let's eat.

247
00:19:21,396 --> 00:19:22,396
Alright.

248
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:24,063
Done.

249
00:19:34,363 --> 00:19:37,663
Lee Yong Jun.

250
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:09,796
It's very clean.

251
00:20:10,229 --> 00:20:14,829
I washed it with water in the morning.

252
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:16,663
Thank You.

253
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:19,096
How much did it cost?

254
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:21,429
It's okay, it's just a minor repair.

255
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:22,896
Still...

256
00:20:27,229 --> 00:20:28,529
It's really okay.

257
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:31,829
I am

258
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,829
26 years old.

259
00:20:33,996 --> 00:20:35,363
What about you?

260
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:38,196
I'm 26 too.

261
00:20:38,596 --> 00:20:39,929
We're the same age.

262
00:20:41,196 --> 00:20:45,496
Then, instead of the repair cost.

263
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,996
Let's be friends.

264
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:52,429
Why?

265
00:20:54,363 --> 00:20:57,263
There's no honorifics in sign language anyway.

266
00:20:57,729 --> 00:21:00,829
So we've been friends since the beginning.

267
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:03,563
Is that okay?

268
00:21:10,296 --> 00:21:13,996
Your face name suits you.

269
00:21:16,129 --> 00:21:18,795
Ahh, I'm not a weirdo.

270
00:21:18,796 --> 00:21:20,462
Actually, yesterday...

271
00:21:20,463 --> 00:21:23,996
I asked your sister.

272
00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:27,063
Because I wanted to be friends.

273
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:29,128
Sorry.

274
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:30,596
It's okay.

275
00:21:31,363 --> 00:21:36,029
You must've gotten that name because you always smile like that.

276
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:40,329
Oh, I didn't even ask your name...

277
00:21:40,863 --> 00:21:45,396
My name is Yong Jun.

278
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:48,829
My face name...

279
00:21:50,363 --> 00:21:51,363
Is this.

280
00:21:51,896 --> 00:21:52,663
Because you like 

281
00:21:52,664 --> 00:21:53,984
taking photos?

282
00:21:54,296 --> 00:21:58,196
It means "take a picture of my face and save it forever".

283
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,962
Then...

284
00:22:03,963 --> 00:22:07,329
To celebrate our friendship

285
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,096
Let's have a meal...

286
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:11,262
Meal?

287
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,563
...Or something else.

288
00:22:14,063 --> 00:22:16,563
How about coffee?

289
00:22:16,963 --> 00:22:19,195
You got my scooter fixed.

290
00:22:19,196 --> 00:22:20,363
My treat.

291
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:24,029
Thank You.

292
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:14,563
Sorry, I have to get going.

293
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:17,929
Give it to me, I'll throw it away.

294
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:19,329
It's okay.

295
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,629
It's okay, I'll do it.

296
00:23:23,163 --> 00:23:24,329
Thank You.

297
00:23:31,463 --> 00:23:34,796
Are you very busy?

298
00:23:35,663 --> 00:23:39,029
A bit, I have training and part time job.

299
00:23:40,596 --> 00:23:43,596
Training and... part time job...

300
00:23:49,196 --> 00:23:50,696
See you later.

301
00:24:14,163 --> 00:24:15,296
Is he dating?

302
00:24:18,063 --> 00:24:19,163
Whom?

303
00:24:19,796 --> 00:24:21,129
How would I know?

304
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:24,096
It can't be Jae Jin.

305
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:27,229
Good grief.

306
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:41,230
HAVE YOU EATEN?

307
00:24:43,856 --> 00:24:45,824
I'M EATING A SANDWICH AT A 
CONVENIENCE STORE.

308
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,729
NO MATTER HOW BUSY YOU ARE 
YOU SHOULD EAT.

309
00:24:53,996 --> 00:24:55,429
Have some coffee.

310
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:58,963
I'm here.

311
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:01,829
What is he doing?

312
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:06,096
Look at him, 
he's suddenly gone crazy.

313
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:18,796
What?

314
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:21,029
It tastes alright.

315
00:25:21,863 --> 00:25:23,129
- Is it good? 
- Yes.

316
00:25:24,296 --> 00:25:25,296
It's good.

317
00:25:26,129 --> 00:25:29,563
Uncle, this might be better 
than looking for a job.

318
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:30,729
Right?

319
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:32,595
Honey, this is it.

320
00:25:32,596 --> 00:25:33,829
Let him do this.

321
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:35,296
Quiet.

322
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:39,429
Why are there so many?

323
00:25:39,629 --> 00:25:42,562
I didn't know what you like.

324
00:25:42,563 --> 00:25:44,962
So I made a bit of everything.

325
00:25:44,963 --> 00:25:46,628
I like everything.

326
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:47,796
Really?

327
00:25:49,063 --> 00:25:50,429
Thank god.

328
00:25:58,596 --> 00:26:01,329
You don't have time, right? Eat it quickly.

329
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:09,929
How is it?

330
00:26:12,163 --> 00:26:13,163
Rellly?

331
00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:18,063
Let's eat together.

332
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:21,796
I'll eat at the store.

333
00:26:23,596 --> 00:26:24,929
Then I'll eat well.

334
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:27,063
Enjoy your meal.

335
00:26:35,363 --> 00:26:37,329
Eat slowly.

336
00:26:41,563 --> 00:26:44,395
How much?

337
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:46,695
It's okay, you don't have to pay.

338
00:26:46,696 --> 00:26:49,696
It's for sale, you can't just give it away.

339
00:26:56,496 --> 00:26:58,129
Is this enough?

340
00:27:06,563 --> 00:27:08,963
Thank you, I ate well.

341
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,929
I ate it, so I'll throw it away.

342
00:27:19,396 --> 00:27:20,496
Bye.

343
00:27:29,896 --> 00:27:31,563
I wasn't trying to sell it.

344
00:27:37,563 --> 00:27:38,563
I'm back.

345
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:42,796
We sold a lot today.

346
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:44,963
- You... 
- Yes.

347
00:27:45,596 --> 00:27:47,463
Why did you suddenly start cooking?

348
00:27:50,163 --> 00:27:51,163
Just because.

349
00:27:52,663 --> 00:27:54,529
Are you going to stay here 
without looking for a job?

350
00:27:54,563 --> 00:27:55,563
No.

351
00:27:56,096 --> 00:27:59,129
Actually, this isn't so bad.

352
00:27:59,163 --> 00:28:00,196
You can't.

353
00:28:00,796 --> 00:28:03,029
You said you'd find a job in 3 months.

354
00:28:03,263 --> 00:28:04,263
I did.

355
00:28:05,863 --> 00:28:07,763
But...

356
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,695
It's exhausting for you and dad, so I...

357
00:28:10,696 --> 00:28:11,696
It's not exhausting.

358
00:28:12,729 --> 00:28:14,463
So don't even dream of it.

359
00:28:14,629 --> 00:28:17,763
You're the one who told me to "do it".

360
00:28:26,129 --> 00:28:27,129
Who is it?

361
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:34,696
Friend.

362
00:28:35,096 --> 00:28:36,163
I'll leave first.

363
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,563
It is a woman.

364
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:44,829
Woman?

365
00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:47,296
Yes, woman.

366
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:48,829
Who?

367
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:50,629
Yong Jun.

368
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:53,662
Yong Jun might be beautiful, 
but he is still a man.

369
00:28:53,663 --> 00:28:57,029
Yong Jun is seeing a woman.

370
00:28:57,063 --> 00:28:58,796
He is dating.

371
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:22,929
GA EUL TRAINING FEE: 
500,000 WON BEFORE JULY 25!

372
00:29:35,196 --> 00:29:41,163
21ST: SWIMMING COMPETITION

373
00:29:47,396 --> 00:29:49,696
- Come out of the pool. 
- You come out too.

374
00:29:49,729 --> 00:29:51,463
- Come out. 
- Are you deaf?

375
00:29:51,496 --> 00:29:52,728
You too?

376
00:29:52,729 --> 00:29:55,262
Does it make sense for you to 
use the same pool as our kids.

377
00:29:55,263 --> 00:29:56,263
Of course it doensn't.

378
00:29:57,863 --> 00:30:00,395
- Can't any of you talk? 
- Call the coach.

379
00:30:00,396 --> 00:30:03,029
- You just cursed, didn't you? 
- Call your guardian.

380
00:30:03,063 --> 00:30:04,296
You get out of here.

381
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:09,596
What are you doing?

382
00:30:11,696 --> 00:30:14,163
What? Are you the coach?

383
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:15,329
What is it?

384
00:30:15,363 --> 00:30:16,996
Get them out of here. We have to practice.

385
00:30:17,163 --> 00:30:19,396
They've already scheduled the training in advance.

386
00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:21,029
So did we.

387
00:30:21,063 --> 00:30:23,729
That's why that area was assigned for you.

388
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:24,895
- They're disabled.
- Are you okay? Let's leave.

389
00:30:24,896 --> 00:30:25,670
- How can we share a pool with them?
- Are you okay? Let's leave.

390
00:30:25,671 --> 00:30:27,442
- How can we share a pool with them? 
- I'm alright.

391
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,063
If we get sick, 
will you take responsibility?

392
00:30:29,064 --> 00:30:30,664
Why would you get sick?

393
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,095
They are all healthy kids.

394
00:30:33,096 --> 00:30:34,463
Whatever.

395
00:30:35,296 --> 00:30:37,563
We'll be back. Make sure you clean up.

396
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:39,495
- With bleach. 
- What did you just say?

397
00:30:39,496 --> 00:30:41,828
Clean it with bleach

398
00:30:41,829 --> 00:30:42,995
And disinfect the water.

399
00:30:42,996 --> 00:30:44,729
You don't even know basic etiquette.

400
00:30:44,963 --> 00:30:46,562
Ji Kyung, change your clothes.

401
00:30:46,563 --> 00:30:48,796
Come out.

402
00:30:49,996 --> 00:30:51,329
Be careful on your way back.

403
00:30:51,763 --> 00:30:53,096
See you later.

404
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:01,763
- Hey lady, 
- What is it?

405
00:31:02,296 --> 00:31:05,496
Deaf people are also able to 
read lips and expressions.

406
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:06,763
What are you on about?

407
00:31:07,396 --> 00:31:09,196
We are people who hear.

408
00:31:09,496 --> 00:31:10,863
They are people who see,

409
00:31:11,463 --> 00:31:12,695
Not people who can't hear,

410
00:31:12,696 --> 00:31:14,829
but those who see more 
clearly than we do.

411
00:31:14,896 --> 00:31:15,529
So?

412
00:31:15,663 --> 00:31:17,828
I saw what you did just now.

413
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:20,496
So what if you did? 
What will you do about it?

414
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,262
Did I say something wrong or 
did I curse at them?

415
00:31:23,263 --> 00:31:24,763
Hey, who are you?

416
00:31:25,896 --> 00:31:26,896
What are you doing?

417
00:31:27,896 --> 00:31:29,763
Why are you taking pictures?

418
00:31:30,496 --> 00:31:31,663
Sitck your head out a little more.

419
00:31:31,996 --> 00:31:33,663
What are you doing?

420
00:31:35,196 --> 00:31:36,196
Are you crazy?

421
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:38,029
Lady,

422
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,629
If you park in an accessible parking area

423
00:31:40,663 --> 00:31:42,229
The fine is 100,000 won.

424
00:31:42,796 --> 00:31:43,963
If you dare report this.

425
00:31:44,829 --> 00:31:45,829
Damn it.

426
00:31:49,996 --> 00:31:53,129
REPORT

427
00:32:16,163 --> 00:32:18,196
Is your sister okay?

428
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:19,763
Did you see it?

429
00:32:22,296 --> 00:32:23,296
She's alright.

430
00:32:23,496 --> 00:32:25,628
And you?

431
00:32:25,629 --> 00:32:26,629
Are you okay?

432
00:32:27,096 --> 00:32:29,128
Me?

433
00:32:29,129 --> 00:32:30,596
I'm alright.

434
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:33,796
This happens sometimes...

435
00:32:35,963 --> 00:32:37,296
But

436
00:32:38,163 --> 00:32:40,896
I really can't get used to it.

437
00:32:53,063 --> 00:32:54,129
Enjoy your meal.

438
00:33:11,963 --> 00:33:14,963
The world seems difficult, doesn't it?

439
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:21,296
The only difference is the lack of sound,

440
00:33:21,896 --> 00:33:24,428
But it's a completely different world.

441
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:27,796
You can't enter or leave. 

442
00:33:34,863 --> 00:33:39,263
It probably won't ever change.

443
00:34:05,829 --> 00:34:07,463
What is it?

444
00:34:09,796 --> 00:34:13,096
Let's go play!

445
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,729
I'm okay standing.

446
00:34:59,529 --> 00:35:03,063
Ask Ga Eul if she's tired...

447
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:10,229
She asked if you were tired?

448
00:35:10,863 --> 00:35:13,696
Going out to play is fun! I'm not tired at all.

449
00:35:14,229 --> 00:35:18,563
She said playing isn't tiring at all.

450
00:35:19,863 --> 00:35:21,129
Thank You.

451
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:27,396
But, doesn't my sister have work today?

452
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:35,829
She asked if it's okay to ditch work?

453
00:35:40,396 --> 00:35:41,396
It's okay.

454
00:35:41,397 --> 00:35:43,296
I've already let them know.

455
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:47,629
She said it's okay.

456
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:27,229
It's delicious!

457
00:37:37,229 --> 00:37:38,929
Why did we come here?

458
00:39:32,463 --> 00:39:34,629
The night air is cool.

459
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:52,228
I was in a bad mood today.

460
00:39:52,229 --> 00:39:54,229
Thank you for making it fun.

461
00:39:56,863 --> 00:39:58,928
I'm a bit tired, so I'll go in first.

462
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:01,463
Sis, you can take your time.

463
00:40:02,463 --> 00:40:03,463
What?

464
00:40:17,663 --> 00:40:19,163
Do you want to go for a walk?

465
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:35,600
BY THE WAY, HOW MUCH DID YOU SPENT?

466
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:44,150
IT'S OKAY. IT'S MY TREAT.

467
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,650
SINCE WE WENT TOGETHER, WE SHOULD PAY TOGETHER.
HOW MUCH IS IT?

468
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,300
IT'S OKAY.

469
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:58,850
DON'T BE LIKE THAT. TELL ME HOW MUCH.

470
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,140
THEN, JUST GIVE ME 30,000 WON

471
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,120
MY SISTER ASKED ME TO GIVE 50,000
BECAUSE SHE'S GRATEFUL.

472
00:42:18,629 --> 00:42:21,629
OKAY, THANKS. LET'S HANG OUT AGAIN.

473
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,380
YEAH. THANK YOU, TOO.

474
00:42:30,263 --> 00:42:32,363
When did I say 50,000 won?

475
00:42:33,696 --> 00:42:34,896
It's fine.

476
00:42:36,563 --> 00:42:39,763
Why are you being so precise with money?

477
00:42:40,396 --> 00:42:42,496
Just treat him next time.

478
00:42:43,563 --> 00:42:45,329
It's because I'm uncomfortable.

479
00:42:47,196 --> 00:42:48,629
What?

480
00:42:49,863 --> 00:42:51,229
Want a beer?

481
00:43:07,829 --> 00:43:09,829
Are you dating him?

482
00:43:10,596 --> 00:43:12,396
We're not dating, we're just friends.

483
00:43:13,696 --> 00:43:15,195
I don't think he feels the same way.

484
00:43:15,196 --> 00:43:16,463
I said we're not.

485
00:43:45,729 --> 00:43:46,629
What?

486
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,429
I'm going to bed, I'm so sleepy.

487
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,330
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR THE MOST...?

488
00:44:18,596 --> 00:44:26,596
YOUR VOICE...

489
00:44:30,296 --> 00:44:33,728
UMM... I'M NOT SURE.
I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK OF ONE.

490
00:44:33,729 --> 00:44:35,696
ARE YOU TIRED? GO TO SLEEP.

491
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:43,029
YEAH. TODAY WAS FUN. GOODNIGHT.

492
00:45:03,963 --> 00:45:05,929
Aren't you late today?

493
00:45:06,629 --> 00:45:08,395
We moved to a new swimming pool.

494
00:45:08,396 --> 00:45:09,828
Because of that lady?

495
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:12,429
Yeah, there were a lot of complaints.

496
00:45:13,529 --> 00:45:15,828
She's too much.

497
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:17,063
Exactly.

498
00:45:17,429 --> 00:45:18,762
Do you avoid poop because you're afraid?

499
00:45:18,763 --> 00:45:20,529
You avoid it cause it's dirty.

500
00:45:22,329 --> 00:45:23,896
What are you eating?

501
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,529
Bread!

502
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:28,896
Where did you move to?

503
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:31,863
Old municipal swimming pool.

504
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:34,228
That's far.

505
00:45:34,229 --> 00:45:36,329
Yeah it is.

506
00:45:37,929 --> 00:45:39,729
Keep up the good work!

507
00:45:39,763 --> 00:45:41,596
Yeah, you too.

00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:05,829
- It looks shabby. - Yeah.

510
00:46:06,863 --> 00:46:08,863
Bro, of course I'll help.

511
00:46:09,163 --> 00:46:11,363
That's the person I was talking about.

512
00:46:13,929 --> 00:46:16,562
- What's the record? 
- 28 seconds.

513
00:46:16,563 --> 00:46:17,629
28?

514
00:46:18,229 --> 00:46:19,963
Is she going to compete?

515
00:46:19,996 --> 00:46:21,729
In the Seoul city hall competition?

516
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,263
I'm confident she can make it to the tryouts.

517
00:46:25,596 --> 00:46:28,095
Anyway, you can use this place comfortably.

518
00:46:28,096 --> 00:46:29,162
Thank you.

519
00:46:29,163 --> 00:46:31,096
I'll use it just until the tryouts.

520
00:46:40,863 --> 00:46:45,529
Shall we learn about international sign language?

521
00:47:18,263 --> 00:47:20,896
I'm hungry, let's go and eat quickly.

What is that?

538
00:49:54,063 --> 00:49:55,629
Gold medal.

539
00:49:56,129 --> 00:49:59,996
Ga Eul set a personal record in the competition.

540
00:50:00,729 --> 00:50:03,363
Congratulations!

541
00:50:05,529 --> 00:50:06,929
Give me a second.

542
00:50:18,763 --> 00:50:19,763
Sorry.

543
00:50:21,363 --> 00:50:24,662
If she reduces her time by a second,

544
00:50:24,663 --> 00:50:26,628
She'll qualify for the tryouts.

545
00:50:26,629 --> 00:50:29,529
If she passes, she'll make the national team!

546
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:33,463
So she's really going to the Olympics?

547
00:50:34,763 --> 00:50:36,663
Yeah, isn't she amazing?

548
00:50:37,229 --> 00:50:41,996
Yeah, you're amazing too!

549
00:50:44,096 --> 00:50:48,429
Should we have a party to celebrate?

550
00:50:51,363 --> 00:50:53,629
What do I do? My sister needs to rest.

551
00:50:53,663 --> 00:50:55,863
I have to make dinner too.

552
00:50:58,696 --> 00:51:01,429
Congratulations.

553
00:51:01,896 --> 00:51:03,529
Thank You.

554
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:06,029
Sis, you should go.

555
00:51:07,963 --> 00:51:10,196
It's okay, we can meet next time.

556
00:51:10,529 --> 00:51:11,763
Sorry.

557
00:51:11,963 --> 00:51:15,329
Just give me 30 minutes.

558
00:51:15,996 --> 00:51:17,929
I'm busy, 
why do you keep looking for me?

559
00:51:17,963 --> 00:51:19,596
What took you so long?

560
00:51:19,763 --> 00:51:22,629
Deliver it here. Hurry.

561
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:24,296
- What is it, I'm busy. 
- Just this once.

562
00:51:24,363 --> 00:51:25,996
- No way. 
- Just this once.

563
00:51:26,029 --> 00:51:28,363
I'm really busy, I can't.

564
00:51:28,429 --> 00:51:29,763
I can't, I'm sorry.

565
00:51:29,996 --> 00:51:32,629
- I'll set you up on a blind date. 
- Do I just deliver it here?

566
00:51:34,529 --> 00:51:35,763
Be careful.

567
00:51:36,596 --> 00:51:40,362
Hey, the owner of the house is very fussy.

568
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:45,229
If you can, 
just put it down and come back.

569
00:51:45,429 --> 00:51:46,996
That's how it's done nowadays.

570
00:51:47,063 --> 00:51:49,063
But, how fussy are they?

571
00:51:49,096 --> 00:51:51,163
Fussier than you can imagine.

572
00:51:52,229 --> 00:51:53,696
Anyway, don't say anything.

573
00:51:57,496 --> 00:52:00,096
- Next Tuesday?
- Hurry, the food's getting cold, asshole.

574
00:52:02,396 --> 00:52:03,396
I'm leaving.

575
00:52:16,763 --> 00:52:18,196
It's so good.

576
00:52:18,696 --> 00:52:20,096
- It's strange. - It's pretty.

577
00:52:20,496 --> 00:52:21,763
This is cool.

578
00:52:22,263 --> 00:52:23,663
- It's Ugly. - It's Cool.

579
00:52:23,763 --> 00:52:25,529
- Not really - It suits me.

580
00:52:31,129 --> 00:52:32,429
How is it?

581
00:52:32,696 --> 00:52:34,696
Woooow~

582
00:53:40,696 --> 00:53:43,929
What? Is there something on my face?

583
00:53:46,229 --> 00:53:47,629
No.

584
00:53:51,796 --> 00:53:53,863
What should we do today?

585
00:53:55,929 --> 00:53:58,196
Are you hungry? Should we go eat?

586
00:53:58,929 --> 00:54:00,363
By the way...

587
00:54:01,929 --> 00:54:05,796
Do I look like all I do is eat?

588
00:54:07,896 --> 00:54:10,429
No, why?

589
00:54:10,663 --> 00:54:14,762
Every time we meet, you ask if I've eaten?

590
00:54:14,763 --> 00:54:18,663
All you ever ask about is food, food, and more food.

591
00:54:20,763 --> 00:54:22,329
Sorry.

592
00:54:23,029 --> 00:54:26,429
It's because my parents run a restaurant.

593
00:54:27,096 --> 00:54:29,829
So what should we do?

594
00:54:32,229 --> 00:54:35,496
Let's just hang out.

595
00:55:14,063 --> 00:55:14,896
It's nice, right?

596
00:55:14,897 --> 00:55:16,763
Yeah, it is.

597
00:55:17,963 --> 00:55:22,996
When I was little, my sister and I always played here.

598
00:55:23,496 --> 00:55:25,796
You used to live here?

599
00:55:27,196 --> 00:55:29,596
My parents still live here.

600
00:55:30,663 --> 00:55:34,429
Sometimes I come here to help my parents.

601
00:55:35,629 --> 00:55:38,928
Or when I have a lot on my mind.

602
00:55:38,929 --> 00:55:45,729
Looking at the river helps me calm down.

603
00:55:49,963 --> 00:55:53,496
HOW'S YOUR DATE GOING?
DON'T REPLY!

604
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:08,696
What's your dream?

605
00:56:09,296 --> 00:56:11,262
My dream?

606
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,662
For my sister to take part in the Olympics.

607
00:56:13,663 --> 00:56:17,063
Not your sister's dream, your dream.

608
00:56:17,396 --> 00:56:18,628
Yeah.

609
00:56:18,629 --> 00:56:22,196
Seeing my sister take part in the Olympics.

610
00:56:24,563 --> 00:56:28,429
What about after that?

611
00:56:29,096 --> 00:56:30,429
After that?

612
00:56:31,929 --> 00:56:33,029
My dream?

613
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:41,129
I don't know.

614
00:56:41,563 --> 00:56:46,796
I've never given it much thought

615
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:51,229
You should give it some thought.

616
00:56:51,763 --> 00:56:53,163
Yeah.

617
00:56:54,163 --> 00:56:56,162
What about you?

618
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:57,363
Me?

619
00:57:04,896 --> 00:57:09,329
Actually, I don't know either.

620
00:57:14,263 --> 00:57:18,929
When I was in school, I liked playing with my friends.

621
00:57:19,129 --> 00:57:24,295
I somehow graduated college.

622
00:57:24,296 --> 00:57:28,363
But I didn't know what I wanted to do.

623
00:57:28,763 --> 00:57:34,096
I kept sending out resumes,

624
00:57:35,363 --> 00:57:38,096
And I kept getting rejected.

625
00:57:47,463 --> 00:57:53,229
I'm not good at anything and I don't know what I want to do.

626
00:57:55,029 --> 00:57:56,929
Just like me.

627
00:57:59,396 --> 00:58:00,496
Yeah.

628
00:58:01,563 --> 00:58:03,428
In that case...

629
00:58:03,429 --> 00:58:06,963
Would you like to find out with me?

630
00:58:07,296 --> 00:58:08,363
What?

631
00:58:09,063 --> 00:58:10,629
You know...

632
00:58:11,229 --> 00:58:15,563
We haven't found it yet.

633
00:58:16,429 --> 00:58:21,763
If we look for it together.

634
00:58:21,996 --> 00:58:26,396
We might be able to find it.

635
00:58:26,529 --> 00:58:27,529
We got this!

636
00:58:38,663 --> 00:58:39,863
Yong Jun!

637
00:58:45,196 --> 00:58:48,462
For asking me to be friends,

638
00:58:48,463 --> 00:58:50,429
Thank You.

639
01:00:50,529 --> 01:00:52,129
Is anyone inside?

640
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:07,396
Earlier...

641
01:01:08,996 --> 01:01:13,596
You thanked me for being your friend.

642
01:01:27,529 --> 01:01:30,128
But...

643
01:01:30,129 --> 01:01:31,528
From...

644
01:01:31,529 --> 01:01:33,663
The first time I saw you...

645
01:01:37,963 --> 01:01:39,096
Sorry, just a second.

646
01:01:49,129 --> 01:01:54,129
PATIENT SEO GA EUL WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM 
AT AROUND 7 PM AFTER SUFFOCATING FROM A FIRE.

647
01:02:07,363 --> 01:02:08,363
I'm sorry.

648
01:02:35,596 --> 01:02:38,696
I just inhaled some smoke.

649
01:02:40,863 --> 01:02:43,396
Don't tell mom and dad, they'll worry.

650
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:49,329
I'm really okay

651
01:02:50,429 --> 01:02:52,163
How are you okay?

652
01:02:52,496 --> 01:02:54,528
If you're not okay, just say you're not okay.

653
01:02:54,529 --> 01:02:57,229
What is this, right before the competition...

654
01:03:00,163 --> 01:03:02,129
Sorry.

655
01:03:11,263 --> 01:03:13,263
No, I'm sorry.

656
01:03:17,163 --> 01:03:19,829
I should've been with you.

657
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,963
I'm really okay.

658
01:03:23,396 --> 01:03:25,163
They said I can be discharged soon.

659
01:03:26,529 --> 01:03:30,729
What if you can't make it to the tryouts 

660
01:03:32,263 --> 01:03:38,196
You struggled for 10 years in the cold water...

661
01:03:38,763 --> 01:03:40,963
It's not that bad.

662
01:03:41,429 --> 01:03:44,529
I feel warm and comfortable in the water now.

663
01:03:44,563 --> 01:03:46,029
So don't worry.

664
01:03:46,063 --> 01:03:50,629
I even set a new record today, so I can rest a bit.

665
01:04:25,463 --> 01:04:28,296
YONG JUN

666
01:05:11,063 --> 01:05:12,528
We'll leave first.

667
01:05:12,529 --> 01:05:13,729
Yeah, go ahead.

668
01:05:34,929 --> 01:05:36,895
THEY TOLD ME I CAN GO HOME.

669
01:05:36,896 --> 01:05:41,829
ALREADY? ALRIGHT, I'LL BE THERE SOON.

670
01:05:53,829 --> 01:05:59,896
IT'S OKAY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME, SIS. 
THE COACH IS COMING. I'LL GO STRAIGHT TO PRACTICE.

671
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:25,963
IF YOU HAPPEN TO FIND THIS SMARTPHONE, 
PLEASE BRING IT TO THE SANGWON-DONG MIJEONG DOSIRAK. 
THANK YOU IN ADVANCE.

672
01:07:05,929 --> 01:07:07,396
Are you okay?

673
01:07:10,663 --> 01:07:12,996
How about we eat something delicious before heading in?

674
01:07:17,796 --> 01:07:20,096
No, you go ahead. I have plans.

675
01:07:25,929 --> 01:07:27,929
Can I come too?

676
01:07:29,263 --> 01:07:31,029
Why?

677
01:07:31,529 --> 01:07:33,829
I have something to talk about with my friends.

678
01:09:39,063 --> 01:09:42,396
I'M GOING TO PRACTICE,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME.

679
01:10:19,296 --> 01:10:21,329
Are you okay?

680
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:26,929
What happened?

681
01:10:29,629 --> 01:10:33,929
I tried contacting you. Didn't you see my texts?

682
01:10:37,529 --> 01:10:38,829
No, I didn't.

683
01:10:40,496 --> 01:10:43,596
I'm sorry, but let's not meet each other anymore.

684
01:10:47,329 --> 01:10:49,629
Please don't contact me either.

685
01:11:05,029 --> 01:11:07,029
Why all of a sudden?

686
01:11:07,996 --> 01:11:09,763
What happened?

687
01:11:10,563 --> 01:11:12,029
It's nothing.

688
01:11:12,329 --> 01:11:14,329
Did I do something wrong?

689
01:11:14,696 --> 01:11:16,029
No, you didn't.

690
01:11:16,663 --> 01:11:18,795
Then, what's wrong?

691
01:11:18,796 --> 01:11:21,328
At least, give me a reason.

692
01:11:21,329 --> 01:11:23,163
You don't need to know!

693
01:11:29,729 --> 01:11:33,563
Do you know how worried I was?

694
01:11:34,063 --> 01:11:36,729
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

695
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:44,196
What about me then?

696
01:11:45,429 --> 01:11:48,096
Do I have to worry about you as well?

697
01:11:49,863 --> 01:11:53,129
My life is difficult as is.

698
01:11:57,163 --> 01:12:00,329
Please leave.

699
01:12:02,996 --> 01:12:04,663
Do...

700
01:12:07,696 --> 01:12:09,729
I make...

701
01:12:11,429 --> 01:12:12,629
Things difficult for you?

702
01:13:08,063 --> 01:13:10,363
He'll still deliver food, right?

703
01:13:15,363 --> 01:13:16,363
Me?

704
01:13:19,629 --> 01:13:20,563
Just go.

705
01:13:20,564 --> 01:13:21,796
Does that have to be delivered?

706
01:13:23,129 --> 01:13:24,129
- I'll do it. 
- Okay.

707
01:13:29,663 --> 01:13:30,729
He's fine.

708
01:14:56,663 --> 01:14:58,363
It's over.

709
01:14:58,729 --> 01:15:01,063
I can't make it to the tryouts.

710
01:15:03,563 --> 01:15:05,029
Sorry.

711
01:15:12,929 --> 01:15:15,363
I'm sorry, Ga Eul.

712
01:15:17,829 --> 01:15:19,429
It's my fault.

713
01:15:20,496 --> 01:15:23,229
Because of me, your dream...

714
01:15:23,496 --> 01:15:25,996
What about your dream?

715
01:15:29,429 --> 01:15:32,029
What's your dream, sis?

716
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:38,063
Do you only care about my dream?

717
01:15:40,396 --> 01:15:43,363
Your dream is my dream.

718
01:15:44,129 --> 01:15:46,663
How does that make sense?

719
01:15:47,296 --> 01:15:50,062
My dream is mine alone.

720
01:15:50,063 --> 01:15:53,896
Why would you sacrifice your dreams for the sake of mine?

721
01:15:54,196 --> 01:15:57,429
What do you mean? What's wrong?

722
01:15:58,163 --> 01:16:00,029
Do you not get it?

723
01:16:02,696 --> 01:16:04,928
Dropping me off and picking me up everyday.

724
01:16:04,929 --> 01:16:07,828
Working part time to pay for my training.

725
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:11,496
And you even come to the pool everyday.

726
01:16:15,296 --> 01:16:20,263
When will you live your life?

727
01:16:23,463 --> 01:16:26,263
This is all because of me.

728
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:33,163
Do you know how I feel seeing you like that?

729
01:16:37,929 --> 01:16:40,696
Like I'm dragging you down with me.

730
01:16:41,996 --> 01:16:43,563
I...

731
01:16:44,396 --> 01:16:47,629
My life... my dream!

732
01:16:50,529 --> 01:16:54,162
Even if I want to rest, I can't.

733
01:16:54,163 --> 01:17:00,063
Even if I want to give up, I can't.

734
01:17:00,996 --> 01:17:04,263
Disappointing you hurts more

735
01:17:07,963 --> 01:17:12,296
Than not making it to the tryouts.

736
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:17,396
It makes me feel guilty.

737
01:18:06,296 --> 01:18:07,296
You're here?

738
01:18:08,496 --> 01:18:11,863
What's up? Did something happen?

739
01:18:24,696 --> 01:18:26,396
The delivery, that day.

740
01:18:27,396 --> 01:18:32,696
Who was that at the house 
of that girl you like?

741
01:18:34,196 --> 01:18:36,896
Did you see her?

742
01:18:37,829 --> 01:18:40,196
No, I just left it there and came back.

743
01:18:41,263 --> 01:18:43,396
But, who was it?

744
01:18:43,763 --> 01:18:45,096
Her younger sister.

745
01:18:46,329 --> 01:18:47,729
Younger sister.

746
01:18:48,429 --> 01:18:50,829
Ahh, it was her younger sister.

747
01:18:52,963 --> 01:18:54,263
You must've worked hard.

748
01:18:57,463 --> 01:18:58,896
Hard work?

749
01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:04,163
It doesn't matter anymore. 
It's all over.

750
01:19:05,563 --> 01:19:06,563
What do you mean?

751
01:19:07,329 --> 01:19:08,329
I was dumped.

752
01:19:11,096 --> 01:19:12,329
That's not good.

753
01:19:13,229 --> 01:19:14,596
It's over.

754
01:19:17,796 --> 01:19:21,796
It's not over until it's over.

755
01:19:21,896 --> 01:19:24,228
What are you on about? It's over.

756
01:19:24,229 --> 01:19:27,163
Then, call her.

757
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:31,729
Call her, say you're sorry and beg.

758
01:19:32,096 --> 01:19:33,529
Just say it's your fault.

759
01:19:33,796 --> 01:19:35,195
I can't

760
01:19:35,196 --> 01:19:38,229
Why can't you? Just call her.

761
01:19:38,629 --> 01:19:40,229
Just this once.

762
01:19:41,796 --> 01:19:43,629
Just this once.

763
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:45,496
She's deaf.

764
01:19:48,263 --> 01:19:55,429
She also told me not to go see her 
or contact her.

765
01:19:59,963 --> 01:20:01,029
Oh, I see.

766
01:20:06,063 --> 01:20:07,729
I didn't even know that.

767
01:20:11,629 --> 01:20:13,496
You must be having a hard time.

768
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:21,910
Is her younger sister also...

769
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:26,696
Deaf?

770
01:20:28,529 --> 01:20:29,529
Yeah.

771
01:20:50,329 --> 01:20:52,163
What's going on?

772
01:20:53,063 --> 01:20:55,062
Nothing.

773
01:20:55,063 --> 01:20:58,195
Ga Eul trains well and eats well.

774
01:20:58,196 --> 01:21:00,896
I was asking about you.

775
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:10,829
Mom, dad...

776
01:21:12,096 --> 01:21:14,496
Why did you give birth to me?

777
01:21:14,929 --> 01:21:17,396
Because you are our daughter.

778
01:21:17,763 --> 01:21:19,163
Exactly.

779
01:21:21,363 --> 01:21:23,296
When you had me

780
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:27,696
Weren't you afraid I'd be deaf?

781
01:21:28,063 --> 01:21:30,528
Why would we be afraid of that?

782
01:21:30,529 --> 01:21:33,563
Because life becomes even harder.

783
01:21:33,929 --> 01:21:35,995
Not at all.

784
01:21:35,996 --> 01:21:37,562
Were you afraid?

785
01:21:37,563 --> 01:21:39,829
Of course not.

786
01:21:59,663 --> 01:22:02,963
My son, were you dumped?

787
01:22:07,763 --> 01:22:08,929
It seemed like it.

788
01:22:09,929 --> 01:22:11,196
Was it obvious, mom?

789
01:22:12,763 --> 01:22:16,496
Who is she to make my son sad?

790
01:22:20,529 --> 01:22:21,529
She...

791
01:22:30,363 --> 01:22:32,429
Loves her sister a lot.

792
01:22:33,829 --> 01:22:35,663
Works very hard.

793
01:22:36,963 --> 01:22:41,629
She lives her life very earnestly.

794
01:22:44,163 --> 01:22:46,163
To the point she doesn't 
even have time to eat.

795
01:22:50,463 --> 01:22:57,763
She has never once thought 
about what she wants to do.

796
01:22:58,396 --> 01:22:59,396
Why?

797
01:23:02,329 --> 01:23:03,429
Because she's too nice.

798
01:23:06,429 --> 01:23:12,129
She always takes care of
others instead of herself.

799
01:23:14,763 --> 01:23:18,763
Maybe that's why she did that to me.

800
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:22,923
Because I might find things difficult.

801
01:23:24,029 --> 01:23:25,229
Why would it be difficult?

802
01:23:26,996 --> 01:23:27,996
Can't hear.

803
01:23:30,663 --> 01:23:34,729
She can't hear or talk.

804
01:23:36,729 --> 01:23:38,096
Mom,

805
01:23:40,163 --> 01:23:45,229
Do you not like me helping you?

806
01:23:46,196 --> 01:23:47,863
Yeah.

807
01:23:48,396 --> 01:23:49,962
Why?

808
01:23:49,963 --> 01:23:51,863
Wouldn't it be better if I helped?

809
01:23:52,063 --> 01:23:54,095
Yeah, but...

810
01:23:54,096 --> 01:23:59,629
Helping others at your expense burdens them.

811
01:24:00,996 --> 01:24:06,296
But, wouldn't it be easier if I help?

812
01:24:06,663 --> 01:24:08,763
Do you know what that's called?

813
01:24:10,063 --> 01:24:11,763
A good daughter.

814
01:24:12,396 --> 01:24:13,763
No.

815
01:24:14,229 --> 01:24:15,329
Then?

816
01:24:17,163 --> 01:24:21,429
Pity

817
01:24:26,663 --> 01:24:28,663
Why do you say that, mom?

818
01:24:29,063 --> 01:24:33,863
We're family, so it's natural for me to help.

819
01:24:34,629 --> 01:24:36,228
I know, but

820
01:24:36,229 --> 01:24:41,363
You can't live another person's life for them.

821
01:24:42,163 --> 01:24:47,663
Family means believing and supporting each other.

822
01:24:48,763 --> 01:24:49,962
I only

823
01:24:49,963 --> 01:24:54,596
Want you to help us if we reach out.

824
01:24:56,763 --> 01:24:58,263
Sorry.

825
01:24:59,596 --> 01:25:02,263
Mom, I...

826
01:25:03,063 --> 01:25:04,163
It's okay.

827
01:25:06,729 --> 01:25:13,063
I wish you'd live as Yeo Reum from now on.

828
01:25:14,629 --> 01:25:19,096
Not as our daughter or as Ga Eul's sister,

829
01:25:19,429 --> 01:25:21,863
But as Yeo Reum.

830
01:25:45,029 --> 01:25:47,429
- Sorry. - Sorry.

831
01:26:01,563 --> 01:26:03,728
The summer birds aren't here yet.

832
01:26:03,729 --> 01:26:04,995
Yeah.

833
01:26:04,996 --> 01:26:07,796
I can't see a single one.

834
01:26:10,396 --> 01:26:13,096
I wanted to see them, since it's been such a long time.

835
01:26:27,996 --> 01:26:31,029
Sis, why haven't you met with Yong Jun?

836
01:26:32,929 --> 01:26:35,363
I’m not thinking about dating anyone.

837
01:26:36,163 --> 01:26:37,463
Why?

838
01:26:38,129 --> 01:26:40,096
Because of the disability?

839
01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:44,163
Because of me?

840
01:26:46,463 --> 01:26:49,529
I don't want to be a burden to you, sis.

841
01:26:49,563 --> 01:26:52,796
You're not a burden to me. Really.

842
01:26:54,529 --> 01:26:57,795
I just

843
01:26:57,796 --> 01:26:59,595
Like seeing

844
01:26:59,596 --> 01:27:01,463
You smile like this.

845
01:27:03,196 --> 01:27:07,029
That's how you smile when you're in the water.

846
01:27:07,329 --> 01:27:10,629
Then, can't you just trust me?

847
01:27:12,529 --> 01:27:15,863
I'll start over and I'll do well on my own.

848
01:27:17,329 --> 01:27:19,029
Yeah, I believe you.

849
01:27:19,563 --> 01:27:21,628
Then, go meet Yong Jun.

850
01:27:21,629 --> 01:27:25,063
I'm the reason you dumped him.

851
01:27:27,329 --> 01:27:30,829
I won't give up on swimming.

852
01:27:31,763 --> 01:27:34,129
You shouldn't give up on him either.

853
01:27:43,096 --> 01:27:44,896
What did Yong Jun say?

854
01:27:45,096 --> 01:27:46,229
Did he get dumped?

855
01:27:49,129 --> 01:27:51,096
What's wrong with our son?

856
01:27:51,429 --> 01:27:52,896
Should I...

857
01:27:53,896 --> 01:27:55,196
Can't hear.

858
01:27:55,763 --> 01:27:56,763
Can't hear?

859
01:27:56,796 --> 01:27:57,862
You mean the ears?

860
01:27:57,863 --> 01:28:00,528
Would I've meant the nose?

861
01:28:00,529 --> 01:28:01,529
The nose.

862
01:28:04,263 --> 01:28:06,129
She's deaf.

863
01:28:06,829 --> 01:28:09,196
So she can't hear or talk.

864
01:28:12,396 --> 01:28:13,696
That's why she dumped him.

865
01:28:14,063 --> 01:28:15,696
Becasue she didn't want to trouble Yong Jun.

866
01:28:18,229 --> 01:28:21,563
Then, should I try talking to her?

867
01:28:23,129 --> 01:28:26,029
Are you okay with it?

868
01:28:26,496 --> 01:28:27,496
With what?

869
01:28:29,963 --> 01:28:31,396
She's deaf.

870
01:28:32,029 --> 01:28:33,196
So what?

871
01:28:34,163 --> 01:28:35,695
As long as she's a good person.

872
01:28:35,696 --> 01:28:37,995
There are many people out there who can 
talk fine but are just frustrating.

873
01:28:37,996 --> 01:28:40,063
There are many people out there who can 
talk fine but are just frustrating.

874
01:28:48,663 --> 01:28:49,796
Right.

875
01:28:50,196 --> 01:28:53,529
This is why I like you.

876
01:28:54,896 --> 01:28:55,996
Like what?

877
01:28:56,529 --> 01:28:57,763
This is what upsets me.

878
01:28:58,096 --> 01:28:59,863
Why are you upset now?

879
01:33:27,729 --> 01:33:29,229
I'm sorry, Yeo Reum.

880
01:33:33,429 --> 01:33:35,429
I'm also sorry for saying I'm sorry.

881
01:33:38,163 --> 01:33:41,829
I'm apologizing to you because

882
01:33:42,796 --> 01:33:45,829
I Don't think I fully understood you.

883
01:33:48,229 --> 01:33:53,296
I thought I understood,

884
01:33:55,829 --> 01:33:57,229
but apparently, I didn’t.

885
01:33:59,229 --> 01:34:00,429
So...

886
01:34:02,529 --> 01:34:03,629
I'm sorry.

887
01:34:04,829 --> 01:34:06,229
And I...

888
01:34:06,929 --> 01:34:10,296
I didn't know I was making 
things difficult for you.

889
01:34:11,829 --> 01:34:13,329
I'm sorry about that too.

890
01:34:19,063 --> 01:34:20,229
Well...

891
01:34:22,896 --> 01:34:28,363
We fell apart a bit.

892
01:34:30,496 --> 01:34:31,129
No,

893
01:34:31,130 --> 01:34:32,629
I was dumped.

894
01:34:38,163 --> 01:34:39,163
But...

895
01:34:41,263 --> 01:34:44,029
I don't like it.

896
01:34:45,029 --> 01:34:47,129
I really don't like it.

897
01:34:49,129 --> 01:34:51,363
Because you don't take care of yourself,

898
01:34:51,529 --> 01:34:54,063
I want to take care of you.

899
01:34:59,663 --> 01:35:00,663
Well...

900
01:35:02,596 --> 01:35:05,329
I like seeing you smile.

901
01:35:05,396 --> 01:35:08,263
And I want to make you smile.

902
01:35:11,663 --> 01:35:12,663
Yeah.

903
01:35:18,229 --> 01:35:21,763
What I'm trying to say is...

904
01:35:23,429 --> 01:35:25,829
I...

905
01:36:45,063 --> 01:36:46,896
Do you

906
01:36:47,196 --> 01:36:49,328
want to work part time

907
01:36:49,329 --> 01:36:55,229
at my parents' restaurant?

908
01:36:56,896 --> 01:36:58,763
Why?

909
01:36:59,296 --> 01:37:03,829
I think it'd be nice if we worked together.

910
01:37:05,529 --> 01:37:08,096
I'm deaf,

911
01:37:10,329 --> 01:37:12,963
Are your parents okay with that?

912
01:37:14,896 --> 01:37:17,896
They'll understand

913
01:37:19,129 --> 01:37:25,429
How good of a person you are

914
01:37:26,563 --> 01:37:30,663
And how hard you work.

915
01:37:45,229 --> 01:37:46,663
Deal?

916
01:37:46,996 --> 01:37:48,329
Deal.

917
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:22,496
Come in.

918
01:38:25,329 --> 01:38:27,163
Have a seat.

919
01:38:29,029 --> 01:38:32,363
She's really pretty.

920
01:38:37,329 --> 01:38:40,496
Mom, dad, she's Seo Yeo Reum.

921
01:38:41,329 --> 01:38:43,429
This is her face name.

922
01:38:44,629 --> 01:38:46,329
Becasue she smiles a lot.

923
01:38:49,796 --> 01:38:51,229
Oh, I forgot.

924
01:38:53,963 --> 01:38:55,496
Look here.

925
01:38:55,829 --> 01:38:58,096
I'm Yong Jun's dad.

926
01:38:58,929 --> 01:39:01,496
I'm Yong Jun's mom.

927
01:39:02,829 --> 01:39:05,596
Nice to meet you.

928
01:39:07,563 --> 01:39:10,796
Our Yong Jun can be a bit childish

929
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,067
And foolish at times.

930
01:39:13,196 --> 01:39:14,196
Mom.

931
01:39:14,197 --> 01:39:18,130
Sometimes, he can be tactless and annoying,

932
01:39:19,463 --> 01:39:22,363
but when he's next to you, he's reliable.

933
01:39:23,796 --> 01:39:26,196
Our Yong Jun, as a kid, ate a lot

934
01:39:26,396 --> 01:39:28,396
and pooped a lot as well.

935
01:39:28,663 --> 01:39:29,696
Dad.

936
01:39:32,963 --> 01:39:38,096
What do you think of getting back together?

937
01:39:41,196 --> 01:39:43,462
Mom, why would you ask something like that?

938
01:39:43,463 --> 01:39:45,562
She's here for the job interview.

939
01:39:45,563 --> 01:39:49,229
You can just date while working 
or work while dating.

940
01:39:50,296 --> 01:39:51,396
Yeah, I like that!

941
01:40:03,129 --> 01:40:06,163
I said "I like that".

942
01:40:08,763 --> 01:40:10,496
She can talk.

943
01:40:11,229 --> 01:40:12,363
She talks.

944
01:40:15,396 --> 01:40:18,429
I thought you couldn't hear.

945
01:40:19,229 --> 01:40:20,229
No.

946
01:40:21,396 --> 01:40:23,463
I thought you couldn't hear.

947
01:40:32,229 --> 01:40:37,663
Then, what I said yesterday...

948
01:40:40,596 --> 01:40:41,796
So you heard everything.

949
01:40:46,396 --> 01:40:50,829
Then, when you said "I like that" just now...

950
01:40:52,829 --> 01:40:53,929
Me...

951
01:40:55,596 --> 01:40:56,696
Or...

952
01:40:57,691 --> 01:40:58,890
The job?

953
01:41:08,329 --> 01:41:09,529
I

954
01:41:12,329 --> 01:41:14,696
like you.

955
01:41:15,563 --> 01:41:16,929
What did she say?

956
01:41:25,229 --> 01:41:27,696
What did she say?

957
01:41:27,829 --> 01:41:29,329
You're so tactless.

958
01:41:30,563 --> 01:41:31,996
She did this.

959
01:41:46,729 --> 01:41:48,829
When I was in college, 
I got tricked by my senior.

960
01:41:52,529 --> 01:41:56,896
He said sign language is a 
form of body language.

961
01:41:57,163 --> 01:42:00,063
You can use it to communicate 
anywhere in the world.

962
01:42:00,229 --> 01:42:03,796
So if you want to travel abroad, 
make sure you learn sign language.

963
01:42:05,896 --> 01:42:08,095
- That's why... 
- That's why?

964
01:42:08,096 --> 01:42:09,629
That's why I learned sign language.

965
01:42:10,029 --> 01:42:11,229
Becasue you believed him?

966
01:42:23,563 --> 01:42:25,096
Then...

967
01:42:26,863 --> 01:42:30,129
In your family...

968
01:42:31,829 --> 01:42:33,663
Are you the only one who can hear?

969
01:42:35,229 --> 01:42:36,263
Yeah.

970
01:42:40,796 --> 01:42:45,529
At first, I thought everyone was like that.

971
01:42:48,063 --> 01:42:49,429
But they weren't.

972
01:42:50,763 --> 01:42:54,496
Only our family lived in a different world.

973
01:42:54,629 --> 01:42:58,463
Don't live like you're deaf just because of us.

974
01:42:59,096 --> 01:43:07,890
You're different from us, but you're not in a different world.

975
01:43:08,329 --> 01:43:10,562
As a family, we live in the same world.

976
01:43:10,563 --> 01:43:12,229
Got it?

977
01:43:19,529 --> 01:43:23,595
Having you and Ga Eul

978
01:43:23,596 --> 01:43:27,463
Was the best thing that happened in our lives.

979
01:43:34,696 --> 01:43:35,929
For me too,

980
01:43:37,063 --> 01:43:39,296
Being born as your daughter

981
01:43:41,429 --> 01:43:43,963
Was the best thing that happened in my life.

982
01:43:49,163 --> 01:43:50,429
For Me too,

983
01:43:52,829 --> 01:43:54,458
Meeting you

984
01:43:54,859 --> 01:43:56,663
Was the best thing

985
01:43:58,829 --> 01:44:00,729
That happened in my life.

986
01:45:16,163 --> 01:45:18,063
Are you okay?

987
01:45:19,729 --> 01:45:21,063
Hold tight.

988
01:45:45,929 --> 01:45:47,329
I like you.

989
01:46:03,315 --> 01:46:33,220
