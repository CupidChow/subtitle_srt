"Lover Merman"
(Episode 2)

25
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,080
(Previously)

26
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,490
My name's Phurit.

27
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,140
I'm Nawa.

28
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,880
This here is Phurit,
my close friend from Bangkok.

29
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,400
From now on,
Phurit will be working here with us.

30
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,240
Phu's a player,

31
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,910
he throws his charm around everywhere.
If you can avoid him, then avoid him.

32
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,260
I don't want my little brother to get hurt.

33
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,130
As for Phu,

34
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,880
if he ever found out the truth one day,
he wouldn't be able to handle it.

35
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,340
Do you need something?

36
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,900
Well, I'm supposed
to start my internship here tomorrow,

37
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,960
Also, there'll be a trainee starting tomorrow.

38
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,360
Go ahead. I don't like training interns.

39
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,690
I suggest you don't touch it.

40
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,770
What kind of fish scale is this?

41
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,210
If I told you it's a merman's scale,

42
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,710
would you believe me?

43
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,120
There's no way I can believe it.

44
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,080
On the night before the full moon,

45
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,300
every mermaid shows an

46
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,410
eight-pointed star mark on their body.

47
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,800
If anyone can bring me
a mermaid to see in person,

48
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,170
then I'll believe it.

49
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,620
Right, Maiaek.

50
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:01,730
Yes?

51
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,880
Can you close up the bar for me?

52
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,810
I'm going out to hang out
with some customers somewhere else.

53
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:05,990
Thanks a lot.

54
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,230
- Sure, no problem.
- Please clean the glass for me.

55
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,080
Alright.

56
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,360
Hey Nawa, heading back already?

57
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,870
I can drive you.

58
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,750
Can I sit and relax here a little longer?

59
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,150
Mm, alright. I'll wait on the shore.

60
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,340
Okay.

61
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,040
- See you later.
- Okay.

62
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:26,900
Let's go first.

63
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,490
A merman!

64
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,010
Mr. Phurit!

65
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,250
I shouldn't have drank that much.

66
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,750
Wow...

67
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,720
How did I even get back here?

68
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,970
I really shouldn't have drunk that much.

69
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,020
This hangover's killing me.

70
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,890
And I'm in such a hurry.

71
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,340
Hey!

72
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,970
It's just been a rough morning.

73
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,650
Should I call the insurance for you?

74
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't think that should be
the first thing you say to me.

75
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,720
Look, I really am in a rush.

76
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,130
I don't want any trouble with you.

77
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,900
I don't care where you're rushing to.

78
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,700
And I don't want any trouble
with someone like you either.

79
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,600
Someone like me?
What's that supposed to mean?

80
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,800
Someone who makes a mistake
and doesn't even bother to apologize.

81
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,240
What kind of person do you think that is?

82
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,540
Is that so?

83
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,430
Well, one thing's for sure,

84
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,770
I'm not the kind of person
who throws shade first, unlike you.

85
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,350
Anyway, about the car just now,
I'm sorry.

86
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,040
I was driving carelessly.

87
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,720
My car just got a little scratch.
Forget it.

88
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,680
Oh, and another thing,

89
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,040
even if you called the insurance,

90
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,710
there's no way any agent would
drag themselves out here to see you.

91
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,050
Don't forget, this is an island,
not Bangkok.

92
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,660
People here don't live the kind of life you do.

93
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,000
Excuse me.

94
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,500
Are you Nawa?

95
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,780
Yeah. And you are?

96
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,180
My younger brother. His name's Ping.

97
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,340
Phana asked us to look after him.

98
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,510
He's here to work behind the bar.

99
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:17,760
Sure.

100
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,720
If you need any help, just let me know.

101
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,180
Yes, thank you.

102
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,880
Man, my little brother's so lucky,
getting the bar's number one bartender

103
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,620
to look after him.

104
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,980
Oh, Ping,

105
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,860
grab the bottles from the crate
and put them up on the bar for me.

106
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,430
Be right back, I'll go to the kitchen.

107
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,610
Got it.

108
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,670
Ping, are you a local here too?

109
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,770
Yes, but I went to study on the mainland.

110
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,170
I only come back once in a while.

111
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,380
Why? Do I not look like a local to you?

112
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,010
I'm sure we've never met,

113
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,030
but for some reason you feel familiar to me.

114
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,860
Hard to explain.
Right, I feel the same.

115
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,710
For the mixers that aren't soda,
put them in here.

116
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,610
Makes it easier to grab when serving customers.

117
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,180
And also, tell Timmy to bring
more whiskey up to the front bar.

118
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,650
Got it.

119
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,130
Nawa.

120
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,560
Yes?

121
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,220
Has Phana come in yet?

122
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,250
He should be here by now.

123
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,740
Are you hungover, Mr. Phurit?

124
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,010
Are you worried about me?

125
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,170
Anyone seeing you like this would think
the same thing I just said.

126
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,170
Then what do I have to do to
make you really worry about me?

127
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,620
And why should I worry about you?

128
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,790
Because I like you.

129
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,050
This is Ping.

130
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,090
Phana brought him in as a trainee.

131
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,680
This is Mr. Phurit, he's...

132
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,700
Are you Nawa's boyfriend?

133
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
- No.
- Yes.

134
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,490
Not yet. But soon.

135
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,580
He's Mr. Phurit,

136
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,220
Phana's friend
and also a co-owner of the bar.

137
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,070
Sorry about that, Mr. Phurit.

138
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,380
Starting your shift early, huh.

139
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,900
Don't start hitting me, man.
My head's already killing me.

140
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,130
Last night, the customers
drank way too hard with me.

141
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,200
Have a regular drink of the staffs here.

142
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:02,590
Nawa,

143
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,610
can you get a hot honey-lemon drink for Phurit?

144
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,340
Yes.

145
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,020
Phana,

146
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,070
last night, I think

147
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,210
I saw something

148
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,470
that looked like a merman.

149
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,600
Sorry, sir.

150
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,020
What are you babbling about?

151
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,760
Mermen? There's no such thing.

152
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,540
I didn't think so either.

153
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,840
But I swear
my eyes weren't playing tricks on me.

154
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,000
Where did you supposedly see this?

155
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,810
Last night,

156
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,330
after I separated with the customers,

157
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,130
I sat by the beach to sober up.

158
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,560
I couldn't see clearly,

159
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,380
but I'm sure of it, it was a merman.

160
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,290
A merman!

161
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,520
But the more I think about it,
the more it looked like…

162
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,120
Looked like what?

163
00:13:59,190 --> 00:13:59,940
Like…

164
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,650
Oh, Mr. Phurit,

165
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,330
you're sober now?

166
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,960
Please don't fall asleep drunk like that again,

167
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,160
you'll get sick.

168
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,960
What do you mean by that, Lek?

169
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,090
Last night,

170
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,880
I happened to go meet a friend at the beach.

171
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,920
That's when I ran into Mr. Phurit,
he'd passed out drunk there.

172
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,300
Damn, Phu.

173
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,500
So you were just drunk
and dreaming you saw a merman.

174
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,670
Let me tell you something,

175
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,550
this isn't Bangkok

176
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,120
where you can get wasted
and then just hop into a cab home.

177
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,520
People on this island might not be dangerous,

178
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,250
but that doesn't mean
it's safe for a newcomer like you.

179
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,550
Right. Sorry.

180
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,250
I'll take better care of myself from now on.

181
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,360
Good.

182
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,770
And thanks for last night, Lek.

183
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:58,960
No problem.

184
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,680
That thing Phu said was it you, Nawa?

185
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,040
Uh… Phana, you knew?

186
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,870
The signs were obvious.

187
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,260
Yesterday I swam pretty far out
from the hidden beach.

188
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,970
I didn't think anyone would see.

189
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:38,950
It's fine.

190
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,300
But I don't want you being careless either.

191
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,210
These days, there aren't many people on the island
who know about mermen.

192
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,850
And the fewer that know, the better,

193
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,090
for your safety.

194
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,850
I'll be more careful from now on.

195
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,170
By the way,
you're going to see Den today, right?

196
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,120
I'm heading out anyway,

197
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,500
want me to give you a ride?

198
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,130
No, it's okay.

199
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,970
I'll just take my motorbike.

200
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,240
That way I can hurry back
and get things ready at the bar.

201
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,590
Alright then, I'll go ahead.

202
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,920
- Alright.
- Take good care of yourself.

203
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,170
I was just about to head into town for a bit.

204
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,440
Mind if I tag along?

205
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,700
I'm only going to the barbershop.
Nothing special.

206
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,470
That's fine.
I'll come to the barbershop with you.

207
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,010
Wouldn't it be easier if you
just drove your own car?

208
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,910
You're not very gentle, you know that?

209
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,170
Let me ask you straight.

210
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,190
All of your actions…
Are you hitting on me?

211
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,860
That's right. I'm hitting on you.

212
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,310
I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong idea that day.

213
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,560
Honestly, I thought you were just a customer.

214
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,780
I only went along with it
the way a bartender usually does.

215
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,720
I never intended to make you think otherwise.

216
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,940
So what? I really like you.

217
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,940
And what exactly makes you like me?

218
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,050
Mmm... I don't know.

219
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,540
I just feel like if I let you slip away,

220
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,400
it would be the biggest regret of my life.

221
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,030
Then I'm too tired to keep talking to you.

222
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,000
What's wrong, Grandpa?

223
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,840
Don't tell me you're out of gas again.

224
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:39,840
Want me to give you a ride?

225
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,260
I mean, you're in a hurry, right?

226
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,380
You said you've got to get back to the bar.

227
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,380
Now that I'm managing the bar...

228
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,690
I'm strict, you know.
If you show up late...

229
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,310
Fine.

230
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,270
But let go of my arm.

231
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,560
Alright.

232
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:19,930
Lead the way.

233
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,030
Uh… Sorry,
I didn't mean to be rude.

234
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,200
I didn't even say anything to you yet.

235
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:22,980
Ah, right.

236
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,800
So, how was it? Your first day at work.

237
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,500
It was good.

238
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,650
Today Timmy and Nawa
taught me step by step.

239
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,930
Right now I'm just trying to
get used to the things around here.

240
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,060
That's good.

241
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,870
Just take it slow and learn.
If you're confused, just ask.

242
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,850
Yes, thank you.

243
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,730
Oh, perfect timing Timmy,
a Manhattan as usual,

244
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,730
then put it over there for me.

245
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,010
Got it.

246
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,730
Does Mr. Phana
usually drink at this hour?

247
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,370
Pfft, usually?

248
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,830
If he's drinking at this time,
it means he argued with Namhom.

249
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,260
Ms. Namhom?

250
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,700
Yeah, his girlfriend.
They fight all the time,

251
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,390
but he really loves her, man.
I see them argue every time,

252
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,720
like twice a week,
but they've never once broken up.

253
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,200
(Ferry Kohkhen)

254
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,240
(Boat ticket sales)

255
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,320
(Speedboat port)

256
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,880
This is your regular barbershop?

257
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,300
There aren't that many shops on the island.

258
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,520
Thanks for giving me a ride.

259
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,700
If you're done with your errands,
just call me anytime.

260
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,860
I'll go walk around the town and wait.

261
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,070
But I don't have your number.

262
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,660
Are you asking for my number right now?

263
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,890
Either way, I have to have yours,
and you need mine too.

264
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,720
Don't forget to save it.
Call me anytime,

265
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,410
don't be shy.

266
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,030
I won't bother you.

267
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,050
If you finish your business,
you can just head back first.

268
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,310
You don't have to wait for me.

269
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,660
How's this?
I trimmed the sides a little higher this time.

270
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,170
Looks good.

271
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,850
Do you like it like this?

272
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,950
Whoa, Den, I really like it.

273
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,530
- Took quite a bit off, huh?
- Um.

274
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,710
Oh hey, Nawa.
Hello, Den.

275
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,570
Hello.
Oh, Phraphai.

276
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,090
Didn't expect to run into you here.

277
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,160
You came for a haircut too?

278
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,780
Oh no,

279
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,750
I came to drop off some wine
that Den ordered from the mainland.

280
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,280
Here you go.

281
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,300
Thanks.

282
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,460
I actually ordered it for you too,

283
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,480
but forgot to bring it.
Didn't think you'd show up here.

284
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,160
I'll just swing by the shop later to pick it up.

285
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,630
Sure.

286
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,240
Whoa, new haircut.

287
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,840
You look way more handsome now.

288
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:15,200
Isn't that a bit much, Nawa?

289
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,990
A bit much?

290
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,540
What, no compliments for your barber?

291
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,550
I cut it for him
with my best effort, you know.

292
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,600
Oh, well that goes without saying, Den.

293
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,140
Right, have you two heard the rumors about

294
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,100
humans hunting mermen on our island?

295
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,630
Where did you hear that from, Den?

296
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,800
Last time I went to release the poison,

297
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:51,020
I overheard some mermen talking.
They said some mermen were missing.

298
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,390
Two or three of them

299
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,370
went missing last week.

300
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,320
Didn't you guys hear anything about this?

301
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,120
I'll need to check with my father
about this first.

302
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,870
Ha, as expected of the headman's son,

303
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,330
never lets anything slip by.

304
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,320
That's Phraphai for you,

305
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,970
he worries about every single mermen
on this island.

306
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,830
Not every mermaid, I'd say.

307
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,460
My father said he heard about it too,

308
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,360
and there's a high chance it's true.

309
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,430
But there's no evidence yet that humans

310
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,660
are specifically targeting mermen.

311
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,000
So, how seriously should I take this,

312
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,420
tell me, Phraphai.

313
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,010
Phraphai.

314
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,690
Does this mean we have
to go back to hiding like before?

315
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:08,690
Nawa.

316
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,360
No need.
My father's handling it.

317
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,480
And besides,

318
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,940
I won't let anyone hurt our people.

319
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,290
Den.

320
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,170
Here's the payment for my haircut.

321
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,940
Thanks.

322
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,200
I'll go grab your change.

323
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,350
Right. Nawa.

324
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,170
Do you need to head anywhere else?

325
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,170
I'll just go back to the shop.

326
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,230
How'd you get here?
Want me to give you a ride?

327
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,910
I need to stop by the shop
to pick up the wine anyway.

328
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,160
Oh, sure.

329
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,800
Let's go.

330
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,830
(I parked my car in front of the barbershop.
If Mr. Nawa done...)

331
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,280
Oh, Nawa!
Do you want to stop anywhere on the way?

332
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,650
I better just head back to the shop.

333
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,260
Okay.

334
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,640
Let's go.

335
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,740
Someone who makes a mistake
and doesn't even bother to apologize.

336
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,210
What kind of person do you think that is?

337
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,500
You two know each other?

338
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:59,790
(Full & a Half Kohkhen)

339
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,980
I'll go inside and get the wine.

340
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,710
Alright, I'll wait in the car then.

341
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,040
What a coincidence.
I didn't expect to see you again.

342
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,960
Same here.

343
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,520
Are you here for dinner?

344
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:43,960
No,

345
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,160
a close friend of mine works here.

346
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,670
By close friend… you mean Nawa?

347
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,190
You know Nawa too?

348
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,230
Of course. I own this place.

349
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:55,850
Really?

350
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,580
I thought Phana was the sole owner.

351
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,170
Then you'll need to update your understanding.

352
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,340
By the way, what exactly
are your relationship with Nawa?

353
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:11,490
Why do you ask?

354
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,560
Because this time,

355
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,050
it's not just a near miss.

356
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,210
I think I'm about to collide with you for real.

357
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,940
Phraphai!

358
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,090
Nawa.
Ah, Nawa.

359
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,920
We were just talking about you.

360
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,450
You two know each other?

361
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,900
Not exactly.

362
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,560
We just happened to run into each other.

363
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,200
This is Phurit,

364
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,360
Phana's friend
and also co-owner of this part of the shop.

365
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,460
And this is Phraphai,

366
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:46,530
my senior,

367
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,080
he owns the fishing fleet
across the whole island.

368
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:51,330
Oh…
You're the influential one around here.

369
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,210
Pleasure to meet you.

370
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,540
Nawa, you're exaggerating.
You'll just make Mr. Phurit thinks I'm smug.

371
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,590
I won't, Phraphai.

372
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,320
Because on this island,

373
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,170
the only one I care about is Nawa.

374
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:15,300
Well, if you know there's a collision coming,
I'd advise you to step back now.

375
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,200
Because no insurance will cover you.

376
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,850
What's this?
Getting to know each other?

377
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,460
Hello, Phana.

378
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,570
Hey, headman. Been busy lately?

379
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,860
Haven't seen you drop by.

380
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,090
I only just came ashore a few days ago.

381
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,070
Are you heading back now, Phraphai?

382
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:51,070
Actually, I've changed my mind.
I'll stay and have some wine here.

383
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,880
Oh, perfect.

384
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,310
I was just about to discuss
the new shipment with you.

385
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,150
It's my pleasure.

386
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,400
I'll be waiting inside then.

387
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,070
Let's go.

388
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:04,940
See you in a bit.

389
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,260
What the hell are you thinking?

390
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,500
Tell me.

391
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,980
Do you remember?

392
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,510
I told you this morning I had a problem
when I went into the shop.

393
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,180
This is the guy I'm having trouble with.

394
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,800
Hey, Phu, what problem?

395
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,770
What the hell did you get yourself into?

396
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:27,700
Hey!

397
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,440
Ping, grab me a refill, will you?

398
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,170
Maiaek.

399
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,220
Yes?
Can I ask you something?

400
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,050
Who's that guy sitting next to Phana?

401
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,610
Oh… That's Phraphai.

402
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,240
He's the son of the island's headman,

403
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,310
basically owns the entire fishing fleet here.

404
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,980
Super famous around here.

405
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:04,910
He's got good personality,
good looks, rich too,

406
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,200
and he's been close with
Phana since they were kids.

407
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,830
But, well, Khen island
is a small island after all.

408
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,450
So he's Nawa's friend?

409
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,890
To Nawa,

410
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,780
Phraphai's like a real older brother.

411
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,450
Older brother.
Yeah.

412
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,280
But it's not the same as Phana.

413
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,760
How do I put this…

414
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,690
Honestly,

415
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,540
they look more like a couple than siblings.

416
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,450
People even say Phraphai has feelings for Nawa.

417
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,190
Oh.

418
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:40,960
Thank you.

419
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,160
So Phraphai likes Nawa.

420
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,060
- Yeah.
- And what about Nawa? Does he like Phraphai back?

421
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,810
That's the big question.

422
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,650
It's a pity nobody knows
what Nawa really thinks.

423
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,220
I wish I knew, too.

424
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,090
Everyone at the bar sees them.

425
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,740
But Phu,

426
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,720
you've been asking a lot about Nawa.

427
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,730
You've got a crush?

428
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,930
Yeah, I like Nawa.

429
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,040
And I'm going to make him mine.

430
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:16,740
I'm rooting for you.

431
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,250
Go for it.

432
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,580
Thanks for giving me a ride.

433
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:36,940
Yes.

434
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,240
Nawa.

435
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,240
Yes?

436
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,050
Can we talk for a bit?

437
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,350
What is it?

438
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,650
What kind of person is Phurit?

439
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,580
Well… Playful, a bit cheeky.

440
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,360
Overall, I'd say he's a good guy.

441
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,040
Is he trying to court you?

442
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,390
Let me ask you straight.

443
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,540
All of your actions…
Are you hitting on me?

444
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,880
That's right. I'm hitting on you.

445
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,860
I think so, yeah.

446
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,940
At first, I thought he was just joking around,

447
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,920
but when I asked him directly,
he said he was serious.

448
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,670
And...

449
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,200
And you? What do you think of him?

450
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,060
I don't think anything of it.

451
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:58,070
Between me and Phurit, it's impossible anyway.

452
00:34:58,850 --> 00:34:59,540
Besides,

453
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,140
Phana told me Phurit is quite the playboy.

454
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,770
I just hope that's really the case.

455
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,650
You don't need to worry, Phraphai.

456
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,550
If I don't give him any attention,

457
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:15,270
he'll eventually give up.

458
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,670
Nawa, I'll be honest with you.

459
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,540
Other than Phana,

460
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,620
I don't want you trusting any human at all.

461
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,600
Don't forget

462
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,030
the scars humans have left on us.

463
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,530
I know.
I won't trust anyone so easily.

464
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,560
Good. Now, go on, get some rest.

465
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,140
Alright. Drive safe, okay?

466
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,440
Is he trying to court you?

467
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,920
Well... I think so, yeah.

468
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,200
Don't forget

469
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,610
the scars humans have left on us.

470
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,780
I know.
I won't trust anyone so easily.

471
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,380
All of your actions…
Are you hitting on me?

472
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,880
That's right. I'm hitting on you.

473
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,290
I don't want to see you end up hurt.

474
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,920
Phu's a player,

475
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,660
he throws his charm around everywhere.
If you can avoid him, then avoid him.

476
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:12,940
Besides,

477
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,780
I don't want my little brother to get hurt.

478
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,550
As for Phu,

479
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,380
if he ever found out the truth one day,
he wouldn't be able to handle it.

480
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,530
What are you babbling about?

481
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,160
Mermen? There's no such thing.

482
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,000
I didn't think so either.

483
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:37,310
But I swear
my eyes weren't playing tricks on me.

484
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:59,780
Nawa, what's wrong, sweetheart? Hmm?

485
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,040
Mom.
I don't want to play with Phana anymore.

486
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,610
He said he's scared of me

487
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,510
because I'm a merman.

488
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,670
Why is he scared of me just like that?

489
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:21,260
I've never done anything to him,
never even teased him.

490
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,580
It's alright, my dear.

491
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,810
You don't like being judged

492
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,670
by someone who
doesn't truly know you, right?

493
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,560
Phana only said that

494
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,860
because he doesn't yet understand
who you really are.

495
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,040
Once he sees that

496
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:48,550
you're kind and gentle,

497
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,730
I'm sure he'll want to
play with you again.

498
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,100
So what should I do, Mom?

499
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,440
You have to open your heart,
don't shut yourself away.

500
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,860
Show others who you really are.

501
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,930
You know, humans and mermen

502
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,410
deep down, we're not so different.

503
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:16,580
We both feel, and we both have hearts.

504
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,410
And if our hearts can truly connect,

505
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,080
then even a love that seems impossible

506
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,050
can become possible.

507
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,230
Really?

508
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,240
Of course, sweetheart.

509
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,600
As long as you lead with your heart.

510
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:35,900
Hmm?

511
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,770
Was what you said true, Mom?

512
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,800
I can't see it yet.

513
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,950
About what Den mentioned earlier,

514
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,400
the rumor that people came here to hunt mermen

515
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,770
my father says it's true.

516
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,920
He's already dealt with those humans,

517
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,490
but still, we can't afford to let our guard down.

518
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,250
Be careful wherever you go.

519
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,170
I worry about you, Nawa.

520
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,670
I understand, Phraphai.

521
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,050
I'll be more careful from now on.

522
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,180
Last time I went to release the poison,

523
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,240
I overheard some mermen talking.

524
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,490
They said some mermen were missing.

525
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,940
Two or three of them

526
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,880
went missing last week.

527
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:20,140
Didn't you guys hear anything about this?

528
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,350
(Love each other.)

529
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,450
(Complicated.)

530
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,550
(My world.)

531
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:52,270
(A new world together.)

532
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,420
(Couple.)

533
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:00,930
(What is important?)

534
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,550
(Next Episode)
I've been courting you for almost a month now.

535
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,400
Why won't you soften up to me yet?

536
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,150
Are you about to give up already?

537
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,990
I brought you something.

538
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,630
A mermaid keychain.

539
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,700
I thought of you when I saw how cute it was.

540
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,090
You know that Phraprai
is courting your bro, right?

541
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,940
If there's anyone who deserves to be with Nawa,

542
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,000
it should be Phraprai.

543
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,080
He's the most suitable.

544
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,340
If it were on your neck, Nawa,

545
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,090
it would look so beautiful.

546
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:41,750
Nawa,

547
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,250
I have something to tell you.

548
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:54,390
Mr. Phana.

549
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:01,140
You're the first person
who's ever made me feel like this.

550
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:02,840
You know what?

551
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,470
I think

552
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,570
