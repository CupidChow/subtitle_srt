"Lover Merman"
(Episode 4)

25
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,680
(Previously)
I've been courting you for almost a month now.

26
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,560
Why won't you soften up to me yet?

27
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,870
Are you about to give up already?

28
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,140
I'm not giving up on you that easily.

29
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,360
What about you?
Do you believe in mermaids?

30
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,120
Yes,

31
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,370
And I also believe that
mermaids and humans can never coexist.

32
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,180
Drink with me.

33
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,730
But I'm still working.

34
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,700
When a customer tells you to drink, you drink.

35
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,600
You came without telling me first.

36
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,370
I wanted to surprise you.

37
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,960
And ended up getting surprised myself.

38
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,700
Actually, I came because
I wanted to talk about.

39
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,460
- I was thinking that...
- Let's break up.

40
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,980
I saw that necklace design you sketched.

41
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,520
I went and had it made for real.

42
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,010
Nawa, let me put it on you.

43
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,070
Where have you been?

44
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,010
Where I go is...

45
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,670
I followed you and Phraphai by car.

46
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,200
What did you just say?

47
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,880
That's Phraphai's car.

48
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,880
Do you realize

49
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,880
what you did

50
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,600
is a violation of my privacy?

51
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,700
Can you at least tell me

52
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,570
that you feel something for me?

53
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,510
Oh, Mr. Phurit.

54
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,000
You're awake.

55
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,890
I made some hot porridge for you
it'll help with your hangover.

56
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,640
But if you're not hungry yet,

57
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,800
I'll go get you some clothes to change into.

58
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,410
It's okay.

59
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,640
I think I might've left some in the car.

60
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,930
Is there something on my face?

61
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,990
I was just thinking about last night.

62
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,470
I'll go grab you a change of clothes.

63
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,490
(Love each other.)

64
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,460
(Complicated.)

65
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,880
(My world.)

66
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,420
(A new world together.)

67
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,550
(Couple.)

68
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,810
(underline it as forbidden love.)

69
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,520
The porridge's pretty good.

70
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,050
You can just drop me off here.

71
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,840
Thanks for breakfast.

72
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,590
And for last night's meal, too.

73
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,960
Mr. Phurit,

74
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
that's not funny.

75
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,480
You've been avoiding me all morning.

76
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,030
I'm dying to talk about us.

77
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,570
I know.

78
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,180
But not right now.

79
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,690
Alright then.

80
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,180
See you this evening.

81
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,620
Nawa.

82
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,090
Mr. Phurit.

83
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,540
Do you have business with Nawa
this early in the morning?

84
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,400
Last night, I...

85
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,170
There was a small issue at the shop last night,

86
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,180
so Mr. Phurit came by to talk about it.

87
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,520
This early though?

88
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,840
You couldn't wait until he got to the shop?

89
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,220
I'm a bit hot-tempered.

90
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,590
When I'm thinking

91
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:09,890
or feeling something,

92
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,200
I want to talk about it right away
don't like leaving things unresolved.

93
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,260
What about you?

94
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,580
Why are you here so early?

95
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh, it's a personal matter.

96
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,740
An outsider like you…
doesn't really need to know.

97
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,140
Alright then,

98
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,720
I'll take care of things
at the shop this evening.

99
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,900
Okay. See you this evening.

100
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,120
Nawa, my dad wants to see you.

101
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,740
Let's get breakfast together.

102
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,870
Sure.

103
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,980
You're all dressed, right?

104
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,060
I'm ready.

105
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,600
- Hungry?
- Yeah.

106
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,190
Let's go.

107
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,090
(Restaurant)

108
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,960
Why are you here so early?

109
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,190
Oh, it's a personal matter.

110
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,930
An outsider like you…
doesn't really need to know.

111
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,360
So damn annoying.

112
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,050
Hello, Phu!

113
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,490
What is it, Than?

114
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,820
I'm driving.

115
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,660
I'm at Khen Island Pier already.

116
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,330
Huh? What? You came to Khen Island?

117
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,770
Come pick us up.

118
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,580
Yu's here with me too.

119
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,160
What's this about?

120
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,480
Some kind of surprise?

121
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,730
Dad send you to drag me back to work?

122
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,650
Don't flatter yourself.

123
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,890
Yu and I just came for a little trip.
That's all.

124
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,480
What if I was busy?
What will you do?

125
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,580
Not my problem, big brother.

126
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,760
Your little brothers are waiting at the pier,

127
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,660
so call me when you get here.

128
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,900
Bye-bye!

129
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,780
Totally cornered me.

130
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,520
You're still seasick, Than?

131
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,820
I felt a bit better
when I got off the boat,

132
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,410
but now the headache's back again.

133
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,800
You done taking pictures?

134
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,980
Yeah.

135
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,360
Want to take some more?
I can snap a few for you.

136
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,770
No, it's fine. You should rest.

137
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,250
That's what I like to hear.

138
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,740
I'll rest, then.

139
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,560
Mm.

140
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,850
Comfy.

141
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,540
You sure you're actually seasick?

142
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,170
You look suspicious.

143
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,620
I'm really sick.
Can't handle it anymore.

144
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,910
Come on, not yet!

145
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,520
Who knows how long it'll be

146
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,680
before Phu shows up.

147
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,100
I told you to call him yesterday.

148
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,100
Who knows, maybe he's

149
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,570
sleeping over at some girl's house
on the island.

150
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,500
That's why he's late.

151
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,100
Since when have you been
sleeping under my bed, Than?

152
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,410
Hello, Phu.

153
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,290
Yu, did Than trick you into coming here?

154
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,880
Trick? Come on,

155
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,300
I've never tricked anyone in my life.

156
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:51,980
Mm.

157
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,300
Something like that, Phu.

158
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,940
But don't worry,

159
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,280
I brought plenty of work with me too.

160
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,130
You seem to forget.

161
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,650
I'm not involved with the company anymore.

162
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,340
Then don't come crying when

163
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,860
you get a smaller inheritance, alright?

164
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:06,920
Geez.

165
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,520
Anyway, Yu, if you like the ocean,

166
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,890
I'll tell you what,
working by the sea here on Khen Island?

167
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,220
Feels like heaven.

168
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,100
Ah… I see.

169
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,240
The waves are pretty rough this season.

170
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,720
Did you get seasick?

171
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,210
Not at all, Phu.

172
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,770
Hey, the seasick one's right here,

173
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,900
You can see it from Mars!

174
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,040
Don't I get asked how I'm doing?

175
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:33,810
Let's get going.

176
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,780
I'll drop you off at your hotel.

177
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,430
- Sure, Phu.
- Grab your bag.
I'll help carry it.

178
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,380
Hey! I'm your real brother, you know!

179
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,500
Do I need to wear a sign
around my neck to remind you?

180
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,460
Geez.

181
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,820
I'm coming too!

182
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,600
Wait up!

183
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,960
Nawa,

184
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,660
the food isn't to your liking today?

185
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,210
I'm just not very hungry today.

186
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,730
Do you have to go back to work
at the shop after this?

187
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,060
Yes, sir.

188
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,210
Everything's going smoothly?

189
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,160
Yes,

190
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,500
business has been quite good lately.

191
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,360
Mm.

192
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,480
It'd be going even better if a

193
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,620
certain person would stop bothering him.

194
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,180
Bothering him?

195
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,190
Who?

196
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,740
Um… Well...

197
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,940
Phana's business partner, Phurit.

198
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,720
He just came from Bangkok.

199
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,770
Seems like he's been pestering Nawa nonstop.

200
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,910
He's totally smitten with him.

201
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,900
But don't worry, Dad.

202
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,490
I already told Nawa

203
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,290
that no human ever truly loves us.

204
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,740
To them we're just monsters,

205
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,190
or demons.

206
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,220
We're too different from humans.

207
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,040
I don't want to meddle
in your personal life,

208
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,570
but everything Phraphai said is true.

209
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,440
Don't forget

210
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,180
what happened 20 years ago,
what the humans did to our kind.

211
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,130
Yes, sir.

212
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,300
Even if we've dealt with
the mermen hunters,

213
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,480
the threat's still out there.

214
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,950
You know how greedy humans are.

215
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,640
If anything happens, tell Phraphai right away.

216
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,280
Yes, Uncle.

217
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,400
Hey, Nawa,

218
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,980
I'm sorry

219
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,500
for bringing up Phurit during lunch.

220
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,120
I just said it because
I'm really worried about you.

221
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,550
I thought if my dad said something,

222
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,440
maybe it'd make you stop and think for a bit.

223
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,980
I understand, Phraphai.

224
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,600
I'm not upset at all, really.

225
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,010
Please don't overthink it.

226
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,130
I'm sorry

227
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,930
for making you worry about me.

228
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,460
Nawa, I'm not worried.

229
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,480
I care.

230
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,280
That's different.

231
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,780
Thank you.

232
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,610
I trust you, Nawa.

233
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,360
Come on, let's go.

234
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,100
Yeah.

235
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,430
Ping, where's everyone?

236
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,280
Aunty Son, Melli, Timmy, Lek, and Maiaek

237
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,270
are in the back,

238
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,050
and Mr. Phurit and Mr. Phana
haven't come in yet.

239
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,600
Sorry, I got held up.

240
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,540
So I was late.

241
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,350
Did you miss me, Nawa?

242
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,090
We've only been apart for a little bit.

243
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,920
Excuse me, I'll go check on Aunty Son
and the others in the back.

244
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,450
What's up with him?

245
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,260
I'm not sure,

246
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,090
but he seems kind of down.

247
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:13,610
What about Phana?

248
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,010
He hasn't shown up either.

249
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,180
What the...

250
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,900
He said he'd come in early,

251
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:22,860
and now he's not answering his phone.

252
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,860
Ping, could you go check on him at home?

253
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,660
If you find out anything,
give me a call, alright?

254
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,270
Got it.

255
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,480
Thanks, man.

256
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,490
Hello? Anyone home?

257
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,370
Anyone home?

258
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:28,570
What is it?

259
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,190
Uh… Mr. Phurit couldn't reach you,

260
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,610
so he asked me to check if you were home.

261
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,480
Oh. Sorry,

262
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,770
I probably turned my phone off.

263
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,330
Excuse me, Mr. Phana.

264
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,340
Oh! You're burning up.

265
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,780
It's fine.

266
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,410
I'll be okay after a bit of rest.

267
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,550
Have you taken any medicine yet?

268
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,310
No.

269
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,500
Then let me call Mr. Phurit

270
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,370
and let him know you're sick.

271
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,330
Please, go lie down and rest.

272
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,570
I'll go get you some food and medicine.

273
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,200
That's not necessary.

274
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,840
Yes, Mr. Phurit.

275
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,130
Mr. Phana's at home, he's got a fever,

276
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,340
and no one else is home.

277
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,720
Yes, sir.

278
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,080
Mr. Phurit told me to stay here
and take care of you.

279
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,260
Call him back

280
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,580
and tell him I can take care of myself.

281
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,270
Please, don't be stubborn.

282
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,910
Come on, let's get you inside.

283
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,810
The strawberries are here, Mr. Phurit.

284
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,940
Delivered directly to your doorstep
with top notch service.

285
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,190
Mmm!

286
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,780
Truly delicious!

287
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,090
See?

288
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,120
With service this good,

289
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,530
are you trying to get me
to give you a raise?

290
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,780
Actually, I hadn't even thought of that,

291
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,530
but since you mentioned it,

292
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,570
I'll gladly accept!

293
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,690
If that's not enough, just say so.

294
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,460
Aunty Son's got plenty more in the back.

295
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,370
- Thank you.
- No problem.

296
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,270
Phu!

297
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,450
Oh!

298
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,190
You actually made it here.

299
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,280
I thought you wouldn't be at the shop.

300
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,310
And if I weren't at the shop,
where would I be?

301
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,330
Well, back in Bangkok,

302
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,010
if you weren't working,

303
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,900
you were probably on a date
with some rich girl,

304
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,580
and maybe breaking her heart later.

305
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,100
Oh my!

306
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,170
Yu… If you say that,

307
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,060
you'll ruin my reputation here.

308
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,530
Anyway, everyone,

309
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,120
these two are my younger brothers.

310
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,000
Nice to meet you!

311
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,380
This is Phuthan,

312
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,470
and this is Winyu.

313
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,170
- Hello.
- That's Melli and Lek.

314
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,610
- Hello.
- Hello.
They work here.

315
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,660
Hello.
Hello.

316
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,000
Hello.

317
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,150
And that's Nawa,

318
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,460
our bartender.

319
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,270
If you want a drink, just ask him.

320
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,830
Are both of them your real brothers?

321
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,910
Than's my biological brother.

322
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,350
Yu was adopted by our dad
when he was a kid.

323
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,410
But honestly, I love Yu even more
than my real brother.

324
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,830
Wow, seriously, Phu?

325
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,180
Oh my gosh, don't fight, boys!

326
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,610
But seriously, excuse me

327
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,700
for saying this,

328
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,580
both of Mr. Phurit's brothers
are so handsome.

329
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,470
Anyone single? Either of you?

330
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,350
Because, well…

331
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,150
My bed's still empty.
I could use someone to cuddle with!

332
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,150
Sorry, can't do.

333
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,020
These two are seeing each other.

334
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,780
Oh my!

335
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,340
Hey! That's not true, Phu!

336
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,270
Aww, don't be shy!

337
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,400
You two are a match made in heaven!

338
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,020
I mean, even without trying,

339
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,530
I've already lost.

340
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,150
Woe is me.

341
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,530
Anyway, suit yourselves, boys.

342
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,780
If you ever break up, call me.

343
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,860
- Wait for me, loser!
- Come!

344
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,200
So where's Phana?

345
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,800
He's sick today, won't be coming in.

346
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,570
No way, master is sick.

347
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,510
Hey, Phu,

348
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,150
show me around here a bit

349
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,210
this place looks amazing.

350
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,090
Sure.

351
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,500
Yu, you wanna come along?

352
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,250
Nah, you and Than go ahead.

353
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,080
I'll grab a drink or something.

354
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,650
Let's go.

355
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,340
Okay.

356
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,610
You can eat it.

357
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:41,410
- Be right back.
- Let's go.
- See you.
- Let's go.

358
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,180
From what I hear about Nawa,

359
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,770
it's pretty serious, huh?

360
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,730
What's wrong with the playboy here?

361
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,690
I don't know.

362
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,140
The more I get to know him,

363
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,530
the more I feel like
I want to be serious with him.

364
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,940
Don't tell me you're planning to

365
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,540
ask him to be your boyfriend?

366
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,550
Oh my God, are you kidding me?

367
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,970
I'm serious.

368
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,400
And I'll do it.

369
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,760
I'm just waiting for the right moment.

370
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,170
From what I saw earlier,

371
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,610
he really is cute.

372
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,490
Just ask him out already.

373
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,010
How are you and Yu doing,

374
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:45,930
by the way?

375
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,230
From what I've seen…
nothing's moving forward, huh?

376
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,690
I've tried to find chances
to talk to him a few times,

377
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,180
but Yu keeps dodging it.

378
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,910
I thought this trip to the island

379
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,740
might give us a good opening.

380
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,760
It's not strange for Yu to think like that.

381
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,200
Yu respects our dad a lot.

382
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,200
He might think being in
a relationship with you

383
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,850
means betraying his benefactor.

384
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,890
Still, I'm a person too.

385
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,920
Whether Yu likes me or not

386
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,290
shouldn't be decided by Dad stuff.

387
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,190
Fight for it, Than.

388
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,170
Yeah.

389
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,970
Don't forget to remind yourself too.

390
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,490
Fight for it. Fight for it.

391
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,040
Fight for it.

392
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,370
Do you want anything, Mr. Phana?

393
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,360
Umm... Can I...

394
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:38,660
Nothing.

395
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,450
I just brushed the mosquito

396
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,820
off your head earlier.

397
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,780
Thank you.

398
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,410
How are you feeling?

399
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,010
Has your fever gone down?

400
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,630
Getting better.

401
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,720
What about you?

402
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,440
You've been here since midday.

403
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,800
I'm fine.

404
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,430
I don't like leaving sick people alone.

405
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,570
Let me stay with you tonight.

406
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,700
You're stubborn.

407
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,770
Fine, I won't stop you.

408
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,250
There.

409
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,220
The quilt and pillow are in the closet

410
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,300
use them so you don't ruin your back.

411
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:32,320
Well?

412
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,240
Or do you want to sleep on the bed with me?

413
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:35,950
Huh?

414
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,580
It's nothing.

415
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,800
I was just babbling.

416
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,600
Go sleep on the floor.

417
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,780
Don't catch my fever too.

418
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,380
Wow, Daniel, your Thai is so clear.

419
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,210
I'm impressed.

420
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,940
I've studied Thai for years,

421
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,990
but I like to tease people sometimes.

422
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,060
Can you speak any other languages?

423
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,900
Just Thai and English.

424
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:27,050
I'm particularly fond of Thai people.

425
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:30,680
Especially cute ones like you.

426
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,380
Even if you compliment me like that,

427
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,930
I won't give you a free drink.

428
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,000
No such thing as a freebie in this world, right?

429
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,340
Hold on.

430
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,690
I already paid a lot for the drinks,

431
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,210
I deserve something more.

432
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,690
Sorry, sir,

433
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,530
we don't have any promotions

434
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,510
for the drinks you just ordered.

435
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,620
Then please just tell me

436
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,010
how much?

437
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,200
What's the number for?

438
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,530
Such an innocent answer.

439
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,660
If I want you to sleep with me tonight,

440
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,730
how much would you charge?

441
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,220
I think you've got the wrong idea.

442
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,060
Nothing's wrong.

443
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,930
Everything's got a price.

444
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,890
You do, too.

445
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,300
Tell me a number

446
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,400
and I'll pay.

447
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,490
You think you can buy me with money?

448
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,280
I think you might have
misunderstood something.

449
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,720
That's not the case.

450
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:03,720
With all due respect,

451
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,660
you wouldn't be doing this job
if money couldn't buy you,

452
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,200
and besides,

453
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,700
I don't think you'd be foolish enough

454
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,890
to refuse my offer.

455
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,850
You're the foolish one.

456
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,310
Who do you think you are?

457
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,290
How dare you call me foolish!

458
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,950
Do you know who I am?

459
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,440
Don't mess with my person!

460
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,660
Who the fuck are you?

461
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,000
If you don't shut up,

462
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,080
I'll kill you.

463
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:37,870
Try me then.

464
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,790
Get out of my shop.

465
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,650
Nawa, are you alright?

466
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,340
Here, some hot coffee.

467
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,510
Do you want anything else?

468
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:20,880
I can get it for you.

469
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,220
No, it's fine.

470
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,950
Please don't worry,

471
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,300
I'm really okay.

472
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,250
How could I not worry about you, hmm?

473
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,290
I've dealt with many customers like that.

474
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,760
I'm used to it.

475
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,420
If that kind of customer ever shows up again,

476
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,850
stay away from them, okay?

477
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,570
Got it.

478
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,130
But you should head back now,

479
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,420
it's late.

480
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,460
Are you kicking me out?

481
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,540
No,

482
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,800
I just don't want you driving home so late.

483
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,180
Actually, there's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

484
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,390
What is it?

485
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,720
After what happened today,

486
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:19,870
I realized I really want to
take care of you.

487
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,340
Please be my boyfriend.

488
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:52,650
Okay.

489
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,440
Maybe I'm rushing you.

490
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,990
You probably need more time.

491
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,260
Mr. Phurit.

492
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:09,520
I think...
it's better if we stop here.

493
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,970
I don't want you to wait or hope...

494
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:15,790
You don't have to say anything more.

495
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,020
Actually,
you've already been through a lot today.

496
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,170
You should rest.

497
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:33,860
I'll get going.

498
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,230
Alright.

499
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,960
Don't forget

500
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,610
what happened 20 years ago,
what the humans did to our kind.

501
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,240
After what happened today,

502
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:25,260
I realized I really want to
take care of you.

503
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,420
Please be my boyfriend.

504
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,470
I already told Nawa

505
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,380
that no human ever truly loves us.

506
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,770
To them we're just monsters,

507
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,170
or demons.

508
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,260
We're too different from humans.

509
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,340
You know, humans and mermen

510
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,860
deep down, we're not so different.

511
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,950
We both feel, and we both have hearts.

512
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,980
And if our hearts can truly connect,

513
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,450
then even a love that seems impossible

514
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,480
can become possible.

515
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,220
I'm really confused, Mom.

516
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,290
Phu, which move should I make next?

517
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,380
Come on, help bro out.

518
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,450
Please.

519
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,400
A bit, yeah?

520
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,120
If you move that one, I'll take your piece.

521
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,280
What's up with you?

522
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:50,920
You look totally out of it.

523
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,770
Than, think for yourself.

524
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,000
You keep asking for Phu's help.

525
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,960
Serves you right.

526
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,670
The moment I got sick,

527
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,370
you went and asked my brother out.

528
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,170
Didn't I tell you to stay out of that?

529
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,170
Nawa's really got

530
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,920
a tough heart, huh?

531
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,330
All week Phu's been

532
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,950
chasing after him,

533
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,580
but he doesn't seem to be softening at all.

534
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,570
Phu, I think you should give up.

535
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:17,740
If you really want to date someone,

536
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,440
go find someone else.

537
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,970
Says the guy who just got dumped himself.

538
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,530
You're not in any position
to give me advice.

539
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,690
Oof, counterattack!

540
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:31,990
Checkmate for the master!

541
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,360
You little twerp.

542
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:43,490
Nawa,

543
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,140
I heard you tell Ping you were craving
a cake from your favorite shop.

544
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,680
I went into town this morning
and got one for you,

545
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:51,500
it's in the fridge.

546
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,560
Thank you,

547
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,580
but you don't have to do that next time.

548
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,760
Phana,

549
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,480
I'll go check the stock in the back

550
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,080
and bring you the updated list.

551
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,550
Call me if you need anything.

552
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,090
Look at you, all deflated.

553
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,780
Sit back down.

554
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:15,760
Hey,
- go on.
- I can walk myself.

555
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:17,920
Let go.

556
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,290
Wait, hey,

557
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,760
where's my piece?

558
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,240
I captured it earlier
right before you stood up.

559
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,560
Nawa.

560
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,780
Mr. Phurit, is something wrong?

561
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,540
Why did you do this?

562
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,410
Doing…

563
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,420
what exactly?

564
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,810
You've been avoiding me all week.

565
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,870
Acting cold.

566
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,170
Treating me like I don't even exist.

567
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,350
Well, you didn't come to talk to me
about work, did you?

568
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:04,670
And what if I didn't?

569
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,930
I think I made it clear.

570
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,680
It's better if things end between us here.

571
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,460
Let me ask you straight.

572
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,870
Do you really want things
between us to end like this?

573
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:27,730
And if what you're about to say isn't true,

574
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,120
then don't say anything.

575
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,240
Because I already know how you really feel.

576
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,370
And I'm not giving up that easily.

577
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,670
Uh, Mr. Phurit?

578
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,840
Mr. Phana asked me to tell you

579
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,750
he's taking Mr. Phuthan to
a friend's party tonight,

580
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,360
and you're supposed to come too.

581
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,370
Tell him I'm not going.

582
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:58,930
I'm staying to watch the shop.

583
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,590
Then you'll have to tell him yourself.

584
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,410
He said you must come.

585
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,520
By the way, you and Mr. Phurit
aren't having a problem, are you?

586
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:30,860
Forget it.

587
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,270
Nothing's wrong.

588
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:49,780
Oh, Nawa,

589
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,470
I thought you already went home.

590
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,630
Was finishing up things at the shop.

591
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:54,840
Everyone else gone already?

592
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,100
Yeah.

593
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,640
Get home safe.

594
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,770
You too. Take care.

595
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:14,820
Hello there, darling.

596
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,240
Remember me?

597
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,190
Daniel!

598
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:20,780
What are you doing?

599
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,230
- Come here! Come here!
- No!

600
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,560
Let go!
Don't!

601
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,020
No!

602
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:38,780
First,

603
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,590
I'm just taking back what you owe me.

604
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,200
And second,

605
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,950
when I want something,

606
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,610
I get it.

607
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,060
It's just that simple.

608
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,390
That's just how it works.

609
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:07,860
Hey!

610
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,240
Who the hell?

611
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,430
What the hell are you lot doing?

612
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,350
Oh wow!

613
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,280
Hey, pretty boy.

614
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,130
We meet again.

615
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,330
Damn it.

616
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,590
Useless idiots!

617
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,450
I told you, didn't I?

618
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:36,990
Stay the hell away from Nawa.

619
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,610
So what?

620
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,620
What something about?

621
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,690
Easy, man.

622
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,200
We can talk this out.

623
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:28,720
Hey!

624
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,870
Next time, I won't miss.

625
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,660
Yeah, figured that out.

626
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,540
Yeah, yeah, alright, fine.

627
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,440
Okay.

628
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,490
Hey!

629
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:41,900
Hey!

630
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,420
Dammit, I kicked too hard.

631
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,810
Hey, let's go!

632
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,500
This isn't over!

633
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:09,750
Nawa!

634
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:11,690
Nawa!

635
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,580
Nawa, can you hear me?

636
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,810
Nawa!

637
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,210
Nawa!

638
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,700
Mr. Phurit.

639
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,280
Careful.

640
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,720
Alright.

641
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:11,790
Are you okay?

642
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:16,010
I'm fine.

643
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,130
Why am I here?

644
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,920
You don't remember anything?

645
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,270
I remember Daniel trying to take me away.

646
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,730
And my head hit the ground.

647
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,160
Then I heard your voice.

648
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,840
Good thing.

649
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:49,610
I went back to grab something from the bar,
or I wouldn't have seen you.

650
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,210
You saved me?

651
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:03,730
Thank you.

652
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,080
Don't mention it.

653
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,940
I'm just glad you're safe.

654
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,740
I was going to take you home,

655
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,040
but I was afraid they might follow,

656
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,750
so I brought you to my place first.

657
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,000
I cleaned up your wounds a bit.

658
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,150
What about them?

659
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,810
I already called the police.

660
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,380
They'll catch those guys soon.

661
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,630
Try not to think about it too much.

662
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,270
Just rest.

663
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,440
You're not hurt, are you?

664
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,750
Do you want to take a shower?

665
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,820
If not, I can help you wipe down a bit.

666
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,400
It's alright, I can do it myself.

667
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,970
Then I'll go get you a towel.

668
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,610
Didn't you say you were fine?

669
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:38,990
Just a scratch.

670
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,360
Let me clean it for you.

671
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,050
Does it hurt much?

672
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:04,070
Not really.

673
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,960
Not really, huh?

674
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,300
Are you teasing me?

675
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,520
Done.

676
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,060
Something wrong?

677
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,200
Do you know

678
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:40,470
how scared I was?

679
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:43,600
I thought I was going to lose you.

680
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,200
I'm safe because you saved me.

681
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,010
I know I've already asked before.

682
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,120
But let me ask again.

683
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,170
Please let me take care of you, always.

684
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:18,240
I don't know what you're afraid of

685
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:23,360
or what you're hiding,

686
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,450
but every time I see you,

687
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:30,850
I just want to be by your side.

688
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,940
You don't have to be perfect.

689
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:40,490
Just be yourself.

690
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,760
That's all it takes for me to love you.

691
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:57,780

Phana, what's going on with you and Ping?

702
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,220
You seem a little too interested in him.

703
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:43,380
I don't even know, man.

704
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:45,220
Honestly, I'm confused myself.

705
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,810
What do you think I should do?

706
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,440
We grew up together, Than.

accept this if he found out?

709
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:58,490
You got a tattoo?

710
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,560
I'm sorry

711
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,520

you have to tell me right away, okay?

715
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:11,120
I just saw another merman swimming that way.

716
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:12,890
Should we follow and check it out?

717
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,600
I want to know who it is.

718
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,300
Is there something you want to tell me?

719
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,010
I was afraid they were part of
the group that hunts mermen.

720
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,220
So I got rid of them.

721
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,730
