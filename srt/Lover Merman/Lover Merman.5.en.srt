"Lover Merman"
(Episode 5)

25
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,480
Do you have business with Nawa
this early in the morning?

26
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,680
(Previously)
What about you?

27
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,970
Why are you here so early?

28
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,220
It's a personal matter.

29
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,920
An outsider like you…
doesn't really need to know.

30
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,820
Since when have you been
sleeping under my bed, Than?

31
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,400
Yu,

32
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,440
did Than trick you into coming here?

33
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,790
- I've never tricked anyone in my life.
- Mm.

34
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,040
Excuse me, Mr. Phana.

35
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,490
Oh! You're burning up.

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,280
Let me stay with you tonight.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,660
If I want you to sleep with me tonight,

38
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,980
how much would you charge?

39
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,530
I don't think you'd be foolish enough

40
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,770
to refuse my offer.

41
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,880
You're the foolish one.

42
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,060
When I want something, I get it.

43
00:02:59,460 --> 00:02:59,920
Hey!

44
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,720
Who the hell?

45
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,830
I told you, didn't I?

46
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,330
Stay the hell away from Nawa.

47
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,300
I know I've already asked before.

48
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,020
But let me ask again.

49
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,400
Please let me take care of you, always.

50
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,550
You don't have to be perfect.

51
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,130
Just be yourself.

52
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,290
That's all it takes for me to love you.

53
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,300
Will you be my boyfriend?

54
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,080
(Love each other.)

55
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,850

56
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,240

00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,570

60
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,100
(as long as we love each other.)

61
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,490
(underline it as forbidden love.)

62
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,300
Alright.

63
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,550
Let's date.

64
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,520

71
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,790
My head's spinning.

72
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,850
Phana's friend group is wild.

73
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,570
We should've left ages ago.

74
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,770
You're the one who wanted to stay.

75
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:14,930
Let me lean on you for a bit.

76
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,760
Mm...

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,660
Why don't you just go lie down on the bed?

78
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,610
I'd rather stay here.

79
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,630
If I'd known you'd be this cute
when you're drunk,

80
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,420
I'd want you to drink more often.

81
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,550
Who's drunk? I'm not drunk at all.

82
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,810
Your face is so red
but you're still denying.

83
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,840
You're drunk.

84
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,370
Wait.

85
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,680
What's wrong, Yu?

86
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,160
Let's not do this, okay?

87
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,050
We've already come this far…
What's wrong?

88
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,460
I'm just drunk, okay?
I didn't mean for this to happen.

89
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,010
Didn't mean it?

90
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,140
You've always known how
I feel about you, haven't you?

91
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,830
Yeah, I know.

92
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,860
But it's impossible.

93
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,470
We grew up together, Than.

94
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,250
If dad finds out,
do you think he could ever accept it?

95
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,330
Please don't make me feel even guiltier
toward him than I already do.

96
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:32,970
Who cares about dad?

97
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,550
Whatever's between us

98
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,860
what does that have to do with him?

99
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,520
We're not kids anymore, Than.

100
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,650
You can't just have everything you want.

101
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:47,840
In the real world,

102
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,200
life isn't easy, you know?

103
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,680
That's irrelevant.

104
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,750
You just decided this is wrong,

105
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,380
so you're going to refuse to try?

106
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,040
About us, and about dad,

107
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,450
you just decided everything on your own.

108
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,710
Aren't you the same?

109
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,840
You decided it can work,

110
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,520
you also decided by yourself,
just like I did.

111
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,930
I'm getting another room for tonight.

112
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,080
We'll talk about this

113
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,940
some other time.

114
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,550
We're too emotional right now.

115
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Hey, Yu, wait!

116
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,370
Whoa, that smells amazing!

117
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:41,980
You're awake?

118
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,240
I was just about to go wake you up.

119
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,380
Your coffee and breakfast smell so good,

120
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,170
they woke me up.

121
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,610
It's just a simple menu,
but I promise

122
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,620
it's just as good as the porridge
you made for me before.

123
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,220
Shouldn't I be the one to test that claim?

124
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,650
Before you test it,
can I get a reward first?

125
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,610
Did you sleep well last night?

126
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,180
Very well, actually.

127
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,820
If that's the case,
you should sleep with me more often.

128
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,780
Is it good?

129
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,740
It's delicious.

130
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,440
Fragrant,

131
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:55,850
sweet,

132
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,060
just the way I like it.

133
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,230
And what about my kiss?

134
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,100
Which one's sweeter?

135
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,640
Mr. Phurit,

136
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,030
you're gonna make me choke on my food.

137
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,200
Okay, okay, I'll stop teasing you.

138
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,490
You don't have to go to the shop today.

139
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,080
I think you need rest.

140
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:40,570
Alright.

141
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,180
All done.

142
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,590
I'll drive you home then.

143
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,410
What are you looking at?

144
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,260
I'm waiting for your answer.

145
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,650
My kiss or the coffee,

146
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,400
which one's sweeter?

147
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,950
Obviously the coffee.

148
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,320
Then I'd better kiss you again.

149
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,400
(Love each other.)

150
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,610
(Complicated.)

151
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,160
(My world.)

152
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,650
(A new world together.)

153
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,990
(Couple.)

154
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,440
(What is important?)

155
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,940
(as long as we love each other.)

156
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,810
If I'd been there last night,

157
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,160
that foreigner wouldn't have
had a pretty corpse left.

158
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,410
Even if you were, you wouldn't
have helped much,

159
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,100
you were dead drunk.

160
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,970
Thanks a lot, you saved my brother.

161
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,700
Consider that I owe you one as well.

162
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,220
It's fine.

163
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,650
Already got too many people who owe me.
I'm tired of collecting what I owe.

164
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,040
Good thing your dad sent you
to learn taekwondo,

165
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,600
judo, and Muay Thai
since you were a kid, huh?

166
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,640
It actually came in handy.

167
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,520
By the way, when you were fighting,

168
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,800
did you yell out any move names like
“Roaring Tiger Fist” or something?

169
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,490
How old are you again, seriously?

170
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,210
Umm... Excuse me.

171
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,860
Yeah, Ping?

172
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,030
Can I leave early today?

173
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:48,980
Something up?

174
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,410
A few friends will come to visit the island.

175
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,730
They took the last boat,
so I thought I'd go see them.

176
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,120
Are they actually friends?

177
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,920
Yes, from university.

178
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,100
There's a bunch of them.

179
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,260
When are you heading out?
Want me to drive you?

180
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,680
I'll leave about an hour before closing,

181
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,620
but I can go by myself.
Don't trouble yourself, sir.

182
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,050
You think they're really just friends?

183
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,040
- Phana.
- Huh?

184
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,120
What's going on with you and Ping?

185
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,490
You seem a little too interested in him.

186
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,630
No.

187
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,620
I just care for my staff, like usual.

188
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,590
Ping's not from around here,

189
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,640
if he's going somewhere,
of course I should check on him.

190
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,880
I'm starving.
I'll go ask Aunty Son to cook something.

191
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:46,770
Hey, Phana.

192
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,020
I'm not buying it.

193
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,580
Hello. Yes, Than?

194
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,470
Where is he now?

195
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,710
Mr. Phurit just updated me that
the police are still searching for him,

196
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,140
but they haven't found anything yet.

197
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,010
This isn't something to take lightly.

198
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,990
I need to make a phone call first.

199
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,840
I'm sorry

200
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,890
for making you worry about me.

201
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,850
Nawa,

202
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,010
you didn't do anything wrong.

203
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,560
You don't have to apologize.

204
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,650
From now on,
if anything happens to you again,

205
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,350
you must tell me right away,

206
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:02,810
understand?

207
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,490
Yes.

208
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,930
Nawa, are you hurt anywhere?

209
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,360
Not anymore.

210
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,430
If possible,
I want you to stay by my side.

211
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,820
I want to protect you,
to take care of you.

212
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,020
Please let me take care of you, always.

213
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,120
I understand

214
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,660
how you feel.

215
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,560
If something bad ever happened
to my dearest brother,

216
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,820
I'd feel the same way too.

217
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,240
Your dearest brother.

218
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,540
Alright then,
let me go warm up your food,

219
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,320
it's already cold.

220
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:27,860
Alright.

221
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,260
You startled me, Mr. Phurit!

222
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,850
That's because I missed you.

223
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,840
But we just saw each other
yesterday morning,

224
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,880
and we talked on the phone last night.

225
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,640
Don't you think you're missing me
a bit too soon?

226
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,090
I just want to be with you all the time.

227
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,290
That's exaggerating.
How can you do that?

228
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,620
I can if that's what you want,

229
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,060
Mr. boyfriend.

230
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,650
You're unbelievable.

231
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,050
Why? Do you want to bite me?

232
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,370
You know that makes me love you
even more, right?

233
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,820
I didn't say you couldn't.

234
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,050
Uh… Sorry to interrupt.

235
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,200
Maybe I should come back later.

236
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,050
Wait, Yu.

237
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,210
Do you need something?
You came by early.

238
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,700
You go ahead to the shop first, okay?

239
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,080
Okay.

240
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,800
I wanted to talk to you about something.

241
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,160
Than called me last night
He told me everything about you two.

242
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,330
I've been thinking it over
for a while now.

243
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,650
I've decided to resign from the company.

244
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,380
If I quit,

245
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,150
I won't have to see Than anymore.

246
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,330
If that's truly your decision,

247
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,770
I'll respect it.

248
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,720
But I still want you to think it over
once more.

249
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,050
If I really go through with it…
will you be mad at me, Phu?

250
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,400
We all grew up together.

251
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,540
You're like a real brother to me.

252
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,380
I'd never get mad at you
over something like this.

253
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,240
I just want you to be happy with
whatever choice you make.

254
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,080
I understand both of you.

255
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,460
Than's feelings for you,

256
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,460
and yours from where you stand.

257
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,800
Love is complicated like that.

258
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,020
If the world only had you
and the person you love,

259
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,680
then feelings would always
win over reason, right?

260
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,350
Speaking of which,
looks like in your world with Nawa,

261
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,580
there are only two people left now, huh?

262
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,250
You've been letting your feelings
lead since early morning.

263
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,940
You've gotten a lot better at teasing.

264
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,730
Did you learn that from Than?

265
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,620
Probably.

266
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,740
Think carefully before you decide.

267
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,560
I will.

268
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,220
Lately, Melly has been
practicing baking,

269
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,050
so she wanted you to try her dessert.

270
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,360
- And have you tried it yet?
- Ah, not yet.

271
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,780
But I can taste it with the others
in the back later.

272
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,970
Nah, no need. Try it here.

273
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:08,960
Okay.

274
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,730
Hey, not bad at all.

275
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,410
Come on, hurry up.
My hand's getting tired.

276
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:36,280
Mmm… it's really good, Mr. Phana.

277
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,980
You had something on your face,
so I wiped it for you.

278
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,420
Oh, thank you.

279
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,360
You eat so messy like a kid.

280
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,650
Oh, from now on,

281
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,210
stop calling me Mr. Phana,

282
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,770
it sounds too distant.

283
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,720
Just call me Phana like everyone else.

284
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:07,340
Okay,

285
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:09,980
Phana.

286
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,470
What's on your mind?

287
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,600
I want to apologize…

288
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,190
about me quitting the company.

289
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,520
Do you know, Yu,

290
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,150
I hate you so damn much.

291
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,920
But no matter how much I hate you,

292
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,120
I still can't erase what I feel for you.

293
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,620
Than, you know,

294
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,650
I feel just as sad as you do.

295
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,660
The more I talk, the worse it sounds…

296
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,890
I'm sorry for being so selfish.

297
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,010
Yeah, you're really selfish.

298
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,060
Well, since we're already talking,

299
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,560
you can yell at me all you want today.

300
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,240
I'll take it.

301
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,020
Nah, I'm tired.

302
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,060
And if you want to be selfish,
go ahead.

303
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:05,260
Everyone's selfish in their own way

304
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,170
nothing weird about it.

305
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,720
And from now on,

306
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,370
I'm going to be selfish too.

307
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,330
Maybe even more than you.

308
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,710
Because what I'm going to do…

309
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,980
is keep loving you.

310
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,320
Even if you quit the company
and move away,

311
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,100
I'll still love you.

312
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,460
I'll keep chasing you
until you finally give in.

313
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,640
I'll keep telling you I love you,

314
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,000
whether you accept it or not.

315
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,270
I'll stay right here,
not going anywhere,

316
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,630
because I don't know

317
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,380
if I can love again

318
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,780
if it's not you.

319
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,120
Than, you know what?
You're not just selfish

320
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,370
you're also a cheater,
and stubborn as hell.

321
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,690
You're still not used to that?

322
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,260
I honestly can't tell

323
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,930
how things between Winyu
and Phuthan will end.

324
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,850
Once different variables get involved,

325
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,220
love stops being just about two people.

326
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,690
And what if…
there are other variables

327
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,710
for us too?

328
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,800
When that day comes,
will you follow your feelings or your reason?

329
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,920
Whether it's reason or emotion,

330
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,410
whichever one

331
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,790
lets me stay with you

332
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,260
that's the one I'll choose.

333
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,250
Even if it's wrong?

334
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:28,090
Yes. I'll still choose you.

335
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,240
By the way,

336
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,300
just don't do what you did to me
at the bar again, okay?

337
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,890
Good thing today it's only you
and Winyu here.

338
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,480
But you were the one who started it.

339
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,510
Doesn't matter.

340
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,670
From now on, you can't act like
anything more than my boss.

341
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,160
Why not?

342
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,910
Why don't you want others to know?

343
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,850
Eventually everyone will find out anyway.

344
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,090
I'm just not ready yet.

345
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,660
Please give me some more time.

346
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,560
Alright.

347
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,450
Whatever you need, Nawa.

348
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,760
But when it's just the two of us…

349
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,570
you can't stop me.

350
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,820
Mr. Phurit, that's enough.

351
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,360
Mr. Phurit!

352
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,700
(Full & a Half Kohkhen)

353
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,560
Text me when you get there, okay?

354
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,610
You should go visit dad sometimes, Phu.

355
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,030
Don't come crying when he gives
all the inheritance to me.

356
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,040
Yeah, yeah. I know.

357
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,550
Come visit again sometime, you two.

358
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,370
- Yes.
- Yes.

359
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,630
Take care of Phu for me, Nawa.

360
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,910
Hurry up and go back.

361
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,450
- Lek.
- Yes sir?

362
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,640
- Take these two back, will you?
- Alright.

363
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,970
No point in remaining here.

364
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,740
The car's ready, sir.
Mr. Phuthan, Mr. Winyu,

365
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:54,860
this way, please.

366
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,430
Let's go.

367
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,090
See you later.

368
00:30:59,150 --> 00:30:59,790
Bye, Phu.
Let's go.

369
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,000
By the way,

370
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,230
why did Winyu ask you
to keep an eye on Nawa?

371
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,650
Yeah, good question.

372
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,270
Don't tell me Nawa and Mr. Phurit are…

373
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,630
Excuse me,
I need to check the stock in the back.

374
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,740
Right.

375
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,690
Today you and I have to go into
the city to buy decorations for the shop.

376
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,090
Let's go.

377
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,370
- Huh...
- I'm starving already.

378
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,050
What's with you?
Going somewhere whenever you want.

379
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,020
Do you have something to tell me?

380
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,600
Yes. The other night,
someone tried to kidnap Nawa.

381
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,760
I was afraid they'd come after him again.

382
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,400
Furthermore, I'm worried they might

383
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,880
be part of the mermen-hunting group.

384
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,130
So I took care of them.

385
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,210
I don't blame you for using this method.

386
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,070
But you should have told me first.

387
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,320
You're the son of a headman,

388
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,490
you need to be more cautious
with everything you do.

389
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,600
Do you understand me?

390
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,570
Understood, father.

391
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,740
One more thing,

392
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:43,490
I know you've been investigating
the concession issue and the mermen-hunting group.

393
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,300
Drop it.

394
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,040
Why?

395
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,350
I'll handle it myself.

396
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:55,070
You meddling in something you
barely understand

397
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,970
will only cause trouble for me.

398
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:02,990
Understood.

399
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,090
I'll take my leave now.

400
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,690
(Love each other.)

401
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,410
(Complicated.)

402
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,930
(My world.)

403
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,530

404
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,640

405
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:18,430
(What is important?)

406
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,910
(as long as we love each other.)

407
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:33,330

Did you get a tattoo?

425

It's just a sticker tattoo.

426
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,790
I thought it looked nice,
so I wanted to try it out.

427
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,410
Oh? We're not going to continue?

428
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,110
Sorry,

429
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,080
I'm just a bit tired today.

430
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,390
You didn't seem tired a moment ago.

431
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:04,750
I promise,

432
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,850
tomorrow I'll do whatever you want.

433
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,190
Alright then.

434
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,810
Whatever you say.

435
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,730
Today's gonna be rough.

436
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,250
Ping's off, and Nawa's not here either.

437
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,660
I don't get your mom.

438
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,560
Why'd she have to take Nawa out
for errands today?

439
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,420
How should I know what she's thinking?

440
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,010
Why are you so worked up about it?

441
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,110
I'm not.
It's just ever since I moved here,

442
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,600
I've never once seen Nawa work
at the shop on a full moon day.

443
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,490
You're still on about my brother?

444
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,310
You two have been getting close lately.

445
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,870
You didn't cross the line I set, right?

446
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,090
Yeah, yeah, I know you're protective.

447
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,440
But what about you, huh?

448
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,050
What's going on with you and Ping?

449
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,140
You're hitting on him, yeah?

450
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,440
Don't just stay quiet.
Tell me everything.

451
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,370
Ever since I broke up with Namhom,

452
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,670
I've actually gotten closer to Ping.

453
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,600
I feel comfortable

454
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,670
when I'm with him.

455
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,240
Damn, so it's true.

456
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,010
So what now?

457
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,090
That's what I don't know.

458
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,290
You're not just lonely, are you?

459
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:02,270
That I cannot answer.
I don't even know myself.

460
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,110
What do you think I should do?

461
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,740
If you're not sure of your own feelings yet,

462
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,930
then don't drag Ping into it like before.

463
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,270
Take a step back
and figure out whether you

464
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,020
actually like him
or you're just lonely.

465
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,890
It might sound weird coming from me,

466
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,350
but I don't want

467
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,030
you playing with his feelings.

468
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,230
And also, don't treat Ping
like a replacement for Namhom

469
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,660
that you just broke up with.

470
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:00,220
I just saw another merman swimming
toward the other side.

471
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,650
Did you see it too, Phraphai?

472
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,540
I caught a glimpse of a tail.

473
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,520
It's definitely not Met.

474
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,640
Should we go check it out?

475
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,440
I want to know who it is.

476
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,940
Usually, there's only us around here.

477
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:20,020
If we don't meet in the water,
we'd never know.

478
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:24,010
I've had a feeling since the first time
I met you, Ping,

479
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,450
that we have something in common.

480
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,510
I thought I was the only one
who felt that way.

481
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,380
Where do you usually release the poison?

482
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:36,550
A bit farther out.

483
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,510
The last time I went swimming
before coming ashore,

484
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,250
I found some coral around here
by accident.

485
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,940
Do you always go alone?

486
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:46,680
No group?

487
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:51,600
I don't really know anyone.

488
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,070
My mom doesn't like mermen,

489
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,670
so I never got to meet others.

490
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:01,630
I'm half-blood.

491
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:06,430
My parents fell in love before
my mom knew my dad was a merman.

492
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,650
When she found out after I was born,

493
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,590
she was shocked…

494
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,800
and she ended up hating my father

495
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:20,050
and me too.

496
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,370
You're still living with your parents?

497
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:29,370
My dad passed away when I was little.

498
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,760
It's just me and my mom now,

499
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,700
but I rarely go home.

500
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,640
I mostly stay in my dorm.

501
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,240
It's okay.

502
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,590
At least we've met.

503
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,090
I'm glad I met you too, Nawa.

504
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,890
By the way…
what's going on between you and Phana?

505
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,110
I can sense

506
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,570
what you feel about him.

507
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:12,730
Come on, tell me. Don't lie.

508
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,090
Honestly?

509
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,440
I do have feelings for him.

510
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,740
But please don't tell anyone.

511
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,020
Go for it. I'm rooting for you.

512
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:38,440
Here, have a drink, both of you.

513
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,860
Thank you.

514
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:47,790
Ping, I'm sorry,
but I overheard your conversation.

515
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,590
I can't support your feelings for Phana.

516
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:57,530
Even though he's a human I trust deeply,

517
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,450
mermen and humans can't be together.

518
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:04,080
Why not?

519
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,240
There are many things beyond our
expectations between humans and mermen.

520
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:11,090
If you don't believe me,

521
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:14,050
look at your parents,

522
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:16,130
they couldn't make it work either.

523
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:26,110
Ping,

524
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,560
I'm saying this out of concern.

525
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,850
I don't want you to get hurt.

526
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:35,130
But a merman and a human
can't be in love.

527
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,390
Then should we head back?

528
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:47,900
Yeah. Let's go.

529
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,260
I'll give you a ride.

530
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:54,320
Let's go get change first.

531
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:25,580
You're staying here tonight?

532
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:27,680
I'm just keeping my promise.

533
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:19,190
(Love each other.)

534
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,030
(Complicated.)

535
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,510
(My world.)

536
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:30,190
(A new world together.)

537
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:34,110
(Couple.)

538
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:38,790
(What is important?)

539
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:43,120
(Next Episode)
Humans have started hunting mermen on the island.

540
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,120
Several have already been kidnapped.

541
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:48,220
Due to the incidents,
I don't feel safe anymore.

542
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:49,940
From now on,

543
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:52,490
I'll personally take charge
of Nawa's safety.

544
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:55,450
I know how much this frustrates you.

545
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:58,430
But I feel the same way too.

546
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:01,410
Yet you still choose to follow others

547
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,320
instead of our feelings?

548
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,490
You've got Phraphai picking Nawa up
and dropping him off every day,

549
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,240
what's your game here?

550
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,980
Or are you just trying to keep
me and Nawa apart?

551
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,680
I think we should keep some distance for now.

552
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:18,530
I feel like we've gotten too close.

553
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:23,290
I don't even know
how I really feel anymore.

554
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,340
Maybe I don't actually
want Ping after all.

555
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:31,370
Right now, I can't tell you everything.

556
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,360
But I promise,

557
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,680
when things get better,

558
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,680
