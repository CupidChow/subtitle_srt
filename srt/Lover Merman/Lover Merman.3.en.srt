"Lover Merman"
(Episode 3)

25
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,440
(Previously)
Are you Nawa?

26
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,680
Yeah. And you are?

27
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,140
My younger brother. His name's Ping.

28
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,280
Phana asked us to look after him.

29
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,520
He's here to work behind the bar.

30
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,000
Ping, are you a local here too?

31
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,940
Yes, but I went to study on the mainland.

32
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,320
I only come back once in a while.

33
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,980
Last night, I think
I saw something

34
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,290
that looked like a merman.

35
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,010
Oh, Mr. Phurit, you're sober now?

36
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,590
Damn, Phu.

37
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,440
So you were just drunk
and dreaming you saw a merman.

38
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,440
These days, there aren't many people on the island
who know about mermen.

39
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,180
And the fewer that know, the better.

40
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,650
I was just about to head into town for a bit.

41
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,970
Mind if I tag along?

42
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,760
All of your actions…
Are you hitting on me?

43
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,050
That's right. I'm hitting on you.

44
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,820
You two know each other?

45
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,820
Well, if you know there's a collision coming,

46
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,200
I'd advise you to step back now.

47
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,020
Because no insurance will cover you.

48
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,680
Other than Phana,

49
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,740
I don't want you trusting any human at all.

50
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,050
Don't forget

51
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,830
the scars humans have left on us.

52
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,180
About what Den mentioned earlier,

53
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,620
the rumor that people came here to hunt mermen.

54
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,980
He's already dealt with those humans.

55
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,360
Be careful wherever you go.

56
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,300
I worry about you, Nawa.

57
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,710
Last time I went to release the poison,

58
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,400
I overheard some mermen talking.

59
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,710
They said some mermen were missing.

60
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,180
Two or three of them

61
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,070
went missing last week.

62
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,970
Didn't you guys hear anything about this?

63
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,980
Ow! Huh?

64
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:14,640
Mr. Phurit!

65
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,710
Nawa... Ow!

66
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,950
I'm so sorry!

67
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,590
It's okay, oww...

68
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,030
Oww.

69
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,160
I'm really sorry, Mr. Phurit.

70
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,220
You came in so quietly.

71
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,140
I didn't realize it was you.

72
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,420
We've been calling for you for ages,
both me and Mr. Phurit,

73
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,260
but no one answered. The door was open,

74
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,300
so I told him to come in and check.

75
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,880
I was wearing my earphones.

76
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,040
See? Kids these days,
always wearing earphones all day,

77
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,700
never paying attention to what's around them.

78
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,340
Anyway, Aunty Pha,
is there something you needed?

79
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,380
Uncle's friend brought over
a lot of fruit from the orchard,

80
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,780
so I came to share some with you.

81
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,120
You could've just told me, Auntyie.

82
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,940
You didn't have to go through
the trouble of bringing it yourself.

83
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,300
It's no trouble at all.
Our houses are so close anyway.

84
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,690
And besides,

85
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,700
it's been a while since
I last came to visit you here.

86
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,580
What about Phana?
Didn't he come with you?

87
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,110
Oh, don't even mention him.

88
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,700
Always caught up in some love drama,
it gives me such a headache.

89
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,130
Let him sort out his own life for now.

90
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,690
So you asked Mr. Phurit to
come along with you instead?

91
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,220
Oh no, dear. He volunteered himself.

92
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,050
Since you work at his shop,

93
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,950
he said he wanted to come see
how you're doing.

94
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,220
And I was planning to invite him
to visit the resort project too.

95
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,580
But before that,
take me by the market, alright?

96
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,460
Of course, Aunty Pha.

97
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,260
But first, I need to use the bathroom.

98
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,710
My stomach's acting up for some reason.

99
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,720
- Sure.
- Of course.

100
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,350
Walk carefully, alright?

101
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,360
Is this your home outfit?

102
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,170
It's so cute.

103
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,360
I didn't expect anyone to come over.

104
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,480
And when I come over, are you happy?

105
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:49,910
I'm indifferent.

106
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,770
People come to see me all the time.

107
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,690
Are you trying to tease me right now?

108
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,260
No. I'm just telling the truth.

109
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,480
I've been courting you for almost a month now.

110
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,320
Why won't you soften up to me yet?

111
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,690
Are you about to give up already?

112
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,830
I'm not giving up on you that easily.

113
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,470
The more you act like this,

114
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,440
the more I want to know you, you know?

115
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,530
Do you really not know me at all yet?

116
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,340
I do.

117
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,840
That's why I'm asking you not to
shut yourself off from me.

118
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,350
So what should I do?

119
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,680
You have to open your heart,
don't shut yourself away.

120
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,280
Show others who you really are.

121
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,230
You know, humans and mermen

122
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,640
deep down, we're not so different.

123
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,820
We both feel, and we both have hearts.

124
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,840
And if our hearts can truly connect,

125
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,280
then even a love that seems impossible

126
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,260
can become possible.

127
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,520
Really?

128
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,460
Of course, sweetheart.

129
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,780
As long as you lead with your heart.

130
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:44,630
Phurit,

131
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,400
I'm done. Let's go.
See you later, Nawa.

132
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,320
Goodbye, Aunty Pha.

133
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,240
Go already. The market's going to close.

134
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,400
I'll get going then.

135
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,730
Let's go, Aunty Pha.

136
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,120
Blue margarita for the lady at table seven.

137
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,200
Got it.

138
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,320
Looking for someone, Nawa?

139
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,660
No.

140
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,570
You sure you're not looking for Mr. Phurit?

141
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,030
Why would I be looking for him?

142
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,780
How should I know?

143
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,470
But seeing how hard he's been chasing after you,

144
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,000
Even if you pretend you don't care,

145
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,650
when he doesn't show up,
doesn't it feel a little empty?

146
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,980
You're making things up.
There's no reason for me to be waiting for him.

147
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,180
So you really weren't waiting for me?

148
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,240
That makes me sad.

149
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,340
Mr. Phurit.

150
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,890
I'll go take another order then.

151
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,520
I brought you something.

152
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,500
A mermaid keychain.

153
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,980
I thought of you when I saw how cute it was.

154
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,960
It reminded you of me?

155
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,660
Yeah.

156
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,320
Ever since I came to Khen Island,

157
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,280
two things always come to mind,

158
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,360
one, the legend of the mermaid,

159
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,460
and two, you, Nawa.

160
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,770
Oh, stop it already.

161
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,890
Isn't it cute?

162
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,530
I've heard about the mermaid legend

163
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,770
since I got here,

164
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,740
but I never really believed it was true.

165
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,980
Lately though, I've started
getting more interested.

166
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,300
More interested?

167
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,520
Yeah. I want to get to know you more.

168
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,350
And learning about your hometown

169
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,910
might be beneficial to me.

170
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,650
What about you?
Do you believe in mermaids?

171
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,580
Yes,

172
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,090
I believe they really once
lived here on Khen Island.

173
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,710
But probably not anymore.

174
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,340
And I also believe that

175
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,630
mermaids and humans can never coexist.

176
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,460
Anyway,

177
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,290
how's your wound?

178
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,960
Ah, it's starting to hurt again.

179
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,140
Ouch! Oww!

180
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,430
Oww!

181
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,960
I can't take it!

182
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,060
It really hurts.

183
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:29,730
Ouch!

184
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:32,430
Oww!

185
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,470
Not allergic to any medicine, right?

186
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,530
Could you apply it for me?

187
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,060
I don't know exactly where the cut is.

188
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,280
And besides, you're the one who caused it.

189
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,120
Oww...

190
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,940
Just stay still, please.

191
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,000
(Love each other.)

192
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,120
What's with you?

193
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,170
(Complicated.)
Afraid it'd be hard for you to apply.

194
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,740
(My world.)
When you're being gentle like this,

195
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,800
you're really cute.

196
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,220
(A new world together.)

197
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,620
If you don't want another wound,

198
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,380
(Couple.)
you'd better stop talking.

199
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,710
(What is important?)

200
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,230
(as long as we love each other.)

201
00:13:59,180 --> 00:13:59,790
All done.

202
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,820
Please go sit at the bar now.

203
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,400
Ping, do you need anything?

204
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,280
Phana asked for another bottle of whiskey.

205
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,640
But didn't he just drink wine?

206
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,340
Yeah, and he just ordered beer too.

207
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,600
What's wrong with that guy?

208
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,330
He saw that Namhom posted a photo
on Instagram with another man.

209
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,910
Can he still talk coherently?

210
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,690
Not at all.

211
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,340
Mr. Phurit, go comfort him a bit, won't you?

212
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:30,870
No way.

213
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,100
He's too drunk to make sense of anything.

214
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,300
I'd rather just stay here and keep you company.

215
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,510
Alright. Ping, you take it to Phana.

216
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,100
Got it.

217
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,020
Here's your drink, sir.

218
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,500
But I think you've already
had quite a lot today.

219
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,360
Drink with me.

220
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,410
But I'm still working.

221
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,520
This is part of your job.

222
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,330
When a customer tells you to drink, you drink.

223
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,370
Everyone who works in a bar drinks hard.

224
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,680
But if you go around telling customers
they've had too much,

225
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,420
they'll all run off.

226
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,720
Now drink more.

227
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,880
But I still have to take care
of the other tables.

228
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,380
Besides, I'm not here to be a host boy.

229
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,190
Maiaek and others can handle other tables.

230
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,770
Accompanying me and having a drink

231
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,980
doesn't make you a host boy.

232
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,950
You're damn nice, you know that?
I like that.

233
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,260
I think you should take a break, sir.

234
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,490
You think it's hot tonight?

235
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,000
Huh?

236
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,600
You said you wanted a break.

237
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,550
Come on, let's go play in the water.

238
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,770
Wait.

239
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
You can't just go swimming now!

240
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,440
Why not?

241
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,940
You can swim anytime you want!

242
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,010
Huh?

243
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,070
Come on.

244
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,360
Hurry up!

245
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,710
- Oww...
- Move it.

246
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,140
Oh, good evening.

247
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,120
Do you already have a table, miss?

248
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,190
I'm here to see my boyfriend.
He works here.

249
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,600
Huh? Your boyfriend?

250
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,480
Who's your boyfriend?

251
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,540
Boyfriend... Who's that?

252
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,110
Phana!

253
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,660
Oh, Namhom!

254
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:26,880
What brings you here?

255
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,470
Have you seen Phana yet?

256
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,300
If you really want to know, go see for yourself.

257
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,570
Hey, are you okay?

258
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:57,940
Are you okay?

259
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,150
I'm fine.

260
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,290
You monster.

261
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,950
Thanks for helping Phana
and Ping earlier.

262
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,370
You don't know how to swim?

263
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,860
No one born on this island

264
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,540
doesn't know how to swim, Mr. Phurit.

265
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,350
Then why didn't you…?

266
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,730
I was just worried
I wouldn't be able to pull Phana out.

267
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,460
And besides, you were

268
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,710
already in the water helping him.

269
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,820
Mr. Phurit,

270
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,840
do you think Phana and Namhom
will sort things out?

271
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,890
Mm...

272
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,360
Honestly, that doesn't depend only on Namhom.

273
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,550
It depends on Phana too.

274
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,970
Love's complicated, you know.

275
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,470
You talk like someone who's
never been in a relationship.

276
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,800
That's right. I never have.

277
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,220
You? Never been in a relationship?

278
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,170
Surprising?

279
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,300
Yeah, really surprising.

280
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,640
How so?

281
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,040
Well...

282
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,530
Mm...

283
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,300
You seem like a playboy.

284
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,060
I'll admit, I used to be a player.

285
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,020
But being a player doesn't mean
I've ever had a partner.

286
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,250
Anyway, what about you?
How many relationships have you had?

287
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,080
Two.

288
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,360
The first was a friend from school.

289
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,920
The second was a customer
from when the bar first opened.

290
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,720
Both were shallow relationships,
nothing serious.

291
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,040
To really connect with someone,

292
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,380
“liking” them isn't enough.

293
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,910
Thank you
for not shutting yourself off from me.

294
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,690
I wanted to share my experience with
someone who's never had a partner.

295
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,130
Then why don't you become my first?

296
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,260
(Love each other.)

297
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,590
(Complicated.)

298
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,120
(Complicated.)
Didn't you say you'd stop hitting on me?

299
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,270
(My world.)

300
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,140
That's not it.

301
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,990
(A new world together.)

302
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,480
I was just making an offer.

303
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,790
(Couple.)

304
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,030
You said you've stopped being a playboy,

305
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,290
(What is important?)

306
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,180
(What is important?)
but I don't believe that.
(What is important?)

307
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,940
You've got a silver tongue

308
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,810
(as long as we love each other.)
classic flirt behavior.

309
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,700
(underline it as forbidden love.)

310
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,780
(I...)

311
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,970
Slowly, careful, please.

312
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,320
Go on, take him inside first, Lek.

313
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,150
I'll take care of the rest.

314
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:30,730
Yes, ma'am.

315
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,720
Your name's Ping, right?

316
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,370
Yes, ma'am.

317
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,880
Nawa called and told me everything already.

318
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,910
Lek, go back to the bar and help.

319
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,060
Phurit and Nawa close up.

320
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,580
As for Ping, I'll drive him home myself,
no need to waste time.

321
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,760
Thank you, ma'am.

322
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,800
And you go take a shower
and change your clothes,

323
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,060
or you'll catch a cold.

324
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,430
Thank you.

325
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,260
Ugh.

326
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,980
Mr. Phana.

327
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,560
Who the hell are you?

328
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,440
It's me Ping.

329
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,360
And what are you doing here?

330
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,870
I brought you home.

331
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,930
Oh… Get out.
I'm going to take a shower.

332
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,130
Alright.

333
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,320
Come sit with me for a bit.

334
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:19,850
Alright.

335
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,290
I prepared you some milk.

336
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,150
Thank you, ma'am.

337
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,160
Why is your face so red?
Are you feeling unwell?

338
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,310
No, ma'am.

339
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,260
And Phana, is he in the shower already?

340
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,720
Yes, he is.

341
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,850
I'm sorry about what happened.

342
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,260
I heard Phana almost caused you real trouble.

343
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,050
You're interning at the bar, right?

344
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:14,690
Yes, ma'am.

345
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,190
Are your parents from the island?

346
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,350
Having such a hardworking son
they must be so proud of you.

347
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,820
This is all because of you.

348
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,150
Tell me, how am I supposed to tell anyone

349
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,380
if they find out what our son is?

350
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,150
How can I tell people that our son is a freak?

351
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,810
But Ping is our son.

352
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:44,050
If I had a choice, I wouldn't
want a child like this at all!

353
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,280
If you ever need anything,
you can tell me, okay?

354
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,180
Think of me as your second mother.

355
00:26:59,340 --> 00:26:59,980
Thank you, ma'am.

356
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:04,560
But if my son ever bullies you
or does anything wrong,

357
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,300
don't hesitate to tell me,
don't hold back.

358
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:13,060
And at the bar,
please look after him for me.

359
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:17,240
He may look grown up,
but he's still as selfish as a kid.

360
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,810
Go on, eat. It's good, right?

361
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,090
What are you doing here so early?

362
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,720
I came to see you, duh.

363
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,860
I know everything about Namhom now.

364
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,990
Yeah, as you saw,

365
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,020
looks like she's started dating someone else.

366
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,220
You idiot.

367
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,360
I checked for you,

368
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:58,270
the guy in her photos? He likes men.

369
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,250
I swear, you should start eating
grass instead of rice, man.

370
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,520
You serious?

371
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,740
Then I still have a chance!

372
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,710
You didn't know, huh?
Namhom came to see you at the bar.

373
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,810
What did you say?

374
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,040
Damn it.

375
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,540
You came without telling me first.

376
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,230
I wanted to surprise you.

377
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,960
And ended up getting surprised myself.

378
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,650
I'm sorry.

379
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,130
You don't have to apologize.

380
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:09,220
It's not like you
and that boy have anything serious between you.

381
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,340
I should be the one apologizing.

382
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,450
I got angry and misunderstood.

383
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:17,560
I'm sorry.

384
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,270
I'm sorry you had to see me like that.

385
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,570
So what you mean is…

386
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,720
if you'd known I was coming,

387
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,560
you wouldn't have gotten drunk like that?

388
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,150
Yeah.

389
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,120
Actually, I came because
I wanted to talk about

390
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:50,800
our relationship face-to-face.

391
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,230
Yeah, I wanted to talk too.

392
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,990
- I was thinking that...
- Let's break up.

393
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,720
Why would you say that?

394
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,500
You don't love me anymore?

395
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,990
It's not about love, Pana.

396
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,740
You know what?

397
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:27,360
I actually liked it better
when we were apart.

398
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,080
Isn't it strange?

399
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,120
You've thought this through, right?

400
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:38,710
Mm.

401
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,830
I've been thinking about it for a while.

402
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,220
So there's no way to fix things anymore?

403
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,560
We've already tried everything, haven't we?

404
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,070
You know it's not working.

405
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,130
Thank you.

406
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,050
So she dumped you just like that?

407
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,340
What else did she say?

408
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,680
Just that she's made up her mind.

409
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,560
And what did you say back?

410
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,360
Nothing.

411
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,330
I can't change how she feels.

412
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,520
Uh, Mr. Phana, excuse me.

413
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,240
Hey, Ping.

414
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,550
Where's Nawa? Is he here yet?

415
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,830
Not yet, sir.

416
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,170
It's full moon night.
He took the day off today.

417
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,040
For what reason?

418
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,400
Whatever reason he's got,
it's his business, isn't it?

419
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,770
Why does he always take time off
during the full moon, huh?

420
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,470
He did the same thing last time.

421
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,570
Does your brother like going
to full moon parties or what?

422
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,420
Maybe.

423
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,230
Just tell me, where did Nawa go?

424
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,040
Are you hiding something from me?

425
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,510
I'm not in the mood to argue
with you today, man.

426
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,700
If you won't tell me,
I'll just go find him at home myself.

427
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,180
Go ahead.

428
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,350
He's probably with Phraphai by now.

429
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,890
With Phraphai? Where'd they go?

430
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,350
Ugh, damn it, Phu,
wherever they go, it's their business.

431
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,430
You do know that Phraphai's
trying to court your brother, right?

432
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,690
Yeah. So?

433
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,620
So you stop me, your best friend,
from going after him, but you don't stop Phraphai?

434
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,920
And what's wrong with that?

435
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,030
They have been close
since they were kids.

436
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:45,030
If there's anyone who deserves Nawa,

437
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,100
it's Phraphai.

438
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,290
He's the most suitable.

439
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,620
Hey! Phu!

440
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:01,750
Phu!

441
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,450
What the heck?

442
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,030
That's Phraphai's car.

443
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,070
Where are they going?

444
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,970
Nawa, what are you thinking about?

445
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,850
Just looking at the stars.
They're really pretty tonight.

446
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,700
Nawa.

447
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,750
My mom once told me a story,

448
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,330
our world had two moons.

449
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,630
But one of them fell in love with the Sun.

450
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,070
So this moon was very sad.

451
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,660
What happened next?

452
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:56,160
The broken-hearted moon shattered
into millions of tiny pieces,

453
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,130
and became the stars.

454
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,750
That's kind of sad.

455
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:09,970
Regardless,

456
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:15,110
those stars still shine
beside the moon even now.

457
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,370
I saw that necklace design you sketched.

458
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,040
It was so beautiful.

459
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,830
I went and had it made for real.

460
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:52,640
Don't tell me that's why you were late?

461
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,700
You went to pick this up?

462
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,270
If it's around your neck,

463
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,950
it'll look so beautiful.

464
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,760
Nawa, let me put it on you.

465
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,940
It's really as beautiful as I thought.

466
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,430
It's so cute.

467
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:34,450
Thank you so much.

468
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:42,560
Nawa.

469
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,150
There's something I want to tell you.

470
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,040
What is it?

471
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,400
Uh… Well...

472
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,100
I forgot about it, Nawa.

473
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,740
Never mind.

474
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,770
Hey, Phraphai.

475
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,050
You can't just tease me like that

476
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,580
and leave me hanging.

477
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,900
Alright, alright. If I remember,

478
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,420
I'll tell you right away, okay?

479
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,080
Okay.

480
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:07,840
Thanks for driving me home.

481
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:10,070
Mm. Get some rest, alright?

482
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:11,350
I will.
Good night.

483
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:43,770
Mr. Phurit.

484
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,830
I've been sitting outside your house,
drinking and waiting for you.

485
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,480
Huh?

486
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,510
Where have you been?

487
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,460
Where I go is...

488
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,220
I followed you and Phraphai by car.

489
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,650
What did you just say?

490
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,460
But I lost you halfway.

491
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,760
Do you realize

492
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,780
what you did

493
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,290
is a violation of my privacy?

494
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,150
I know.

495
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:27,610
Then why did you do it
if you know it's wrong?

496
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,530
Because I was so damn worried about you.

497
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,990
You're the first person who's ever
made me feel like this,

498
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,630
and since it's my first time.

499
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,350
I don't know how to handle it.

500
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:53,670
When I saw how close you and Phraphai are…

501
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,530
do you know what it did to me?

502
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:06,860
This whole past week,
I've barely been able to think straight.

503
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,740
I keep thinking about you.

504
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,130
Wondering

505
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,100
what you're doing,

506
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:18,990
whether you've eaten,

507
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,720
whether you're sleeping well.

508
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:26,580
I think

509
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,780
I like you more than I can handle.

510
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,350
Phraphai and I have been close
since we were kids.

511
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,830
His family was hosting a dinner tonight,

512
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,470
so he came to pick me up.

513
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,250
That's all there is to it.

514
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,110
Are you satisfied now?

515
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,090
Don't ever do something like this again,

516
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,090
understand?

517
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:18,730
Yes.

518
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,560
Now go home.

519
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,140
I don't think I can.

520
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:37,850
Because I'm really drunk right now.

521
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,200
Right.

522
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:50,500
Then I'll grab you a towel
so you can take a shower.

523
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,130
Can you at least tell me

524
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,490
that you feel something for me?

525
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:12,830

Mr. Phurit.

Do you have business with Nawa
this early in the morning?

00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,730
I'm an impatient person.

Excuse me, Mr. Phana.

Nawa, why did you do this?

577
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,360
If what you're about to say is a lie,

578
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:32,930
you don't have to say it.

579
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,780

Nawa, you know humans are greedy.

581
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,310
Whatever happens, tell Phraphai.

584
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,110
no human truly loves us.
