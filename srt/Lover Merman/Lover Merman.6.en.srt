"Lover Merman"
(Episode 6)

25
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,740
(Previously)
Will you be my boyfriend?

26
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,580
Alright. Let's date.

27
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,340
If anything happens to you again,

28
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,970
you must tell me right away.

29
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,770
I understand

30
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,480
how you feel.

31
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,110
If something bad ever happened
to my dearest brother,

32
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,050
I'd feel the same way too.

33
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,700
We grew up together, Than.

34
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,670
If dad finds out,
do you think he could ever accept it?

35
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,300
Because what I'm going to do…

36
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,030
is keep loving you.

37
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,590
Because I don't know
if I can love again

38
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,120
if it's not you.

39
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,170
I know you've been investigating
the concession issue and the mermen-hunting group.

40
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,570
Drop it.

41
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,780
Why?

42
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,200
I'll handle it myself.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,070
You meddling in something you
barely understand

44
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,850
will only cause trouble for me.

45
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,480
It's just ever since I moved here,

46
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,020
I've never once seen Nava work
at the shop on a full moon day.

47
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,610
I just saw another merman swimming
toward the other side.

48
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,770
Should we go check it out?

49
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,710
I want to know who it is.

50
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,150
If we don't meet in the water,
we'd never know.

51
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,070
I've had a feeling since the first time
I met you, Ping,

52
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,400
I'm half-blood.

53
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,260
My parents fell in love before

54
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,380
my mom knew my dad was a merman.

55
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,890
You're staying here tonight?

56
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm just keeping my promise.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,340
(Phraphai)

58
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,060
It's not just a near miss,

59
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,350
I think I'm about to collide with you for real.

60
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,330
The past month,
customer numbers have gone up a lot.

61
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,050
I think we should increase our stock

62
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,610
of alcohol, we're running out fast.

63
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:39,840
Yeah, sure.

64
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,270
I'll talk to the supplier
from the mainland myself.

65
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,710
Mm.

66
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,740
What about the food supplies,
what do you think?

67
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,740
We should increase those too,

68
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,810
but check ingredient prices carefully,

69
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,390
otherwise, we'll end up with a loss.

70
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,340
Yeah, I'll handle that at the market.

71
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,000
Let's stick to the plan then.

72
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,850
Okay, I'll get going then.

73
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,010
Yeah.

74
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,660
Do you want some orange cake?

75
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,290
Aunty Son said it's your favorite.

76
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,590
No thanks.

77
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,900
I heard you're going to
restock the bar today,

78
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,090
want me to come help?

79
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,020
No need. I can handle it myself.

80
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,870
Are you okay, Phana?

81
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,500
What do you mean?

82
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,550
It's just the past few days,

83
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,520
it seems like you don't
really want to talk to me.

84
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,130
Did I do something that upset you?

85
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:52,940
Ping,

86
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,020
I think we should keep some distance for now.

87
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,760
I feel like we've gotten too close.

88
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,850
I'm worried about what people might think.

89
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,950
Who would think badly of us?

90
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,150
You and Nava

91
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,000
are close too, right? Like siblings.

92
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,270
Nava and I grew up together.

93
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,450
But you,

94
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,930
you're my employee, and I'm your boss.

95
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,050
I don't understand.

96
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,280
Bosses and employees don't usually
act this close in front of others.

97
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,240
I haven't done anything special for anyone else,

98
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,650
so why should I treat you any differently?

99
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,110
So in the past, you do think

100
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,700
I'm special, right?

101
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,410
No. I never thought that.

102
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,530
The reason we got too close was

103
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,370
because I'd just broken up with Namhom.

104
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,530
I was lonely, that's all.

105
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,480
Then let me ask you directly.

106
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,880
What do you feel about me, Phana?

107
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,530
I don't know.

108
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,090
How do you feel about me?

109
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,000
To me,

110
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,900
you're more than just a boss.

111
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,490
But I'm sorry...

112
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,420
for crossing the line too much.

113
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,030
Hey, what's wrong with you, Phana?

114
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:05,950
Nothing.

115
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,130
I'm just spacing out.

116
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,400
You're like this because of Ping, isn't it?

117
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,580
I talked to him about keeping some distance.

118
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,490
But I don't know if I did the right thing

119
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,490
saying that to him.

120
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,370
Didn't you say you wanted to

121
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,360
recheck your own feelings first?

122
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,020
Yeah,

123
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,380
but I still don't know how I feel.

124
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,760
The only thing I know is that

125
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,400
Ping already caught feelings,

126
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,430
and I know

127
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,280
I accidentally ended up hurting him.

128
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,200
The worst part is,

129
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,320
I don't even know

130
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,620
how I feel about him.

131
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,220
Or if maybe,

132
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,260
like you said, I was just trying to
use him to replace Namhom.

133
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,430
Maybe

134
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,310
I don't really want Ping after all..

135
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,230
It's not wrong to feel that way right now.

136
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,440
But I think

137
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,970
you should give yourself a bit more time.

138
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,640
Once you're sure of what you feel,

139
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,060
then decide what to do next.

140
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,800
Yeah, you're probably right.

141
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,550
I really haven't figured it out yet.

142
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,990
Mr. Phurich, I suddenly have a fever.

143
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,160
I'll head home early today.

144
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,910
Is anything up?

145
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,380
I'm home, Mom.

146
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,280
I brought you some snacks.

147
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,630
I'll leave them in the kitchen, okay?

148
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,030
Aren't you supposed to be doing your internship?
Why did you come back?

149
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,680
Don't tell me people already found out

150
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,320
you're a monster.

151
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,750
If they find out what our son is,

152
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,540
what am I supposed to tell them?
That my son's a freak?

153
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,160
But Ping is our child.

154
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,510
If I had a choice,
I wouldn't have a kid like this at all!

155
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,160
Phana,

156
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,780
I'd like to take another sick day.

157
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,020
I already messaged Mr. Phurich,

158
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,870
but since he's gone to the mainland,

159
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,290
he told me to let you know myself.

160
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,180
Have you taken your medicine yet?

161
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,960
Phana, are you okay?

162
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,730
You look really stressed.

163
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,010
Oh, just now, Ping texted me.
He asked for another day off.

164
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,380
You and Ping don't have any issues, right?

165
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,510
Why? Did you hear something?

166
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,470
I can tell just by looking
at your face, Phana.

167
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,150
It's nothing serious.

168
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,220
I just…
don't really know what I'm feeling.

169
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,670
I don't know

170
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,840
what's going on between you
and Ping right now,

171
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,290
but I don't want to see you

172
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,060
all sad alone like this.

173
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,540
If there's anything I can do to help,

174
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,620
please tell me, okay?

175
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,440
Thanks.

176
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,720
Hello, Phana.

177
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,650
Oh, Phraphai,

178
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,460
what brings you here today?
You even came to my shop.

179
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,680
I have something to discuss with you and Nava.

180
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,700
You sound serious.

181
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,440
A little, yes.

182
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,760
Alright, I'll get straight to the point.

183
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,860
You've heard about the mermen sea
concession, right?

184
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,820
Yeah, I've heard some.

185
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,200
Right now, humans have started
hunting mermen on the island.

186
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,800
Several have been kidnapped…

187
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,690
some even killed.

188
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,800
My father and I are investigating it.

189
00:16:59,300 --> 00:16:59,980
And we suspect...

190
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,570
it's linked to

191
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,100
human encroachment into the mermen territory.

192
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,080
So you're saying...

193
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,670
what happened 20 years ago

194
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,350
might be happening again?

195
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,330
Possibly.

196
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,770
I can't confirm it 100 percent yet,

197
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,680
the evidence isn't strong enough.

198
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,370
But the incident

199
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,060
has already caused fear among
the mermen on the island.

200
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,300
When this happens,

201
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,020
I don't feel safe at all.

202
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,980
Especially when it comes to Nava.

203
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,660
Phana,

204
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,320
that's why I came here to talk,

205
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:33,510
from now on,

206
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,320
I'll personally take charge
of Nava's safety.

207
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,620
My safety? What do you mean, Phraphai?

208
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,640
Nava, from now on

209
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,630
I'll take you to and from work.

210
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,910
If you need to go anywhere, tell me.

211
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,740
And at night,

212
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,720
I'll have Met watch over you.

213
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,790
Why does it sound like

214
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,380
I'm being put on probation or something?

215
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,330
Nava,

216
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,230
please understand.

217
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,130
I'm only doing this

218
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,980
for your safety.

219
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,890
Don't forget,

220
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,320
the one who suffered from
what happened 20 years ago

221
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,140
was you.

222
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,580
I don't want anything bad to happen
to you again.

223
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,480
But...

224
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,510
I think we should do as Phraphai says.

225
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,750
I don't want to see you hurt again.

226
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,910
Phraphai, please take good care of him.

227
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,180
Of course.

228
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,940
Then I'll come by tonight to pick you up.

229
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:46,740
Nava.

230
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,010
I'm really worried about you.

231
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,330
I'll go now.

232
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,830
I'll take my leave, Phana.

233
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,520
Nava,

234
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,320
I want to ask you something directly

235
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,090
about Phurich.

236
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,110
Please answer truthfully,

237
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,980
what exactly is your relationship

238
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,380
with him now?

239
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,340
We're dating.

240
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,260
I know mermen shouldn't get
involved with humans,

241
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,120
especially romantically,

242
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,300
it's forbidden.

243
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,020
But as...

244
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,920
a being with a heart just like humans,

245
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,050
I want to follow my own feelings.

246
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,200
I understand.

247
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,320
But please,

248
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,730
listen to me and Phraphai.

249
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,800
At least, I want you

250
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,660
to listen to Phraphai first.

251
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,590
Until we're sure you're truly safe.

252
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:17,920
Okay?

253
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:32,740
Nava,

254
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,880
let's go home.

255
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,640
Uh… Mr. Phurich.

256
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,270
- You see...
- Nava.

257
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,540
I'm here to pick you up.

258
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,010
What's that supposed to mean?

259
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,460
It's a personal matter.

260
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,510
I don't owe you an explanation.

261
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,670
Let's go, Nava, I'll take you home.

262
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,670
What's going on, Nava?

263
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,320
I'm sorry.

264
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,430
Everything that's happening...

265
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,850
I truly can't explain to you.

266
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,780
But I promise,

267
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,380
once everything settles down,

268
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,560
I'll tell you everything myself.

269
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,090
You already knew, didn't you?

270
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,860
Why are you doing this, huh?

271
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,070
You've got Phraphai picking Nava up
and dropping him off every day,

272
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,990
even have people guard his house.

273
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,080
What game are you playing?

274
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,980
Trust me, Phu.

275
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:00,880
Phraphai and I have a reason.

276
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,670
What reason?

277
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,140
Or are you just trying
to keep me and Nava apart?

278
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,540
Calm the hell down, man.

279
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,100
Then why are you doing this?

280
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,850
You're acting like Nava's in danger.

281
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,740
Exactly.

282
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,990
Everything we're doing is to protect him.

283
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,660
What do you mean?

284
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,320
Who's trying to hurt him?

285
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,040
Calm down.

286
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,780
Listen carefully, Phu.

287
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,060
Right now,

288
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,480
no one's done anything to Nava yet.

289
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,030
But something could happen.

290
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,090
On this island,

291
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,550
there are still
a lot of complicated things going on

292
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,890
and I can't tell you everything.

293
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,980
All I'm asking is

294
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,150
trust me,

295
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,530
and trust Nava.

296
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,480
That's all.

297
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,780
Then why does it have to be Phraphai?

298
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,060
Why can't you and I protect him together?

299
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,950
You're like his real brother, right?

300
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,520
Oh, Phu…

301
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,760
I don't know how to explain this to you.

302
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,960
Hello, Phana.

303
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,110
How's your condition?

304
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,310
Still not much better.

305
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,590
Do you need anything else?

306
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,460
I can ask Lek to bring it to the resort for you.

307
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,320
I already came home two or three days ago.

308
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,460
I'm not at the resort anymore.

309
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,110
You're not trying to avoid me, are you?

310
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,630
If I said yes,

311
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,270
that I really am avoiding you,

312
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,280
what would you do?

313
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,680
Wouldn't you feel anything at all?

314
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,150
I...

315
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,680
I don't know.

316
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,030
Phana,

317
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,700
I'd like to resign.

318
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,760
Please take this as official notice.

319
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,820
And what about your internship, Ping?

320
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,780
If you don't complete it,
how are you going to graduate?

321
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,490
Did you think about yourself
making such decision?

322
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,940
Why do you want to know?

323
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,720
You always say, “I don't know.”

324
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,490
I'm just one of your subordinates.

325
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,000
So please, stop caring.

326
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,320
Yeah, fine.

327
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,340
If that's what you think is best,
do whatever you want.

328
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,920
Go wherever you want.

329
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,520
I don't care anymore.

330
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,830
Alright. Bye.

331
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:25,910
Haven't seen you in a while.

332
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,110
Oh, Silp! Hello.

333
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,980
Mind if I join you for a drink?

334
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,140
Of course not. Is this table okay?

335
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,350
- Okay.
- Please take a seat.

336
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,740
What would you like to drink?

337
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,400
Brandy for me, please.

338
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,860
Maiaek.

339
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:48,260
Yes?

340
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,030
One glass of brandy.

341
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,590
Got it.

342
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,320
So, how are you adjusting

343
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,920
to life on Khen Island?

344
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,700
If we're talking about daily life,

345
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,600
I'm doing fine.

346
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,120
But if it's about understanding this place,

347
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:06,830
not quite yet.

348
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,550
What do you mean?

349
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,230
I don't know.

350
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,300
I just feel like…

351
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,440
- Here you go.
- Please drink.

352
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,200
Brandy, sir.

353
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,650
- Thank you.
- Yes.

354
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,870
There's something strange about this island,

355
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,060
the stories, the people,

356
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,470
the things that happen that I don't understand.

357
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:37,780
It's like everyone's hiding something

358
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,820
from outsiders.

359
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,060
Sometimes not knowing certain things

360
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,010
is better.

361
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,500
Like I once told you, this island

362
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,300
isn't really suited for newcomers.

363
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,290
That's probably true.

364
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:04,600
Since I arrived,
everything's been filled with secrets,

365
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,760
and that mermen legend.

366
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,620
Didn't you say

367
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,530
you didn't believe in mermen legends?

368
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,600
Well, I wouldn't say I don't believe.

369
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,700
It's just that those stories keep
finding their way into my life,

370
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,980
and it's hard to ignore them now.

371
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:28,870
Then let me

372
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,940
tell you a little tale about Khen Island.

373
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:39,080
Originally, this place had another name,

374
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,160
The Island of the Moon.

375
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,340
It was home to a race of

376
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,730
beings we call mermen.

377
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,010
Normally, they live in the sea.

378
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,080
When they're under the water,

379
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,080
their lower bodies

380
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,950
covered in scales and tails like fish.

381
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,290
But when they step onto land,

382
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,550
they appear completely human.

383
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:08,280
Yet, they have one restriction.

384
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,570
What is it?

385
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,680
If they stay in human form

386
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,400
for too long,

387
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,180
marks begin to appear on their bodies,

388
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,170
like tattoos.

389
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,630
Before the full moon night.

390
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,550
Oh?

391
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,510
So you've heard about this before?

392
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,870
Just a little.

393
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:31,720
Good.

394
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,380
Those marks I mentioned are a warning.

395
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,510
It means their blood is turning poisonous.

396
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,930
And during that time,

397
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,160
they must not mate with anyone.

398
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,240
They have to dive deep into the ocean

399
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,100
on the night of the full moon

400
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,140
and cleanse their blood with coral.

401
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,760
If they don't,

402
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,650
they'll be trapped in mermen form forever.

403
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:01,670
In the old days,

404
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,490
the mermen lived peacefully here.

405
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,310
Until humans began settling on the island,

406
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,970
At first, both sides

407
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,690
coexisted peacefully.

408
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,400
But as time has passed,

409
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,180
as greed and desire grew,

410
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,400
humans began hunting mermen

411
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:25,740
for greed, for beauty, or anything,

412
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,160
Hundreds were killed

413
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,250
and disappeared forever.

414
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,850
After that, mermen and humans

415
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,110
could never live together again.

416
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,490
Those who survived

417
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,060
gathered together to resist humans.

418
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,680
But in the end,

419
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,670
they swore never to reveal themselves

420
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,660
to humans again.

421
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,040
So, that means

422
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,110
there are no mermen living among humans anymore?

423
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,890
Actually,
to say that might not be entirely correct.

424
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,160
Because we don't know who the mermen are.

425
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:09,420
Maybe even mermaids themselves can't
tell who among them is one.

426
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,750
Have you ever seen one, then?

427
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,060
For this question,

428
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,790
I'll answer that question the day you truly

429
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,620
believe mermen exist.

430
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,230
Yes.

431
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,390
Mr. Phraphai, you also drink here?

432
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,380
Oh, no. I'm here to pick up Nava.

433
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,150
It just so happens that
this area isn't very safe.

434
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,000
Nava.

435
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,380
You know him too?

436
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,880
He's the son of the island's head chief.

437
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,680
Everyone here knows who he is.

438
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:13,420
Except you, apparently.

439
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,600
- Are you done?
- Yes, all done.

440
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,320
Then shall we head home?

441
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:22,990
Sure.

442
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,080
Silp, I'll get going now.

443
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,680
Let's go.

444
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,950
Goodbye, Mr. Phurich.

445
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,750
See you later.

446
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,490
Let's go.

447
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,010
You and that boy…

448
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,850
You're not just employer and employee, are you?

449
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:45,980
No.

450
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,410
Drop me off here.

451
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,530
Goodbye, Silp. And thanks.

452
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,940
Is something wrong with you?

453
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,240
You've been staying home for three weeks now.

454
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,870
The place you're interning for wouldn't
let you take that long of a break, yes?

455
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,950
I quit, Mom.

456
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,700
Actually... I'm thinking of taking a leave
from school this semester.

457
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,980
But don't worry about the tuition.

458
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,830
I still have some savings.

459
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,440
So they all know now, don't they?

460
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,370
That you're a monster.

461
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,740
Monster this,

462
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,140
monster that.

463
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,940
The “monster” you're talking about

464
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,630
he's still your son.

465
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,530
Can I ask you something straight?

466
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,410
Since the day I was born,

467
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,220
have you ever loved me?

468
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,050
Then I guess I've been right all along.

469
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,810
Because you've never

470
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,140
really seen me as your son, have you?

471
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,020
Do you think I had a choice?

472
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,510
I didn't!

473
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,200
It hurts every time

474
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,670
I remember that my own child isn't human!

475
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,400
And what about me, Mom?

476
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,960
You think I had a choice?

477
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,850
I didn't.

478
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,210
If you hate me that much,

479
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,700
why don't you just kill me?

480
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,730
If I walk out of your life right now,

481
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,110
will that make you happy?

482
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,600
Go wherever you want.

483
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,560
I don't want anything to do with you anymore.

484
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:06,980
Nava,

485
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,910
your brother isn't here
to watch over you today?

486
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,790
He had something to take care of.

487
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,510
He'll probably be late.

488
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,060
How long are we supposed to stay like this?

489
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,230
It's been almost three weeks already.

490
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:26,920
We're lovers, you know?

491
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,830
Don't you miss me at all?

492
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,020
Of course I do.

493
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,900
I miss you a lot.

494
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,030
I just don't know what I should do.

495
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,980
Please try to understand me.

496
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:47,500
And what about you,

497
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,100
do you understand me?

498
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,070
I know how suffocating this must feel for you.

499
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,160
But I feel the same way.

500
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,720
Then why do you keep choosing to do
what others tell you,

501
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,550
without caring how we feel?

502
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:14,790
I'm sorry.

503
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,220
I guess I haven't done enough for you.

504
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,590
It's not really your fault.

505
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,660
It's just I miss you so much

506
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,740
that I don't know what to do anymore.

507
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:35,260
We see each other every day,

508
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,400
yet it feels like we're drifting further apart.

509
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:43,620
I'm sorry.

510
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:51,840
Nava.

511
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,540
You're done, right?

512
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,490
Let me just take these things back inside first.

513
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,860
Alright. I'll wait here then.

514
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,050
I know how suffocating this must feel for you.

515
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,970
But I feel the same way.

516
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,960
Then why do you keep choosing to do
what others tell you,

517
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,720
without caring how we feel?

518
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,110
May 14, 2018.

519
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,710
Mom seemed to be in a really good mood today.

520
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:53,100
Maybe it's because one of her
favorite movies was on TV.

521
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,670
It's the first time in years
I've seen her smile.

522
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,040
I'm so happy.

523
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,230
June 29, 2020

524
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,160
I got into university! I'm so excited.

525
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,590
Pitupong.

526
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,490
How should I tell Mom?

527
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,640
Will she be happy?

528
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,130
If she's happy,

529
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,090
maybe she'll accidentally hug me.

530
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,500
February 9, 2024

531
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,400
If I could make just one wish…

532
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,480
I wish I could eat dinner
with Mom happily just once.

533
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:36,810
Nava.

534
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:48,940
Are you sure it's okay

535
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,180
for you to sneak out at this hour?

536
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,480
If Phraphai finds out, then it's not okay.

537
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,530
But I couldn't stand missing you anymore.

538
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,220
I still want to be with you.

539
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,820
Even if I can't tell you everything yet,

540
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:22,730
I promise that

541
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,980
when things finally settle down,

542
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,080
I'll tell you everything myself.

543
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,750
I'll be honest,

544
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,130
it hurts every time I'm kept in the dark.

545
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,300
But what hurts even more…

546
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,800
is seeing you every day and barely

547
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:45,710
being able to be near you.

548
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,710
I don't want anything else

549
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:55,080
just you.

Phu,

559
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,930
Nava's at your house, right?

560
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:29,470
Come out.

561
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,370
Phraphai and I are at your door.

562
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:42,790
What's going on?

563
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:44,910
You've got some nerve asking that.

564
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:46,200
Nava.

565
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,250
You were the one who told him
to run away, weren't you?

566
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,020
Phraphai, I...

567
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,420
I came to see Phurich on my own.

568
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:01,590
Nava,

569
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,530
we already talked about this.

570
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,060
I'm only doing this

571
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,100
to keep you safe.

572
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,060
You know how dangerous this is.

573
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:13,900
That's right, Nava.

574
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,140
We're only worried about you.

575
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,220
But I feel trapped.

576
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,160
I'm suffocating living like this.

577
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,710
Nava,
I know you're feeling uncomfortable.

578
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:29,450
But I have to do this.

579
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:31,900
It's for your safety.

580
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,830
This isn't a game, Nava.

581
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:36,520
Otherwise, I wouldn't have let
Phraphai go this far.

582
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,360
I'm sorry,

583
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,360
but can someone tell me

584
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,190
what's going on?

585
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:50,250
You're all acting like
someone's trying to kidnap him.

586
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,610
If there's something going on,
shouldn't you just tell me directly?

587
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,020
Shut it.
This has nothing to do with you.

588
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:00,240
Or maybe there's nothing going on.

589
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,190
Maybe you're just trying to keep us apart.

590
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:05,180
Is that all you can do?

591
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:09,250
If that's all you've got,
then that's just pathetic.

592
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:10,800
I'm about to lose my patience.

593
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,150
You're an outsider, get out of here.

594
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,040
Scram!

595
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,150
- Phraphai!
- Hey!

596
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:16,580
Phu, calm down.

597
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:22,850
Phraphai, please stop.

598
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,480
Nava, let's go home.

599
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,920
I can't let you stay with someone like him.

600
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,720
If you walk away with him right now,

601
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:45,720
you'll never see me again.

602
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,950
I've had enough of this!

603
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,710
Can I talk to you Phraphai alone?

604
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,220
I'm sorry, Phraphai,
for talking to you this way…

605
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,530
But right now, I'm dating Mr. Phurich.

606
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:45,710
I've fallen in love with him.

607
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,720
I know

608
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,440
everything you've done was for my sake,

609
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,830
but if you really care about me…

610
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,800
please let me follow my heart.

611
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:10,340
Mm.

612
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:13,280
Nava.

613
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:20,650
After hearing that, what else can I say?

614
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:29,310
What I said might sound selfish,

615
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,620
but it's how I truly feel.

616
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,100
So you've chosen to be with Mr. Phurich?

617
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:49,980
Yes.

618
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,730
What about tonight, then?

619
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,140
We still have to cleanse the poison together.

620
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:08,490
I'll do it myself tonight.

621
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,790
You don't have to worry.

622
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:48,960
Thank you for understanding me.

623
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:52,600
Alright we'll talk later.

624
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:55,160
I just need to take this call.

625
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,410
Sure.

626
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:43,480
Yes.

627
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:04,890
Met, get in the car.

628
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:08,260
Hey! Phraphai! What's going on? Wait!

629
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:09,680
Phraphai!

630
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:22,770
What did you just say, Lek?

631
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,340
Huh?

632
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,250
Who came looking for me?

633
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:42,720
Dad!

634
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:46,840
Dad!

635
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:48,860
Dad!

636
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:50,910
Dad!

637
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,990
Who did this to you? Who?

638
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,220
Was it the humans?

639
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,630
I'll handle this myself.

640
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,130
(Love each other.)

641
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,800
(Complicated.)

642
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:56,280
(My world.)

643
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,920
(A new world together.)

644
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:04,140
(Couple.)

645
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,780
(What is important?)

646
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,160
Mom.

647
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,760
(Next Episode)

648
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:13,660
There's something I need to tell you, ma'am.

649
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,300
I'm in love with your son.

650
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:20,910
There's something important I have to say.

651
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,440
From now on,

652
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,000
Nava won't be working here anymore.

653
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:27,100
And as for you, stay away from him,

654
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:29,360
or I'll make sure you regret it.

655
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:32,660
I can't lose someone I love again

656
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,570
especially you, Nava.

657
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:40,160
I promise I'll protect you
with everything I have.

658
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,370
From now on, I'll go with you.

659
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:46,980
Phurich, I get how you feel.

660
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:48,940
But you need to calm down first, man.

661
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:51,870
Get back!

662
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:52,950
Phraphai.

663
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:55,320
They're going to kill Nava.

664
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:01,500
