"Lover Merman"
(Episode 8)

25
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,510
(Previously)
Who did this to you?

26
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,770
Who?

27
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,090
The one who killed your father
was a merman.

28
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,890
There's something you should know…

29
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,970
about what happened 20 years ago.

30
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,240
If I don't see Ping tonight…

31
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,760
I'll never see him again.

32
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,810
Is Ping a merman?

33
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,790
I'm sorry, Ping.

34
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,660
That you're not a replacement for anyone.

35
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,680
But because…

36
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,320
I really do love you.

37
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,740
You're going to kill Nawa.

38
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,900
When he saw what we really are,

39
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,400
he was terrified.

40
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,980
He looked at us like we were monsters.

41
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,950
So from now on, I'll live with you.

42
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,980
After everything,

43
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,860
Nawa's decided he won't hide
his identity anymore.

44
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,930
And you...
But from now on, let's live separately.

45
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,570
Stay out of Nawa's life.

46
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,770
If you don't, I'll collide into you.

47
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,940
It's been a few days now.

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,810
How have you been, Mr. Phurit?

49
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,720
Longing.

50
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,240
If Nawa had a choice,

51
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,870
he'd still want to live his life with you.

52
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,340
Thank you, Ping.
You made me realize something.

53
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:24,980
Silp.

54
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:26,760
Mr. Phurit.

55
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:28,980
What's the matter?

56
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,710
I believe it now that mermen really exist.

57
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,160
Silp, could you tell me if you've ever

58
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,810
met a mermaid before?

59
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,930
Where did you see one?

60
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,770
Please tell me.

61
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,570
It's really important to my life.

62
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,990
You know Phraphai, right?

63
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,220
Do you know where his house is?

64
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,830
The thing you're so distressed about…

65
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,540
it's about that boy named Nawa, yes?

66
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,580
What I fear the most is

67
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,830
a deep relationship between
a human and a merman.

68
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,060
Silp, you know that Nawa is...

69
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,960
Please, sit down.

70
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,390
That scale you once asked me about,

71
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,410
it was the mermen scale of someone I loved.

72
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,200
When I was about your age,

73
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,270
I was someone with courage,

74
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,240
dreams, and love.

75
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,220
I fell in love with a merman,

76
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,800
and I truly believed with all my heart

77
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,250
that we could be together.

78
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,580
Our difference in species

79
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,740
didn't matter to me at all.

80
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,950
(20 years ago)

81
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,130
Silp, are you sure about meeting my parents?

82
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,880
Yeah. They need to know that

83
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,550
we love each other.

84
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,680
I'll make your parents accept me.

85
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,250
Whether merman or human,

86
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,560
we all have the same heart.

87
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,170
I believe your parents will understand.

88
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,080
And after that, we'll open that café

89
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,730
we dreamed about together.

90
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,020
- Honey!
- Silp!

91
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,080
A human and a merman can't love each other!

92
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,750
You know full well

93
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,080
humans are hunting our kind

94
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,140
and you still insist on loving one of them?

95
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,250
Both humans and mermen

96
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,230
have good and bad people.

97
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,940
I've never wanted to harm Vee,

98
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,760
nor take advantage of him in any way.

99
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,760
You're too naïve, boy.

100
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,150
What you said proves

101
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,180
you don't understand anything at all.

102
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,480
This world isn't just the two of you!

103
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,200
I love Vee. No matter what happens,
I won't stop loving him.

104
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,350
And I'll protect him from everything.

105
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,010
If you won't listen,

106
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,110
then I'll kill you right here and now!

107
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,290
- Dad, no!
- Honey, calm down!

108
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,380
This? This is the person
who claims he'll protect my son?

109
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,550
Pathetic.

110
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,860
Silp, let's leave here.

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,600
Vee!

112
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,210
Go report this to the headman.

113
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,410
Tell him to bring our son back.

114
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,390
Are you still thinking about what Dad said?

115
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,880
Don't worry about it.

116
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,000
I know you can protect me.

117
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,080
And I'll protect you too.

118
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,380
We're a couple, we help each other.

119
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,480
I can't let you be the only one
taking care of me.

120
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,170
Thank you for staying by my side.

121
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,140
What's this? What the hell?

122
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,630
This the one you said is the merman?

123
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,780
Yeah. That's him. No mistake.

124
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,220
Vee! Run!

125
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:36,520
Go!

126
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,630
Hey! No! Don't!

127
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,420
A monster

128
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,450
like this doesn't deserve a human.

129
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,010
Let's go!

130
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,310
Vee.

131
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:56,880
Vee!

132
00:07:59,390 --> 00:07:59,990
Vee!

133
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,390
Vee!

134
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:02,920
Vee!

135
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,130
Stay with me!

136
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,200
I'll take you to the hospital right now!

137
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,990
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

138
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,170
Why are you apologizing?

139
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,090
You didn't do anything wrong.

140
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,480
Don't blame yourself.

141
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,550
You once said you

142
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,040
liked me when I was in my merman form.

143
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,570
I was saving it for the day we opened our café.

144
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,740
But I guess I have to give it to you now instead…

145
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,070
I love you so much, Silp.

146
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,370
Vee!

147
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,220
Vee! Stay with me.

148
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,490
Vee!

149
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,510
Vee!

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,590
Vee! Stay with me!

151
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,890
Vee! Talk to me! Vee!

152
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,180
Vee, please stay with me!

153
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,780
Vee!

154
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,840
When humans and mermen
get involved with each other,

155
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,030
it only leads to tragedies
that repeat endlessly.

156
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,080
That's why I want you to let this go.

157
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,210
I understand how hard it is…

158
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,700
but it's what's best for you
and for that boy.

159
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,760
You want me to just give up like this?

160
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,850
After that incident,

161
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,210
I tried to investigate the people
who killed my lover…

162
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,200
and I found the truth.

163
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,690
Everything Vee's father once said was true.

164
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,730
This world isn't just about me and Vee.

165
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,490
There are many people

166
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,710
who refuse to let humans and mermen
love each other.

167
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,470
And that is the real reason

168
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,230
humans and mermen can never be together.

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,170
What truth?

170
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,420
20 years ago,

171
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,180
there really was a group hunting mermen
on Khen island.

172
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,820
And the one behind everything…

173
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,880
was headman Chan, Phraphai's father.

174
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,090
Why?

175
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,360
Why would he do that?

176
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,190
To show all mermen how disgusting
humans supposedly are.

177
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,740
Then he played the hero,

178
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,560
so they'd obey him unquestioningly.

179
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,480
Especially his command to never get
involved with humans again.

180
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,140
And I believe Phraphai

181
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,860
thinks exactly the same way as his father.

182
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,330
Then I have to bring Nawa back.

183
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,100
If Nawa and I truly can't be together,

184
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,930
then that decision should be ours

185
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,150
not anyone else's.

186
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,930
You really think this problem

187
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,640
is that simple to fix?

188
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,190
I know how big this is.

189
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,450
But living while feeling like

190
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,720
you're already dead…

191
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,540
That's even worse.

192
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,530
I know you understand

193
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,130
how I feel.

194
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,970
I have to bring Nawa back,

195
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,540
even if it costs me my life.

196
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,550
And I'll prove to you that

197
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,080
love can happen between anyone,

198
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,420
human, mermen,

199
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,410
whatever.

200
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,560
Love doesn't need conditions.

201
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,050
You're right.

202
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,830
What I couldn't do,

203
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,650
maybe you can.

204
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,920
Phraphai's home is in the mermen village.

205
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,980
Take a boat west.

206
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,790
Go far. You'll find it.

207
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,780
Why the hell are you here?

208
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,930
I know everything.

209
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,710
Where did you take Nawa?

210
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,460
You really want to know?

211
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,080
Then step over my dead body first.

212
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,490
Tell me where Nawa is!

213
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:21,670
Get up here!

214
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:33,480
I'm sorry, Nawa…
This is as far as I could go…

215
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,550
Nawa.

216
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,560
Nawa.

Mr. Phurit! Mr. Phurit!

264
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,350
I heard a human trespassed into mermen territory.

265
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,300
Grandpa Samut, please help Mr. Phurit!

266
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,080
I don't know what's happening to him!

267
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,900
This man has been poisoned by mermen.

268
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,140
Does that mean he's going to die?

269
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,180
At this rate, yes.

270
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,660
What do I do?

271
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,100
To save him,

272
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,620
he must drink blood from a merman's heart.

273
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:21,540
I understand.

274
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:22,830
Mr. Phurit…

275
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:24,960
I'll save you, Mr. Phurit!

276
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,650
He's your lover?

00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:43,960
Mr. Phurit! Mr. Phurit!

278
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,140

279
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,420

00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,140
Mr. Phurit!

287
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,580
Stop! Stop the car!

288
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,520
- Please help my friend!
- Hey, kid.

289
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,950
Is he okay?

290
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,860
My friend is really sick.

291
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,020
Please take us to my house!

292
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,080
He looks seriously ill.
Shouldn't we take him to the hospital?

293
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,010
Please just take us home.

294
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,700
Alright, get in! I'll take you!

295
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,810
- Careful!
- Let's go!

296
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,030
- Careful, please.
- Why is he burning up?

297
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,000
Gently!

298
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,190
Mr. Phurit! Mr. Phurit!

299
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,670
Do you know how I've lived?

300
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,050
Aimlessly.

301
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,360
Working as a bartender every night,

302
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,560
going home,

303
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,050
hiding who I am

304
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,580
because I was terrified people would
learn I'm a merman.

305
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,050
But since you came into my life…

306
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,820
my boring days were filled with smiles.

307
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,210
No matter how much I ran from you…

308
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,080
you never gave up.

309
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,860
You made me brave enough to be myself.

310
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,540
Do you know?

311
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,850
Your love

312
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,450
gave meaning to my life.

313
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,900
I hope what I'm about to do

314
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,030
can repay the love you've given me.

315
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,500
I love you, Mr. Phurit.

316
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,320
Mr. Phurit.

317
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,080
I love you, Mr. Phurit.

318
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,590
Goodbye, Mr. Phurit.

319
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,780
Nawa!

320
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:41,230
- Hey! What the hell are you doing?
- Let go!

321
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,870
You're going to sacrifice yourself for him?

322
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,300
Are you insane?

323
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,890
I'm going to save Mr. Phurit!

324
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,800
Stop talking nonsense.

325
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,810
I'm not letting you die!

326
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,950
I'm not letting Mr. Phurit die either!

327
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,320
You'd rather kill yourself just to save him?

328
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,920
What the hell are you thinking?

329
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,990
It's the only way he'll live!

330
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,610
I'm doing it!

331
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,780
I know if a human gets merman poison,

332
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,400
the only cure

333
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,520
is merman heart-blood.

334
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,340
Let go!

335
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,450
Let go!

336
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,090
Nawa!

337
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,300
If you keep insisting,

338
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,600
I'll kill him right now!

339
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,090
If you kill Mr. Phurit,

340
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,810
I'll kill myself too.

341
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,360
Nawa.

342
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,900
Stop saying stupid things.

343
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,190
Do you ever think

344
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,770
about what I'd do if I lost you?

345
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,140
And did you ever think

346
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,910
that what you did to Mr. Phurit

347
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,650
made me not want to be with you anymore?

348
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,210
Nawa…

349
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,990
How do you know about that?

350
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,320
No merman here even knows who Mr. Phurit is.

351
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,190
None of them

352
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,760
had a problem with him, Phraphai.

353
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,740
Nawa.

354
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,560
Everything I did,

355
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,100
I did it for you.

356
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,900
That's not true.

357
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,640
You did it for yourself.

358
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:19,680
Let go of me!

359
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:20,980
Nawa!

360
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,640
- Nawa, I'm sorry.
- Let go!

361
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:04,760
Nawa.

362
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,520
Nawa, don't worry.

363
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,220
I already told Phana that you're here.

364
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,460
He should be on his way.

365
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,670
I'm sorry

366
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,350
I had to keep you like this.

367
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,200
If I didn't,

368
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,220
you would never have given me…

369
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,470
a chance to talk to you one last time.

370
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,310
I don't know if, after everything I say,

371
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,040
you'll ever forgive me.

372
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,160
But now that things have come to this,

373
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,030
I don't want to hide anything from you anymore,

374
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,310
about what happened 20 years ago.

375
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:22,110
You called for me, Headman.

376
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,360
What do you need me to do?
Take this information to the humans who hunt mermen.

377
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,450
Tell them that tonight

378
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,380
a group of mermen will be
delivering goods to a house on

379
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,000
the western coast of the island.

380
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,590
Do you want me to take care of them like before?

381
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:41,940
Yes.

382
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,550
Once they kill the mermen,

383
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,440
make sure you kill the humans too.

384
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,520
Leave no evidence behind.

385
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,940
Understood, sir.

386
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,020
Sorry to trouble you.

387
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,590
Joi had a road accident and hurt his leg,
so he couldn't make it.

388
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,920
I have to rely on you two today.

389
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,690
Don't worry about it, Pha.

390
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:07,360
It's on our way anyway.

391
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,440
You can leave the motorbike here.

392
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,870
Pick it up tomorrow when you come back.

393
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,220
Alright, Pha,

394
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,120
and tomorrow I'll bring
Nawa over to stay with you.

395
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,800
Is that okay?

396
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,910
Of course.

397
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,090
Nawa is like my own child.

398
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,710
It'll be good, Phana will finally

399
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,630
have someone to play
with instead of just video games all day.

400
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,320
It's getting late. We should get going.

401
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,000
See you tomorrow.

402
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,280
- We'll be going now.
- Goodbye.

403
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:36,870
- Take care!
- Let's go, dear.

404
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:37,880
Drive safe.

405
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,080
Sir…
our men fired at the wrong people.

406
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,530
- They shot...
- I know.

407
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,750
Bring them to me alive.

408
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,290
I'll kill them myself.

409
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,340
Uncle Chan…

410
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,410
It's alright, dear.

411
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,150
I'll take care of everything.

412
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:17,170
Uncle Chan, can you bring my parents back to me?

413
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,250
I can't.

414
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,560
But I promise you this, starting today,

415
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:30,090
I'll take care and protect you in their place.

416
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,970
And you too, Phraphai.

417
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,820
We have to protect him.

418
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,270
Never let any human

419
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,170
harm our kind again.

420
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,550
Yes, Father.

421
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:59,900
I only learned the truth
on the day my father died.

422
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,280
What happened to your father

423
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,490
has nothing to do with the concession deal.

424
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,870
What do you mean by that, Grandpa?

425
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,330
The person who killed your father…

426
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,530
was a merman.

427
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,470
You should've known your father better.

428
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,560
We found proof

429
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,550
of all the terrible things
he'd done to the culprit.

430
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,210
They're not so different.

431
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,770
I'm sorry…

432
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,880
for what my father did,

433
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,300
and for what I had to hide from you.

434
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,720
I'm not asking you to forgive me
or forgive him.

435
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,370
But I want to atone for the sins

436
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,300
my father and I have caused.

437
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,540
Nawa, I'll put it on for you.

438
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,590
It's beautiful as expected.

439
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:56,910
I understand

440
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,510
how you feel.

441
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,230
If something bad ever happened

442
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,710
to my dearest brother,

443
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,850
I'd feel the same way too.

444
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,960
Your dearest brother.

445
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,410
Nawa.

446
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,630
My life

447
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,130
is the last thing

448
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,910
that I'll give to you.

449
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,350
I'm sorry, Phraphai,
for talking to you this way…

450
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,530
I've fallen in love with Mr. Phurit.

451
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,000
I know

452
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,640
everything you've done was for my sake,

453
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:12,270
but if you really care about me…

454
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,960
please let me follow my heart.

455
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,390
Give it to your lover.

456
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,820
- Phraphai!
- Nawa!

457
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,000
Phu!

458
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,430
Phraphai!

459
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:27,720
Phu!

460
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:31,410
Phu!

461
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,350
Wake up and talk to me first!

462
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,980
Phraphai!

463
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,620
Phraphai, wake up!

464
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,160
Phraphai!

465
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,160
Phraphai!

466
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,480
Phraphai!

467
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,190
Phraphai!

468
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,770
Phraphai!

469
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,740
Wake up, Phraphai!

470
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,910
- Mr. Phurit!
- Phu!

471
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,090
Mr. Phurit, wake up!

472
00:40:59,100 --> 00:40:59,740
Phu!

473
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:01,780
Wake up and talk to me, Phu!

474
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,320
From the sea you came,

475
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:34,730
and to the sea you shall return.

476
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,780
You'll always stay in my heart,

477
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:46,740
Phraphai.

478
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,700
Thank you for everything,

479
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,060
my friend.

480
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,580
Phraphai was like a pillar of this island.

481
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:18,700
A great tree that sheltered many,

482
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,520
just like his father, Chan.

483
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,930
We will remember Phraphai forever

484
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,750
as the beloved merman of our island.

485
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:47,260
Thank you for everything, Phraphai.

486
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,520
I feel so bad for Nawa.

487
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,940
It's like he's lost his whole family.

488
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,080
He's probably in shock for a while,

489
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,330
but he'll adjust eventually.

490
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,310
I understand how he feels

491
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,200
but he still has us.

492
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,400
If only Mr. Phurit wakes up
and stays with Nawa…

493
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,570
everything might be a better.

494
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:45,770
Mr. Phurit!

495
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:47,630
Nawa.

496
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,810
How long have I been unconscious?

497
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:25,990
It's been about a week since that day.

498
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,110
A whole week?

499
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,660
What happened?

500
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,830
This man has been poisoned by mermen.

501
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:06,530
What do I do?

502
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,040
To save him,

503
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:13,670
he must drink blood from a merman's heart.

504
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,890
Give it to your lover.

505
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:26,000
You drank the blood from Phraphai's heart.

506
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:30,390
Then that means

507
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:32,790
Phraphai is…

508
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:38,520
Yes.

509
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,910
Phraphai is...

510
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:50,570
Thank you.

511
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,030
Thank you, Nawa.

512
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:57,750
And thank you, Phraphai.

513
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,380
I barely did anything.

514
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,760
It was…

515
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,920
only Phraphai who sacrificed his heart for you.

516
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:32,720
That's not true.

517
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:35,760
Did you know?

518
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:39,800
When I was sinking into the water…

519
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,020
I was terrified

520
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,800
that I'd die before seeing you again.

Hello, Silp.

544
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:29,870
Oh,
I was just thinking about you, actually.

545
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:32,720
Sorry I only came just now.

546
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,540
It's fine.

00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,470
I already heard everything that happened.

548
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,970
I'm truly happy for you, Mr. Phurit,

549
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:45,770
that you managed to achieve

550
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,170
what you wanted.

551
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,710
It's all thanks to your advice.

552
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:55,600
So you're here to close down the shop

553
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,750
and treat me to drinks like you promised?

554
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,090
Of course, Silp.

555
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:04,920
But I'm here

556
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,620
because I wanted to thank you.

557
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,670
No need, Mr. Phurit.

558
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,320
I only told you what I knew.

559
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,100
Everything that happened afterward

560
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:20,850
came from your own decisions.

561
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:24,470
You give me too much credit.

562
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,070
You've shown so many people

563
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:31,280
that humans and mermen

564
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,200
can love and be loved.

565
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:39,450
You changed what I believed about love…

566
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:42,330
and changed many others too.

567
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,180
I should get going now.

568
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,210
This way, this way!

569
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,930
Welcome to Khen Island, both of you!

570
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,670
Right here is the island's main pier,

571
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:29,310
the first place everyone arrives.

572
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:32,130
I want to show you something.
This way, please.

573
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,980
Here it is,
the first check-in spot of the island.

574
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:36,800
Go on, stand there.

575
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,220
Okay, please smile.

576
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:42,720
Okay!

577
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,070
How is it? Nice photo, right?

578
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:48,350
Out there, the open water…
and over there, that's Khen Island.

579
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:51,270
People say if you go over to that side…

580
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,440
You might just see a merman.

581
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,770
We call them mermen.

582
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,130
Yeah.

583
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,970
I've heard stories too,

584
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,710
but not quite like what you're saying.

585
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,150
So let me ask, Mr. Nawa,

586
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:38,530
do you believe in them?

587
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:47,690
It depends on what people choose to believe.

588
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:51,530
What about you, Mr. Phurit?
Do you believe?

589
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,340
Cheers!

590
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:11,580
Come on, cheers!

591
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,370
I haven't felt this relieved in so long.

592
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,550
Wow, Maiaek,

593
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:20,690
you have things to stress about?
First time I'm hearing that.

594
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,660
Oh, brother, of course I do!

595
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:26,100
Before this, it was nothing
but headaches all day long.

596
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,480
But look at the bar now,

597
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:29,840
why are there suddenly

598
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:34,570
couples everywhere being all sweet and clingy?

599
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:36,500
Should we change this into a bubble tea café?

600
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,330
Ants are swarming from all this sugar!

601
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:39,920
Don't stop us.

602
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,210
We've been through so much to get here.

603
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:47,520
You can't control feelings or love anyway.

604
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:49,310
Well said.

605
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:50,790
It's the opposite.

606
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:55,150
Everyone here wants Mr. Phurit and Nawa,

607
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:58,510
Phana and Ping
to love each other even more.

608
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:01,540
From now on, I hope this place is filled

609
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:04,870
with love and happiness.

610
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,350
Alright, alright! Here's what we'll do,

611
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:14,240
both couples,

612
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,170
feel free to be as sweet as you want.

613
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,540
Leave dealing with jealousy

614
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,410
to us!

615
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,500
- That's right.
- Exactly.

616
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:27,250
So? What will you do?

617
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:30,290
You heard them, didn't you?

618
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:32,020
Yes.

619
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:36,890
- Oh my...
- Mr. Phurit!

620
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,120
They're watching!

621
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:39,650
What for?

622
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:42,740
They said they were jealous of us,
didn't they?

623
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:44,490
Should I kiss you again?

624
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,490
- Oh my...
- Mr. Phurit!

625
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:51,240
- They're watching!
- How about the other side too?

626
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,350
How about the other side?

627
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:58,240
Fabulous! Two kisses already!

628
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:00,130
That couple's done.

629
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:03,250
Now, what about your couple, Phana?

630
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,400
What are you going to do?

631
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,510
After what Mr. Phurit did,

632
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,880
are you going to let him outshine you?

633
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:09,960
Right! Exactly!

634
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:10,930
You shouldn't let it slide!

635
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,480
- Don't let him! Don't let him!
- Wait, wait!

636
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,150
Wait, Timmy! Lek!

637
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:17,180
Don't push Phana like that!

638
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:19,470
They're not wrong though.

639
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:21,380
What are you going to do?

640
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,480
Well a cheek kiss is too ordinary.

641
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:26,350
For us, we should kiss for real.

642
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,150
No!

643
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,940
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

644
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:32,110
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

645
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,810
- Kiss! Kiss!
- Phana, stop!

646
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:35,310
Kiss! Kiss!

647
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:36,130
Kiss!

648
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:38,280
Kiss! Kiss!

649
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,330
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss...
