6
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,930
Have you ever heard the legend of Khen Island?

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,540
They said, besides humans,

8
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,380
there are other beings who
look no different from humans,

9
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,650
living together on Khen Island
in harmony with mankind

10
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,330
to the point where
they can't be distinguished.

11
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,840
When they are on land,

12
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,930
they are no different from ordinary people.

13
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,290
But whenever these beings
dive beneath the ocean,

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,970
their bodies transform.

15
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,530
We call them

16
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,340

"Lover Merman" (Episode 1)

35
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,980
(Full & a Half Kohkhen)

36
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,270
I'm telling you, today.

37
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,090
Timmy's the dark horse for sure.

38
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,540
But I think Nawa's better.
Maybe. We'll have to wait

39
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,100
until we taste it.

40
00:05:59,260 --> 00:05:59,900
Timmy'll win,

41
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,610
- my bro always makes delicious things.
- I think Nawa will win.

42
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,400
Let's wait and see. Just wait and see.

43
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,360
Damn, you always go all out, huh, Nawa?

44
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,840
Can't you go easy on me for once?

45
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,500
In that case,
let's get started with the judging.

46
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,740
I can't wait to taste it.

47
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,680
Alright then.

48
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,750
I'll start with Timmy's drink first.

49
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,220
Let's do this, bro.

50
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,980
How is it?

51
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,820
Whoa, today's really good.

52
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,010
It might win.

53
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,700
Whoa...

54
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,440
What's the matter?

55
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,750
That good, huh?

56
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,100
Whoa…
Oh!

57
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,250
If you guys are reacting like this...

58
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:32,760
Let me see.

59
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,250
This is the real deal, bro.

60
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,390
Just how good is it?

61
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,050
Sh*t… damn, Nawa…

62
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,970
this is amazing!

63
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,650
Can I just admit defeat already?

64
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,310
That's too much, man, too much.

65
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,610
Then I'll just go ahead and announce it,

66
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,950
today's winner is…

67
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,590
- Nawa!
- Nawa.

68
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,720
This is the real deal.

69
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,160
Gotta hand it to him.

70
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,330
That's damn good!

71
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,810
I think we can put this on the bar menu.

72
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:04,960
Customers would love it.

73
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:05,850
It'll totally work.

74
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll try pitch it to Phana first.

75
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,320
Okay.

76
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,120
Oh, I totally forgot.

77
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,166
Maiek. We've gotta go pick up
the stuff at the shop.

78
00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:15,046
We're already late, man.

79
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:17,953
Then what are we waiting for, bro?
Hurry up!

80
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:20,033
- Bro is gonna start nagging again.
- Cover the shop for me.

81
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,093
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

82
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,300
- Look after the place for a sec.
- Bro will nag again.

83
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,433
Hey,

84
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:29,800
I'm going to clean up the kitchen for a bit.

85
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,760
What kind of drink would you like today?

86
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,760
Usually, what do people in love order?

87
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,500
That would be the list on
the first page of the menu.

88
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,020
You can choose whichever flavor you like

89
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,590
sour or sweet.

90
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,570
What about you? Which do you prefer?

91
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,730
I like sweet.

92
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,040
I like… sweet too.

93
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,150
This menu was inspired by my own experience.

94
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,650
The flavor represents love
that feels like a dream,

95
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,860
hidden behind a mist of uncertainty.

96
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,010
It might be a little hard to drink at first,

97
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,050
but once you get halfway through,

98
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,020
you'll find sweetness.

99
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,650
And that, right there,

100
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,400
is the reward for someone who
makes love more clear.

101
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,850
Please, give it a try.

102
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,820
I bet you must have a lot of people
hitting on you.

103
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,480
My name's Phurich.

104
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,880
I'm Nawa.

105
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,760
Wow! I can't believe

106
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,740
how fragrant and rich the flavor is,
everything blends perfectly.

107
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,810
It's really delicious.

108
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,190
Thank you very much.

109
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,720
Can I get one more shot of tequila, please?

110
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,700
For you, Mr. Nawa.

111
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,720
Hey, are you trying to hit on my staff or what?

112
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:25,710
Phana.

113
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,320
Hey, Phu.

114
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,990
How have you been?

115
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,380
I'm good. And you?

116
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,140
I'm good too.

117
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,080
Your place looks great, man.

118
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,290
Of course, it's my shop!

119
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,920
(Full & a Half Kohkhen)

120
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,770
This here is Phurich,

121
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,460
my close friend from Bangkok.

122
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,700
He's also my business partner.
Together we founded Full & a Half Bar.

123
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,270
From now on,
Phurich will be working here with us.

124
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,540
So everyone,
treat him as another owner of the place.

125
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,450
Hello.

126
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,660
I've heard Mr. Phana mention you many times,

127
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,330
but I didn't expect you to be this handsome.

128
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,490
Are you single?

129
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,480
Aham... keep it down.

130
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,220
I'm Aunt Son,

131
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,080
the chef here.

132
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,770
And this is my nephew,

133
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,550
- called "Somchai"
- Hey!

134
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,630
It's Mary, my name is Mary.

135
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,160
Right. Mary.
My assistant in the kitchen.

136
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,280
And I'm beautiful and single too.

137
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,820
Mr. Phurich, I'm Lek, a server here.

138
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,450
If you need anything,
you can always call me.

139
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,390
I'm Maiek, Phana's cousin.

140
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,430
Do you still remember me, Phu?

141
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,570
Of course I do. You little monkey,

142
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,610
you've grown up a lot.

143
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:58,280
Hey...

144
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,410
More like he grown into a bigger monkey.

145
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,870
What kind of monkey looks this cool?

146
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,020
And what about those two?

147
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,300
Those two...

148
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,400
That one's Timmy.

149
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,530
And the one you just tried to flirt

150
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,070
is Nawa.

151
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,790
He's our number one here,

152
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,450
the one who really draws the customers in.

153
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,350
Anyway, that's pretty much everyone.

154
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,390
Now let's all get back to work.

155
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,190
We're opening slow today.

156
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,180
Go go.

157
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:48,950
Okay.

158
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,120
Why are you standing there?

159
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,290
Get inside.

160
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,960
If you need anything, Mr. Phurich,
just let me know.

161
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,110
Go on, move.

162
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,860
Don't even think about it.

163
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,880
I'm giving you a red card,
you're out of the game.

164
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,450
No hitting on Nawa.

165
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:07,840
Why not?

166
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,160
Don't tell me you've got
your eye on Nawa too.

167
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,050
What about Namhom, your girlfriend?

168
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,980
Nawa's no different
from my real younger brother.

169
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,470
My family raised him since he was a kid.

170
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,640
Then that's perfect.

171
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,590
Your mom doesn't hate me or anything.

172
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,540
But I know you too well, Phu.

173
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,790
You've never truly loved anyone.

174
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,450
And I don't believe that you've changed.

175
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,490
So, go mess around with someone else.

176
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,790
My order is final, no negotiations.

177
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,810
That's that.

178
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,070
I'm off.

179
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,480
We've only got four kinds of wine left.

180
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,660
Three bottles each.

181
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,850
That's all of them?

182
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,860
Yeah, all set.

183
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,950
Okay.

184
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,640
Everything good?

185
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,820
All good.

186
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,560
Nawa and I listed everything out.

187
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,100
Thanks a lot, Timmy.
Okay.

188
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,000
I want to speak to Nawa for a bit.

189
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,220
Okay.

190
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,210
Oh, right! I almost forgot.

191
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,090
The kid I mentioned
who's coming in for training,

192
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,580
he'll arrive tomorrow.
Can I bring him over around noon?

193
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,080
Yeah, that's fine.

194
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,410
Okay, thank you.

195
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,750
Phana, is something wrong?

196
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,060
I just wanted to ask,

197
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,110
earlier, what were you talking about with Phu?

198
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,030
What kind of drink would you like today?

199
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,760
Usually, what do people in love order?

200
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,670
That would be the list on
the first page of the menu.

201
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,070
You can choose whichever flavor you like

202
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,910
sour or sweet.

203
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,320
What about you? Which do you prefer?

204
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,600
I like sweet.

205
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,240
I like... sweet too.

206
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,890
It's nothing, really.

207
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,950
Mr. Phurich only ordered a drink.

208
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,600
He tried to hit on you too, didn't he?

209
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,160
Probably.

210
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,890
At first, I thought he was
just a regular customer,

211
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,270
so I just went with the flow.

212
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,600
But once I realized
he's your business partner,

213
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,120
I won't get involved with him.

214
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,830
That's a relief.

215
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,880
I don't want to see you end up hurt.

216
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,440
Phu's a player,

217
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,710
he throws his charm around everywhere.

218
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,150
If you can avoid him, then avoid him.

219
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,360
Besides,

220
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,200
I don't want my little brother to get hurt.

221
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,000
As for Phu,

222
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,770
if he ever found out the truth one day,
he wouldn't be able to handle it.

223
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:50,880
Yes.

224
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,300
Alright then. I'll head out first.

225
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,020
Alright.

226
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,010
Stop staring at my brother.

227
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,040
What the hell,

228
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,380
I can't even look?

229
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,180
If it were someone else, I wouldn't care.

230
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,430
But you? You're way too flashy.

231
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,210
You've got no right to
lecture me about this, Phana.

232
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,410
Don't compare yourself to me.

233
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,050
At least I talk to one person at a time,
date one person at a time.

234
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,210
When I do, I date them for a long time.

235
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,280
So what?

236
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,960
I don't see your love life
turning out any better than mine.

237
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,540
If someone isn't “the one,”
why force yourself to keep dating them?

238
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,430
Hey...

239
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,610
Did that hit a nerve?

240
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,170
You hit him straight in the heart.

241
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,260
You know what?
Since the bar opened,

242
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,060
Namhom hasn't even shown up here once.

243
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,700
I see him every day just drinking,

244
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,090
getting drunk, missing her.

245
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,930
Geez, he's so pitiful.

246
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:20,830
There, there.

247
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,730
You brat, are you so free that

248
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,190
- you need to listen to others talking?
- Just kidding.

249
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,620
- Just kidding. Just kidding.
- Maiek.

250
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,640
Yes?

251
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,150
Get me another drink.

252
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,180
Okay. Same as before, right?

253
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,430
Phana,

254
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,090
is there something you want to tell me?

255
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,270
I haven't seen Namhom in almost three months.

256
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,440
It's not like it's a huge deal.

257
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,710
We're both busy with our own lives.

258
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,530
She's in Bangkok,

259
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,690
I'm stuck here on Khen Island.

260
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,920
Not meeting each other for so long,

261
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,530
I feel like Namhom's changed.

262
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,740
You think Namhom has someone else?

263
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,760
I don't think so.

264
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,220
If she really did,

265
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,920
it would actually be easier.

266
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,820
I'd just break up with her, no hesitation.

267
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,620
Then what are you gonna do?

268
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,880
Have you tried sitting down
and really talking it out?

269
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,120
We have.

270
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,170
We've tried fixing things so many times,

271
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,780
but it always ends in a fight.

272
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,380
Even this afternoon, when she called,
it was the same old argument again.

273
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,840
It feels like we're not part
of each other's lives anymore.

274
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,720
All that's left is the
“relationship status” tying us together.

275
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,200
I can't even give you advice on this, man.

276
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,220
I've never been in a relationship like yours.

277
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,440
Hey,

278
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,450
don't stress out on my behalf.

279
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,090
I'm sure once we meet up again,

280
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,660
things will get better.

281
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,400
Hey. Cheers.

282
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,950
I hope it turns out the way you say.

283
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,320
Hey, hey.

284
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,180
Cut it out.

285
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:46,640
None of your business.

286
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,780
(Full & a Half Kohkhen)

287
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,990
(yesterday
Phana: I have something I want to talk about.)

288
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,420
The bar isn't open yet.

289
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,240
Right now, we only serve breakfast and coffee.

290
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,540
I'm not here to order drinks.

291
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,790
I came to see Timmy.

292
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,170
Timmy's not here.

293
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,640
Do you need something?

294
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,190
Well, I'm supposed
to start my internship here tomorrow,

295
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,850
but Timmy told me to meet
with the owner first.

296
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,260
I see.

297
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,500
Hey, Ping!

298
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,520
Timmy!

299
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,570
Sorry, I'm late. Had a rough night.

300
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:53,930
Phana,

301
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,230
this is my little bro I mentioned
the one coming to intern at the shop.

302
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,900
Yeah, I know.

303
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,370
He didn't annoy or tease you, right?

304
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,840
Annoy or tease me?

305
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,170
He looked like a lost kid
wandering into the shop just now.

306
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:09,150
Anyway, what do you want to do here?

307
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,260
I want to learn about the bar system.

308
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,610
And actually, the reason I came here

309
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,230
is also because I want to understand how
a restaurant-bar hybrid works.

310
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:22,330
Then I'll leave you with Nawa and Timmy
to train him on the bar side.

311
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,420
Got it.

312
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,940
And if I've got time,

313
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,840
I'll teach you how
the restaurant system works.

314
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,250
Oh. But when it's busy,

315
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,100
you'll probably have to help serve as well.

316
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:33,880
No problem.

317
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,940
Alright then, I'll leave him to you.

318
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,560
- Got it.
- I'll get back to work.

319
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,170
Come with me.
- Let me show you.
- Sure.

320
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,440
Hello.

321
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,420
Hello.

322
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,280
What's up, Phana?

323
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,420
Yeah, I'm in front of your house now.

324
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,540
I brought the car for you.

325
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,970
Hey, my car's ready already?

326
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,490
Yep. You can come out and get it, sir.

327
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,600
Okay, I'll hurry down.

328
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,150
Phana.

329
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,100
What's up?

330
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,920
Here you go. Your car.

331
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,500
- I checked it thoroughly for you.
- Asshole.

332
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,500
Not a single scratch.

333
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,640
Thanks a lot, man.

334
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,020
So,

335
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,970
how's it going?
First night in a new place?

336
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,670
Not bad.

337
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:05,110
Switching from my condo
to a house feels pretty good.

338
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,060
That's good.

339
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,540
Sometimes a change of scenery is nice,
you might like it.

340
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,200
Phana.

341
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,540
Oh, what are you doing here?

342
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,820
Aunty Pha asked me to bring
the documents you forgot for Mr. Phurich.

343
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
Thank you.

344
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:19,690
Thanks.

345
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,600
Today, I was thinking
of driving around the city.

346
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,780
Want to be my guide?

347
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,220
I'm not free today.

348
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,410
He's taking the day off today.

349
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,410
For what?

350
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,630
You don't need to know everything.

351
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,520
He told me many days ago.

352
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,830
But if a staff who works at the bar

353
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,210
takes time off, shouldn't I know?

354
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,660
Then I'll take my leave now, Phana.

355
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,510
Drive safe.

356
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,070
- Yes, see you later.
- Bye-bye.

357
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,740
Bye-bye.

358
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,740
You, seriously...

359
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,580
Right in front of me no less.

360
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,210
If you're just messing around,

361
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,940
go mess around with someone else,

362
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,230
not Nawa.

363
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,150
And if I'm not just messing around...

364
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:13,990
Does that mean I can hit on him?

365
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,330
For someone like you?

366
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,300
Better not even say that.

367
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,130
Anyway, since we're at it,

368
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,360
drive me to the bar.

369
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,080
Also, there'll be a trainee starting tomorrow.

370
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,030
Go ahead.

371
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,600
I don't like training interns.

372
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,080
You handle it.

373
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,510
Alright, then.
You keep an eye on the customers

374
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,180
and the shop side.

375
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,590
Let's go.

376
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,450
I suggest you

377
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,270
don't touch it.

378
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,680
Sorry for being rude.

379
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,380
I just I saw it and it looked beautiful,

380
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,450
so I...

381
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,050
That's exactly why.

382
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,920
It's beauty is what lures humans

383
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,730
who are full of desire,

384
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,940
making them obsessed time and time again.

385
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,960
How so?

386
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,980
Never mind.

387
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,820
Let's just say

388
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:12,090
it's my personal, valuable possession.

389
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,650
By the way, what kind of fish scale is this?

390
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,680
I've never seen anything like it before.

391
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,840
If I told you it's a merman's scale,

392
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,420
would you believe me?

393
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,090
There's no way I can believe it.

394
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,440
Good. It's better you don't.

395
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,530
The more people believe in these things,

396
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:39,290
misfortune tend to follow.

397
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,710
You're not a tourist, right?

398
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:45,870
No, I'm not.

399
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,060
You're not from this island either.

400
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,160
I just decided to move here,

401
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,560
and I opened a bar
with a friend as a business partner.

402
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,040
I'm thinking about starting a resort too,

403
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,850
and planning to stay here long-term.

404
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,410
Khen Island should only have
two kinds of people,

405
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,810
one, the original residents,

406
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,590
and two, tourists.

407
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,990
This island isn't suitable for new residents.

408
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,610
Why not?

409
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,660
Excuse me.

410
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,900
Yes, Phana?

411
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,460
Okay, I'll go now.

412
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,260
I'll take my leave.

413
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,430
Sorry again for being rude.

414
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,580
What's your name?

415
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:54,690
I'm Silp.

416
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,600
I'm Phurich.

417
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,780
My bar is on the main beach,

418
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,400
called Full & a Half.

419
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,530
If you ever want a drink,

420
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,020
you're welcome to come by.

421
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,570
Nice to meet you.

422
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,480
Likewise.

423
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,300
I'll take my leave now.

424
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,220
Nawa, I'm in front of the house now.

425
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,050
Okay, Phraphai.

426
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,500
I'll be out soon.

427
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,480
Mm, finish getting yourself ready first
before coming out.

428
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:13,980
Got it.

429
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:15,460
Alright.

430
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,220
Take your time getting ready.
I can wait.

431
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:25,080
Oh, and about your heart, I can wait too.

432
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,930
No matter how long it takes,
I'll wait for you, Nawa.

433
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,540
Met.

434
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,360
You want to hitch a ride with me
to release the poison, don't you?

435
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,620
I'm just teasing a little, don't pout.

436
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,070
Watch what you say.

437
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,200
I don't want him to find out about this.

438
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:42,960
Honestly,

439
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,860
I think everyone on the island

440
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,100
already knows how you feel about Nawa.

441
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,600
Only he still sees you as
just a really good older brother.

442
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,320
I'm serious,

443
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,930
don't you have any plan
to tell him your feelings?

444
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,380
You're adults now,

445
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,070
if you feel something, just say it.

446
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,840
Oh, hey, Met.

447
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,030
Are we going together today?

448
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,360
My car's having a little problem,

449
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,420
- so I'll hitch a ride with you two.
- Uh.

450
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:08,970
Nawa,

451
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,940
shall we head out?

452
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,570
Ready.

453
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,670
Let me see.

454
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:21,970
Looking all dreamy.

455
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,540
What is it?

456
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,340
Met's just rambling, Nawa.

457
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,720
Come on, let's go.

458
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:33,690
Okay.

459
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,260
Let's go.

460
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,540
If it's going to be like this,
maybe they could just go together,

461
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,460
I'll release the poison here.

462
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,660
Damn it, Phraphai, Nawa, wait for me!

463
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,610
The weather's great today.

464
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:16,730
After releasing the poison,

465
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:17,990
I want to swim a little more.

466
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:18,730
Sure.

467
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,900
Nawa, you're not in a rush, right?

468
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,300
No,

469
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,720
I want to swim a bit longer too.

470
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,120
I'll go down first. See you below.

471
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,650
Mm, see you, man.

472
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,650
- Hello.
- Hello.

473
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,070
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Yeah.

474
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,780
Hello.

475
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,660
If you need anything, just let me know.

476
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,390
Make yourself comfortable.

477
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,170
Maiek,

478
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,660
our bar gets pretty busy, huh?

479
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,470
Yeah.
Even though it's not high season,

480
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,920
customers keep coming in.

481
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:22,830
Why do you think that is?

482
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,050
The mermaid legend?

483
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,460
Whoa! You know about that too?

484
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,380
Every customer talks about it.

485
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,590
They say that on Khen Island,
mermaids live mixed in with humans,

486
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:37,030
looking and living just like humans.

487
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,790
So people can't tell the difference.

488
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,130
You know the details, huh.

489
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,490
On the night before the full moon,

490
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,720
every mermaid shows an

491
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,480
eight-pointed star mark on their body.

492
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,620
Before the full moon night?

493
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,170
Yes.
Yeah.

494
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,790
Do you believe it, Phu?

495
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,070
Everyone asks me the same thing.

496
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,210
And my answer?

497
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,720
If anyone can bring me
a mermaid to see in person,

498
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,170
then I'll believe it.

499
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:12,570
I understand.

500
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,640
Hello.

501
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,580
Right, Maiek.

502
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,660
Yes?

503
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:22,810
Can you close up the bar for me?

504
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,710
I'm going out to hang out
with some customers somewhere else.

505
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:25,610
Sure.

506
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:26,930
I'll handle it.

507
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:27,960
Thanks a lot.

508
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,260
- Sure, no problem.
- Please clean the glass for me.

509
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,090
Alright.

510
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,520
You don't even clear your own glass.

511
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,030
Hey Nawa,

512
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,380
heading back already?

513
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:39,940
I can drive you.

514
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,750
Can I sit and relax here a little longer?

515
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,110
Mm, alright. I'll wait on the shore.

516
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:48,340
Okay.

517
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,370
See you later.
Okay.

518
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:52,820
Let's go first.

519
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,080
How long has it been since I was drunk like this?

520
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:46,960
A merman!

521
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:50,690
Mr. Phurich!

522
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,880
(Love each other.)

523
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,080
(Complicated.)

524
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,280
(My world.)

525
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,160
(A new world together.)

526
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,960
(Couple.)

527
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:34,680
(What is important?)

528
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,180
(Next Episode)
That guy over there... Who's he?

529
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:49,480
Honestly, they look more like a couple
than siblings.

530
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,230
I want to ask you directly...

531
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,580
What you're doing right now...

532
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,330
Are you trying to hit on me?

533
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,110
Yes. I am trying to hit on you.

534
00:42:58,910 --> 00:42:59,800
Are you here for a meal?

535
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,240
No.

536
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,460
It's just that someone close to me works here.

537
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:04,630
Nawa, huh?

538
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,160
If you know you're about to crash,

539
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,480
I suggest you back off.

540
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,160
No insurance will cover you.

541
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,790
By the way, have you two heard about
humans coming to hunt mermaids on our island?

542
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,720
Den, where did you hear about this?

543
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:20,870
Nawa,

544
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,620
I don't want you to trust any humans at all.

545
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,650
Are you a local here too, Ping?

546
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:26,930
Why?

547
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:28,770
Don't I look like a local?

548
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,480
Last night I thought...
I saw something

549
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,300
that looked like a merman,

550
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,320
but when I thought about it carefully,
it looked like...
