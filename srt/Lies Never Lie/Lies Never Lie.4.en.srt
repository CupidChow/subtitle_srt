(Information)

33
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,030
Victim, Liu Cheng.

34
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,840
Psychological counselor
at Xinmei Institution.

35
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,400
He joined an intellectual disabilities

36
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,030
charity event held
by Women's Federation.

37
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,190
Wang Pu killed him on his way home

38
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,360
from a patient's house.

39
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,190
Keep reading.

40
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,190
Er...

41
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,960
Wang Pu, 48 years old.

42
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,800
Retired from the boxing team
18 years ago.

43
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,630
Due to his unsuccessful athletic career

44
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,180
and lack of skills to sustain himself,

45
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,590
he had a struggling life.

46
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,750
What about his family?

47
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,530
Unmarried.

48
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,280
His mother died of illness
when he was three,

49
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,560
and his father passed away
in a car accident when he was 22.

50
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,630
No siblings.

51
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,710
Master, the journey is quick.

52
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,590
I didn't know that.

53
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,630
Hurry up.

54
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,960
No time left.

55
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,520
Okay.

56
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,840
Wang Pu

57
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,710
joined the team in 1988.

58
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,190
1988?

59
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,520
When he was only 14?

60
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,080
Exactly.

61
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,430
He was specially recruited
by our old coach, Liu Haihua.

62
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,870
Wang Pu

63
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,750
was the hope of our municipal team
back then.

64
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,630
I can't believe he ended up a murderer.

65
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,120
Are you saying he was a genius?

66
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,190
Of course, he was specially recruited.

67
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,590
But based on what we found,

68
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,630
his athletic career was a failure.

69
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,960
(Champion)
It's a shame.

70
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,000
Coach Hu.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,630
Yes?

72
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,600
This one?

73
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,190
Oh.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,120
The leader found it unpleasant to display

75
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,870
a murderer's name,

76
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,480
so the trophy was turned around.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,600
If what you say is true,

78
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,120
you two were in the same batch.

79
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,720
Yes.

80
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,310
You must be very skilled as well.

81
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,600
Why don't I see your name

82
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,190
on any certificates or medals?

83
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,600
Oh.

84
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,600
Well.

85
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,750
You see,

86
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,750
it's a funny coincidence.

87
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,720
Both of us

88
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,390
used to be known as Couch Liu's
most promising students.

89
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,950
But he preferred Wang Pu more.

90
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,630
Fair enough.

91
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,720
He was very young

92
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,000
and gifted.

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,390
But I was the hard-working type.

94
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,360
That was why everyone
used to expect more from him.

95
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,750
May I ask you something?

96
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,600
Based on what you know about him,

97
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,830
did he ever show violent tendencies

98
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,270
outside the ring?

99
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,560
I'm not sure,

100
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,270
but he did hurt others by accident.

101
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,630
There was once,

102
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,560
during a selection competition,

103
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,630
where one of us could be chosen.

104
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,870
It was a fierce fight between us.

105
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,000
Look.

106
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,270
Twelve stitches.

107
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,830
It almost cost me my life.

108
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,920
I couldn't box anymore after that.

109
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,270
I had no choice but to be a coach.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,870
I see. What about Wang Pu?

111
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,750
He didn't perform well

112
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,310
in that competition,

113
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,950
so he didn't win.

114
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,190
Afterward, people started
gossiping about him,

115
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,270
saying that he was bold
when beating his own teammates

116
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,560
but cowardly

117
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,720
when facing real opponents.

118
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,680
Couch Liu even

119
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,120
called to talk to us several times
because of this.

120
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,000
It's fine for us to spar

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,560
and get hurt.

122
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,270
However, he hit someone in the street.

123
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,390
The victim was a layman.

124
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,750
That's too much.

125
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,270
Right?

126
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,190
You must know

127
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,390
Wang Pu was sentenced to death.

128
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,160
Master.

129
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,630
The execution is in two days.

130
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,830
Um,

131
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,160
after I was injured,

132
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,430
I went back to my hometown.

133
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,120
By the time I returned,

134
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,000
he had already left.

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,120
I had never heard from him again.

136
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,430
(Boxing Gym)

137
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,070
Then Wang Pu wasn't wrongly accused.

138
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,830
Do you believe him?

139
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,680
I can analyze his facial expressions.

140
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,070
So he was lying,

141
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,360
and everything he said was fake?

142
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,800
Not entirely,

143
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,950
but he does hate Wang Pu.

144
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,310
That's why when he heard
about the execution,

145
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,510
he looked excited

146
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,800
and relieved.

147
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,160
It was like he finally got his revenge.

148
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,360
I can't analyze that much.

149
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,800
We didn't find anything useful
from Hu Tian.

150
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,310
I think I dislike Wang Pu more now.

151
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,510
Should the police

152
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,000
be less emotional?

153
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,390
You'll get used to it.

154
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,270
We didn't get much from Hu Tian,

155
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,120
just that he hates Wang Pu,
which doesn't help.

156
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,070
He mentioned Liu Haihua.

157
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,830
Right.

158
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
The coach.

159
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,720
Let's go.

160
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,680
Tiaotiao.

161
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,430
Yes?

162
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,040
Have you contacted
the local police station?

163
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,120
Yes, I did.

164
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,920
Good job.

165
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,360
Ms. Li, mind if I ask you something?

166
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,240
Shoot.

167
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,950
Aren't you worried

168
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,950
we might be wasting our time?

169
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,270
What makes you think that?

170
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,430
Liu Cheng was

171
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,120
a quiet and decent man,

172
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,870
while Wang Pu looks fierce.

173
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,270
Even if something unexpected comes up,

174
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,240
I doubt the conviction
will be overturned.

175
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,750
As cops,

176
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,000
as long as there isn't
the slightest doubt left,

177
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,390
it's never a waste of time.

178
00:08:10,516 --> 00:08:14,440
(32 hours, 19 minutes
until Wang Pu's execution)

179
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,480
Ms. Wei.

180
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:21,800
Hmm.

181
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,560
Qian Pengfei, the man who assaulted Ma Bo,

182
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,000
is Song Chaoran's childhood friend
and business partner.

183
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,040
So he did this for his buddy?

184
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,030
What's interesting is that
according to Ma Bo,

185
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,000
Qian Pengfei made a private deal

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,550
to sell all his shares
to Tianniu Technology.

187
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,670
Why did you arrest me?

188
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,150
Ma Bo is the killer.

189
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,750
You assaulted someone.

190
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,080
Care to tell us why

191
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,910
you think Ma Bo is the killer?

192
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,000
Money.

193
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,270
What else can it be?

194
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,120
Ma Bo wanted to take over our company.

195
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,480
Chaoran refused,

196
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,870
so he hired someone to beat him.

197
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,750
That's it.

198
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,240
An old trick in the book.

199
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,630
Song Chaoran refused to sell?

200
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,670
And what about you?

201
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,910
My shares are small. It doesn't matter
whether I sell them or not.

202
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,550
I'm asking, are you selling?

203
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,080
Yeah.

204
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,910
To whom?

205
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,360
Whoever pays the most.

206
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
From what we found,

207
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,670
Tianniu Technology offered
the highest price.

208
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,480
Fine, I admit

209
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,840
that Ma Bo and I

210
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,390
had a private deal,

211
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,960
and I'd sell my shares to him.

212
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,120
But Chaoran held the majority,

213
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,080
so I told Ma Bo I'd persuade Chaoran.

214
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,630
Looks like you failed.

215
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,550
Ma Bo took action against him

216
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,440
before I did anything.

217
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,080
How are you sure it was Ma Bo?

218
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,200
Who else could it be, then?

219
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,600
If you hadn't shown up so early,

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,260
I would've beaten him to a pulp.

221
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,790
Oh.

222
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,080
What about the shares now?

223
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,840
That's a different matter.

224
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,960
Chaoran and I are good buddies.

225
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,670
How could I not stand up for him
when he was bullied?

226
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,720
Arrest me or punish me

227
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,870
if you want.

228
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,320
I won't deny it.

229
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,030
Okay?

230
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,270
Captain Ding, we found the car
that moved Song Chaoran.

231
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,720
It belongs to Tianniu Technology.

232
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,200
The log shows

233
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,510
that the driver is Ma Da,

234
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,150
the brother of the deputy CEO, Ma Bo.

235
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,200
Hmm.

236
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
Thank you, Coach Liu.

237
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,320
We came here

238
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,480
to ask about Wang Pu.

239
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,510
Wang Pu used to train under you...

240
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,360
Dad,

241
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,720
why are you meeting with them?

242
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,480
It's about Wang Pu again?

243
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,200
You must be Liu Lin.

244
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,080
About your intention here,

245
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,910
I just want to say

246
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,360
that he deserves it.

247
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,750
Could you tell us why?

248
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,870
A murderer deserves to die.

249
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,960
He had it coming.

250
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,840
That's all I have to say.

251
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,960
My dad knows nothing else.

252
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,360
Don't come back again.

253
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,960
My dad just recovered

254
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,150
from a stroke.

255
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,840
They're here to help Pu.

256
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,550
Dad,

257
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,150
he's not the Pu you knew anymore.

258
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,790
He's the murderer, Wang Pu.

259
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,550
Wang Pu would never kill anyone.

260
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
I taught him before.

261
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,200
A boxer's fist should never
be used outside the ring.

262
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,360
As if he would listen to you.

263
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,790
Well.

264
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,960
If he had followed your teachings,

265
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,000
you wouldn't have left

266
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,840
Baizhou after spending
your whole life there.

267
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,320
He brought this trouble to you.

268
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,030
What trouble did he bring me?

269
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,870
Huh?

270
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,910
Since young,
whenever we bought some meat,

271
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,870
he'd eat half of it.

272
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,080
And what?

273
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,840
He killed someone.

274
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,000
He was sentenced to death.

275
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:12,840
That's easy for him.

276
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,670
What about you?

277
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,440
Your reputation is ruined.

278
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,910
I believe him.

279
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,720
He wouldn't do such a thing
when I say so.

280
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,000
Please calm down, Coach Liu.

281
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,120
We also believe Wang Pu
wouldn't kill without a reason.

282
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,150
Officers,

283
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,790
would you weigh in here?

284
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,080
I used to run a gym at Baizhou.

285
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,200
My dad was so persistent

286
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,480
in getting Wang Pu to work there

287
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,550
as a coach.

288
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,840
And then what?

289
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,910
That scoundrel actually

290
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,270
messed around with a female client.

291
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,000
Her fiance found out.

292
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,030
He was a journalist
at the provisional broadcast station.

293
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,270
I had to pay a lot to keep it quiet.

294
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,200
Besides, I had to calm that guy down,

295
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,480
so I fired that scoundrel.

296
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,550
Because of that,

297
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,550
my dad hadn't spoken to me
for almost one year.

298
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,200
Later, I found out

299
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,790
he went behind my back

300
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,840
and gave Wang Pu money

301
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,120
to start a business.

302
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,360
This was unfair to me.

303
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,790
Who's your real son, really?

304
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,440
Pu is my student.

305
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,550
I believe in him.

306
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,120
Dad, he killed someone.

307
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,080
You still believe him?

308
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,390
He didn't.

309
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,240
Or the police wouldn't
be investigating.

310
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,440
There must be something else
going on.

311
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,870
The court convicted him.

312
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,750
How long are you going
to stay stubborn?

313
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,720
Forget it.

314
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,550
What a waste of time.

315
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,200
Get lost!

316
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,440
You!

317
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,670
Fine, I'll leave.

318
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,240
You've never treated me
like your own son, anyway.

319
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,630
Hmph!

320
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,630
I'm sorry about that.

321
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,600
Officers,

322
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,120
Ma Da is a terrible person.

323
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,910
He's been to prison twice

324
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,750
for assault.

325
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,750
We're paying great attention to him.

326
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,320
He often drinks here
around this time of night.

327
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,720
Don't worry. We'll find him here.

328
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,360
This brat must

329
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,000
be a trouble.

330
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,030
Isn't that Ma Da?

331
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,120
- Don't run!
- Don't run!

332
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,480
Ouch.

333
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,910
Stop right there.

334
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,870
You down.

335
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,030
Ow!

336
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,910
Hey.

337
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,510
Keep running. Run.

338
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
You were fast.

339
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:57,910
Yue,

340
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,870
you were too slow.

341
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,080
Speaking of Pu,

342
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,000
he's really a natural.

343
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,630
Good.

344
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,270
Yes.

345
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,030
Straighten your back.

346
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,320
That's right.

347
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,120
Good.

348
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,720
Well done.

349
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,960
Excellent.

350
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,790
He could've joined

351
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,500
the provincial and national teams,

352
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,390
and maybe even won an Olympic gold.

353
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,790
Oh,

354
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,600
by the way,

355
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,000
look at this.

356
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,630
Look at him.

357
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,550
He was so popular

358
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,390
back then.

359
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,200
At that time,

360
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,440
reporters,

361
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,080
the team physician,

362
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,320
and those female boxers

363
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,440
were all crazy about him.

364
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,080
Coach Liu,

365
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,120
given his athletic excellence,

366
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,000
why did he retire?

367
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,080
Well.

368
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,510
Pu

369
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,790
came from a single-parent family.

370
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,270
His mother died

371
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,150
when he was a kid,

372
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,440
so he was raised by his father.

373
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,550
But when Pu was 22,

374
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,870
his father was in a car accident.

375
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,150
Sadly,

376
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,390
he died.

377
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,240
Pu,

378
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,840
take a break.

379
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,070
I know you're upset,

380
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,070
but you might hurt yourself like this.

381
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,480
Take a break.

382
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,270
All right.

383
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:18,920
Listen.

384
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,830
Keep practicing,

385
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,270
and I'll bring you the food.

386
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,160
When I get back,

387
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,160
we'll eat together,

388
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,070
then you can continue, okay?

389
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,000
Ah!

390
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
Wang Pu.

391
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,030
Wang Pu.

392
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,070
His wrist

393
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,440
was severely injured.

394
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
On top of that,

395
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,350
the team was on a tight budget.

396
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,510
We couldn't afford
the best treatment for him.

397
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,880
For Pu,

398
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,000
boxing was everything.

399
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,830
Taking that away from him

400
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,590
was more crushing than taking his life.

401
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,550
Plus, he joined the boxing team
when he was a teenager,

402
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,270
so he didn't

403
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,240
study much

404
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,000
or learn

405
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,240
how to deal with people.

406
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,830
If I hadn't recruited him

407
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,350
to the boxing team that early,

408
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,110
his life wouldn't have
turned out this way.

409
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,920
I'm to blame.

410
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,000
Coach Liu,

411
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,310
may I ask,

412
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,640
do you believe

413
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,030
Wang Pu would kill someone
for no reason,

414
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,350
especially a stranger?

415
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,400
That's impossible.

416
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,590
He may be a bit aggressive,

417
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,880
but killing someone?

418
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,350
In all his years on the team,

419
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,310
he never even argued
with other teammates.

420
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,920
How could he possibly beat
a stranger to death?

421
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,680
Coach Liu,

422
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,000
please take a look at this man.

423
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,160
Liu Cheng. Do you know him?

424
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,640
Liu Cheng?

425
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,960
No, I don't.

426
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,750
Has Wang Pu ever mentioned him?

427
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,680
I'm sure he didn't know him

428
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,160
while he was on the team.

429
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,510
Coach Liu,

430
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,000
could you please do me a favor?

431
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,140
(Countdown to Wang Pu's execution:
28 hours and 3 minutes)

432
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,400
Why did you run when you saw us?

433
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,480
I panicked.

434
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,830
Why were you panicked?

435
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,590
I get scared easily.

436
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,270
I was born this way.

437
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,880
If you chase me, I panic and run.

438
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,000
Is that a problem?

439
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,270
Do you know why we arrested you?

440
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,830
So,

441
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,960
officers,

442
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,830
how am I supposed

443
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,850
to know that
when you don't know that yourself?

444
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,160
You think

445
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,550
I don't know?

446
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,070
It makes a big difference
for you and us to state the reason here.

447
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,590
I don't know.

448
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,350
You don't know?

449
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:45,110
The car with plate number Bai A73548

450
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,920
left the main gate of Tianniu Technology
at 4:30 PM

451
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,440
and returned at 10:15 PM yesterday.

452
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,440
The person captured in the footage
was you.

453
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,030
Tell me, what were you doing
during those hours?

454
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,070
Nothing.

455
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,680
I just drove around

456
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,590
and grabbed a bite.

457
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,240
Where did you go?

458
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
I can't remember.

459
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,920
Let me refresh your memory.

460
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,680
Ziqiao Road,

461
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,830
Dongbing Road,

462
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,400
Shiwulidian,

463
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,310
Xiaguang Street,

464
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,640
and Bianmin Alley.

465
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,240
Here's a tip. Don't take any chances.

466
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,030
There are cameras everywhere in Baizhou.

467
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,310
Every move you make is recorded.

468
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,480
Also,

469
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,640
we found Song Chaoran's
blood and fingerprints

470
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,590
in your car.

471
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,550
Do you want me to continue?

472
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,110
Fine.

473
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,160
I'll confess.

474
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,510
I led my men to beat Song Chaoran up.

475
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,240
Why?

476
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,200
He refused my brother's offer.

477
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,680
My brother has been
worrying about it lately,

478
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,750
so I wanted to teach him a lesson.

479
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,590
But I went overboard

480
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,440
and hit him too hard.

481
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,030
Then why did you move him afterward?

482
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,000
I was afraid the police
would come after me,

483
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,110
so I thought I could move him
like those in TV shows.

484
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,110
All right.

485
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,920
Tell me the details.

486
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,440
Okay.

487
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,720
Ms. Wei,

488
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,440
we can't believe everything Ma Da said.

489
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,960
It's getting late now.

490
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,000
We'll check out
the scene Ma Da mentioned

491
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,920
tomorrow morning.

492
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,510
Why did you ask for me again?

493
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,510
Huh?

494
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,640
I told you

495
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm not answering any of your questions.

496
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,880
I'll be executed soon.

497
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,030
Can't you let me get a good sleep?

498
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,790
We just came back from Tailou City.

499
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,640
Tailou City.

500
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,510
That has nothing to do with me.

501
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,590
We went to meet Coach Liu Aihua.

502
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,920
Why did you meet him?

503
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,200
I have nothing to do with him anymore.

504
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,680
He has a weak heart.

505
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,960
He can't handle stress.

506
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,750
Why did you disturb him?

507
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,510
What do you want?

508
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,110
I borrowed something from him.

509
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,680
I think

510
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,110
you need to see this.

511
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,110
Go!

512
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,350
- Punch him.
- That's right.

513
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,880
Punch him.

514
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,270
Good.

515
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,270
(Brat,)

516
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,830
(well done.)

517
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,880
(Don't be proud.)

518
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,640
(We'll work harder to make it)

519
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,360
(to the national team next year.)

520
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,310
Do you know why Coach Liu Aihua

521
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,070
moved to Tailou City?

522
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,240
He faced controversies

523
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,160
because of you.

524
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,590
I suppose you know very well

525
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,030
what fists mean to a professional boxer,

526
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,160
both inside and outside the ring.

527
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,640
Remember.

528
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,750
We use our fists

529
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,920
to fight for victory in the ring.

530
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,440
Outside the ring,

531
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,720
they become deadly weapons,

532
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,440
so don't use them,

533
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,160
not especially

534
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,510
against laymen.

535
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,350
This is the martial ethic

536
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,830
and dignity.

537
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,240
Dignity of a boxer.

538
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,550
Understood?

539
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

540
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,640
Louder.

541
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,750
- Yes.
- Yes.

542
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,720
That's why he requested
early retirement

543
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,830
and returned to Tailou City.

544
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,310
He's a professional boxing coach,

545
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,920
but his student has become a murderer.

546
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,310
It has nothing to do with him.

547
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,000
He's innocent.

548
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,070
Wang Pu

549
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,160
can do this.

550
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,550
I'm the head coach.

551
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,830
He can do it as I say.

552
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:37,960
Yes.

553
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,480
I know he's 28.

554
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,350
You see,

555
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,680
he's in good shape now.

556
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:46,750
He just needs one win
to build his confidence.

557
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,440
If Wang Pu is eliminated in the first round,

558
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,680
you can take my position away.

559
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,510
How's it?

560
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,400
Does your body feel better lately?

561
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,110
Master,

562
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,310
I want to quit.

563
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,680
Why?

564
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,680
I don't get it.

565
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,200
You're in great shape.

566
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,160
You have the foundation.

567
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,960
You can push a little more.

568
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,440
Master,

569
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,720
there's no way I can ever win.

570
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,160
How is that?

571
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,350
Pacquiao defeated

572
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,790
the unbeaten Thurman at 41.

573
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,880
Mayweather

574
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,110
fought until she was 38.

575
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,750
Your foundation is just
as strong as theirs,

576
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,200
and you're only 28.

577
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,920
Master,

578
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,310
do you even believe what you're saying?

579
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,310
I've had enough over these years.

580
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,000
I worked so hard to train

581
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,200
and recover,

582
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,480
but I kept getting eliminated
in the first round.

583
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,920
I'm just someone else's stepping stone.

584
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,240
I've had enough of all this.

585
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,640
Just hang in there.

586
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,790
Trust me.

587
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,570
Play in the National
City Games this August.

588
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,640
You'll win.

589
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,440
Master,

590
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,350
I don't want to do boxing anymore.

591
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,750
I'm so done.

592
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,790
Do you know what Coach Liu

593
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,440
told us before we left?

594
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,110
He said

595
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,240
Pu was his best student.

596
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,750
He would never kill someone
for no reason.

597
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,200
There had to be a reason.

598
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,960
Do you deserve his trust?

599
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,000
Why did you kill Liu Cheng?

600
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,200
He was a monster.

601
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,400
He was simply a monster.

602
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,070
He was a monster!

603
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,750
He was a monster!

604
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,310
He was a monster!

605
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,240
He was a monster!

606
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,740

37 hours and 46 minutes)
