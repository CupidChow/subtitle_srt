Hello?

00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,620
Honey?

30
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,109
What's wrong, honey?

31
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,869
I...

32
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,300
I killed Meng Zhengyi.

33
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,020
Are you crazy?

34
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,499
I know too many of his secrets.

35
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,220
He won't let me go.

36
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,109
So long as he's alive,

37
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,650
you and our daughter
will never have peace.

38
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,250
Where are you now?

39
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,360
=Lies Never Lie=
=Episode 14=

40
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,780
Yue, here's the case file
you wanted.

41
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,269
Oh wow.

42
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,109
Thank you, sir.

43
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,180
Thanks a lot.

44
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,499
Come over for dinner sometime.
My mom will cook.

45
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,930
- Sounds great. It's a deal.
- All right. Thanks again.

46
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,090
The time, location,
and sequence of events all match up.

47
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,410
Everything checks out.

48
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,709
Yang Shuang, female,
34 years old. She's Xu Jun's wife.

49
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,340
Three years ago, she had a conflict
with Meng Zhengyi.

50
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,499
After the incident,

51
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,779
she tried to flee the province
in Meng Zhengyi's car

52
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,130
but was caught on the spot.

53
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,899
Later, she confessed to killing him
at the crematorium

54
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,930
and disposing of the body
in the incinerator.

55
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,709
This knife was found
in Meng Zhengyi's car.

56
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,579
The DNA test confirms

57
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,989
the blood belongs to him,

58
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,780
making this the murder weapon.

59
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,779
Also,

60
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,619
our tech team found
Yang Shuang's Weibo alternate account.

61
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,780
Take a look.

62
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,059
Her posts

63
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,429
are filled with hatred
toward Meng Zhengyi,

64
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,780
along with extreme and violent language.

65
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,370
A life for a life. Burn to ashes.

66
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,459
A life for a life?

67
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,739
Burn to ashes?

68
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,340
Yeah, the body was pretty much burned.

69
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,880
That's exactly what happened.
A life for a life and burn to ashes.

70
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,229
Since all the evidence points
to Yang Shuang

71
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,819
and she has confessed,

72
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,229
we can close the case.

73
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,669
Not yet. There's still one thing
that doesn't add up.

74
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,229
When Yang Shuang was arrested,
the first thing she said, was admitting

75
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,179
that she killed him.

76
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,349
If she was going
to admit everything so easily,

77
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,020
why did she try to run?

78
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,739
Here's something to think about.

79
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,349
The car

80
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,179
was wiped clean with disinfectant,

81
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,619
right?

82
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,739
The tech team couldn't recover
any biological evidence.

83
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,429
But

84
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,059
why did she miss the evidence,
which is the knife?

85
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,589
That knife wasn't forgotten.

86
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,819
It was left there on purpose.

87
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,379
That's right.

88
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,109
Which means

89
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,059
she will look like the perfect suspect.

90
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,850
And she wasn't running away.

91
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,499
She was staging an escape
to make it look like she was guilty.

92
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,429
So Meng Zhengyi wasn't killed by her.

93
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,780
She went through all this trouble
just to take the blame.

94
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,299
If that's the case,

95
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,429
the only explanation is

96
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,340
that she's protecting someone
more important than herself.

97
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,090
Xu Jun.

98
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,109
She knows exactly
what happened that night.

99
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,700
That means she must have talked
to the real killer.

100
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,699
This is all just speculation.

101
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,259
Right now,

102
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,349
we have no solid evidence to prove

103
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,259
whether it was Xu Jun or Yang Shuang

104
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,490
who left the crematorium that night,

105
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,650
right?

106
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,699
Without evidence,

107
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,970
we can't overturn her confession.

108
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,410
You're right.

109
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,220
Lend me your hair.

110
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,460
I'm going to interrogate Yang Shuang.

111
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,299
Let's go

112
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,410
and see how it goes.

113
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,600
(Interrogation Room)

114
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,530
I've told you everything.

115
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,050
Just arrest me.

116
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,490
No rush.

117
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,229
If you really killed someone,

118
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,739
we wouldn't let you walk free.

119
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,850
I only want to chat.

120
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,220
You have a 9-year-old daughter, right?

121
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,490
She's in fourth grade now?

122
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,940
But I heard she has some disabilities

123
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,850
and often gets bullied by other kids.

124
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,379
Her teacher even suggested

125
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,669
sending her to a special school.

126
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,260
But you refused.

127
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,259
My daughter is not disabled.

128
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,850
All right.

129
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,669
But if you go to prison for murder,

130
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,460
she will be sent to a special school.

131
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,530
What are you trying to say?

132
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,050
I want you

133
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,700
to picture this.

134
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,050
Your daughter finishes school

135
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,610
and waits at the gate
for you to pick her up.

136
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,780
But too bad,

137
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,340
she can never see you again.

138
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,939
All the other kids leave

139
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,549
with their parents,

140
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,259
and she's left standing there alone.

141
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,909
Looking pitiful, and scared.

142
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:58,429
Stop it.

143
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,349
Her teacher will tell her,

144
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,469
"Your mom is in prison for murder.
She's never coming to pick you up again."

145
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,589
Enough!

146
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,410
Then tell me who's the real killer!

147
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,650
I told you I killed him.

148
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,220
I did it.

149
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,380
If I go to prison,

150
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,669
my husband can take care of Qiqi.

151
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,970
I'm not worried.

152
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,850
Are you sure?

153
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,260
Come

154
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,970
and take a look

155
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,290
at what I have here.

156
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,820
That's right.

157
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,580
A strand of hair.

158
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,109
Well,

159
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,589
you did a great job cleaning up
Xu Jun's biological traces

160
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,789
from Meng Zhengyi's car.

161
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,059
But sorry to spoil it for you.

162
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,850
We still found this strand of hair
under the seat.

163
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,940
That's right.

164
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,260
It belongs to Xu Jun.

165
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,939
That means we have undeniable proof
that Xu Jun killed Meng Zhengyi.

166
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,109
Taking the blame
for him now is pointless.

167
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,789
And if you both end up in prison,

168
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,460
who will take care of your daughter?

169
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,029
This is your last chance.

170
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,820
Tell me who's the real killer.

171
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,130
It's 2:45 PM now.

172
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,499
In about an hour,

173
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,370
your daughter will be off school.

174
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,610
I'm sure

175
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,490
she's hoping to see you pick her up.

176
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,460
Fine.

177
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,250
I'll talk.

178
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,970
My husband killed him.

179
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,090
That night, around midnight,

180
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,850
he called me.

181
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,610
I killed someone.

182
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,010
Listen,

183
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,660
I need you to do something for me.

184
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,220
What is it?

185
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,460
I want you to report this to the police.

186
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,899
What?

187
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,469
There are no cameras
on the back road behind our building.

188
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,580
I left Meng Zhengyi's car there.

189
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,060
The knife I used is inside.

190
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,619
Call the police

191
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,229
and tell them I killed someone.

192
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,460
But why?

193
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,250
I'm too scared to turn myself in.

194
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,250
But I can't be on the run
for long either.

195
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,460
They will catch me sooner or later.

196
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,970
If you don't report it,

197
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,539
they might think you're my accomplice.

198
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,700
No, I can't.

199
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,060
I won't do it.

200
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,250
- Just do as I say.
- Where are you?

201
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,989
When can I see you?

202
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,250
You can't get caught.

203
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,820
If you're caught,
who will take care of Qiqi?

204
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,370
Just do what I say.

205
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,490
I struggled with the decision for two days.

206
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,010
I just couldn't bring myself
to call the police.

207
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,370
I thought

208
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,420
since the body
was already burned to ashes,

209
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,660
there shouldn't be any evidence left.

210
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,940
That meant you wouldn't be able
to trace it back to Xu Jun.

211
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,970
Maybe after some time,

212
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,940
he could come home

213
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,090
when everything has settled down.

214
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,940
But the next day, you found me.

215
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,940
I knew I couldn't wait any longer.

216
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,940
Where is Xu Jun now?

217
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,220
I don't know.

218
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,949
You destroyed evidence in the car
and tried to take the fall for him.

219
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,989
What you did makes you an accomplice

220
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,379
and criminally responsible.

221
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,779
If you really want to protect
your daughter and your family,

222
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,480
the best thing you can do now is cooperate
with the police investigation

223
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,739
and give us more information.

224
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,469
That's the only way
you can help yourself.

225
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,180
I really don't know.

226
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,069
I haven't heard from him
since that night.

227
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,229
I've called him so many times,
but his phone is off.

228
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,809
I can't find him.

229
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,569
(Police)

230
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,419
(Police)

231
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,220
Is she telling the truth?

232
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,349
Her daughter is her weak spot.

233
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,490
She cares about her more than anything.

234
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,739
When we showed her that hair sample,

235
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,229
she completely panicked.

236
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,130
She thought we had solid proof
against Xu Jun.

237
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,970
She's cooperating

238
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,250
because she wants
to stay with her daughter.

239
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,420
But if Xu Jun wanted her
to call the police,

240
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,820
why didn't he turn himself in?

241
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,370
Was he just scared?

242
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,540
That seems too simple.

243
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,970
Yeah, something
about this doesn't add up.

244
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:51,090
She said Meng Zhengyi hired someone
to kill Xu Jun three years ago.

245
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,300
Why would he do that?

246
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,610
You think this is connected
to Ning Jing's case?

247
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,139
Let's go.

248
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,109
Where?

249
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,420
To pick up her daughter.

250
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:22,869
Look,

251
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,949
there are so many fish in there.

252
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,779
Red ones, big golden ones too,

253
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,850
right?

254
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,580
Aren't they pretty?

255
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,250
It's time to eat!

256
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,060
Coming!

257
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,250
Let's go and have dinner.

258
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,370
I'll do it.

259
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,250
Thank you.

260
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:21,090
Let's eat first.
You can draw later, okay?

261
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,189
Wow, what are you drawing?

262
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,589
Mommy and Qiqi.

263
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,770
That's lovely.

264
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,340
Flip to the next page.

265
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,540
Daddy.

266
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,940
Mommy.

267
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,820
Qiqi.

268
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,700
- This one?
- Why did you draw so many?

269
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,130
Daddy.

270
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,820
Mommy.

271
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,010
Qiqi.

272
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,139
There are more?

273
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,940
Wow, that's really good.

274
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,250
Daddy.

275
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,370
Mommy.

276
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,709
Qiqi.

277
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,970
Daddy is wearing a watch.

278
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,829
A watch? The pretty lady has one too.

279
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,660
- I have one too.
- It looks nice.

280
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,460
I want one too. Draw one for me.

281
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,989
It's 5:15 PM.

282
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,130
So it's dinner time.

283
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,660
Let's eat.

284
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,309
Here.

285
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,580
Eat a little more.

286
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,460
Open wide.

287
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,659
Eat slowly.

288
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,970
Something's not right

289
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,890
about some parts of these drawings.

290
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,580
Qiqi, eat by yourself.

291
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,940
Look at these.

292
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,309
It looks like

293
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,130
Xu Jun is doing something.

294
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,890
Xu Jun and his family
are at an aquarium.

295
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,220
And look at this one.

296
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,540
There are a lot of them.

297
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:56,970
Here's another one.

298
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,739
Xu Jun is cooking.

299
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,180
In all these drawings,

300
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,109
he's either working out,

301
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,189
cooking,

302
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,580
or playing with his daughter.

303
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,499
Don't you think

304
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,090
he seems to have a positive attitude
about life?

305
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,019
Let's check
every little corner carefully.

306
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,970
Yes, madam.

307
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,899
Gym membership card, swimming pass,

308
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,069
family club card...

309
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,580
Captain Ding, look.

310
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:43,580
He sure signed up for a lot of things.

311
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,340
And all of these were registered
not long after he got out of prison.

312
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,660
That doesn't seem like someone who
was plotting revenge on Meng Zhengyi.

313
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,970
Yeah, he seemed to enjoy living.

314
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,090
Mochou, find anything on your end?

315
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,090
A phone book?

316
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,730
Ms. Li, does anyone still use this?

317
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,660
The more important something is,
the more people will write it down.

318
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,139
Check again over there.

319
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,300
Okay.

320
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,420
I found something.

321
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,490
Xu Jun knew Zeng Xiang.

322
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,490
Three years ago,
Meng Zhengyi hired a hitman to kill him.

323
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,340
This is probably the reason.

324
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,850
It's certain now.

325
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,779
Meng Zhengyi
was behind Ning Jing's case.

326
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,820
What a huge setup.

327
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,619
No wonder we found no trace
of Meng Zhengyi contacting Zeng Xiang

328
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,180
when searching Zeng Xiang's workplace.

329
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,259
Because Meng Zhengyi
never contacted him directly at all.

330
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,529
He has been using Xu Jun
to communicate with him.

331
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:49,640
(Meng Zhengyi. Xu Jun. Ning Zhiyuan)

332
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,779
But there's one thing I don't get.

333
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,779
Meng Zhengyi was a scheming

334
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,940
and ruthless man.

335
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,259
Why would someone like him

336
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,229
take the risk of doing something foolish

337
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,090
and showing up alone
in the middle of the night?

338
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,700
Master,

339
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,179
it's the middle of the night

340
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,100
and this place gives me the creeps.

341
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,659
After handling so many cases,
you're still scared?

342
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,860
Well, we can always turn on
some lights. right?

343
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,789
Master.

344
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,349
Hm?

345
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,290
Did you notice something?

346
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,970
If Xu Jun really killed
Meng Zhengyi here

347
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,620
and dragged him into the incinerator,

348
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,549
there should be traces of blood

349
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,829
around the furnace

350
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,420
or on the door handle.

351
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,899
But this area is spotless.

352
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,220
There's nothing at all.

353
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,050
Tiaotiao, why is that?

354
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,900
Does that mean...

355
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,700
He went in by himself?

356
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,420
He climbed in himself?

357
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,180
Let himself be burned alive?

358
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,900
If someone was burned alive,

359
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,770
they would definitely struggle.

360
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,730
I'm going in.

361
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:05,869
Be careful.

362
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,970
Okay.

363
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,660
If the victim was alive
before being burned,

364
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,620
he would have been in agony, curled up,

365
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,010
and thrashed around.

366
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,220
Look at this.

367
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,770
What is it?

368
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,869
These are Qiqi's latest drawings.

369
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,380
She asked me to give them to you.

370
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,100
Thank you.

371
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,509
I noticed

372
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,380
that Qiqi's dad is wearing a watch
in every drawing.

373
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,220
Does it have

374
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,179
any special meaning to him?

375
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,570
Qiqi gave it to her dad as a gift.

376
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,010
Qiqi has loved drawing
since she was little.

377
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,979
So we signed her up
for a drawing competition,

378
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,050
and she won first prize.

379
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,810
The watch was her reward.

380
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,900
So she gave it to her dad.

381
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,899
He has worn it ever since

382
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,770
and never took it off.

383
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,700
Never took it off?

384
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,460
He always thinks

385
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,899
it was his fault

386
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,860
that Qiqi ended up like this.

387
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,770
That's why he often feels guilty.

388
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,050
That watch meant everything to him.

389
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,380
He would never lose it,
not even in death.

390
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,570
Can you take a look at this?

391
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,250
This...

392
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,570
Isn't this...

393
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,010
We found this watch face

394
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,420
in the incinerator.

395
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,010
The killer is Meng Zhengyi.
Issue an immediate warrant for his arrest.

396
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,380
The owner of this watch face was Xu Jun.

397
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,970
It was a final clue he left for us.

398
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,320
(Xu Jun)

399
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,420
Hello?

400
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,460
I killed someone.

401
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,509
So the call Yang Shuang received
wasn't from Xu Jun

402
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,290
after he killed someone.

403
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,380
It was before he died.

404
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,420
This was all part
of Meng Zhengyi's plan.

405
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:28,029
He wanted Yang Shuang
to believe Xu Jun killed him

406
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,700
and made her call the police.

407
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,659
Meng Zhengyi disappears from the world

408
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,460
and his biggest threat, Xu Jun,
is completely wiped out.

409
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,490
A perfect setup
for killing two birds with one stone.

410
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,970
I killed someone.

411
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,860
I switched shifts with Li

412
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,900
and lured that scum Meng
to the crematorium.

413
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,770
When he let his guard down,

414
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,180
I stabbed him

415
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,660
and threw him into the incinerator.

416
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,050
Then...

417
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,700
Then I destroyed the body.

418
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,290
From now on,

419
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,699
you and Qiqi can finally live in peace

420
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,109
without any worries.

421
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,419
Where are you?

422
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,509
When can I see you?

423
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,660
Where's Qiqi?

424
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,100
She's already asleep.

425
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,420
Honey, when can I see you?

426
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,490
There's not much time left.

427
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,330
Soon enough, you'll have a wonderful life.

428
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,800
Five million yuan has already been transferred
to an overseas account under Yang Shuang's name.

429
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,290
When they reach there a month later,

430
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,940
I'll find the best doctors
to treat Qiqi.

431
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,700
You better take good care of Qiqi.

432
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,380
If you don't,

433
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,810
I'll return as a ghost

434
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,460
and haunt you forever.

435
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,290
Honey,

436
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,660
I have to go now.

437
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,530
I love you both.

438
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,940
Qiqi.

439
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,700
Daddy!

440
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,660
Daddy!

441
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,900
Daddy!

442
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,100
Daddy!

443
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,699
Xu Jun believed he was a failure

444
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,530
because he couldn't give
his daughter a good life,

445
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,860
and he didn't have the money
to pay for her treatment.

446
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,770
So he compromised with Meng Zhengyi,

447
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,309
trading his life for his wife

448
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,730
and daughter's future.

449
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,699
Captain Ding.

450
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,789
Report to Chief Ou and request
full police support to arrest Meng Zhengyi.

451
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,940
Yes, madam.

452
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:11,200
(Serve the People)

453
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,770
Mommy.

454
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:46,660
Mommy, look! I have a new watch.

455
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,700
It's beautiful.

456
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,530
When Daddy comes back,

457
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:59,180
I'm going to show it to him!

458
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,100
You two, head down.

459
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,460
- You guys, go up.
- Yes, madam.

460
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,020
No one has been living in this house
for a long time.

461
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,730
Ms. Wei, there's no one here.

462
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,940
No one up here too.

463
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,460
Captain Ding, come take a look at this.

464
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,800
(Drowning? Captain Ning Jing.
Big fire. Beach Resort. Poison?)

465
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,240
(Drowning? Captain Ning Jing.
Big fire. Beach Resort. Poison?)

466
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:05,760
(Drowning? Captain Ning Jing.
Big fire. Beach Resort. Poison?)

467
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,619
(Zeng Xiang, Age 30. Cut wrist?
Drug arrest, 2017. Fumes poisoning?)

468
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,459
Find anything?

469
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,010
Read all these.

470
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,459
"She's a runaway girl.

471
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,619
Her heart is love.

472
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,829
Sorry,

473
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,570
I can't make it to the ball.

474
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,349
Come to the board meeting with me
next Tuesday."

475
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,320
(Family Massacre. Kunpeng Chairman.
Bao Xijie, 54. Haitian Grand Hotel 888.)

476
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:31,979
"Sorry,

477
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,570
I can't make it to the ball.

478
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:37,129
Come to the board meeting with me
next Tuesday."

479
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:41,040
(Xu Jun. Accident? Sleep meds overdose?
2019, bar fight. 2022, incinerated)

480
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:49,120
(Extreme sports? Gas poisoning?)

481
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,220
Mochou,

482
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:01,970
