Can you say something?

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,910
Where's my sister?

30
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,000
Can you say something?

31
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,280
The suspect, Zeng Xiang,

32
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,870
was arrested five years ago
for drug-related crimes.

33
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,310
So, he harbored hatred toward
Ning Jing, the police officer

34
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,520
who was on that case.

35
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,120
Thus, he sought revenge crazily.

36
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,240
Captain Ning Jing
from Criminal Investigation Team

37
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,630
died on duty while solving this case.

38
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,680
We've lost the best police officer.

39
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,360
You rejected Zhiyuan many times.

40
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,310
But that foolish child
still thinks naively

41
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,960
that it's not just friendship

42
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,630
between the two of you.

43
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,470
You can help me
explain it to Ning Zhiyuan.

44
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,240
But he doesn't believe me.

45
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,274
(Mochou, what are you doing?)

46
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,698
(Mochou, pick up.)

47
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:53,700
(Can we meet up?)

48
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
I'm looking for Mochou.

49
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,910
I know that she's back.

50
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,980
Right? She must be inside.

51
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,000
Zhiyuan.

52
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,870
Listen to me.

53
00:03:59,310 --> 00:03:59,960
She's not here.

54
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,310
She's out on a mission.

55
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,240
Where is she now?

56
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,190
You know

57
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,870
that we have rules.

58
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,310
He has left.

59
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,120
Mochou.

60
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,070
Hang in there.

61
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,070
Ning Jing!

62
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,800
Mochou.

63
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,120
Mochou.

64
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,000
Chief Jia.

65
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,560
I wish to apply for a transfer.

66
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,220
=Lies Never Lie=
=Episode 2=

67
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,510
I found her!

68
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,600
I found her before you.

69
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,560
That's because
we worked together very well.

70
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,190
Yifei, are you okay?

71
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,040
What took you so long?

72
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,950
- I was scared.
- I came here right away.

73
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,360
Where's my sister?

74
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,830
Let me look at you.

75
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,240
Are you hurt?

76
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
Hang in there.

77
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,870
Ning Jing!

78
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,600
Mochou.

79
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,480
Luckily, you are fine.

80
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,390
You are different from the female

81
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,510
entrepreneur I imagined.

82
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,240
How am I different?

83
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,510
Way younger.

84
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,040
You look like a university student.

85
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,750
I'll take that as a compliment.

86
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,120
Thank you, Officer Li.

87
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,990
Thank you for saving my girlfriend.

88
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,390
If it's okay,

89
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,480
we'll go to the hospital.

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,950
Do you know him?

91
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,600
Yes.

92
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,680
I do.

93
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,000
Let me reintroduce myself.

94
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Ding Wei, from Team B.

95
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,920
I have things to do. Gotta go.

96
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,600
Okay.

97
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,190
Ms. Li.

98
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,070
You are amazing.

99
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,270
Can you teach me?

100
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,830
Will it be too late for someone like me

101
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,150
who has no psychology background?

102
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,950
Of course not.

103
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,800
Besides,

104
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,630
how did you find out from him

105
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,190
that she was on the fishing boat?

106
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,310
Well.

107
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,510
Tell us.

108
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,240
Tell us.

109
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,920
It's not that hard.

110
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,510
Since the beginning, Yuan Xi

111
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,630
has already set up
a countdown game of catch.

112
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,070
He just wants to play with the cops.

113
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,240
So, the more nervous we are,

114
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,240
the more excited he is.

115
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,270
So, you chatted with him
about geography.

116
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,950
Yes. But it was not
just a pointless chat.

117
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,310
I just roughly use

118
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,360
some locations in Baizhou

119
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,310
to eliminate some of the places
the hostage may be hidden.

120
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,120
I see.

121
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,310
You are amazing.

122
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,430
Can you teach me?

123
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,360
It was my first time

124
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,560
knowing the distance
from the east to the west

125
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,800
and from the south to the north.

126
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,870
I was shocked.

127
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,870
I firstly seeing
that kind of interrogation.

128
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,000
To be honest,
those were just random numbers.

129
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:07,920
What?

130
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,870
Yes.

131
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,510
Until we talked about his childhood.

132
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,720
I found that he reacted.

133
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,000
So, I asked him
if he wanted water or coffee.

134
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,360
And I made the decision for him.

135
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,120
At that moment,

136
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,680
I succeeded in bringing him

137
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,870
into a game I set.

138
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,310
Actually, psychology can't

139
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,800
be the only basis in solving cases.

140
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,430
It can only provide more clues
and give a direction.

141
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,270
It's an aid.

142
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,390
What?

143
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,270
Okay. I got it.

144
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,480
Yuan Xi committed suicide.

145
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,910
There's poison in his teeth.

146
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,480
So, he was ready

147
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,080
to die

148
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,320
before telling you the location
of the hostage.

149
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,030
But how is that related to "seven"?

150
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,510
Yuan Xi

151
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,360
is quite pitiful.

152
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,750
When he was seven,

153
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,750
he injected his mother with an overdose,

154
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,750
leading to her death.

155
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,030
It traumatized him.

156
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,240
That's one of the reasons
why he was mentally twisted.

157
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,320
Yes.

158
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,750
The six previous victims

159
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,480
were related to "seven" as well.

160
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,960
And all those six deceased

161
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,240
sold addictive products.

162
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,270
But Tianxiang Group
is a pharmaceutical company.

163
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,150
Many medications
can lead to addiction too.

164
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,360
Captain Ding.

165
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,510
Thank you for being my eyes.

166
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,200
Zhiyuan.

167
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,630
Zhiyuan.

168
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,390
You are awake.

169
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,240
Why do I feel like you are distracted?

170
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,200
What's wrong?

171
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Just now, I was thinking

172
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,960
what I would do
if I lost you forever.

173
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,390
You dummy.

174
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,840
Look.

175
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,510
I'm all well now.

176
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,750
Are you done peeling?

177
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,480
It's so sweet.

178
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,270
Zhiyuan.

179
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,200
The police officer just now,

180
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,670
Li Mochou,

181
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,600
do you know her?

182
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,870
Chief Jia.

183
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,670
I spent one year looking for Mochou.

184
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,120
I sent her countless messages.

185
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,250
She didn't reply any of them.

186
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,840
She didn't go home too.

187
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,120
Why she's acting like this?

188
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,850
As if she has changed
into another person.

189
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,240
Our company has decided
to collaborate with Thailand.

190
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,480
I'll leave tomorrow.

191
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,000
She used to be

192
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
my sister's colleague.

193
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,240
The three of us were very close.

194
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,790
I haven't seen her in a long time.

195
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,750
She's like an old friend.

196
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,600
It's okay. I'm just asking.

197
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,750
You don't have to tell me everything.

198
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,550
I trust you.

199
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,390
Mr. Qiu, it was a near-miss
for Ms. Luo this time.

200
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,510
Yes.

201
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,440
Her ward is there.

202
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,270
Okay.

203
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,080
Mr. Ning, you are here.

204
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,080
Shouldn't I be here, Mr. Meng?

205
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,320
How's Yifei right now?

206
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,120
She's doing okay.

207
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,360
She's resting now.

208
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Let me introduce.

209
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,600
He is Mr. Qiu from the Dazhou Group.

210
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,200
He is Tianxiang's strategic
business partner, Ning Zhiyuan.

211
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,000
Mr. Ning.

212
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

213
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,000
Is Yifei still sleeping?

214
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,390
Yes.

215
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,440
Mr. Qiu.

216
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,790
I'm really sorry.

217
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,910
Ms. Luo is still sleeping.

218
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,360
I'll ask my assistant
to take you to the resting area.

219
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,910
- I'll leave you to it.
- Let me have a few words with Mr. Ning.

220
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,150
- Okay.
- Thank you.

221
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,200
Zhiyuan.

222
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,150
Come.

223
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,870
I hear that you've been
on business trips.

224
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,510
Yes. I just came back from Xiamen.

225
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,440
You've worked hard.

226
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,630
Ning Zhiyuan.

227
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,840
If I were you,

228
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,240
I would murder Yuan Xi.

229
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,600
He has been arrested by the police.

230
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,910
If it weren't for them,
Yifei would be dead now.

231
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,670
I've always known that you are a coward.

232
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,480
Let me tell you.

233
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,840
Yifei is not an ordinary girl.

234
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,600
You better stay away from her.

235
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:07,910
Hey.

236
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,000
Captain Yue.

237
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,720
I saw someone delivering
a banner to us just now.

238
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,320
I've heard about it.

239
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,360
Look.

240
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,390
Banners are great.

241
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,200
(Serving the People without Fear)
But things are not one-sided.

242
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,150
(Serve the People)

243
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,360
What do fewer banners mean?

244
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,150
It means that there are fewer cases.

245
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,390
Fewer cases mean better public security.

246
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,600
Right?

247
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,200
We have to be humble

248
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,600
even after achieving great things.

249
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,550
Right? Someone fights for fame.

250
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,120
What do you fight for?

251
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,790
I fight for the people.

252
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,790
- Or what else?
- Hah.

253
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,440
Ms. Wei.

254
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,390
This is the information
for the meeting later.

255
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,360
Ms. Li, let me pour you a cup of coffee.

256
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,080
You don't have to be so kind.

257
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,720
By the way.

258
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,150
Yes?

259
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,630
It seems like you are interested
in psychology.

260
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,240
I've compiled
some information on psychology.

261
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,270
You can take a look.

262
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,510
I don't know if you'll
be interested in studying it.

263
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,910
Thank you.

264
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,000
Also, if I want to drink coffee,

265
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,870
I'll make it myself.

266
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,960
You don't have to do it.

267
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,960
Okay.

268
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,790
Mr. Meng.

269
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,320
This way, please.

270
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,550
Chief Ou.

271
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,240
Ding Wei.

272
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,440
Yue Qun.

273
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,750
- Master.
- Come.

274
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,510
Let me introduce this man to you.

275
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,080
He is Meng Zhengyi,
from Tianxiang Group.

276
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,320
He's here to express his thanks.

277
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,480
I'm here on behalf
of the group and myself

278
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,030
to thank all of you today.

279
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,670
Thank you for rescuing Ms. Luo.

280
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,360
Thank you.

281
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,670
We were just doing our duty.

282
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,000
This...

283
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,030
You are too kind.

284
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,630
No need for it.

285
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,250
You deserve it.

286
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,320
This is huge.

287
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,240
A role model in solving cases

288
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,270
and serving the people.

289
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:54,840
To...

290
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,080
Officer Li Mochou.

291
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,270
They wrote it wrongly.

292
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,270
Nonsense.

293
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,840
It's because of everyone
that we managed to save Ms. Luo.

294
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,840
It's wrong.

295
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,670
Hang it up.

296
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,080
Keep quiet.

297
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:13,750
Ms. Li.

298
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,630
Hang it up?

299
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,600
I've heard about everything.

300
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,030
If it wasn't for you,

301
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,200
they wouldn't have found
that boat quickly. Thank you.

302
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,270
You are too kind.

303
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,120
You solved the case with psychology.

304
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,080
You are extraordinary.

305
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,320
Are you new to Baizhou, Ms. Li?

306
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,440
Yes.

307
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,360
If you need any help
or face any trouble,

308
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,390
you can come to me.

309
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,790
I can't solve cases.

310
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,320
But I can do my best to help you

311
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,840
run some errands.

312
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,030
I see.

313
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,910
Meng Zhengyi.

314
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,480
Thank you.

315
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,000
Please take care of us.

316
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,940
Thank you.

317
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,440
Chief Ou, it's almost time.

318
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,870
I'll get ready with the meeting.

319
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,670
Okay.

320
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:03,960
Chief Ou.

321
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,590
I won't disturb you further
from doing your work.

322
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,160
See you.

323
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,550
Bye.

324
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,160
Goodbye.

325
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,170
Okay. Let me see you out.

326
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:10,830
Goodbye.

327
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,030
Mr. Meng.

328
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,260
(A Role Model in Solving Cases)

329
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,680
Welcome.

330
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,680
Welcome.

331
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,920
Sir.

332
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,030
Are you okay?

333
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,160
Madam.

334
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,400
Sir.

335
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,880
Help!

336
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,310
Anybody? Help!

337
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,270
Captain Ding.

338
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,550
Are you not coming in tomorrow?

339
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,920
Why act so diligent?

340
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,310
You're staying here?

341
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,880
Exploit the station?

342
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,000
Before I came here,

343
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,900
I already rented a house.

344
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,310
But I don't like it after seeing it.

345
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,830
So, I've decided to stay
at the station for two more days.

346
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,270
You are too picky.

347
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,270
Pack your things.

348
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,240
You can stay at my house.

349
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,750
I don't want to intrude.

350
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,510
You don't seem reluctant.

351
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,110
Thank you.

352
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,160
Oh.

353
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,200
Captain Ding.

354
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,000
Is Meng Zhengyi, from Tianxiang Group

355
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,400
close to the station?

356
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,070
Tianxiang Group
is the leading enterprise of Baizhou.

357
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,960
So, our superiors take it seriously.

358
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,720
But I have received some information.

359
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,480
Although Luo Yifei

360
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
is the chairwoman of Tianxiang Group,

361
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,720
the man who holds real power
is Meng Zhengyi.

362
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,000
I see.

363
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,830
Have you dabbled in psychology before?

364
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,680
I studied criminal psychology
when I was in the police academy.

365
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,480
What does it have to do with him?

366
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Of course it does.

367
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,440
At least he knows a bit of it.

368
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,400
Otherwise,

369
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,750
why he gave me such a huge banner

370
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,720
on my first day
at Baizhou Police Station?

371
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,200
I'm very sure he knows

372
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,000
you are the real backbone
of Baizhou Police Station.

373
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,480
So, he was trying
to drive a wedge between us

374
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,680
by using the most common
human emotion, jealousy.

375
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,480
I don't think

376
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,310
you should worry.

377
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,240
With how blatant he was,

378
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,990
I could tell that he had
an ulterior motive.

379
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,510
Hello?

380
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
Okay. I got it.

381
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,960
We can't go home now.

382
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,200
Let's go to the crime scene.

383
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,680
A murder in the Haitian Grand Hotel.

384
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,070
Bao Xijie, male.

385
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,110
Age, 54. The chairman of Kunpeng Group.

386
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,480
He Xin, female.

387
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,640
Age, 51. Bai Xijie's wife.

388
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,830
Bao Wenxuan, male.

389
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,510
Age, 22.

390
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,070
Bao Xijie and He Xin's only son.

391
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,480
It was Bao Xijie's
54th birthday yesterday.

392
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,070
The family came here to celebrate.

393
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,920
All three victims have
dozens of stab wounds.

394
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,090
Large blood vessels ruptured.

395
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,510
They died from blood loss.

396
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,550
Further examination is needed.

397
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,880
A crime of passion.

398
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,640
A vendetta.

399
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,000
This is too vicious.

400
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,920
This is not a common vendetta.

401
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,550
This is deep hatred.

402
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,030
Captain Ding, Liu, take a look at this.

403
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,070
What is this?

404
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,590
After he killed them,

405
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,480
the murderer must
have taken something away.

406
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,070
Judging from the shape,
it can be a luggage bag.

407
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,510
Such a brutal killing method.

408
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,350
It must have caused quite a stir.

409
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,330
Where are the witnesses?

410
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,640
This is the worst part.

411
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,110
This hotel

412
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,250
is very well enclosed.

413
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,150
Good sound insulation.

414
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,790
No one noticed anything
until the server

415
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,790
brought their food over.

416
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,160
This is a big hotel

417
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,790
with crowds.

418
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,160
But no one noticed anything?

419
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,440
Ms. Wei.

420
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,720
This is the record of everyone
who came here yesterday.

421
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,550
Including staff, customers,

422
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,000
the pick-up of the kitchen,

423
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,960
and the take-out.

424
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,550
Nothing seems out of sorts.

425
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,440
Take it back and check.

426
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,790
Okay.

427
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,510
The CCTV footage?

428
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,480
We didn't find any suspicious men.

429
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,240
This is such a mystery.

430
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,590
The murderer appeared out of thin air,

431
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,680
murdered three people,

432
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,920
and vanished.

433
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,270
Impossible.

434
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,270
When I get changed just now,

435
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,720
I took a look around this floor.

436
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,590
There are dozens of CCTV cameras
on this floor alone.

437
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,880
And the server left
for only five minutes.

438
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,070
He killed all three people
within five minutes

439
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,400
without making a noise.

440
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,400
This murderer must be very calm.

441
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,880
Besides, he must have visited
this place again and again

442
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,070
to plan out his murder.

443
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,920
But the crime scene looks chaotic.

444
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,960
These two aspects
are very contradictory.

445
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,400
Is it possible that the murderer
had everything planned out,

446
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,590
but lost control when he saw

447
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,790
his enemies?

448
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,240
No.

449
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,350
The murdered stabbed them messily
to create an illusion.

450
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,000
By the way,

451
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,880
is there anything in common
between the wounds of them?

452
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,680
Ms. Li is right.

453
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,480
Look.

454
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,440
Their carotid arteries were severed.

455
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,550
But the stab wounds
on their bodies are messy

456
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,590
with different depths.

457
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,310
But the wounds
on the carotid artery were clean.

458
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,200
A fatal stab.

459
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,350
Any news?

460
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,110
Ms. Li, what's wrong?

461
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,960
Let me summarize it.

462
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,310
This is not a crime of passion.

463
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,240
He's professional.

464
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,880
A professional assassin?

465
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,270
Come in.

466
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,960
I never thought

467
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,440
that your house would be so clean.

468
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,550
It's fine.

469
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,590
I didn't clean it.

470
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,880
My parents will clean my house
every now and then.

471
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,110
You can sleep in my room.

472
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,720
Well... No.

473
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,790
I can sleep on the sofa.

474
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,750
Stop it.

475
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,680
We have a guest room.

476
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,160
I'll take a shower first.

477
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,550
You should unpack and take a rest.

478
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,880
We'll analyze the case tomorrow.

479
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,030
You should've told me earlier.

480
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,790
Mochou.

481
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,270
Yes?

482
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,830
Let me tell you something.

483
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,200
Okay.

484
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,550
When two objects connect,

485
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,960
something will be transferred.

486
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,680
When something is taken away,

487
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,550
something will be left behind.

488
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,640
Okay.

489
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,720
Have some water.

490
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,680
This is too complicated.

491
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,720
To put it simply,

492
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,310
you'll always pay

493
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,350
for what you've done.

494
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,480
Don't make it sound so mysterious.

495
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,440
Good comprehensive skills.

496
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,640
Of course.

497
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:54,960
Wait.

498
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,030
Let me ask you this.

499
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,240
If we follow your logic,

500
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,640
why are there still

501
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,510
so many unsolved cases in this world?

502
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,880
Because we are not attentive enough.

503
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,440
So, we haven't found the clues.

504
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,750
You're attentive enough.

505
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,270
Oh, my.

506
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,880
You are the most
attentive person in the world.

507
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,030
Looks like being a doc
has changed you.

508
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,550
You are the most attentive one.

509
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,920
How dare you kick your master.

510
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,830
No.

511
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,030
What is the meaning of this?

512
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,440
Li Mochou, are you done unpacking?

513
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,070
I'm coming.

514
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,640
Bao Xijie

515
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,880
has a criminal history.

516
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,920
A criminal history?

517
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,550
He was earning black money.

518
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,920
But he changed after he became successful.

519
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,270
And he did a lot of charity.

520
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,680
The real kind of charity.

521
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,880
It means that this person felt guilty

522
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,830
about his previous acts.

523
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,510
So, he must have lived
with a sense of atonement.

524
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,070
People like him shouldn't
have too many enemies.

525
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,790
We investigated his social relations.

526
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,160
We didn't find anything abnormal.

527
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,310
We didn't find any useless clues
at the crime scene too.

528
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,590
Sigh.

529
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,070
I can't find any clues.

530
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,440
I don't believe in a perfect crime.

531
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,310
I have a way to catch him.

532
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:35,920
This is...

533
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,590
How is it?

534
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,400
Any news?

535
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,480
Carotid artery laceration.

536
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,310
If nothing was blocking the blade,

537
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,000
I would be dead.

538
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,880
What are you saying?

539
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,880
The murderer who assassinated me

540
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,790
might be the same man

541
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,000
who murdered Bao Xijie.

542
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,200
What is your plan?

543
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,160
He didn't manage to kill me.

544
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,030
If I show up in front of him again,

545
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,990
I'm sure he'll come for me once more.

546
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,830
What's the reason?

547
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,070
Back then, he only cut me once.

548
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,640
And he left without a backward glance.

549
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,680
If he had cut me again,

550
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,070
I would be dead on the spot.

551
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,030
What does that mean?

552
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,350
He's confident.

553
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,720
Extremely confident.

554
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,880
And me being alive

555
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
is the biggest challenge
for his confidence.

556
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,550
Based on the current clues that we have,

557
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,720
it's hard for us to capture
this professional assassin.

558
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,550
So, we can only throw out the bait

559
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,590
and let him to take a bite.

560
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,510
No.

561
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,790
I will be fine.

562
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,350
Impossible.

563
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,270
Captain Ding.

564
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,200
Think of this

565
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,960
as doing me a favor.

566
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,240
This man is very important to me.

567
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,070
I have to catch him.

568
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,160
I'll catch him too.

569
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,000
But not by risking
the life of my comrade.

570
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,550
Hello, Zhao.

571
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,510
I am Mochou.

572
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,240
I would like to ask you for a favor.

573
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,590
(Zeng Xiang,
Professional Assassin)

574
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,860
(Arrested five years ago,
harbored hatred toward Ning Jing.)

575
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,160
Smells good.

576
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,790
You're such a good cook.

577
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,960
Wash up and get ready to eat.

578
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,110
I've washed up.

579
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,070
Here.

580
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,400
Okay.

581
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,070
Thank you.

582
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,830
By the way,

583
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,400
you are new here in Baizhou.

584
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,160
They say that this can

585
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,120
make you feel better.

586
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,200
Give it a taste.

587
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,160
Captain Ding.

588
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,000
This porridge is delicious.

589
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,920
And it takes a lot of time to cook it.

590
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,720
You must have woken up
very early to make it.

591
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,880
Actually, my best dish
is soy-braised pork.

592
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,310
I'll make it for you someday.

593
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,070
You are new here.

594
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,310
I'm in charge of your safety.

595
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,310
So, I hope that you can be understanding

596
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,310
and give me time.

597
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:55,750
Okay?

598
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,510
Okay.

599
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,160
You gave me a fright.

600
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,790
When will you be done?

601
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,640
I'm famished.

602
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,310
Soon.

603
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,160
Wait for me.

604
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,030
One dish is done.

605
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,160
Let me serve it up for you.

606
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
Okay?

607
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,750
Let me help

608
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,550
you cutting.

609
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,510
You don't have to.

610
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,070
Be good.

611
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:20,960
Okay.

612
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,920
Here.

613
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,720
Give it a taste.

614
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,200
This is your reward.

615
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,310
Thank you.

616
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,680
How is it?

617
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,510
It's tasty.

618
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,030
Do you know?

619
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,920
The man, Yuan Xi, who kidnapped me,

620
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,880
is dead.

621
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,000
I thought he was arrested.

622
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,240
How is he dead?

623
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,960
I don't know.

624
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,590
Ning Zhiyuan.

625
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,880
If I were you, I would murder Yuan Xi.

626
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,200
Don't think too much.

627
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,880
That person deserves it.

628
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,400
Oh.

629
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,550
It's a WeChat message from Zhengyi,
read it for me.

630
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:25,000
Are professional assassins really like
the killers in the movies?

631
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,240
Yes. Professional assassins exist.

632
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,680
Once, when I attended the Interpol
Psychological Crime Conference,

633
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,590
Ms. Mochou.

634
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,510
I almost got killed

635
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,640
from neck laceration.

636
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,480
But fortunately, I survived.

637
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,480
Do you know
how many rules you broke

638
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
with your actions today?

639
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,510
How about I write you a detailed report?

640
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,110
Is this about a report?

641
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,270
You exposed yourself online.

642
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,030
Do you know
how much danger you'll be in?

643
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,750
I trust you.

644
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,350
You say that you'll
protect your comrade.

645
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,550
You just went ahead with it

646
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,680
to force me to cooperate.

647
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,640
Captain Ding,
I know I shouldn't do this.

648
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,160
But I have my reasons.

649
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,160
I need to find this person.

650
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,110
You will cooperate with me.

651
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,400
Right?

652
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,590
Starting now, you are
not allowed to get involved

653
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,640
in any cases for a month.

654
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,350
Also, you can only stay in our house.

655
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,510
As for the rest,
I'll report it to Chief Ou.
