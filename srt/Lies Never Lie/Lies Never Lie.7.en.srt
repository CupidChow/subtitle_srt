Chaoran.

29
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,950
Next time, knock before you come in.

30
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,519
Aren't you looking for land

31
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,479
to build a warehouse?

32
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,950
I found a place for you.

33
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,240
That fast?

34
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,040
Here's the address.

35
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,990
Go and check it out this afternoon.

36
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,870
You're not coming?

37
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,319
I have an appointment.
I'll head over after it's over.

38
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,240
Okay.

39
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,039
All right. I'll take my leave first.

40
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,990
Okay.

41
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,980
(Diaoyuzui Alley, Xinhua District.
No. 15, Xinghua Factory)

42
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,240
You spent 100,000 yuan to hire a hitman.

43
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,270
You got what you wanted.

44
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,110
I didn't hire a killer.
I never paid anyone to kill him.

45
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,799
I just wanted to teach him a lesson.

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,849
Isn't Song Chaoran doing fine
at the hospital?

47
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,830
So you admit it.

48
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,360
You admitted you planned
this whole thing.

49
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:09,710
Qian Pengfei,

50
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,710
don't you want to know exactly
what crime you've committed?

51
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,849
Song Chaoran never once told us
it was you.

52
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,710
He was protecting you the whole time.

53
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,480
That's impossible.

54
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,479
Pengfei had no reason to kill me.

55
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,830
There's no way!

56
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,799
But he did have a motive.

57
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,270
What motive, huh?

58
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,760
What motive?

59
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,830
Because my dad killed his dad?

60
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,270
We made peace a long time ago!

61
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,430
Calm down.

62
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,919
You may think it's over.

63
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,430
But that's only your assumption.

64
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,169
Your guilt made you tolerate
everything he did.

65
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,409
So no matter what he did,
you will always forgive him.

66
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,009
Do you agree?

67
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,969
But did you really think

68
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,950
he saw you as his close friend?

69
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,830
And there's one more thing.

70
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,360
He did it because of Pan Xin.

71
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,129
You know how she felt about you.

72
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,289
When she broke up with Qian Pengfei,

73
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,689
she probably told him
about her feelings for you.

74
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,729
With that and his grudge from the past,

75
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,600
it led Qian Pengfei to do this.

76
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,520
That's impossible.

77
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,070
I don't know what you're talking about.

78
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,110
There's no way.

79
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:25,310
This card was found
among his personal belongings.

80
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,720
Song Chaoran!

81
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,319
Do you want me to wait
outside the operating room

82
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,480
like a mad person again?

83
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,040
Chaoran.

84
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,840
So what you committed
is attempted murder.

85
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,440
=Lies Never Lie=
=Episode 7=

86
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,159
Here comes

87
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,929
your crayfish.

88
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,889
Here you go.

89
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,449
Thank you, boss.

90
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,110
There are still some more dishes.

91
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,839
Eat up before they get cold.
I heard their crayfish is the best.

92
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,160
Everyone, dig in while it's hot!

93
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,369
I invited everyone to dinner today

94
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,720
to say thank you,

95
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,920
especially to Tiaotiao.

96
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:11,489
Thank you.

97
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,190
And, of course, to Captain Ding.

98
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,269
Ms. Li, no need to be so formal.

99
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,860
Looks like you still don't know
how Unit 2 works.

100
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,199
You mean the Wang Pu case, right?

101
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,239
Honestly, if anyone should be thanked
regarding Wang Pu's case, it's you.

102
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,790
Without you, Wang Pu wouldn't be saved.

103
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,590
Which means you also saved
my life in a way.

104
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,909
We should thank Ms. Li.

105
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,790
I already said it for you.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,790
You really think that?

107
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,909
Come on,

108
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,679
give me some face here.

109
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,439
Everyone knows

110
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,860
you've been digging through my cases,
even if you don't say it.

111
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,880
Hey man, nice reflex.
You trained before?

112
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,360
Yeah, I did a few years of martial arts
when I was a kid.

113
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,030
Shaolin Temple, huh?

114
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,639
Li, with skills like yours,
being a cook seems like a waste.

115
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,860
Not at all.

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,670
We still have more dishes coming.

117
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,790
This guy is interesting
and very friendly.

118
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,810
(Craayfish)

119
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,759
Captain Ding,

120
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,820
Captain Ding, we eat together,

121
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,509
live in the same house, work together,
and work the same shifts together.

122
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,239
We practically spend 24/7 together.

123
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,439
So maybe you can call off
the guys following me?

124
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,199
No need to waste

125
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,350
Baizhou Police Station's resources, right?

126
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,230
Huh?

127
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,430
I...

128
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,439
Come on, she caught on too fast.

129
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,820
It's not my fault.

130
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,180
So...

131
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,239
Fine, call them off.

132
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,469
All right.

133
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,999
No more talking. Let's drink.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,029
Thank you, Ms. Li.

135
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,620
Thank you, Ms. Li.

136
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,250
(Craayfish)

137
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,030
This wasn't some impulsive murder.

138
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,360
The killer is definitely
a professional hitman.

139
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,010
(Craay)

140
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,219
(Cray)

141
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,810
(Craay. Cray)

142
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,570
(Craay. Cray)

143
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,389
Does the Haitian Grand Hotel

144
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,990
serve crayfish?

145
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,759
Haitian Grand Hotel's
signature dishes are seafood.

146
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,500
So they definitely do.

147
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,349
Our seafood comes

148
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,349
from a nearby market.

149
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,029
They supply to us regularly.

150
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,319
Twice a day.

151
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,060
Once at 6 AM and again at 5 PM.

152
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,380
They would deliver to us.

153
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,909
The incident happened

154
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,550
at 6 PM.

155
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,079
It was after all the deliveries
were done.

156
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,029
I already reported this

157
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,740
during the last investigation.

158
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,159
Did one person write all of this?

159
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,829
Yes, the person in charge
of ingredients keeps the records.

160
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,000
(Craayfish)
But why did someone else write it on this day?

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,039
Who wrote this?

162
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,580
Probably Rong wrote it.

163
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,589
The delivery guy.

164
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,469
Probably our guy was busy

165
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,750
so he wrote it for him.

166
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,869
So, are you certain
that Rong wasn't at the hotel

167
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,399
at the time of the incident?

168
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,419
I'm sure he wasn't here.

169
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:56,919
He usually arrives at 5 PM sharp

170
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,709
and leaves at 5.30 PM at the latest.

171
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,430
What if he was late that day?

172
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,630
That can't be.

173
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,469
They've been delivering to us

174
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,600
and were never late once.

175
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,390
If he filled out
the delivery receipt himself,

176
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,940
he could have faked the delivery time.

177
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,820
(Rong usually delivers seafood
to the hotel at exactly 5 PM.)

178
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,940
(This is when the kitchen is prepping.)

179
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,229
(So the staff always fills out)

180
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,750
(the delivery receipt themselves.)

181
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,510
(But if Rong was late that day,)

182
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,700
(the kitchen could be already busy.)

183
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,229
(They might have
let him write it instead.)

184
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,580
(That means he could've faked
the delivery time.)

185
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,220
I'll leave them here.

186
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,390
Okay.

187
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,820
- Help me fill out the delivery receipt.
- Okay.

188
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,439
I've written it down.

189
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,919
Okay, thanks.

190
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,199
(Inventory Purchase Record)

191
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,109
Since he's always on time

192
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,270
and there were no supply issues
on that day,

193
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,159
everyone just assumed

194
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,750
he wasn't late that day.

195
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,519
So when giving statements,

196
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,100
all of you unknowingly gave him
an alibi.

197
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,989
Now, it all makes sense.

198
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,519
This person isn't a hotel employee

199
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,220
or listed as a hotel guest.

200
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,199
Yet, he could move in and out freely.

201
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,079
He also avoided being caught on cameras.

202
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,469
He's most likely the one

203
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,270
who killed Bao Xijie's family.

204
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,749
What's Rong's full name?

205
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,679
Is it Li Guangrong?

206
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,940
Let me help you.

207
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,630
Hey, Li.

208
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,180
This isn't your job. Let me handle it.

209
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,680
I just checked with the Haishi market.
His full name is Li Guangrong.

210
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,039
Have the officers protecting Mochou
been pulled out?

211
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,229
- Li.
- Yeah?

212
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,279
Thank you for helping out.

213
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,430
It's nothing.

214
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,510
What happened to your hand?

215
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,559
I overslept this morning.

216
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,949
Can you give me a ride

217
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,199
and drop me off somewhere?

218
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,869
Sure, no problem.

219
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,469
Okay.

220
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,060
- Get in.
- Okay.

221
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,910
Harder.

222
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,039
Li, you're always on time.

223
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,870
Why were you late today?

224
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,940
Oh...

225
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,919
I woke up late.

226
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,270
Good thing I ran into you.

227
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,439
Yue Qun,

228
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,220
look at all these knives.

229
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,300
Captain Ding.

230
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,109
Speak.

231
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,989
We found a bunch of photos
of Bao Xijie being followed,

232
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,670
along with murder weapons
and a bag of one million yuan in cash.

233
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,550
This must be the payment for the hit.

234
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,219
Also, among the photos,
there are some of Ms. Li Mochou.

235
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,869
(Craayfish)

236
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,799
Just arrived in Baizhou?

237
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,589
Yeah.

238
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,560
This wasn't some impulsive murder.

239
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,560
The killer is definitely
a professional hitman.

240
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,519
Nice reflex. You trained before?

241
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,790
This scar...

242
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,279
The person who tried to kill me

243
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,319
is likely the same person
who wiped out Bao Xijie's family.

244
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,030
If I show up in his sight again,

245
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,750
he'll probably make a move.

246
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,030
Meet up with me now.

247
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,399
Your hand is already injured.

248
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,869
I even made you fix my car.

249
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,949
I feel bad about that.

250
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,670
It's fine. I got hurt moving stuff
the other day.

251
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,079
And my car's old
so thanks for your help.

252
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,550
It's no trouble at all.

253
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,430
Let go of me!

254
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,330
(Ding Wei)

255
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,170
(Ding Wei)

256
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,730
(Ding Wei)

257
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,439
Captain Ding,

258
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,630
I still can't get through.

259
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,910
You've made a real mess for me.

260
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,670
Liu, go upstairs
and check if Mochou's home.

261
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,150
I'll search the surrounding area.

262
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,790
If I were you, I'd save my strength.

263
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,460
Mochou is not home,

264
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,820
and nothing out of the ordinary inside.

265
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,300
Tell Tiaotiao and Anran
to get traffic surveillance footage.

266
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,079
Also, have everyone regroup.

267
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,460
Start a grid search from here.

268
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,980
You're finally here.

269
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,910
Sorry to keep you waiting.

270
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,910
Are contract killers really like
what we see in movies?

271
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,399
Yes, professional killers do exist.

272
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,150
I attended an international conference
on criminal psychology once.

273
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,510
Hello.

274
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,820
I need to cancel my flight.

275
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,910
I've been watching you for a long time.

276
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,560
But there were always undercover officers around.
So I never got the chance to act.

277
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,910
You shouldn't have let Captain Ding
call them off.

278
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,750
How long was I out?

279
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,750
Over an hour.

280
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,550
Don't try to pry.

281
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,910
It's pointless.

282
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,910
No one will find this place.

283
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:32,919
Gasoline...

284
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,829
Mochou mentioned
her car had a major fuel leak.

285
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,829
Her tank will empty within a day.

286
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,180
Check all nearby gas stations.

287
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,580
Yes, madam.

288
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,750
My car

289
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,790
is out of gas.

290
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,340
It wouldn't run for an hour.

291
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,199
And I can hear waves outside

292
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,220
and the stuff on the walls...

293
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,079
This must be an abandoned repair shop,

294
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,150
not far from the city.

295
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,559
Figure it out that fast?

296
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,910
That's really impressive.

297
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,629
It's my job.

298
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,149
Is that right?

299
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,110
Well,

300
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,460
this is also my job.

301
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,109
This area is a major transit hub.

302
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,700
So there are over ten gas stations.

303
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,150
They...

304
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,390
It's from Anran.

305
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,819
Anran, speak.

306
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,279
(Anran)
Ms. Wei,

307
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,109
the suspect didn't head
toward the city after the kidnapping.

308
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,429
So we checked the highway instead

309
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,519
and found footage
of Mochou's car refueling.

310
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,500
We're sending it over now.

311
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,460
That's him, Li Guangrong.

312
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,180
Where does this road lead?

313
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,349
Binhai Road.

314
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,909
The highway loop is just ahead.

315
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,149
There's nowhere else to go.

316
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,150
He must've taken the highway.

317
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,200
He refueled.

318
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,520
But he must know there are
cameras all over the highway.

319
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,000
The rear tire was swapped for a spare.

320
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,860
The refueling and heading to the highway
could be a trick to throw us off.

321
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,999
He probably didn't go far.

322
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,239
There's an unfinished building complex
down Binhai Road.

323
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,519
We investigated a case
about modified cars there before.

324
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,719
Have Tiaotiao and Anran

325
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,909
keep checking highway
and public road surveillance.

326
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,910
I'll throw it underground, boom!

327
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,590
Everything ends

328
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,350
and disappears without a trace.

329
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,700
In less than five minutes,
we will be all over the news.

330
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,349
And you call

331
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,110
that "disappear without a trace"?

332
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,039
At most,
it'll just be a social news piece.

333
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,799
People will forget in a couple of days.

334
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,429
An old car leaking fuel,

335
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,559
an abandoned repair shop,

336
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,239
and some unlucky guy lighting
a cigarette.

337
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,909
An explosion is only natural.

338
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,039
Even if someone dies,

339
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,500
it's just an accident.

340
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,150
Do you really think
you can fool the police?

341
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,039
Of course,

342
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,829
they will not believe it.

343
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,239
So they will investigate.

344
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,719
But they won't find any evidence.

345
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,460
In the end, the case will go cold.

346
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,039
Because you and I, the only people

347
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:58,390
who know the truth,
will both be dead in the explosion.

348
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,719
You're a professional hitman.

349
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,870
Yeah.

350
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,589
You must have countless ways

351
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,110
to make me disappear without a trace.

352
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,349
Why are you choosing to go down

353
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,740
and die with me?

354
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,630
Revenge.

355
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,310
Revenge?

356
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,959
You were the one who almost killed me.

357
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,500
If anyone's getting revenge,

358
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,759
it should be me.

359
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,910
Do you know what it's like
to watch someone you love die

360
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,670
because of you?

361
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,670
I do.

362
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,180
If you had died in that last job,

363
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,910
I would've gotten my payment

364
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,110
and saved my mom.

365
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,189
But you didn't die.

366
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,150
Why didn't you die?

367
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,020
I've done this for a long time.

368
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,350
And this is the only time I missed.

369
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,189
The one job to kill you,

370
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,389
where I shouldn't have missed.

371
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,020
You didn't die.

372
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,999
But my mom died.

373
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,279
By the time I rushed back,

374
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,310
I saw her take her last breath.

375
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,460
How could I not hate you?

376
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,870
Split up and search.

377
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,959
Watching the person you love die
in front of you.

378
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,389
I was completely helpless.

379
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,110
I was helpless.

380
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,039
You know what that feels like too,

381
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,150
don't you? Ning Jing!

382
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,669
Ning Jing!

383
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,110
What do you think
that partner of yours was thinking

384
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,149
before she died?

385
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,310
Shut up.

386
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,070
Do you know
what it feels like to burn alive?

387
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,700
I said shut up.

388
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,540
Ning Jing cared about you so much.

389
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,039
And what did you do?

390
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,500
In the end, you let her burn alive.

391
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,589
Do you know
what it's like to be burned alive?

392
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,799
The nervous system gets destroyed,

393
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,909
you suffocate, lose oxygen,

394
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,740
and instinctively start flailing.

395
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,460
But by then,
your skin is already burned.

396
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,350
The pain is so intense
that the body goes into shock.

397
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,070
But the intense pain wakes you up.

398
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,020
Then comes the instinct to scratch
at the burning flesh.

399
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,429
Do you know
what's burning at that point?

400
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,780
The fat under the skin.

401
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,180
Like roasting meat.

402
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,109
Roasted meat.

403
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,759
- Stop it. I said stop!
- That's what it is, roasted meat.

404
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,039
Stop it already!

405
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,669
Shut it! Just shut it!

406
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,780
Help! Roasted meat! It's BBQ!

407
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,909
You don't deserve to live in this world.

408
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,519
I'm not worthy of living
in this world too.

409
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,430
I'm serious.

410
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,940
Come.

411
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,980
Come,

412
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,630
hold this.

413
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,759
Light it

414
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,150
and end all of this.

415
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,390
What's that smell?

416
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,980
Liu.

417
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,350
It's rotting meat.

418
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:47,180
But there's also gasoline in the air.

419
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,740
The smell is coming from here.

420
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,460
Spread out

421
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,319
and search the basement.

422
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,039
Yes, madam.

423
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,180
Liu, come with me.

424
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,150
Light it.

425
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,110
What are you waiting for?

426
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,830
Light it.

427
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,700
How did you know
Ning Jing was burned alive?

428
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,350
Be careful.

429
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,070
Captain Ding, over here.

430
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,350
Open it.

431
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,500
Huh?

432
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,350
What do they have on you?

433
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,870
When you handed me the lighter,

434
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,310
I saw a rubber band sticking out
from your shirt.

435
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,310
The woman must be important to you.

436
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,180
You're a professional hitman

437
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,149
who is always on the move.

438
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,740
So it's unlikely to be a lover.

439
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,740
It's probably your older sister
or younger sister.

440
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,700
No, that's not it.

441
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:33,909
Your older sister?

442
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,070
Don't say it.

443
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,870
Your face tells me I'm right.

444
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,719
And I bet she hates you

445
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,310
because you're the reason
your mother died.

446
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,319
No, stop it!

447
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,700
Your mother died because of you.

448
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,909
Just stop it. Stop talking about it.

449
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,629
Trust the police.

450
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,589
I will definitely find

451
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,740
your sister.

452
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,519
We still save her.

453
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,149
If you die,

454
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,629
who's going to protect her?

455
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,429
Your mother has died because of you.

456
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,559
Do you want your sister to die
because of you too?

457
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,830
Stop it, I say.

458
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,260
Who's pulling the strings?

459
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,590
Why did Ning Jing have to die?

460
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,310
Why do they want me dead too?

461
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,390
This ends now!

462
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,430
Mochou.

463
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,430
Mochou, open your eyes.

464
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,540
- Call the ambulance.
- Okay.

465
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,149
Are you okay?

466
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,390
Take Mochou out of here.

467
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,150
Mochou, come.

468
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,460
Who ordered you to do this?

469
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,590
