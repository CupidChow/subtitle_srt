00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:41,759

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,200

=Lies Never Lie=
=Episode 15=

47
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,599
Let me do it.

48
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,550
Okay.

49
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:37,729
Captain Ding,

50
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,009
Ms. Luo didn't go to work today.

51
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,800
No one from the company
has been able to reach her.

52
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,480
Her phone is off, and she hasn't responded
to WeChat, QQ, or email.

53
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,200
- When was the last time they talked to her?
- Yesterday evening before getting off work.

54
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,009
Officer!

55
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,110
Sir! Sir!

56
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,280
We got the report and went
to check immediately.

57
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,580
There's no one at Mr. Ning's house.

58
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,120
Any records of him leaving
the neighborhood?

59
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,919
No. But I checked the surveillance footage.

60
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,830
Mr. Ning entered the estate
at 6:30 PM yesterday

61
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,200
and never left.

62
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,199
Look

63
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,839
at this.

64
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,399
Around 8 PM,

65
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,750
the elevator camera caught
him going downstairs.

66
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,609
Right here.

67
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,319
See?

68
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,160
This is the last footage of him.

69
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,400
But here's what's strange.
After stepping out of the elevator,

70
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,079
he never appeared

71
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,360
on any of the neighborhood's cameras.

72
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,399
Take a look.

73
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,129
I reviewed all of the footage.

74
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,369
He just vanished.

75
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,079
He was making a phone call around 8 PM.

76
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,049
Then he disappeared.

77
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:41,959
Yes.

78
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,279
Check Ning Zhiyuan's call records.
Find out who he talked to at 8 PM.

79
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,110
Yes, sir.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,609
Am I right?

81
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,450
Is Ning Zhiyuan's car still
in the neighborhood?

82
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,639
Come on, take me there.

83
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,670
Okay.

84
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,240
Miss Luo.

85
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,990
Miss Luo, are you home?

86
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,750
Miss Luo, are you home?

87
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,310
Open the door.

88
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,510
Hello, please come in.

89
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,920
Miss Luo.

90
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:12,929
Miss Luo.

91
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:13,719
Check upstairs.

92
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:13,959
Okay.

93
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,040
Miss Luo.

94
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,839
I know that license plate number,

95
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,159
White W6021.

96
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,489
I already looked into it.

97
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,569
I had a feeling something
was off about Mr. Ning.

98
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,990
Years of reading detective novels
have taught me...

99
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,280
Keep quiet.

100
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,809
(Li Mochou)
This is the car.

101
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,430
It's Ning Zhiyuan's car.

102
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,510
Hello, Mochou.

103
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,720
Hey, Zhiyuan.

104
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,240
It's me, Yue.

105
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,639
I found Ning Zhiyuan's car
in the basement parking lot.

106
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,870
The door was unlocked.

107
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,310
But he's not here.

108
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,720
His phone was in the car.

109
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,960
I'm checking his call records now.

110
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,959
His last call was from Luo Yifei

111
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,040
at 8:02 PM.

112
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,630
Wait a second.

113
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,750
No one is at home,

114
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,430
and there are no signs of a struggle.

115
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,720
The meal box is still sealed,

116
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,280
and the chopsticks
haven't even been unwrapped.

117
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,639
At Luo Yifei's place,
we found an untouched takeout order.

118
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,159
Based on the receipt,

119
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,249
something must have happened

120
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,319
between 7 and 8 PM.

121
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,489
Otherwise,

122
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,489
she wouldn't have left without eating.

123
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,070
She's been unreachable ever since.

124
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,990
They've been kidnapped.

125
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,800
The blood test results are in.

126
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,840
The blood found in the parking lot
is Ning Zhiyuan's.

127
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,609
Anran, take a team and check all of Luo Yifei
and Ning Zhiyuan's accounts.

128
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,670
- See if any transactions have been made.
- Yes, madam.

129
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,820
Liu, track Luo Yifei's phone in real time.
The moment it's turned on, get a location.

130
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,280
Yes, madam.

131
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,449
All right.

132
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,129
Let's check the surveillance footage

133
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,250
from Ning Zhiyuan's
neighborhood parking lot last night.

134
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,959
At 8:03 PM,

135
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,199
he was last seen on camera,

136
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,310
heading down the fire escape
into the parking lot.

137
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,569
Judging by his direction,
he was walking toward his parking spot.

138
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,489
But his parking spot is a blind spot
for the cameras. And then he vanished.

139
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,960
There's no trace of him
on any surveillance footage after that.

140
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,430
We searched the entire parking lot
but found nothing.

141
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,519
Ning Zhiyuan's phone was left
in his car,

142
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,199
and the door was unlocked,
yet he was gone.

143
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,840
That means something happened to him
when he was heading to his car.

144
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,040
Exactly.

145
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,399
We also checked
the footage of all vehicles

146
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,369
that left the garage after 8 PM.

147
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,719
This is what we found.

148
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,079
At 2:17 AM,

149
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,489
a cleaner was pushing
a massive garbage bin

150
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,070
toward the blind spot
near Ning Zhiyuan's parking space.

151
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,249
One minute later,

152
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,009
he reappeared in another camera,

153
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,480
heading toward a corner parking spot.

154
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,719
That doesn't make sense.

155
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,889
No matter how hardworking,

156
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,510
a cleaner wouldn't collect trash
at 2 AM.

157
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,480
He slowed down and the amount
of strength used also differed.

158
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,080
The way he was pushing showed
he was struggling.

159
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,600
The bin got heavier.

160
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,329
That's right.

161
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,129
After passing Ning Zhiyuan's car,

162
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,600
the bin was noticeably heavier.

163
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,559
Ning Zhiyuan was likely

164
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,519
inside it.

165
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,680
Then,

166
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,849
at 2:23 AM,

167
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,249
just five minutes later,

168
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,559
a gray SUV left the parking lot.

169
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,249
I suspect

170
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,910
that's how they transported
Ning Zhiyuan out.

171
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,889
But the person pushing the bin
was wearing a mask and a hat,

172
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,320
so we couldn't identify him.

173
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,480
Pause the video.

174
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:07,960
Ding Wei,

175
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,320
what's that?

176
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,440
Bandages.

177
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,910
Okay.

178
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,249
Yue's team found the gray SUV abandoned

179
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,759
on a highway outside the city.

180
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,200
No one inside.

181
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,270
Meng Zhengyi and the two victims
are still missing.

182
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:37,519
Yue.

183
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,039
Yes?

184
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,679
- What's the situation?
- The driver said the SUV was already here

185
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,720
when they arrived.

186
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,440
But there are too many tire tracks
on the ground.

187
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,480
So we can't tell which one belongs
to Meng Zhengyi's car

188
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,919
or which direction they went.

189
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,480
But we suspect
they switched vehicles here.

190
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,460
(Peace and Safety)

191
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,840
What's this?

192
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,560
Peace and safety.

193
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,840
This is Ning Zhiyuan's amulet.

194
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,960
(Peace and Safety)
From the looks of the cord,

195
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,209
it was bitten off.

196
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,089
That means
he was in a desperate situation.

197
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,240
Meng Zhengyi may hurt them at any time.

198
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,519
- Yue! Anran!
- Yes, Captain Ding.

199
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,639
Pull all nearby surveillance footage

200
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,560
and look into everything.

201
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,480
Conduct a full-scale search for Meng Zhengyi
and prepare for a rescue operation.

202
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
- Yes, madam!
- Yes, madam!

203
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,140
(Police Roadblock)

204
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,320
(Police)
Bank accounts belonging

205
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,840
to Ning Zhiyuan, Luo Yifei,
and Meng Zhengyi haven't been touched.

206
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,320
It's like they've vanished into thin air,
leaving no traces at all.

207
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,799
Meng Zhengyi is ruthless.

208
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,159
The victims have been in his hands
for 20 hours.

209
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,560
- Could they already be...
- No.

210
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,489
We have a citywide manhunt for him.

211
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,519
Yet he's going

212
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,489
through all this effort to move them.

213
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,840
That means these two hostages
are extremely important to him.

214
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,399
What does he want in exchange for them?

215
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,840
If he wants hostages,

216
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,159
that means Luo Yifei
and Ning Zhiyuan are still alive.

217
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,969
But we have no leads.

218
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,089
We don't need to find him.

219
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,720
He'll contact us himself.

220
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,609
Hello?

221
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,360
Hello.

222
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,080
It's Meng Zhengyi.

223
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,329
This is Captain Ding Wei,
Baizhou Criminal Investigation Team 2.

224
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,639
I have the people you're looking for.

225
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,439
They are still alive.

226
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,630
What do you want?

227
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,209
Half an hour from now.

228
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,489
Fuxing Harbor.

229
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,369
Open a route for me to board a ship

230
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,870
and leave the country.

231
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,039
I need to hear Mr. Ning
and Miss Luo's voices first.

232
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,729
Relax. They're alive.

233
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,110
Once I leave, I'll release them.

234
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,919
Hello?

235
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,080
Call back!

236
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,030
The phone is off.

237
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,849
We were so close to track him down.

238
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,110
He's careful.

239
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,639
He knew we were tracking his call

240
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,270
and hung up at the right moment.

241
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,439
We couldn't pinpoint his exact location.
But we got a general area.

242
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,110
He should be in the Qiaonan District.

243
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,089
Qiaonan District?

244
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,759
Yes.

245
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,329
Fuxing Harbor

246
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,630
is in the Qiaonan District.

247
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,729
Get everything ready as he asked.

248
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,990
You're really letting him go?

249
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,849
Of course not.

250
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,039
We have to catch him.

251
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,279
He's cunning.

252
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,759
If we don't make it look real

253
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,849
and show him a ship,

254
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,039
he won't show up.

255
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,009
So we pretend to cooperate

256
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,790
while preparing for his capture.

257
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,639
That's the plan.

258
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,159
Mochou, I need you and Tiaotiao
to dig into Meng Zhengyi's background

259
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,489
and create a psychological profile

260
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,680
to analyze Meng Zhengyi's
possible next moves.

261
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,249
Anran, contact customs.

262
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,960
Make the preparations
according to his demands.

263
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,680
We're in the open
while he's hiding in the dark.

264
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,249
Get all the paperwork
and procedures in order.

265
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:00,889
Yes, madam.

266
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:01,329
Yue,

267
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,889
borrow a few unfamiliar officers
from Team 1 and have them stake out the harbor

268
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,510
and prepare to take action when needed.

269
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,630
Yes, madam.

270
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,110
You should stay out of sight.
Meng Zhengyi has seen you before.

271
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,630
Got it.

272
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,150
Everyone, move out!

273
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,390
- What are you doing?
- Police investigation.

274
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,200
What's the matter, Captain Ding?

275
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,200
Liu,

276
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,990
how long have you been doing this?

277
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,790
Almost ten years.

278
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,560
Why?

279
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,600
You've handled
a few kidnapping cases, right?

280
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,009
Yeah.

281
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,720
But they're mostly threats
and scare tactics.

282
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,480
How many hostages are usually taken?

283
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,960
One, right?

284
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,750
If it's a kidnapping,

285
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,960
one hostage is enough.

286
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,039
Two are harder to control
and increase the risk of exposure.

287
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,240
So why did Meng Zhengyi take
both of them?

288
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,559
Liu,

289
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,369
send me the recording of his call.

290
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,150
Okay.

291
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,329
When was the last time you saw Mr. Meng?

292
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,129
Did he do

293
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,680
anything unusual in the past few days?

294
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,270
I don't know.

295
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,560
Nothing out of the ordinary?

296
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,200
Any updates?

297
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,039
Stay sharp.

298
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,209
That guy is tall

299
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,009
and has long legs.

300
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,360
I bet he runs fast too.

301
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,609
I have the people you're looking for.

302
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,680
Both of them

303
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,030
are still alive.

304
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,039
Half an hour from now.

305
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,159
Fuxing Harbor.

306
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,969
Open a route for me to board a ship

307
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,480
and leave the country.

308
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,320
Relax. They're alive.

309
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,790
Once I leave, I'll release them.

310
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,630
Stop.

311
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,360
Play it again.

312
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,329
Target has shown up.

313
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,030
Be on high alert.

314
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,200
Copy that.

315
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,329
Open a route for me to board a ship

316
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,840
and leave the country.

317
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,870
Relax. They're alive.

318
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,679
Once I leave, I'll release them.

319
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,399
Hearing a foghorn in the background

320
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,630
is normal at a harbor.

321
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,889
Isolate the part with the foghorn,

322
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,159
amplify the sound, and play it again.

323
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,270
Got it.

324
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,960
Once I leave, I'll release them.

325
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,199
Once I leave, I'll release them.

326
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,329
Stop.

327
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,049
Turn up the volume

328
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:14,769
and play it again.

329
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,590
Okay.

330
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,240
Get ready! Move in!

331
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,089
Stop right there!

332
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,270
Freeze!

333
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:54,920
Don't move!

334
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,200
Hands up!

335
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,640
Get down!

336
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,919
That sound doesn't seem like a harbor.
It sounds more like...

337
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,719
- A railway crossing alarm.
- Yes, that's it.

338
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,329
A foghorn isn't only at a harbor.

339
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,070
It could be a train crossing.

340
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,569
We got it wrong.

341
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,340
(Baizhou Criminal Investigation Team)

342
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,199
Hello?

343
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,529
Yue, Meng Zhengyi isn't at the harbor.

344
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,479
It was a setup!

345
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,129
Get up!

346
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,270
Get him up!

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,750
Get up!

Yue,

349
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,830
these are just bricks.

350
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,399
- Where's Meng Zhengyi?
- I don't know who that is.

351
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,750
Who sent you?

352
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,240
A guy paid me.

353
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,990
It was a homeless man.

354
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,609
He said

355
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,609
about an hour ago,

356
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,439
some man gave him 1,000 yuan,

357
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,609
dressed him up,

358
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,529
and told him to drive the car here

359
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,400
and hand over the suitcase
to the police.

360
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,129
He doesn't know anything else.

361
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,600
(Overpass. Blind Massage. Grey Bin)
I think that man was Meng Zhengyi.

362
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,239
Look into these places.

363
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,199
This was the last place
Meng Zhengyi was seen.

364
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,880
Under the overpass.

365
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,389
The homeless guy said
there was a blind massage parlor nearby,

366
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:04,889
a small two-story inn,

367
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,529
and a gray metal dumpster.

That's all he remembers?

369
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,690
That's all we could get from him.
Look into these first.

370
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,400
Find locations within an hour's drive

371
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,719
from the harbor that have a railway crossing
and match these places.

372
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,550
On it.

373
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,200
Mochou, check out that area.

374
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:26,809
Mochou,

375
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:27,960
look.

376
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,350
He's a stalker.

377
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,640
And worse, he's a fetishist.

378
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,399
Yes, Mochou?

379
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,200
Ding Wei,

380
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,399
something is not right.

381
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,830
Okay. Meng Zhengyi set this up
as a distraction.

382
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,360
I found Meng Zhengyi stashing
Luo Yifei's personal belongings.

383
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,479
He's obsessed with her,
almost to the point of madness.

384
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,089
His possessiveness is extreme.

385
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,479
He would never

386
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,129
let her be

387
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,480
with another man.

388
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,270
And another thing, Meng Zhengyi has been
taking medication for bipolar disorder.

389
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,889
So he's incredibly dangerous.

390
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,239
He could do something extreme
at any moment.

391
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,129
That phone call was a decoy.

392
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,679
It was just to buy time.

393
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,769
Meng Zhengyi didn't kidnap

394
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,089
Luo Yifei and Ning Zhiyuan

395
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,400
to escape.

396
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,639
If that were his goal,
he would have killed them on the spot

397
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,400
instead of setting up this whole scheme.

398
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,889
Meng Zhengyi is going through all this trouble,
playing cat and mouse with the police.

399
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,790
There must be a reason.

400
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,680
That's right, his goal is to kill.

401
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,310
He set up a diversion

402
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,550
to buy time.

403
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,159
That means
he's still somewhere in Baizhou.

404
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,369
Right now, he's trying to reach
the place he chose for the murder

405
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,369
while leading the police
toward the harbor.

406
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,049
That means the place he wanted to go

407
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,400
must be in the opposite direction.

408
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,089
Liu.

409
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:10,439
Yes?

410
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,959
Tell the team

411
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,569
to conduct a full sweep of this area.

412
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,720
Yes, madam.

413
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,200
Captain Ding.

414
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,919
Set up roadblocks on all major routes

415
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,959
near Beishan Bridge.

416
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,239
Search every possible hiding spot.

417
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,269
Yes, madam!

418
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:39,060
(Serve the People)

419
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,070
Nothing on my end.

420
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,830
- You?
- None.

421
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,030
Still nothing.

422
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,510
No sign of him.

423
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,990
Ning Jing.

424
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,480
Zeng Xiang.

425
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,920
Bao Xijie. Xu Jun.

426
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,529
There's no connection

427
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,199
between their crime scenes.

428
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,809
Yes,

429
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,089
all the locations seem random

430
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,769
with no special connections.

431
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,310
No sign of Meng Zhengyi.

432
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,200
- Nothing here.
- No sign of him.

433
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,750
I have nothing here.

434
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,919
But Luo Yifei is extremely important

435
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,270
to him.

436
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:36,369
He wouldn't just take them
somewhere random to kill them.

437
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,959
He must have brought her

438
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,089
to a place

439
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,920
that holds special meaning to him.

440
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,920
Somewhere special.

441
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,529
Check the cars over there.

442
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,750
Yes.

443
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,880
- Find anything?
- Nothing.

444
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,920
Captain Ding, I caught a pickpocket while
searching and I've sent him back to the station.

445
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,479
But no sign of Meng Zhengyi. Over.

446
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,990
Still nothing here.

447
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,159
Find anything?

448
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,030
Nothing.

449
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,159
We've searched everywhere

450
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,590
but we find nothing.

451
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,479
Hello, Ding Wei.

452
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,880
This isn't working.

453
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,880
We're looking
for a needle in a haystack.

454
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,480
The longer this takes,

455
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,569
the more danger Ning Zhiyuan
and Luo Yifei are in.

456
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,750
I know.

457
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,369
Are you okay?

458
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,510
I'm okay.

459
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,199
Stay focused.

460
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,529
Don't let the past.

461
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,070
and personal feelings get in the way.

462
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,399
Use your expertise.

463
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,310
I believe in you. Just give me a direction.
I will definitely find them.

464
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,609
Okay.

465
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,200
I can do this.

466
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,529
Ms. Wei, I've been searching
for ages but I didn't find anything.

467
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,880
What about Ms. Li?

468
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,200
Have faith in her. She'll figure it out.

469
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,439
Keep searching!

470
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,350
Yes!

471
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,159
Hello?

472
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,159
I found it.

473
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,289
Three years ago,
Meng Zhengyi adopted a tiger

474
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,550
and named it Zhengyi

475
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,560
(Animal Adoption Agreement)
after one of his name characters

476
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,830
and the number "one."

477
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,440
The tiger is now
at Beishan Bridge Wildlife Park.

478
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,609
That's it.

479
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:54,680
That has to be the place.

480
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,160
Call Captain Ding immediately
and dispatch a team over there now.

481
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,239
Yes.

482
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,960
Ms. Wei, they've figured it out.

483
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,030
Meng Zhengyi is at No. 88, Beishan Bay.

484
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,030
Everyone, move out
to No. 88, Beishan Bay.

485
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,679
Let's go!

486
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,830
Yes, madam.

487
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:33,620
(Abandoned Big Cat Enclosure,
Beishan Bridge Wildlife Park)

488
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,809
Yifei.

489
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:39,920
Yifei.

490
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,830
Yifei.

491
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,830
Are you okay?

492
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:56,049
Mr. Meng, this is illegal.

493
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,480
Let us go, please.

494
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,750
Are you scared?

495
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,640
Don't be scared.

496
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,070
You know I love you.

497
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,160
Look at me!

498
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,270
Always bossing me around, huh?

499
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,030
Hush...

500
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:39,030
It won't hurt. I'll tear it off gently.

501
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,070
Zhengyi,

502
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,399
let us go,

503
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,199
okay?

504
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,439
I promise

505
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,679
we won't call the police.

506
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,070
"We?"

507
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,880
Yifei,

508
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,479
I did everything for you.

509
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,200
I have nothing left.

510
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,529
And you betrayed me

511
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,750
for this pretty boy.

512
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,750
You chose him over me?

513
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,830
Huh?

514
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,679
No, don't!

515
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,999
Zhengyi. Zhengyi.

516
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,959
I'll kill you!

517
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,830
Zhengyi! Zhengyi!

518
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,369
What's so great about him?

519
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,310
Zhengyi,

520
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,809
I'm begging you.

521
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,529
Zhengyi, please.

522
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:13,790
Let me go,

523
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,350
and I swear we...

524
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,959
I mean I won't call the police.
Please believe me.

525
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,889
I won't call the police.

526
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,880
- Just let him go.
- Let him go? That's impossible.

527
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,640
He must die.

528
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,480
He must die today.

529
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,809
Zhengyi. Meng Zhengyi!

530
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,750
Meng Zhengyi, are you crazy?

531
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,640
What are you trying to do?

532
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:33,550
What are you doing?

533
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,350
Meng Zhengyi, are you crazy?

534
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,849
Yeah.

535
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,529
I'm crazy.

536
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,680
Come here.

537
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,070
No!

538
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
Don't do it!

539
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,750
Zhengyi.

540
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,270
Don't do it, please.

541
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,920
I'm begging you. Please don't.

542
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,120
Beg me?

543
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,480
What are you begging for?

544
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,400
I'm begging you not to kill him, okay?

545
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,399
I lost everything because of you.

546
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,199
Now I'm a wanted man.

547
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,289
I'm as good as dead!

548
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,889
So today, he dies with me!

549
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:09,719
No!

550
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,239
Zhengyi!

551
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,030
Meng Zhengyi!

552
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,030
So no matter what,

553
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,030
he has to die today?

554
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,030
Yes.

555
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,310
No matter what.

556
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,070
Zhengyi, listen to me.

557
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,399
So long you let him go,

558
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,480
I'll do whatever you say.

559
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,089
I will also do whatever you ask.

560
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,440
As long as you don't kill him

561
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,639
and let him go,

562
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,270
I'll do whatever you say, okay?
Is that okay?

563
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,720
Whatever I say?

564
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,510
Really?

565
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,640
Yes.

566
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,680
That's great.

567
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,750
I'll give you a choice.

568
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,550
Okay.

569
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:01,400
Only one of you gets to live today.

570
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,120
If you choose him,

571
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,030
push him off.

572
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,550
If you choose yourself,

573
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,640
then you jump.

574
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,790
Choose.

575
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,400
I said, choose!

576
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,159
You love him, don't you?

577
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,809
Okay, that's enough.

578
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,160
That's enough!

579
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:34,960
Meng Zhengyi,

580
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,159
If I die,

581
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,830
will you let Luo Yifei go?

582
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,200
Yes.

583
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:21,960
Okay.

584
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,070
Yifei,

585
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,199
he's after my life.

586
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,529
So long I'm dead, he'll let you go.

587
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,880
Trust me, okay?

588
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,030
Listen to me.

589
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,329
You were there for me

590
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,289
at my lowest

591
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,070
and I'll never forget that.

592
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,769
Let me die.

593
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,129
I won't let you die.

594
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,399
Just let me die.

595
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,999
How can I live without you?

596
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,129
I won't let you die!

597
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,070
Listen to me!

598
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,369
You can't choose?

599
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,400
Then both of you can die together!

600
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,159
Wait!

601
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,239
I choose him!

602
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,590
I want to live!
