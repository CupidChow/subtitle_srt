What's going on?

29
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,280
This isn't right. According to the GPS,
there should be a road nearby.

30
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,360
- How far are we from our destination?
- We're 1km away from our destination.

31
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,370
Master!

32
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,840
Master!

33
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,680
Geez. What about me and the car?

00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,179
=Lies Never Lie=
=Episode 16=

35
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,330
Love, huh?

36
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,490
This is your pathetic excuse of
something called love.

37
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,370
It's just like me.

38
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,370
It's worthless.

39
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,330
Come!

40
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,370
Zhiyuan.

41
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,810
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,490
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,250
I love you.

44
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,650
Yifei!

45
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,610
They're on top!

46
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,329
Head down and rescue them.

47
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,490
- Alright.
- Yes, ma'am.

48
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,169
What other things
do we need to investigate?

49
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,320
Ms. Li.

50
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,000
Why did you kill Ning Jing?

51
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,200
Why did you kill Ning Jing? Tell me!

52
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,899
Tell me! Why did you kill Ning Jing?

53
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,019
- Tell me why?
- Officer Li, please calm down for now.

54
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,850
Why?

55
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,970
- Sorry, we have to treat him.
- Why?

56
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,490
Tell me!

57
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,930
Here it comes.

58
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,810
This is the most delicious noodles ever.

59
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,289
Not bad at all.

60
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,849
- What do you think?
- It's great.

61
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,290
I was asking her.

62
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,050
Thank you.

63
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,640
Jing, you should have more carrots.

64
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,059
- It'll provide you with vitamins.
- Vitamins.

65
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,250
Yeah, vitamins.

66
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,730
Mochou, eat up.

67
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,120
We can at least be friends, right?

68
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,490
Everything is over.

69
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,760
Yeah.

70
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,000
Everything's over.

71
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,930
Everything that I once owned

72
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,370
has left me as well.

73
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,649
I can't tell you this.

74
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,850
We'll talk about that later.

75
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,810
Hello? You were hurt by a tiger?

76
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,289
Hello?

77
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,440
You're from the media?

78
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,610
I killed him.

79
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,169
We did it out of self-defense.

80
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,680
Both Yifei and I would've died
had she not done so.

81
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,080
Two nights ago,

82
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,810
Meng Zhengyi suddenly called me.

83
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,880
I was terrified.

84
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,969
He was pronounced dead,

85
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,200
yet he was still alive.

86
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,899
And, he told me

87
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,459
that he had captured Zhiyuan.

88
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,170
He told me to find him.

89
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,579
If not,

90
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,170
he would kill him.

91
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,290
But he knocked me out when I was leaving

92
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,930
the neighborhood.

93
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,880
Back then, Meng Zhengyi called me
with Luo Yifei's number.

94
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,970
He said he had captured Yifei.

95
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,169
He told me to find him.
He forbade me to call the cops.

96
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,170
I'm on my way!

97
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,810
The basement?

98
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,520
Alright. I'll head there right now.

99
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:02,769
Calm down.

100
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,320
I'll be there in a second.

101
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,880
Alright.

102
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,080
He ambushed me from behind my car.

103
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,440
He kidnapped me.

104
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:54,950
(Park)

105
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,490
Actually, Meng Zhengyi was already dead.

106
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,040
He no longer existed in the world.

107
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,139
He did a perfect job
with the murder at the crematorium.

108
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,600
No one would ever suspect him for it.

109
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,280
But at the very end,
I still left behind a distress signal.

110
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,730
Yifei!

111
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,979
Of course, we have to thank you guys
for investigating Meng Zhengyi.

112
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,370
That's why we were rescued.

113
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,850
By the way,

114
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,850
you can take this back.

115
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,570
Meng Zhengyi told
Luo Yifei to make a choice.

116
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,280
Between her and I,
only one of us could survive.

117
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,529
I understand clearly

118
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,250
that Meng Zhengyi wanted me dead.

119
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,000
Luo Yifei would be fine as long
as she gave up on me.

120
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,280
But Yifei didn't.

121
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,090
She chose me.

122
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,280
She wanted me to live on.

123
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,809
My sister said that this protective charm
would ward off danger

124
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,370
when one is in danger.

125
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,610
That's why I've been
carrying it with me all these years.

126
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,040
I did it because of my sister.

127
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,570
I did it because of you too.

128
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,409
But now,

129
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,570
I think

130
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,520
I don't want it anymore.

131
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,450
I have a question.

132
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,730
Why was Luo Yifei terrified

133
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,499
whenever we brought up Meng Zhengyi?

134
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,859
I don't fear him!

135
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,120
I don't.

136
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,000
I merely wanted to protect Zhiyuan.

137
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,139
But you look anxious

138
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,880
whenever you bring him up.

139
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,730
Moreover, we found pictures of you
in his house, which he took in secret.

140
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,400
Your expressions in those photos

141
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,160
were filled with fear and disgust.

142
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,529
Hey. Come.

143
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,690
Let me take a sip.

144
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,000
Time to check out
the new discoveries I made.

145
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,649
Isn't this a WeChat chat log?

146
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,690
Today,

147
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,529
I visited Tianxiang Group with my men.

148
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,929
Everyone in the company said

149
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,720
Meng Zhengyi was a control freak.

150
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,739
On the surface,
Luo Yifei makes all the decisions.

151
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,440
But in reality, Meng Zhengyi was
controlling her from behind the scenes.

152
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,569
I thought something was off.

153
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,730
I told Liu this.

154
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,929
I told him

155
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,219
to retrieve the chat history
between Meng Zhengyi

156
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,259
and Luo Yifei.

157
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,409
In the end?

158
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,210
Take a look.

159
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,049
Isn't he manipulating her?

160
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,289
Manipulation, huh? Such cases are
quite frequent for the past few years.

161
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,499
There were plenty of victims.

162
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,520
All of them were
outstanding females as well.

163
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,339
Look.

164
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,049
First, Meng Zhengyi
put Luo Yifei on a pedestal.

165
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,409
He made it as if
he couldn't live without her.

166
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,019
After that,

167
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,859
he made her dependent on him for work.

168
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,409
He made her think that she couldn't
handle the company without him.

169
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,339
That's right.

170
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,099
After that,
he used his twisted reasoning

171
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,139
to denounce Luo Yifei
as utterly worthless.

172
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,449
There was no way Luo Yifei
could withstand the disparity.

173
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,859
To cope with it, she would try
to find faults with herself.

174
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,259
After some time,

175
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,240
Luo Yifei would deny her worth

176
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,899
and become extra dependent
on Meng Zhengyi.

177
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,449
That's right.

178
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,529
Isn't he shameless?

179
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,690
Indeed.

180
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,769
Meng Zhengyi

181
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,619
was manipulating
Luo Yifei psychologically.

182
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,160
This was a twisted relationship.

183
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,610
Therefore, Meng Zhengyi
owned the company.

184
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,449
That means

185
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,139
Meng Zhengyi could use
Tianxiang Group to do the things

186
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,490
he desired.

187
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,040
I knew that was
psychological manipulation.

188
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,640
Zhiyuan told me about it many times.

189
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,690
I secretly searched for
information online as well.

190
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,800
But...

191
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,850
But for some reason,

192
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,219
I dare not go against him.

193
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,330
I dare not do so.

194
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,850
Thank you for your testimony.

195
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,400
Regarding Luo Yifei's case,
we'll investigate it further.

196
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,490
You may leave now.

197
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,920
I may leave now, huh?

198
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,450
Rest well.

199
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,970
Thank you.

200
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,640
It's been three years.

201
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,970
I've finally found

202
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,330
Ning Jing's murderer.

203
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,640
You did a great job.

204
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,730
I knew that Tianxiang Group

205
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,850
was involved in many shady deeds

206
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,880
under Meng Zhengyi's control
more or less.

207
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,769
But I didn't dare to ask him about it.

208
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,850
I dare not report him
to the authorities either.

209
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,049
Now, he poses no threat to you.

210
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:10,809
Just tell us

211
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,040
everything you know.

212
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,970
Meng Zhengyi gave me this necklace

213
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,800
on my birthday.

214
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,019
Both Zhiyuan and I were worried

215
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,400
that he might've installed
a hidden camera on it.

216
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,400
But in the end...

217
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,570
This USB drive has
many encrypted locks on it.

218
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,120
It's hard to crack indeed.

219
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:49,689
It's fine.

220
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,920
Let's take it slow.

221
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,799
Why do you still have this with you?

222
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,980
Shouldn't it be handed
to the Evidence Department by now?

223
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,610
This belongs to Ning Jing.

224
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,120
He might be able to
discard it at a whim, but I can't.

225
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,619
Lips tightly pressed,

226
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,570
brows furrowed and drawn together.

227
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,809
And constricted pupils.

228
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,160
Are you angry?

229
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,690
Why should I be angry?

230
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,700
I just think that we're letting off
Meng Zhengyi too easily.

231
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,680
I managed to crack it.

232
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,370
Come here and listen to this.

233
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,610
Is this a call recording?

234
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,730
Hello?

235
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,610
That's Meng Zhengyi's voice.

236
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,450
I'm done. When will you wire
the money to me?

237
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,730
Is that Zeng Xiang?

238
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,689
You failed.

239
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,259
Don't worry. I'll find
another opportunity in one month.

240
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,649
I'll definitely fulfill the task.

241
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,850
Is that Li Guangrong?

242
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,280
Don't act for now.

243
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,970
I'll wire the money to you as usual.

244
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,619
But avoid the female cop
for the time being.

245
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,619
Remember,

246
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,160
do not divulge my information
under any circumstances.

247
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,640
If not, your sister will be...

248
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,090
Meng Zhengyi!

249
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,320
Don't worry.
As long as you play by the book,

250
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,539
she'll be fine.

251
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,520
There's a total of 15 call records.

252
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,320
All of them belonged to Meng Zhengyi.

253
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,840
These are evidence of his crime.

254
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,779
According to
the circumstances back then,

255
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,139
Meng Zhengyi abducted
Luo Yifei and Ning Zhiyuan.

256
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,280
And, he wanted to murder them.

257
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,600
Therefore, Luo Yifei retaliated against
Meng Zhengyi out of self-defense.

258
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,640
Besides, the murder of Xu Jun,
Bao Xijie, and Li Guangrong

259
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,130
were all committed by Meng Zhengyi.
Guys, take a look.

260
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,490
Let's talk about Xu Jun's case.

261
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,009
This is the actual reaction

262
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,760
in front of the incinerator
at the crime scene.

263
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,690
This is the steel plate taken by
Meng Zhengyi at the scene.

264
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,130
This is the chat record of
Meng Zhengyi and Luo Yifei.

265
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,170
This is the testimony
of an employee of Tianxiang Group.

266
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,409
These are the knives

267
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,120
we found at Li Guangrong's house.

268
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,000
He used these knives
to commit all the murders.

269
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,520
And, we also found
a bloody wallet in his house.

270
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,520
It contained one million yuan in cash.

271
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,360
He received it from Bao Xijie.

272
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,480
These are photos of Bao Xijie
being stalked

273
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,490
and secretly photographed
before being murdered.

274
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,449
(End of report)

275
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,009
That is all.

276
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,249
Does anyone have any objections?

277
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,139
No.

278
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,539
Okay.

279
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,690
Meeting dismissed.

280
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,240
The true culprit of Ning Jing's murder
has been arrested.

281
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,760
Why are you still pulling a long face?

282
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,600
Don't you think
everything makes too much sense?

283
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,080
The evidence chain is complete.
They match everything.

284
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,840
But I feel restless.

285
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,520
What are you restless about?

286
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,969
You see,

287
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,489
Luo Yifei said Meng Zhengyi exercised
long-term psychological control over her.

288
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,729
She was controlled psychologically
for such a long time.

289
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,859
Where did she gather the courage

290
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,210
to resist the person who controlled her?

291
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:53,280
Perhaps the extreme environment caused her
to develop a strong survival instinct.

292
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,840
That makes sense.

293
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,890
Maybe I was overthinking it.

294
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,410
No matter what,

295
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,579
the evidence of
Meng's crimes is complete.

296
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,080
There is no doubt about this.

297
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,210
Hmm.

298
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,650
Meng Zhengyi subjected Luo Yifei
to long-term psychological control.

299
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,450
And thus manipulated
the entire Tianxiang Group.

300
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,650
He exploited the group
for his own illegal gains

301
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,210
and caused many murder cases.

302
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,800
Based on Luo Yifei's testimony

303
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,040
and the key evidence she provided,

304
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,009
It can be confirmed that the mastermind

305
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,800
behind the Ning Jing case
is Meng Zhengyi.

306
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,130
I used to love braised meat.

307
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,970
Every weekend,

308
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,280
I would ask Ning Jing
to make braised meat for me.

309
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,730
This glass belongs to Ning Jing.

310
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,410
Although I haven't met you before,

311
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:50,840
after all this time,
she still remains so stubborn.

312
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,760
You must be worth it.

313
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,410
I'll offer you a toast.

314
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,360
Meng Zhengyi's mother
came to identify the body.

315
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,450
Officer,

316
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,280
say,

317
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,280
can I trim my son's nails?

318
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,600
Sure.

319
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,760
How many times have I told you?

320
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,040
You need to trim your nails frequently.

321
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:36,600
Your nails need to be tidy and clean.

322
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,000
Why didn't you heed my advice?

323
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,320
Look at you.

324
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,320
Look at how old you are.

325
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,360
You still need me to trim your nails.

326
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,280
What's wrong?

327
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,009
Although the evidence chain
of Meng Zhengyi's case is complete,

328
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:17,040
I thought something was off
from the start.

329
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,299
Today's my first time
meeting Meng Zhengyi's mother.

330
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,210
It really confirmed my thoughts.

331
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,690
Don't you think Meng Zhengyi's mother
has very high standards for herself?

332
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,779
She grooms herself very meticulously.
She has a brooch.

333
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,240
And her hair is styled perfectly.

334
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,560
She even brings a nail clipper with her
everywhere she goes.

335
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,409
People with high standards
for themselves are usually control freaks.

336
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,209
If Meng Zhengyi

337
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,409
did grow up in such an environment,

338
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,579
he'd surely be very introverted.

339
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,840
He would be timid as well.

340
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,280
If so, how could he control Luo Yifei?

341
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,719
Of course, there are many factors
that contribute to one's personality.

342
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:51,779
Some are innate,

343
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,320
while some are acquired.

344
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,249
That's why I think...

345
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,579
Understood.

346
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,600
Let's go.

347
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,859
Miss, I have a question.

348
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,000
Was Meng Zhengyi antisocial
when he was younger?

349
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,249
That child

350
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,779
was quite different.

351
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,760
It's not that he was antisocial.

352
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,760
He just has a softer personality.

353
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,890
He was always bullied by his classmates.

354
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,880
He didn't make a sound
even though people bullied him.

355
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,379
I had no choice after that.

356
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,059
I had to keep him around.

357
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,170
He had lunch together with me
for many years.

358
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,649
When he graduated,

359
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,649
I was quite reluctant to part with him.

360
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,170
Meng Zhengyi, huh?

361
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,080
He was a nice boy.

362
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,409
He was very obedient.

363
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,899
His grades were good as well.

364
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,280
I do have an impression of him.

365
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,400
It seems like
Meng Zhengyi's family was quite strict.

366
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,779
He was not allowed to do this or that,
and could only study.

367
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,449
I really can't remember clearly.

368
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,120
I've taught many students
over the years.

369
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,999
He didn't even know
what his classmates were up to.

370
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:54,249
He had no friends.
But his grades were pretty good.

371
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,059
It's just that he's pretty introverted.

372
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,730
He didn't like to talk to people.

373
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,130
It's really hard to remember someone
like him since he's very quiet.

374
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,560
Geez.

375
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,139
We investigated the entire school.
The conclusions are pretty much the same.

376
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,009
Meng Zhengyi was always an unnoticed,

377
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,360
inconspicuous person
from elementary school to university.

378
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,400
That's the issue.

379
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,560
Say, when do you think his personality
started undergoing a drastic change?

380
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,520
I have a hypothesis.

381
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:28,170
What if Meng Zhengyi was the one who was
controlled psychologically?

382
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,800
Are you saying the manipulator
is pretending to be the victim?

383
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,410
Thank you, Yifei.

384
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,930
I promise you.
I won't ever leave you again.

385
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,080
Really?

386
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,320
Ms. Luo.

387
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,280
Mochou.

388
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,649
Come in.

389
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,800
Thank you.

390
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,600
Mochou, you can take a look around.

391
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,730
Okay.

392
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,320
This chair is designed by
a German designer.

393
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,969
Meng Zhengyi likes it a lot.

394
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,859
And then, on his birthday last year,

395
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,379
I took a photo for him.

396
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,560
Therefore, he often came over
to play chess with me.

397
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,409
So, Ms. Luo, both you and Meng Zhengyi

398
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,560
really enjoy playing chess, huh?

399
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,899
Oh, that's not the case.

400
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,360
Meng Zhengyi loved it.

401
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,539
He's obsessed with chess.

402
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,139
I don't really know how to play chess.

403
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,450
I only know a little.

404
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,320
This game of chess

405
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,840
is halfway through.

406
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,760
But he's already...

407
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,649
I think the cigarettes

408
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,690
belong to a French brand.

409
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,170
What?

410
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,689
Oh, the cigarettes?

411
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,600
I don't know much about them. Do you?

412
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:33,920
I don't either.

413
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,819
I saw people smoke a few times
when I was on a business trip abroad.

414
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,970
Oh.

415
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:43,449
By the way, is it okay
if I take a photo to keep a record?

416
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,600
No problem.

417
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,239
Mochou, I've filled out the form.

418
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,930
- See if it's right.
- Come. Let me take a look.

419
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:06,819
I wish to ask you something.

420
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,930
Have you been dreaming about
Meng Zhengyi frequently lately?

421
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,040
Yeah.

422
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:16,689
Did you dream about his death scene?

423
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,560
Or some details from the time
you two lived together before?

424
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,250
The details from the time
we lived together.

425
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,040
But the strange thing is,

426
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,410
in my dream, it feels like
I don't realize he's already gone.

427
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,009
That's normal as well.

428
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,520
That means Meng Zhengyi
has impacted your psyche too deeply.

429
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,779
But that's fine.

430
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,819
You just need some time for treatment,

431
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,099
and you'll fully recover.

432
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,250
Thank you.

433
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,490
But I feel like

434
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,489
I might never be able
to get rid of him in this lifetime.

435
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,650
Don't give up.

436
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,040
You'll surely recover.

437
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,489
Thank you, Mochou.

438
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,099
Let's begin our treatment, then.

439
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,930
Okay.

440
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,440
Have you heard of the saying
'the handwriting reflects the person'?

441
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,489
- Yeah.
- But actually,

442
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,600
one's chess placements
reflect one's personality too.

443
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,779
I was at Luo Yifei's office just now.

444
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,249
She and Meng Zhengyi

445
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,059
had an unfinished game of chess.

446
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,169
The white pieces in this game
belong to Meng Zhengyi.

447
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,490
Look at his moves.

448
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,689
He was pressing the attack.

449
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,929
This is a typical
controlling personality.

450
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,040
The black pieces in the game
belong to Luo Yifei.

451
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,339
She's retreating with every move.

452
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:35,360
She's being cautious and meticulous.
This is a typical submissive personality.

453
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,169
Hmm. A game of chess can actually
reveal so many insights, huh?

454
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,320
Yeah.

455
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,340
But how can you confirm that
the white pieces belong to Meng Zhengyi

456
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,860
and the black pieces belong to Luo Yifei?

457
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,250
Luo Yifei told me this.

458
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,170
This chair is designed by
a German designer.

459
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,059
Meng Zhengyi likes it a lot.

460
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,929
And then, on his birthday last year,

461
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,520
I took a photo for him.

462
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,690
Therefore, he often came over
to play chess with me.

463
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,619
I had no way to confirm it.

464
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,489
When I was providing Luo Yifei
with psychotherapy,

465
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,819
all the things I told you just now

466
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,890
were mental suggestions
she showed to me.

467
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,490
And, the white chess player
had a cigarette that wasn't finished.

468
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,040
Luo Yifei told me
that it belonged to Meng Zhengyi.

469
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,409
Li Mochou, did you realize something?

470
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,249
After completing
the profile on Luo Yifei,

471
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,690
you overturned
all of our previous conclusions

472
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:31,819
You're becoming increasingly submissive,
and you're passive at every turn.

473
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,489
You are analyzing the game of chess
played by Meng Zhengyi and Luo Yifei.

474
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,689
But to me,

475
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,250
Luo Yifei was playing chess
with you instead.

476
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,299
Could it be that Luo Yifei was the one

477
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,490
controlling the white pieces
for both of these games?
