28
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,609
I'm asking you for the final time.

29
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,259
Is Tang Tang in Baizhou now?

30
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,610
Officer.

31
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,099
I told you.

32
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,009
I don't know.
I picked that phone off somewhere.

33
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,170
Where exactly?

34
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,659
A cybercafe.

35
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,800
No.

36
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,640
I don't remember.

37
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,169
Piao Daguang.

38
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,080
If you can provide useful clues,
you could reduce your sentence.

39
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,570
Why aren't you talking?

40
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,939
As you wish, then.

41
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,939
After all,

42
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,009
nine out of ten things you say are lies.

43
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,730
It does affect my judgment.

44
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,290
Your expressions are truer.

45
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,699
So, just tell me the truth.

46
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,400
Where did you get that phone?

47
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,080
Was it Qiaoxi District?

48
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,290
Xinhua District?

49
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,800
Qiaodong District?

50
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,730
Were there any
high-rise buildings nearby?

51
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,049
No. That means it's not
a highly developed area.

52
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,610
Were there any schools nearby?

53
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,290
Elementary schools?

54
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,640
Junior high schools?

55
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,570
Universities?

56
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,450
Any bus stops nearby?

57
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,010
Here's my last question.

58
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,920
Were there any large factories nearby?

59
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,889
How's it going, Tiaotiao?

60
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,010
Ms. Wei.

61
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:49,819
We got the address.

62
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,700
It's a building within a 5 km radius
of Shuiyuan Street, Qiaoxi District.

63
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,430
=Lies Never Lie=
=Episode 9=

64
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,379
Did you get him to reveal
Tang Tang's whereabouts?

65
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,169
I think I was heading
towards a dead end.

66
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,539
I wanted to make him say
where he hid Tang Tang,

67
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,609
but I couldn't get anything from him.

68
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,009
It's possible that he really
doesn't know where Tang Tang is.

69
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,130
Also, he did pick
the phone off somewhere.

70
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,130
A meat processing factory in Qiaoxi.

71
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,890
That's where he found the phone.

72
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,419
Who are they?

73
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,419
What are they doing here?

74
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,330
They're Tang Tang's parents and husband.

75
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,809
Yue. Bring some men and search there.

76
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,979
I'm going up with An Ran.

77
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,770
Follow me, guys.

78
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,000
Ms. Wei, we've finished searching everywhere
except for the flash freezing room.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,369
It's where they freeze their meat.

80
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,539
Hey, what are you doing here?

81
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,689
You're not even wearing protective gear.
What if you bring in germs?

82
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,249
We're police.

83
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,400
Please cooperate.

84
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,210
The police?

85
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,130
They're fixing something in there.

86
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,779
There was a power trip.

87
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,899
We can't go inside now.

88
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,130
We're still going inside.

89
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,160
Ms. Wei.

90
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,539
This is the victim, Tang Tang.
Female, 26 years old,

91
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,040
from Baizhou.

92
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,520
She went missing three months ago
after embezzling funds.

93
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,489
At first, she was thought
to be escaping arrest,

94
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,129
but several suspicious clues
showed up during our investigation.

95
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,640
In the end, we found her body
in a meat processing factory in Qiaoxi.

96
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,040
According to the autopsy report,

97
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,810
her body has been frozen
for at least three months.

98
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,040
What about the specific time of death?

99
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,450
That's where the problem is.

100
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,459
The body had been
frozen for a long time.

101
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,899
Given our current technology, we can't
deduce her exact time of death accurately.

102
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,130
All we can say is that
it was around three months ago.

103
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,779
Also, the victim's family has provided

104
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,930
Tang Tang's chat history
and WeChat Moments.

105
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,169
Three months ago,

106
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,169
starting from 6 November,
she stopped sending voice messages,

107
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,690
and only sent text messages.

108
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,690
Her last voice message was sent on

109
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,929
5 November at 10 PM,

110
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,899
to her mother, Shen Li.

111
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,280
Mom.

112
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,370
I fought with Zhao Zimo again.

113
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,520
I want a divorce.

114
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,249
The message ended abruptly.

115
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,249
That's why we believe

116
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,930
she may have encountered something.

117
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,219
Please play the recording again.

118
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,330
Mom.

119
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,960
I fought with Zhao Zimo again.

120
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,810
I want a divorce.

121
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,339
The message ended abruptly.

122
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,339
That's why we believe

123
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,729
she may have encountered something.

124
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,480
She sounded so sad.

125
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,369
Yes, and her mother
kept asking her what was wrong.

126
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,960
It was only until the next morning
when she received a text reply and a selfie.

127
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,729
Relieved that her daughter was safe,
Madam Shen didn't ask further.

128
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:06,160
However, our investigations discovered
that this selfie was taken in October last year,

129
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,560
not on the day the photo was sent.

130
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,080
So, Tang Tang likely died

131
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,280
when the voice message trailed off.

132
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,219
5 November, 10 PM.

133
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,330
That may be Tang Tang's time of death.

134
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,729
Until now, Piao Daguang

135
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,960
is still the largest suspect
in this case.

136
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,930
Take a look.

137
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,480
What the heck is that?

138
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,219
Take a look.

139
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,539
That photo...

140
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,409
Does this count

141
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,960
as mental abuse and threatening?

142
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,050
Take a good look and tell me
whether you recognize her.

143
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,290
Hey.

144
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,450
You know her?

145
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,210
Isn't that...

146
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,410
Tang Tang.

147
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,339
You killed her,

148
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,859
then impersonated her.

149
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,129
I didn't.

150
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,939
You used her phone

151
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,880
to message her parents, husband,
and friends on WeChat.

152
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,450
You also kept posting
her photos on WeChat Moments

153
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,369
to create the illusion
that she was still alive,

154
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,299
while you squandered off her money.

155
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,240
Correct?

156
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,930
How did you get rid of
her body in the freezer?

157
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,939
I told you, I didn't.

158
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,009
Tang Tang is dead,

159
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,009
but you had her phone.

160
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,099
You kept posting

161
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,179
every day

162
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,459
to make people believe
that she was still alive.

163
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,819
How are you going to explain that?

164
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,570
I...

165
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,080
I did pick that phone

166
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,480
off the streets.

167
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,120
That night,

168
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,720
I was feeling frustrated,

169
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,360
so I went out to get some booze.

170
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,690
Then, I wandered around the streets.

171
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,910
(Mom)

172
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,810
When did you find that phone?

173
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,720
A few months ago.

174
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,649
I don't really remember.

175
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,810
Dig deeper.

176
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,410
Early November.

177
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,530
Before 11 November.

178
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,290
Continue.

179
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,489
When I got that phone,

180
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,880
I was curious at first.

181
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,990
(Verification failed)

182
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,750
(Verification success)

183
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,000
Wow.

184
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,480
Awesome!

185
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,960
I was on the run
for the past six months,

186
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,600
and I was running low on money.

187
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,690
So, it's just as what
Captain Ding had said.

188
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,330
You impersonated Tang Tang,

189
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,320
chatted with her husband and parents,

190
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,099
continued posting on WeChat Moments
to conjure a peaceful illusion,

191
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,889
all while spending her money.

192
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,650
I thought I'd just
do that as long as I could.

193
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,769
If her family does find out,

194
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,880
I'd just throw the phone away.

195
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,690
I picked it off the streets, after all.

196
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,099
But, who'd have thought
that even after three months,

197
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,840
her family still didn't notice anything.

198
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,699
If you didn't arrest me,

199
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,410
I reckon that they'd never find out.

200
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,000
Who'd have thought?

201
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:54,360
Maybe my acting was too good.

202
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,570
Piao Daguang wasn't lying.

203
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,000
You're sure about that?

204
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,649
What's wrong?

205
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,410
People react differently
when they see a corpse.

206
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,299
When a normal person
sees a corpse for the first time,

207
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,009
they'd express shock, fear, and pity,

208
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,360
and would unconsciously shy away.

209
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,459
However, when a murderer

210
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,729
sees their victim's corpse
for the first time,

211
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,129
they'd show signs of disgust

212
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,000
and even get flustered.

213
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,290
These are intuitive human reactions.
There's no way to fake them.

214
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,960
Here.

215
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,050
Look at this.

216
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,360
You know her?

217
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,600
Isn't that...

218
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,360
Yes, Tang Tang.

219
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,690
Right here.

220
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,939
This was when Piao Daguang recognized

221
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,930
Tang Tang's body.

222
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,720
It took him by surprise.

223
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,360
Even though it was a brief moment,

224
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,249
it was genuine.

225
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,080
He didn't fake it.

226
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,570
Hmm.

227
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,769
Therefore,

228
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,579
Piao Daguang didn't know
that Tang Tang was dead

229
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,179
until the realization hit him,

230
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,120
and he couldn't digest it immediately,

231
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,530
hence the flustered reaction.

232
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,530
So, Piao Daguang didn't kill Tang Tang.

233
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,210
Ding Wei.

234
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,360
You're the only child
in your family, right?

235
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,769
Yeah.

236
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,000
How often do you contact your family?

237
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,480
Once a week.

238
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,679
What would happen
if you don't contact them for a month?

239
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,489
Even before that, they'd come after me.

240
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,360
Right?

241
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,729
So, she's the only daughter
in her family,

242
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,129
and she just got married
five months ago.

243
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:58,339
For the past three months, no one in her family
sent her a voice message or called her.

244
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,880
They only exchanged text messages,
never met face-to-face,

245
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,000
yet none of them felt something was off.

246
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,179
That does seem suspicious.

247
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:06,939
Zhao Zimo!

248
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,530
Come out, you murderer!

249
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,210
Come out, you murderer!

250
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,579
Come out!

251
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,059
If you won't open the door,

252
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,600
I'll die right here today!

253
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,450
Quiet!

254
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,330
Police! Make way!

255
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,210
Make way!

256
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,210
Get out!

257
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,450
What's going on?

258
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,000
It was Zhao Zimo who killed my daughter.

259
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,009
Take a look.

260
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,240
Over here.

261
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,840
We're going to check there.

262
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,450
Anran, look at this.

263
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,480
She wasn't dead
when they put her inside.

264
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,760
That's what the coroner said, too.

265
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,579
There are signs of blunt impact trauma

266
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,099
at the back of the victim's head,

267
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,179
but it wasn't the cause of death.

268
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,769
Now we know what it is.

269
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:19,050
They knocked her out,
then threw her into the freezer.

270
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,120
That's what the coroner said, too.

271
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,170
She froze to death.

272
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,889
Why do you say that
Zhao Zimo killed your daughter?

273
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,960
He killed my daughter.

274
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,080
Can you explain in detail?

275
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,369
Back then, my daughter
insisted on marrying Zhao Zimo.

276
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,240
She was blinded by love.

277
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,009
We couldn't dissuade her.

278
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,489
She even stole our household register
to get married.

279
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,409
So, you don't really
like your son-in-law?

280
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,570
Of course.

281
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,489
My daughter is a university graduate
majoring in finance.

282
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,530
She got a job in a bank
right after she graduated.

283
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,450
She's an excellent lady.

284
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,609
On the other hand, Zhao Zimo couldn't
even graduate from vocational school.

285
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,889
He's poor,
and he doesn't have a stable job.

286
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,170
He's useless.

287
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,410
My husband and I
have nothing good to say about him.

288
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,320
Tiaotiao.

289
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,099
When did they get married?

290
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,410
Last year in June.

291
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,480
That means they're newlyweds.

292
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:43,760
Sigh.

293
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,209
As her parents,

294
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,760
we want the best for her.

295
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,090
But they're just not compatible.

296
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:52,960
Yes, yes.

297
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,739
Financial compatibility
is important when deciding a partner.

298
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,890
I understand.

299
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:57,779
Officer,

300
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,040
don't get me wrong.

301
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,609
I'm not asking my daughter
to marry a rich man.

302
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,259
We don't need the money.

303
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,209
All we have is our daughter.

304
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,169
However, their backgrounds,

305
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,099
lifestyle habits,

306
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,259
education levels,

307
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,499
and life perspectives are all different.

308
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,579
How would they last forever?

309
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,579
Before you get married,
it's all about romance.

310
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,929
After you get married, it's all about
facing reality, building a life together.

311
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,040
Can Zhao Zimo even afford

312
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,499
paying for their daily expenses?

313
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,690
He's been relying on my daughter.

314
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,040
This is our wedding photo.

315
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,560
She knew I was broke,

316
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,760
so we didn't even rent a wedding gown.

317
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,650
We took our wedding photos
wearing jeans.

318
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,800
Back then, I promised her

319
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,040
that when I become rich,

320
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,520
I'd buy her the most beautiful
wedding gown there is.

321
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,609
Tang Tang earned 15,000 yuan a month.

322
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,450
She was well-off when she was single,

323
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,579
but after she got married,

324
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,130
all her income

325
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,129
went to his family, sucking her dry.

326
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:24,090
Even so, Zhao Zimo wasn't satisfied.

327
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,209
He often picked on
my daughter for no reason.

328
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,969
My poor girl, she deserved better.

329
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,889
Yet she chose to be with him.

330
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,370
What else does he want?

331
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:39,040
Zhao Zimo is a leech.

332
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,480
He's been sucking my daughter's blood,

333
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,520
but he was never grateful.

334
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,520
He's a useless bum.

335
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,779
The last time Tang Tang messaged me,
she was crying.

336
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,130
She said she fought
with Zhao Zimo again.

337
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,339
Officer.

338
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,339
He must be related

339
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,760
to my daughter's death!

340
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,850
Hmm.

341
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,019
So, when you said that
Zhao Zimo killed Tang Tang,

342
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,130
you didn't mean that
Zhao Zimo killed her with his own hands,

343
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,040
but that he failed to
take good care of her.

344
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,690
How is that any different?

345
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,480
Earlier, I heard your in-laws say

346
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,720
that you killed her?

347
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,090
Oh.

348
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,169
He's right.

349
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:31,930
I...

350
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,090
I failed to take care of her.

351
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,850
Back then, everyone said
I didn't deserve her.

352
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,690
Of course, I felt the same way.

353
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,520
Even now, I still find it unbelievable.

354
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,370
Say,

355
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,819
why would a decent lady like her

356
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,650
choose to be with me?

357
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,779
Did you argue with your wife
before she went missing?

358
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,930
Yes.

359
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,099
She said she'd be
staying with her parents.

360
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,339
Why did you argue?

361
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,720
Over some petty issues.

362
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,689
I'm a useless man.

363
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,210
I don't have any skills.

364
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,930
I don't have any income.

365
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,040
I made her suffer.

366
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,170
Still, she went missing
for three months.

367
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,210
Didn't you look for her?

368
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,450
I daren't.

369
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,210
I didn't have the heart to do so.

370
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,929
When we got married,

371
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,720
I promised her

372
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,800
that I'd give her a good life.

373
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,280
Look at me now.

374
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,450
I couldn't give her anything.

375
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,090
We met online.

376
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,689
When we first met,

377
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,610
I didn't know she was a capable woman.

378
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,280
I thought she was
a silly, innocent girl.

379
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,650
Then, I realized I was wrong.

380
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,090
She was a swan.

381
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,610
She was meant to fly, you know.

382
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,929
And she was soaring high

383
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,090
above the clouds.

384
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,059
I was literally a toad

385
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,969
who could only sit on the ground

386
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,480
and look at her with my head up.

387
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,130
Ribbit.

388
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,800
Ribbit.

389
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,560
Ribbit.

390
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,890
Tiaotiao.

391
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm sorry.

392
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:37,960
I made her die.

393
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,130
I made her die.

394
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,450
Don't worry.

395
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,760
I'll be nice to you forever.

396
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,090
Whatever your friends have,
you'll have it too.

397
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,890
Trust me.

398
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,890
I love you, Tang Tang.

399
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,170
One day, I will...

400
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,169
I will give you

401
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,170
the prettiest wedding gown in the world.

402
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,370
I will.

403
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,320
- Hubby?
- Darling.

404
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,739
We're married!

405
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,779
Look at my diamond ring!

406
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,609
We're married!

407
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,090
Pretty, isn't it?

408
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,560
Thank you, Hubby!

409
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,850
- You're welcome.
- Yeah!

410
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,499
I'm the happiest person in the world!

411
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,000
So, this is a story of
a princess who married a peasant.

412
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,240
Kind of.

413
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,690
What did Tang Tang's parents say?

414
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,579
It's a typical case
of economic disparity.

415
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,819
After they got married,
Tang Tang's went from riches to rags.

416
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,969
The couple fought every day.

417
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,169
Tang Tang's parents were also

418
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,889
very unhappy about their son-in-law.

419
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,130
That's how it is.

420
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,969
Still, it's normal for couples

421
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,720
to quarrel sometimes.

422
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,650
Was there anything fishy
about Zhao Zimo?

423
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,649
Judging from his body language
and facial expressions,

424
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,720
his grief and pain was genuine.

425
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,130
They seem to be deeply in love, though.

426
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,240
That's what it seems,

427
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,609
but if your newly-wedded wife
goes missing for three months,

428
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,930
and the husband doesn't even notice,
does that seem normal?

429
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,280
No.

430
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,410
Hey, Anran.

431
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,720
Ms. Wei.

432
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,370
Someone tripped the freezer's
power supply on purpose.

433
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,209
- Chen Peng.
- Yes.

434
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,960
Who's in charge of
the freezer's controls?

435
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,450
Guess who's in charge of the freezer.

436
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,890
(Freezer Control, Vice Manager)
Zhao Chunhua, Tang Tang's mother-in-law.

437
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,520
Zhao Zimo's mother.

438
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,450
We're police. Please cooperate.

439
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,760
The police?

440
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,760
They're fixing something in there.

441
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,409
There's a power trip.

442
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,650
We can't go inside now.

443
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,969
Drinking again?

444
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,960
All you do is drinking.

445
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,859
Wait for me.

446
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,210
I'll cook you some braised pork.

447
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,210
Wait for me.

448
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,090
So, there's a conflict
between the in-laws,

449
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:37,000
and the mother kills her son's wife?

450
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,650
That's possible.

451
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,739
The body was found
in the meat factory's freezer.

452
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,449
When we searched there,

453
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,240
we found out that
the fuse box was tampered with.

454
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,059
It just so happens that the victim's MIL
is in charge of the freezer.

455
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,890
Isn't that too much of a coincidence?

456
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,099
Come on.

457
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,739
Mother-in-law disputes
happen everywhere,

458
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,130
but I've never heard anyone
getting killed because of it.

459
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,539
Besides, most typical families

460
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,929
would admire

461
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,339
a capable woman like Tang Tang.

462
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,969
Why would they even clash?

463
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,369
You're right.

464
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,760
That applies to typical families.

465
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,369
Zhao Zimo was raised by a single parent.

466
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,859
For Zhao Chunhua,

467
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,370
her son means everything to her.

468
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,930
Don't cry, my son.

469
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,129
Mama's here. Don't be scared.

470
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,850
Mom...

471
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,339
We talked to Zhao Zimo's neighbors.

472
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,609
They said

473
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,779
Zhao Chunhua visits her son every week

474
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,130
to do his house chores.

475
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:20,090
So, Zhao Zimo
is very reliant on his mother.

476
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,610
A mama's boy.

477
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,520
A relationship like this

478
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,040
often develops into an Oedipus complex.

479
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,000
Oedipus complex?

480
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,649
Different family conditions

481
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,209
may contribute to psychological issues

482
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,929
such as Electra and Oedipus complexes.

483
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:37,169
Therefore, when choosing a spouse,

484
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:42,520
they would unconsciously pick someone
similar to their mother or father.

485
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,090
I guess that happens.

486
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,170
We've brought Zhao Chunhua here.

487
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,059
5 November, 10 PM.

488
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,520
Where were you?

489
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,130
Drinking with colleagues.

490
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,739
That was three months ago,

491
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,090
and you could remember clearly?

492
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,890
I have a good memory.

493
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,579
It was you who
tampered with the fuse box,

494
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,579
causing a power trip in the freezer,

495
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,649
hoping to stop us from searching there.

496
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,090
What's that?

497
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,579
Zhao Chunhua,
I'm asking you one more time.

498
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,370
What were you doing
on the night of 5 November?

499
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,299
I did ask to meet Tang Tang.

500
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,450
But...

501
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,610
But she didn't show up.

502
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,210
Continue.

503
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,690
That day, Tang Tang
fought with Mo again.

504
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,169
It was worse than usual,

505
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:39,969
and

506
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,480
she wanted a divorce,

507
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,739
so I asked Tang Tang to meet me.

508
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,650
I wanted to help them reconcile.

509
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,449
But she didn't show up

510
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,850
after I waited her for hours.

511
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,690
Later, Li Hong invited me
for a round of drinks,

512
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,240
so I went out.

513
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:58,090
So, Tang Tang didn't show up that night?

514
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,129
No.

515
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,859
Then, how did she end up
dead in the freezer?

516
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,499
I really don't know.

517
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,739
I think

518
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,090
Zhao Chunhua seems
unconfident when she talks.

519
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,320
Exactly.

520
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,280
Because she's lying.

521
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,130
Look.

522
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,059
When she mentioned Tang Tang,

523
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,850
she looked disgusted.

524
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:21,739
And whenever she mentioned Tang Tang,

525
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,480
she had the same reaction.

526
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:24,739
This proves

527
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,930
that she really despises Tang Tang.

528
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,760
Something's fishy about Zhao Chunhua.

529
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,739
Ms. Wei, we've finished
checking Zhao Chunhua's alibi.

530
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,170
She was with friends
on the night of 5 November.

531
00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:00,690
Tang Tang died on 5 November at 10 PM.

532
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:01,969
Zhao Chunhua

533
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:04,090
was having dinner with her colleagues,

534
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:07,090
who can all vouch for her.

535
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,930
Stop.

536
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,800
8:57 PM.

537
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,130
We've got witnesses
and physical evidence.

538
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,240
But if it's not her, who could it be?

539
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:24,130
Zhao Chunhua is a major suspect.

540
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,609
If she's not the murderer,

541
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,369
why did she tamper with the fuse box

542
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,000
to stop us from searching the freezer?

543
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,539
She probably knows the murderer,

544
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,890
and is trying to cover up for him.

545
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,930
It's late.

546
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,320
What are you looking at?

547
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,720
Look at this photo.

548
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,649
Tang Tang's parents and Zhao Zimo

549
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:05,090
came here to observe
Piao Daguang's interrogation.

550
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,040
All three of them said
they didn't know him.

551
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,170
Watch their expressions.

552
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,520
It's true that Tang Tang's parents
didn't know Piao Daguang.

553
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:17,720
However, I'm sure Zhao Zimo knows him.

554
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,610
Zhao Zimo lied to us?

555
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,320
Yes.

556
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,890
He definitely knows Piao Daguang.

557
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:27,960
Do you know him?

558
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:33,800
I don't.

559
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,040
Take a closer look.

560
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,520
I really don't know him.

561
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:44,609
Come on.

562
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,579
Officer, you told me

563
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,169
that if I prove myself useful,
I can get my sentence reduced,

564
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,320
right?

565
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,760
I see you remember that clearly.

566
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,410
So, if I know him, I'd surely tell you.

567
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,889
Maybe the mirror's reflection

568
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,480
isn't accurate enough?

569
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,930
No.

570
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,650
Look at this.

571
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,320
Scroll downwards.

572
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,410
Take a good look.

573
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,650
Oh.

574
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,969
That's Tang Tang.

575
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,210
You know him?

576
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,720
That means this guy is her husband.
