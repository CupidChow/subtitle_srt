28
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,120
Meng Zhengyi,

29
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,529
why did you set up Zhiyuan
to send money to Bao Xijie?

30
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,880
Yifei,

31
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:27,489
try this.

32
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,680
The wine tastes pretty good.

33
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,370
Ning Zhiyuan is all right, isn't he?

34
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,769
I'm the deputy director
of Tianxiang Group.

35
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,579
Everything I do is for the company

36
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,720
and for you.

37
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,739
The collaboration with the government

38
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,530
is currently at a crucial stage.

39
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,019
We must cut ties with
business partners drowning in debt,

40
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,840
like Bao Xijie.

41
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,530
The money had to be lent,

42
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,770
but not from the company.

43
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,370
Ning Zhiyuan is an outsider here,

44
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,979
so using his name

45
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,560
was the most appropriate way.

46
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,330
As for what happened to Bao Xijie,

47
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,370
how could I have predicted he'd be there?

48
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,210
I don't care what you're up to,

49
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,929
but I'm warning you,

50
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,000
don't go behind my back
and mess up with Zhiyuan.

51
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,120
If he threatens the company's interests,

52
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,440
will you still choose him?

53
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,050
Yes,

54
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,880
I will.

55
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,049
Also, let me be clear.

56
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,960
My bottom line is Ning Zhiyuan.

57
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,680
If you ever do this again,

58
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,770
please leave.

60
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,030
(Inpatient)

61
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,680
Let's end this.

62
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,440
Mochou, wake up.

63
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,330
Wake up now, Mochou.

64
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,819
Give some response.

65
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,970
Say something.

66
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,289
One at a time.

67
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,370
One at a time.

68
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,640
Calm down. Let's do it one at a time.

69
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,729
I can't answer that right now.

70
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,849
I'll let you know immediately
if there's any update.

71
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,769
Is there any progress
on the hotel murder case?

72
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,499
The case can't be disclosed.

73
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,089
The murder case from a few days ago
has drawn public attention.

74
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,499
Are there any updates on it?

75
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,050
We can't disclose anything regarding that.

76
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,729
Why are you discharged
from the hospital?

77
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,490
What's going on
outside the police station?

78
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,379
Li Guangrong is dead.

79
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,080
Don't use the main entrance.
Come with me.

80
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,440
Why is the entrance surrounded
by reporters?

81
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,619
The higher-ups wanted to
keep this case confidential,

82
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,459
but somehow, the news leaked,

83
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,680
and now reporters from all media outlets
have flocked in.

84
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,610
Will external pressure

85
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,440
help speed up the process
of solving the case?

86
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,529
The higher-ups are
under tremendous pressure now.

87
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,939
Chief Ou arrived early this morning

88
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,520
to oversee the case.

89
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,730
You seem to pay extra attention
to Li Guangrong.

90
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,490
What are you trying to
find out from him?

91
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,320
He almost killed me.

92
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,610
I just want to find out

93
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,850
who was after me.

94
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,649
We found knives of various sizes

95
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,930
from Li Guangrong's place.

96
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,259
Among them,

97
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,000
this one matches the weapon
used to kill Bao Xijie and his family.

98
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,499
According to Mochou's recollection,

99
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,640
Li Guangrong admitted
to killing Bao Xijie and his family.

100
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,000
Did he kill them
out of personal revenge?

101
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,290
Or was he hired?

102
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,880
Whether or not it's a personal revenge,
we're still working on it.

103
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,459
But we did find
a bloodstained leather bag

104
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,059
at his place.

105
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,250
It contained one million in cash.

106
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,579
Forensics confirmed the blood
on the leather bag

107
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,939
belonged to Bao Xijie.

108
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,059
We also found a large number
of secretly taken photos

109
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,850
of Bao Xijie.

110
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,579
We speculate

111
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,089
that Li Guangrong planned to murder

112
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,729
Bao Xijie and his family

113
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,880
and then take the money.

114
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,259
In other words,

115
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,729
Bao Xijie hired him

116
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,139
but didn't pay as promised,

117
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,939
so the latter killed him

118
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,680
to set the rules.

119
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,170
Currently, all the evidence supports
this theory.

120
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,899
But there are many restaurants
in Baizhou.

121
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,409
How could he be sure that Bao Xijie

122
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,640
would be at Haitian Grand Hotel
celebrating his birthday?

123
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,209
Chief Ou,

124
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,209
it's said that Bao Xijie liked seafood,

125
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,000
especially the dishes
at Haitian Grand Hotel.

126
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,089
He celebrated his birthday there
every year,

127
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,849
so it was expected
he'd choose there again

128
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,250
this year.

129
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,209
Have you found the source of the money?

130
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,320
We're looking into it.

131
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,490
Any thoughts, Mochou?

132
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,170
Well.

133
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,459
Bringing one million in cash
to celebrate his own birthday

134
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,880
is suspicious in itself.

135
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,290
The results are in.

136
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,459
We traced the serial numbers
of the money.

137
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,899
At 4:30 PM on March 30,
the day when Bao Xijie was murdered,

138
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,939
someone withdrew
one million in cash from bank

139
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,080
on Chengjiao Street.

140
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,000
The person who withdrew it
was Ning Zhiyuan.

141
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,850
Mr. Ning, Ning Zhiyuan.

142
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,729
Yes, I am.

143
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,810
CEO of Tianci Group.

144
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,560
Do you know Bao Xijie?

145
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,290
Yes, we were business partners.

146
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,139
At 4:30 PM on March 30,

147
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,520
where were you?

148
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,059
Chengjiao Street.

149
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,619
I withdrew one million cash from a bank.

150
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:41,550
(Ning Jing, Zeng Xiang, Bao Xijie,
Li Guangrong, Luo Yifei, Ning Zhiyuan)

151
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,040
You seem well-prepared.

152
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,160
The tragedy of Mr. Bao
and his family is big news.

153
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,400
Everyone knows.

154
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,760
Mr. Bao and I were strictly
business partners.

155
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,049
We weren't close.

156
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,610
We met for tea a few times.

157
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,680
A while back, Mr. Bao said
he had some difficulties in business

158
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,979
and urgently needed cash,

159
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,330
so he came to me.

160
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,330
This is the IOU he signed.

161
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,610
Mr. Bao had a bad reputation,

162
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,240
and I was worried it might affect
my company,

163
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,400
so I didn't transfer the money
from the company account.

164
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,520
I withdrew cash instead.

165
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,400
Also, I didn't know

166
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,880
March 30 was his birthday.

167
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,760
He probably reserved the hotel
in advance,

168
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,480
picked up the money,
and went straight there.

169
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,920
I feel like you already knew
what I was going to ask,

170
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,520
and you had your answers ready.

171
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,090
I know a thing or two about
how interrogations work.

172
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,520
Officer Li.

173
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,160
Hi, Officer Li.

174
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,160
May I have a word with you?

175
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,120
Sure.

176
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,250
Coffee.

177
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,570
Thank you, Officer Li.

178
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,289
You saved me last time.

179
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,040
I haven't had a chance to thank you.

180
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,809
It's my duty.

181
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:36,970
You don't have to do that.

182
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,040
Officer Li,

183
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,040
Zhiyuan and you...

184
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,289
I don't know how much you know
about our past,

185
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,899
but I've always seen him
as a younger brother.

186
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,769
Right.

187
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,280
Is it because of his sister?

188
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,400
Zhiyuan told me you two
used to work together.

189
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,160
Yes, we were colleagues.

190
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,730
Mochou,

191
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,809
you've known Zhiyuan for a long time.

192
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,259
Do you know what he likes or dislikes?

193
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,370
Could you please tell me?

194
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,929
You two are a couple now.

195
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,570
It's better

196
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,880
if you ask him directly.

197
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,569
Mochou, you're an expert in psychology.

198
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:22,090
Could you teach me a little
if you have time?

199
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,760
That way, I can figure him out better.

200
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,730
You want to study psychology
just to figure Zhiyuan out?

201
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,370
Isn't that silly?

202
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,379
No, you're cute.

203
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,259
I just feel like

204
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,800
he's hiding a lot from me.

205
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,090
What exactly is he hiding from you?

206
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,330
Zhiyuan.

207
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,160
We should get going.

208
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,970
Mochou, let's meet up
when you have time.

209
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,400
See you next time.

210
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,730
Bye-bye.

211
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,970
It's almost done.

212
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,739
Here you go.

213
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,019
Hurry and try them. Quick.

214
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,689
It's so hot.

215
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,689
Look at what happened.

216
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,330
A criminal actually worked here,

217
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,330
yet you still came here to eat.

218
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,619
I was so blind.

219
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,920
I didn't even realize it.

220
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,289
Sir, please don't say that.

221
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,250
If you could've discovered him,
why would the police be needed?

222
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,979
Losing a barbecue cook is no big deal.

223
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,499
We can grill the skewers ourselves.

224
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,019
It's called the self-service barbecue.

225
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,440
- Right.
- That's the trend now.

226
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:35,899
All right.

227
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,929
You guys must eat your fill.
It's on the house.

228
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:39,589
Here, have one.

229
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:41,499
- All right.
- My skewers taste just as good as his.

230
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,570
- Absolutely.
- Sure, thank you.

231
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,259
How does it taste?

232
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,490
Good.

233
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,920
Where's Mochou?

234
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,499
Oh yeah.

235
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,640
Where's Ms. Li?

236
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,979
I saw her

237
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,450
walking toward the beach just now.

238
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,769
She's been feeling down lately.

239
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,520
Looks like something's on her mind.

240
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,019
I've been looking for her
for the past year.

241
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,449
I sent her countless messages,
but she didn't reply to any of them.

242
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,449
She never came home either.

243
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:19,240
It's like she's a completely
different person.

244
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,000
I don't understand why
she became like this.

245
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,099
Ning Jing,

246
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,070
(Tomb of My Sister, Ning Jing)

247
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,280
I'll definitely find out the truth.

248
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,690
It's late now. Why are you here alone?

249
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,490
What are you doing here?

250
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,000
About what happened before, I apologize.

251
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:00,640
I shouldn't have acted on my own accord
and caused trouble for you and the squad.

252
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,280
But most importantly,

253
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,640
thank you for saving my life.

254
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,090
Well.

255
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:14,859
We're friends.

256
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,330
There's no need to thank me.

257
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,120
Friends?

258
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,730
We went through life-and-death situations
together. Doesn't that make us friends?

259
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,570
Stop calling me Captain Ding
from now on.

260
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,760
It sounds like a stranger.

261
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,570
What should I call you then?

262
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,120
Ding Wei.

263
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,920
I must say,

264
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,289
exposing yourself

265
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,250
as bait was indeed effective.

266
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,169
But you also put yourself in danger.

267
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,120
That's more serious
than going against regulations.

268
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,690
To get close to you,

269
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,450
Li Guangrong went undercover as a chef
at a restaurant next to the station,

270
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,970
moving around us every day.

271
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,120
You almost lost your life.

272
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,250
Li Mochou, tell me the truth.

273
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,850
Why was he so determined to kill you?

274
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,339
And why did you risk your life

275
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,979
and act as bait

276
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,450
to find him?

277
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,400
What's really going on between you two?

278
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,370
Ding Wei, you say we're

279
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,850
friends, right?

280
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,880
Of course.

281
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,520
Someone once told me the same thing.

282
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,760
Her name was Ning Jing.

283
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,880
She was my captain.

284
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,090
Do you understand what that means?

285
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,169
When I first joined the police force,

286
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,169
I was proud
of my professional abilities.

287
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,379
I was headstrong and reckless,

288
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,250
always questioning things,

289
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,610
which annoyed a lot of people.

290
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,610
I caused a lot of trouble back then,

291
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,400
and Ning Jing would clean up after me.

292
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,569
But she told me cops mustn't
be afraid of trouble.

293
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,040
What she appreciated most about me was
that I questioned everything.

294
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,649
She told me not to hold back

295
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,760
and dig for doubts,
she would be there to resolve them.

296
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,570
She's a good cop.

297
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,730
Yes.

298
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,450
She was a good cop.

299
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,690
She...

300
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,160
She's gone.

301
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,370
One time, we went out on an operation

302
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,730
to meet someone
who claimed to be an informant.

303
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,330
We didn't expect it to be a trap.

304
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,649
Back then,

305
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,880
I blindly believed

306
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,210
that psychological profiling
was the key to everything.

307
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,769
I didn't realize

308
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,859
that Ning Jing was already in danger.

309
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,560
Because of my mistake,

310
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,450
she died.

311
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,249
Also, Zeng Xiang,
the so-called informant,

312
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,730
also died accidentally.

313
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,760
I followed the clue Zeng Xiang
left behind, which led me to Baizhou.

314
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,170
Also, Li Guangrong tried to
kill me twice.

315
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,449
I suspect someone behind him

316
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,890
is connected to the person
who killed Ning Jing.

317
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,930
Trust your instinct

318
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,840
and judgment.

319
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,169
Finding out the truth for Ning Jing

320
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,040
is the best thing you can do for her.

321
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,970
Do you

322
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,800
really think so?

323
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,320
I believe you think the same way.

324
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,000
We're quite in sync.

325
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,210
Congratulations. You have found
a comrade and true friend now.

326
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,280
So Ning Zhiyuan is Ning Jing's...

327
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,800
Brother.

328
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,169
I knew it.

329
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,930
I noticed the way he looks at you
is different.

330
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,360
Ding Wei, since when did you
become so nosy?

331
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,210
He's Ning Jing's brother.
I also see him as my brother.

332
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,650
But if Ning Jing were still alive,

333
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,730
she'd surely be happy if Zhiyuan
found a girlfriend who's not a cop.

334
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,099
What's wrong with dating a cop?

335
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,880
You're discriminating
against this profession.

336
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,099
Why did she leave?

337
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,970
She left her phone
and purse behind and hasn't paid.

338
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,169
What's the place over there, Ding Wei?

339
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,410
Batong Port.

340
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,650
Look.

341
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,249
Over there.

342
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,250
Okay.

343
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,600
Let's go.

344
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,250
Stay back.

345
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,490
All right,

346
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,059
I won't come any closer.

347
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,280
We're the police.

348
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,760
You can talk to us
if something is wrong.

349
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,130
We can help you.

350
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,800
Trust us.

351
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,210
No one can help me.

352
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,450
You can't.

353
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,650
We won't lie to you.

354
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,800
I don't even know how you can help me.

355
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,730
Why is my money gone?

356
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,929
I lost everything.

357
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,819
No one can help me.

358
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,689
I can't carry on with my life anymore.

359
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,360
I'm not afraid to die.

360
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,320
Don't move.

361
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,840
I'm not moving.

362
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,450
Let go of me.

363
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,130
Are you all right, Ms. Wei?

364
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,379
Are you okay, Ms. Wei?

365
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,170
I'm good.

366
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,890
Are you okay?

367
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,649
(Baizhou Police)

368
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,489
I looked into the woman.
She came from the provincial area.

369
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,339
She works as a janitor in Tianci Tower

370
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,099
with little pay.

371
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,920
She's been to Baizhou
for seven to eight years.

372
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,720
She saved up a few hundred thousand
and invested it in a financial product.

373
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,000
Some time ago, her dad
was diagnosed with cancer.

374
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,960
She wanted to withdraw her money
to pay for his treatments,

375
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,650
but then she found out
all her money was gone.

376
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,339
Gone?

377
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,339
Yes.

378
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,520
A financial firm's employee, Tang Tang,
embezzled the money for loan lending.

379
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,139
What?

380
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,320
Seriously?

381
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,539
Anyway, I've heard about things
like this before.

382
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,690
How does the financial firm
respond to this?

383
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,779
They pass the buck

384
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,489
to Tang Tang.

385
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,449
But the problem is

386
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,649
Tang Tang quit her job a few months ago.

387
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,520
There's no sign of her now.

388
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,929
That woman is desperate

389
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,819
and drinks a little.

390
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,080
She almost

391
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,560
took her own life.

392
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,059
You see, you can never
entrust your money

393
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,450
to financial advisory firms.

394
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:26,819
I must

395
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,450
tell my mum right now.

396
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,250
Does this count as a crime?

397
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,139
I already had Anran arrest her.

398
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,139
We couldn't find her.

399
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,320
We couldn't find her.

400
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,250
- We couldn't find her.
- What?

401
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,130
You couldn't find her.

402
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,080
What's wrong with you, Ms. Wei?

403
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,009
Get to the point.

404
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,819
Oh. Here's what happened.
We went to Tang Tang's house.

405
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,800
Her husband said she went back
to her parents' house three months ago

406
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,929
and never returned.

407
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,539
Then we went to her parents' house.

408
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,299
Her parents said

409
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,249
she had been with her husband
the whole time

410
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,249
and never came back.

411
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,209
We assume

412
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,899
she lied to both sides.

413
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,360
She's probably already fled
with the money by now.

414
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,130
You're still drinking here so casually.

415
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,040
Keep investigating. Go on!

416
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,650
Yes, madam.

417
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,760
Oh, my. Young people these days.

418
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,280
January, 2018.

419
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:23,899
You're eating instant noodles?

420
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,080
Ms. Li,

421
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,819
are you looking something up?

422
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,209
Yes.

423
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,539
I need the interrogation footage
of Ning Zhiyuan from Tianxiang Group.

424
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,690
Sure.

425
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,729
Ms. Li,

426
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,929
are you looking into
Captain Ding's case again?

427
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:40,539
No, I just need to verify some details

428
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,760
and review the case.

429
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,539
All right.

430
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,690
Thank you.

431
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,720
Don't eat too much junk food.
It's unhealthy.

432
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,840
All right.

433
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,760
Mr. Liu.

434
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,240
I've checked the online systems
for trains and airplanes.

435
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,490
There are no records
of Tang Tang leaving the city.

436
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,489
What about the highways?

437
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,299
That'd be difficult.

438
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,379
If you really need that,

439
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,600
we'll have to mobilize
a lot of police resources.

440
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,280
But I don't think it's necessary.

441
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,099
I tracked Tang Tang's
bank card transactions.

442
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,730
She's been frequenting

443
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,520
these two places.

444
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,320
Both are cybercafes.

445
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,930
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

446
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,139
(Cybercafe)

447
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,969
Fight them.

448
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:51,929
Quick.

449
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,080
Where are you?

450
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,840
No. I can't. My bar hits zero.
My bar hits zero. I'll retreat.

451
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,929
Excuse me.

452
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,080
Have you seen her?

453
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,520
- No.
- Thank you.

454
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,250
Have you seen her?

455
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,280
No.

456
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,320
Thank you.

457
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,619
Ma'am, excuse me.

458
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,970
Have you seen this person before?

459
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,520
No.

460
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,560
Thank you.

461
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,210
Mister over there.
Where are you going?

462
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,840
Stand right there.

463
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,139
Send me a copy of this.

464
00:24:59,140 --> 00:24:59,779
Okay.

465
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,449
And this too?

466
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:00,819
Yes.

467
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,970
Hey.

468
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,099
You guys got it right.

469
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,560
Guess who we caught earlier today.

470
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,250
- Who?
- Come here.

471
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,059
(Reward Notice)

472
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,000
(Class A Wanted Order)
Piao Daguang,

473
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,409
32 years old.

474
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:21,449
Imprisoned twice from 2015 to 2019
for Offenses of Aggravated Assault.

475
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,249
Early this year,

476
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:26,080
he abducted and murdered
a 17-year-old girl

477
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,890
and has been on the run ever since.

478
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,040
Really?

479
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:34,450
Cops from the neighboring city didn't
have a proper Chinese New Year to catch him.

480
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,800
They all hate his gut.

481
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,099
This guy is bold.

482
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,969
He's on the run,

483
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,520
yet he dares to hang out in a cybercafe.

484
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,450
And now we got him.

485
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,880
Oh no. Tang Tang has been missing
for a few months,

486
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,579
and her phone is with the murderer.

487
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,450
In that case...

488
00:25:51,296 --> 00:25:53,999
(Baizhou Police)

489
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,950
(Interrogation Room)

490
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,170
Why do you have Tang Tang's phone?

491
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:03,649
Who is Tang Tang

492
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,800
or anything?

493
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,729
A man or a woman?

494
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,490
Are they as good-looking as you?

495
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,320
Just answer my question.

496
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,600
Where's Tang Tang?

497
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,409
I don't know.

498
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,130
Who's this Tang Tang?

499
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,689
Her phone is with you,

500
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,970
and you claim not to know her?

501
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,000
I found it.

502
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,000
You found it?

503
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,970
Where?

504
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,299
In the cybercafe.

505
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,560
When did you find the phone?

506
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,130
Just now.

507
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,360
Piao Daguang.

508
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,339
Madam,

509
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,210
please don't scare me.

510
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:46,560
We have Tang Tang's spending records
from the last month.

511
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,449
Look at this. Chengxin Cybercafe.

512
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,970
Chengxin Cybercafe.

513
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,689
Was it you?

514
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,930
You just found

515
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,650
the phone?

516
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,649
Well, a few days ago.

517
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:03,800
Which day exactly?

518
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,819
I don't remember.

519
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,040
Where did you find it?

520
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,080
I don't remember that either.

521
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,859
Piao Daguang, if this is your attitude,

522
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,250
you're not getting out of here.

523
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,800
Madam, are you pulling my leg?

524
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,729
I killed someone.
I'm not expecting to get out anyway.

525
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,040
Cut your crap.

526
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,320
Where's Tang Tang?

527
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,520
I really had no idea.

528
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,250
Hello?

529
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,520
Okay.

530
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,409
Ms. Wei, while Tang Tang
has been for three months,

531
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,600
Piao Daguang has been holding her phone.

532
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,649
Technical Investigation Division
found bloodstains on it.

533
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,539
Piao Daguang

534
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,619
has a long crime record.

535
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,819
We believe

536
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,250
the victim may be in grave danger.

537
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,840
Contact Li Mochou.

538
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,009
Tell her to interrogate Piao Daguang and
find out the whereabouts of Tang Tang.

539
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,170
Yes, madam.

540
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,360
Hey,

541
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,859
let's go to Piao Daguang's place.

542
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,040
Let's go.

543
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,929
Captain Ding, the suspect,
Pu Daguang, male,

544
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,210
32 years old.

545
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,650
He was imprisoned twice
for intentional injury.

546
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,969
Earlier this year, he abducted
and killed a 17-year-old girl.

547
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:43,689
He fled to Baizhou

548
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,930
and rented a two-story shared unit
near Shuiyuan Street.

549
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,779
Oh.

550
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,890
Alienware.

551
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,250
What alien?

552
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,929
This is a professional gaming computer.

553
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:11,249
It costs at least 15,000.

554
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,249
15,000?

555
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,320
Yes.

556
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,729
Isn't Piao Daguang on the run?

557
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,130
Where did he get that much money?

558
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,800
Did he use Tang Tang's money?

559
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,929
Madam.

560
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,170
Officer.

561
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,690
Respected officer.

562
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,859
I really don't know anything.

563
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,099
You can't just assume
that every dead person is my doing

564
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,490
just because you found
that I killed someone.

565
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,410
Oh? You're saying Tang Tang is dead?

566
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,410
I didn't say that.

567
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,840
You killed her?

568
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,619
I don't know. Not me.

569
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,800
Where is she now?

570
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,009
- How am I supposed to know?
- Is she Injured?

571
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,080
What's your problem?

572
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,619
I said I didn't abduct her

573
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,619
or kill her.

574
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,249
I didn't even know who she was.

575
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,410
You're lying.

576
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:53,890
I'm not.

577
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,139
These takeouts are for only one person.

578
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,160
(One portion of Korean kimchi)
Are you suggesting...

579
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,890
This suggests that Tang Tang isn't here.

580
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,059
Notify Mochou.

581
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,859
Piao Daguang likely has an accomplice.

582
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:08,139
Tang Tang is still in danger.
Find this person as quickly as possible.

583
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,840
So you do have an accomplice.
Tang Tang is with them, right?

584
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,209
I don't have any accomplices. No.

585
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,970
My colleagues are searching
your neighborhood.

586
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,970
Tang Tang isn't at your place.

587
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,170
Sir,

588
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,210
do you recognize this person?

589
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,210
Excuse me.
Have you seen this face before?

590
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,539
No.

591
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,450
Ma'am, have you seen this person?

592
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,800
No.

593
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,490
Thank you.

594
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,250
How's it going, Tiaotiao?

595
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,170
We can't get anything from him.
This interrogation is tough.

596
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,689
Ask Mochou to figure something out.
We know nothing about the victim's situation.

597
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,520
Her life could be in danger
at any moment.
