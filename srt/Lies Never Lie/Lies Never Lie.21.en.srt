28
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,229
Around 4:30 P.M., 19th of May, 2018,

29
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,709
we received a call.

30
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,160
The owner of the phone is Li Hui.

31
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,949
Li Hui?

32
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,090
Li Hui?

33
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,620
Do you know him?

34
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,810
I don't know if the Li Hui you mentioned
is the same Li Hui I knew.

35
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,180
He's the ex-chairman of Tianxiang Group.

36
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,149
The ex-chairman of Tianxiang Group?

37
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,779
That's right.

38
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,949
Five years ago,

39
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,619
he retreated behind the scenes.

40
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,059
But he sold off all of his shares.

41
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,370
He retired.

42
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,339
After that, he went on a yacht.

43
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,810
The yacht was caught in an accident.

44
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,060
It was a huge deal.

45
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,800
It was quite the news back then.

46
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,829
Yifei brought him up
numerous times before this.

47
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,899
He was considered
Yifei's kindred spirit.

48
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,619
He had been quite supportive of her.

49
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,370
But how did Li Hui and Ning Jing
get to know each other?

50
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,060
Why did he call her private phone
with his work phone?

51
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,460
Let me check.

52
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,019
According to the logs, Li Hui
went on a private yacht.

53
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,899
It crashed into a coral reef.

54
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,620
No one survived.

55
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,300
When did it happen?

56
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,370
18th of July.

57
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,370
The time doesn't match.

58
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,300
Give me a second.

59
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,829
Although Li Hui died on
the 18th of July,

60
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:31,500
Li Hui departed for the sea
on the 21st of May.

61
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,899
The 21st of May?

62
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,109
That means Li Hui went missing

63
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,949
since the 21st of May.

64
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,339
I remember that Ning Jing was murdered

65
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,459
on the 21st of May. At the same time,
a skeleton was discovered

66
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,900
in the wildlife park, which was
devoured by wild animals.

67
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,970
And, the case hasn't been
solved as of yet.

68
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,580
Do you think the skeleton
belongs to Li Hui?

69
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,900
Can we obtain Li Hui's DNA?

70
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,250
I'll try.

71
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,530
Captain Ding.

72
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,899
I made some inquiries.

73
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,619
Li Hui had no children.

74
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,499
None of his immediate
family members are alive.

75
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,090
He lived alone when he was still alive.

76
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:20,490
Maybe we'll be able to find traces
of his DNA from his personal items.

77
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,469
Send his address to me.

78
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,059
This is his address.

79
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,220
Okay.

80
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,460
Thank you for your cooperation.

81
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,410
Goodbye.

82
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,260
I can only help you
until tomorrow's boarding.

83
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,700
Hello?

84
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,059
Mochou.

85
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,299
The DNA result is out.

86
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,090
The skeleton does belong to Li Hui.

87
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,580
Ning Jing's murder is definitely
related to this case.

88
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,720
Therefore, we must gather evidence
of Luo Yifei's crime from this.

89
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,229
Ning Zhiyuan said Li Hui was
Luo Yifei's kindred spirit.

90
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,789
They had a great relationship.

91
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,669
If so, what exactly happened
three years ago

92
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,780
for Luo Yifei to murder him?

93
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,739
Could it be that Li Hui

94
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,940
has the goods on Luo Yifei
and he wanted to report it to Ning Jing?

95
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,140
Maybe that's why Ning Jing was murdered.

96
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,469
Luo Yifei set up such an elaborate plot.

97
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,259
She resorted to murdering cops
and silencing multiple victims.

98
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,170
Perhaps the crimes
she's trying to cover up

99
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,179
are way more severe than we think.

100
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,549
Tianxiang Group is
a pharmaceutical company.

101
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,340
What kind of illegal deeds
can they commit?

102
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,410
Could it be that they've been
manufacturing and selling drugs?

103
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,580
Drugs?

104
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,139
If so, we must find the truth
before Luo Yifei

105
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,050
leaves the country.

106
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,939
Did Tianxiang Group

107
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,410
make any unusual moves three years ago?

108
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,259
Liu, help me search for

109
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,410
Tianxiang Group.

110
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,820
I've done some research.

111
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,139
Glory Tower,
which was located in our city,

112
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,739
was initiated and constructed by
Tianxiang Group three years ago.

113
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,819
In May of that year,

114
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,229
construction was halted due to some
disagreements at the upper levels.

115
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,970
Construction was only resumed in July.

116
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,059
Li Hui's true time of death was in May.

117
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,109
July was the time when he was reported
to have died at sea.

118
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,850
It was also the time Luo Yifei
took over the company officially.

119
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,780
Something must be off with the building.

120
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,050
Here's another detail to take note of.

121
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,490
The main designer of the building is

122
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,499
Bao Xijie.

123
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,650
Bao Xijie?

124
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,739
We couldn't find the reason

125
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,669
Luo Yifei silenced Bao Xijie.

126
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,650
Maybe the answer we seek
is inside the building.

127
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,139
If Tianxiang Group did
manufacture and sell drugs,

128
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,619
I suppose their secret base

129
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,820
should be located in Glory Tower.

130
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,460
Ning Zhiyuan and Luo Yifei
got engaged today

131
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,970
at Glory Tower.

132
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,899
Ding Wei, I've arrived at the scene.

133
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,609
Ms. Mochou. This doesn't look like a venue
for a wedding engagement.

134
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:55,139
Luo Yifei is a successful career woman.

135
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,950
Why would she decorate
the place this shabbily?

136
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,420
And, the people here don't seem like
her friends or family members.

137
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,200
Luo Yifei just had a harrowing experience
after Meng Zhengyi tried to kill her.

138
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,620
She shouldn't held her wedding engagement now,
not to mention at a shabby place like this.

139
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,229
Luo Yifei knew
that we were going to act.

140
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,109
That's why she caused a huge commotion
to impede our progress.

141
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,709
That means our judgment is correct.

142
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,660
Something's off with Glory Tower indeed.

143
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,050
(Ning Zhiyuan & Luo Yifei
I Met You At My Best)

144
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,460
You're too near the camera.

145
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,540
I'm so happy today.

146
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,120
We got engaged today.

147
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,019
For the rest of our lives.

148
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,779
From this moment onward,

149
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,660
we shall be together for eternity.

150
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,139
Tiaotiao, Yue Qun,

151
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,040
you guys can remain here.

152
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,920
See if there are any leads
you can pick up on.

153
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,709
Yes, ma'am.

154
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,349
Ding Wei,

155
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,379
I watched their videos.

156
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,469
They didn't hold the wedding to
impede the cops from investigating the case.

157
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,360
The last expression
she showed toward the camera

158
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,960
was the message
she wanted to relay to me.

159
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,259
She was provoking me.

160
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,379
And, she's not at the scene at all.

161
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,360
Have Tech Liu check right away if
their flight tickets have been rebooked.

162
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,820
I found something.
Luo Yifei did rebook her flight.

163
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,739
The flight time is 11:55 P.M.

164
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,250
Flight CA5969.

165
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,010
It's in 40 minutes.

166
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,229
We have no time left.

167
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,820
I'll rush to the airport now.

168
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,659
Excuse me!

169
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,820
Officer!

170
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,109
Someone called me all of a sudden.

171
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,340
He wanted me to notify you guys

172
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,869
that the engagement banquet
has been canceled. Something cropped up.

173
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,949
Notify us?

174
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,700
- That's right.
- Notify us?

175
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,770
That's right.

176
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,469
Set up the perimeter! Seal off the scene!

177
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,850
Hurry! Seal off the scene!

178
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,829
Tiaotiao, check the order's
phone number and info.

179
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,610
Yes, sir.

180
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,090
Luo Yifei,

181
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,300
are you treating illegal activities
like it's a casual dinner invitation?

182
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,419
(Service Suspended)

183
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,309
Hello.

184
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,259
Flight CA5969.

185
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:11,659
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,019
Boarding has already been closed.

187
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,949
I'm a cop. I need to look for someone.

188
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,090
Please wait a moment.

189
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,770
Has Flight CA5969 taken flight?

190
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,090
Okay. Officer, the flight
has already departed.

191
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,250
Ms. Mochou.

192
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,370
What are you doing here?

193
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,229
Ms. Luo, what a coincidence.

194
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,899
Initially,

195
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,770
Zhiyuan and I booked the 10 P.M. flight.

196
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,580
Zhiyuan, we've arrived.

197
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,420
Hello, Mr. Li?

198
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,940
Yes.

199
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,890
Right now?

200
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,700
Alright, got it.

201
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,970
What's wrong?

202
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,180
Something cropped up at the company.

203
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,060
He's urging me to head back.

204
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,580
Why don't we rebook our flight?

205
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,940
Are you sure?

206
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,820
He already called me, you know?

207
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,540
But he had something urgent to do.

208
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,280
Therefore,
we've decided to depart tomorrow.

209
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,660
Thank you for your cooperation.

210
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,139
Goodbye.

211
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,460
I can only help you
until tomorrow's boarding.

212
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,770
What are you doing here?

213
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,770
I came here to see my friend off.

214
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,300
I couldn't make it in time.

215
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,659
Yue! Anran!

216
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,580
Captain Ding.

217
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,709
What have you found?

218
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,360
This is just a normal office building.

219
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,520
Tianxiang Pharmaceuticals owns
all the floors above Floor 15.

220
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,560
Normal tech companies occupy
Floor 15 and below.

221
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,140
Didn't you guys
discover anything strange?

222
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,850
We've searched the building
several times. We didn't discover anything.

223
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,490
Mochou.

224
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,300
We checked the building.

225
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,940
There's nothing strange about it.

226
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,490
Ms. Mochou?

227
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,139
I'm driving back to the city.

228
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,109
- Do you want to join me?
- Sure.

229
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,250
Let's go.

230
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,829
Thank you.

231
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,090
Don't mention it.

232
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,180
Captain Ding, what's wrong?

233
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,499
I think something's off.

234
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,499
Logically speaking,

235
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,829
Ning Zhiyuan and Luo Yifei
went to the airport together.

236
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,229
But why did Ning Zhiyuan leave

237
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,890
while Luo Yifei remain behind?

238
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,560
This might be a coincidence.

239
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,400
After all, the flight
just departed not long ago.

240
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,460
Maybe Luo Yifei didn't make it in time.

241
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,610
I don't think so.

242
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,949
Go and find out where Ning Zhiyuan is.

243
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,090
Yes, ma'am.

244
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,899
Ms. Luo, I heard that you got engaged
with Zhiyuan at Glory Tower today.

245
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,229
What a coincidence
to encounter you at the airport.

246
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,460
Are you leaving
because of something urgent?

247
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,090
Would you believe me
if I said I did it on a whim?

248
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,659
It's because I suddenly realized
that the most important thing

249
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,820
for a couple is
for their hearts to be one.

250
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,460
But you won't believe anything

251
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,370
I tell you now, right?

252
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,069
I knew that you looked for Zhiyuan

253
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,580
and told him to stall me

254
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,700
so that you guys could
gather evidence of my crime.

255
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,469
Seeing your friend off?

256
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,010
That's an excuse.

257
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,220
You guys think I'm the mastermind
behind Meng Zhengyi's action,

258
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,779
right?

259
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,139
We can't locate him. Ning Zhiyuan's phone
has been switched off.

260
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,869
The signal of his phone
was last detected

261
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,370
at the neighborhood he lives in.

262
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,610
Alright. Ms. Wei.

263
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,460
Mr. Liu said Ning Zhiyuan
didn't go to the airport today.

264
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,069
Mochou.

265
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,480
Stop your car. This is a trap.

266
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,309
Ning Zhiyuan didn't go
to the airport at all.

267
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,600
Luo Yifei appeared at the airport
in order to wait for you.

268
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,370
Mochou.

269
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,060
Mochou?

270
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,220
Something has happened. Recall the team!

271
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,229
Recall the team!

272
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,109
Everyone, get back!

273
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,420
Let's go!

274
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,139
There are no updates from Mochou.

275
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,589
How did it go?

276
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,460
Captain Ding.

277
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,379
We found a handkerchief

278
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,770
soaked in chloroform in the car.

279
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,080
Mochou might've been drugged.

280
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,259
Where did Luo Yifei get her hands
on such contraband?

281
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,360
Tianxiang is a pharmaceutical company.
She can have all the drugs she desires.

282
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,309
But Master is a psychologist.

283
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,229
She wouldn't fall for
her tricks that easily.

284
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,700
Your master also said

285
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,010
that one's emotions will cloud
their judgment sometimes.

286
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,960
Since this case is
related to Ning Zhiyuan,

287
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,899
the more she cares about it,
the more flustered she is.

288
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,720
Something's definitely off
about Glory Tower.

289
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,469
Bao Xijie constructed the building.

290
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,370
We might find leads
if we start investigating Bao Xijie.

291
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,229
Anran, lead the search.

292
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,779
Yes, ma'am.

293
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,010
Mobilize everyone we have
and search the entire city.

294
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,739
Find Li Mochou even if you guys

295
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,349
have to flip Baizhou upside down!

296
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,490
Yes, ma'am.

297
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,730
Hello. Please show me your ID card.

298
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,890
Alright. Please go ahead.

299
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,370
It's out of power since
it's been vacant for a long time.

300
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,469
Find all the models
and blueprints related to construction,

301
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,829
anything that has to do with Glory Tower.

302
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,970
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

303
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,540
Zhiyuan?

304
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,539
Zhiyuan!

305
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,700
Zhiyuan!

306
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,300
Zhiyuan!

307
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,739
Mochou?

308
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,779
Zhiyuan, are you okay?

309
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,770
I'm fine.

310
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,939
This isn't working.

311
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,570
We have to wait for her to contact us.

312
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,749
That won't do.

313
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,139
Mochou is in danger now.

314
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,269
She has no way to contact us.

315
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,490
Think of something.

316
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,700
Mochou is in a lot of danger now.

317
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,700
You have to locate her
as soon as possible.

318
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,490
What are you looking for?

319
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,180
You may stop.

320
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,700
It's with me.

321
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,700
So, it's you indeed.

322
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,970
What are you doing?

323
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,050
She's manufacturing drugs.

324
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,810
More accurately,
manufacturing and selling drugs.

325
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,490
Initially, it was just my speculation.

326
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,490
But now that I'm seeing all these,

327
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,570
it proves that my speculation is right.

328
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,029
And you used Li Hui's import-export
trade channels

329
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,290
to transport the drugs you made abroad.

330
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,380
Am I right?

331
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,620
It's a shame that a person
of your intellect is just a cop.

332
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,330
It's done.

333
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,040
It's connected.
We cannot communicate with it.

334
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,970
However, we can intercept
Mochou's signal.

335
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,220
Ms. Mochou, I wanted to let you off.

336
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,509
But you kept

337
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,380
pursuing me.

338
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,180
Everyone would've been safe

339
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,570
had you let me
and Zhiyuan left the country.

340
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,899
But you actually bewitched Zhiyuan

341
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,570
and made him betray me.

342
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,050
Let me ask you something.

343
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,419
Do you still love him?

344
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,509
Answer me.

345
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,460
Hey!

346
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,250
You always knew that I loved you.

347
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,220
You miss her.

348
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,330
I can forgive you for that.

349
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,620
You investigated me on her behalf.

350
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:25,829
I can choose

351
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,250
not to ask you about it.

352
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,970
I can even give you my life
if you ask for it.

353
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,970
If we took that flight,

354
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,970
I believe

355
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,140
that we'll have a happy future together.

356
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,979
But why did you choose to trust her?

357
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,250
Why?

358
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,810
Why did you choose to trust her?

359
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,659
Why did you choose her instead of me

360
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,970
at the very end?

361
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,419
Yue, we managed to
locate Mochou's phone.

362
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,000
Be ready to rescue her at any moment.

363
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,829
Liu, pinpoint her location.

364
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,660
Yes, ma'am.

365
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,619
Captain Ding, we lost the signal.

366
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,800
Did you manage to pinpoint it?

367
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,589
Not really.

368
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,050
But the area has been narrowed down
to within one km.

369
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,420
This won't do. We don't have time.

370
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,970
Notify everyone.

371
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,939
Do a sweep search within the perimeter.

372
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,900
Yes, ma'am.

373
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,620
I bought this watch for you, you know?

374
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,660
You wish to call the cops?

375
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,010
Luo Yifei.

376
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,380
I'll ask you one thing.

377
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,860
Did you murder my sister?

378
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,860
Answer me.

379
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,860
Answer me!

380
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,220
I didn't know that she was your sister.

381
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,420
Did you do it because
Ning Jing obstructed you?

382
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,939
Li Hui found out that you smuggled drugs

383
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,160
under the guise of international trade
using his name.

384
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,250
That's why he reported you
to Ning Jing in secret.

385
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,509
You used that to your advantage
and lured them out,

386
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,290
silencing everyone in the process.

387
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,180
Besides them,

388
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,810
Li Hui, Zeng Xiang,

389
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,220
Ning Jing,

390
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,900
Bao Xijie,

391
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:38,869
Xu Jun,

392
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,290
Meng Zhengyi, you murdered all of them.

393
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,029
Lastly, you pushed all the blame
on Meng Zhengyi.

394
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,029
You're truly despicable,

395
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,220
Luo Yifei.

396
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,269
I told you not to stare at me like that.

397
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,109
Don't you understand?

398
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,869
I told you not to stare at me!

399
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,100
Let go of him!

400
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,490
What have I done wrong?

401
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,829
I'm making my own money here.

402
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,139
I didn't steal or rob anyone.

403
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,960
I tried to make money
together with them!

404
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,800
What have I done wrong?

405
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,509
What gives them the right
to obstruct me?

406
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,029
What gives?

407
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,810
I gave them chances before.

408
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,380
They didn't heed my advice.

409
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,970
If so,

410
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,050
I have to get rid of them one by one.

411
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,900
You lunatic.

412
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,379
What did you call me?

413
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,250
You're a lunatic!

414
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,250
That's right! I'm a lunatic!

415
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,459
I've lost my mind
all because I've fallen for you!

416
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,900
Did you hear me?

417
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:41,869
Anran.

418
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:42,810
Over here.

419
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,660
Shine some light on it.

420
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,810
There's a hidden compartment.

421
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,419
Ms. Wei.

422
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,749
We found the real blueprint
in Bao Xijie's house.

423
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,309
Glory Tower is actually
a twin-layered building.

424
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,789
A low, hidden space was added

425
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,860
between every two floors.

426
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,420
Everyone,
return to Glory Tower immediately.

427
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,330
Li Mochou.

428
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,660
Aren't you an expert at reading minds?

429
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,589
Come. Take a guess.

430
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,330
Guess what I'm thinking right now.

431
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,940
Tell me.

432
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,660
That's easy.

433
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,620
Zhiyuan chose to trust me.

434
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,490
He didn't trust you.

435
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,530
You thought Zhiyuan betrayed you.

436
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,620
That's why you tied us up
and kept us here.

437
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,770
You're just exacting revenge.

438
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,420
You didn't intend to let us
leave this place alive from the start.

439
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,789
Am I right?

440
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,940
That's right.

441
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,940
Bingo.

442
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,530
So what?

443
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,660
Do you think anyone
is going to rescue you?

444
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,269
Captain Ding?

445
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,899
Listen,

446
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,530
she won't be able to find the place.

447
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,290
You have to die today.

448
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,660
Ning Zhiyuan, let me ask you this.

449
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,080
Will you leave with me or not?

450
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,330
Answer me!

451
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,730
Scram.

452
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,420
Let's play a game.

453
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,100
Make a choice between you two.

454
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,900
We'll definitely leave this place alive.

455
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,379
Hey!

456
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,530
Is anyone there?

457
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,940
There's toxic gas!

458
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,770
Hurry and untie the rope!

459
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,140
Mochou!

460
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,250
Mochou!

461
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,460
Hurry and put it on!

462
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,490
Hurry and put it on!

463
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,250
I can't afford to lose you!

464
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,900
I've already lost Ning Jing!

465
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,940
I can't afford to lose you!

466
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,700
Hurry and put it on!

467
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,570
Mochou.

468
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,700
Here comes the oxygen tank.

469
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,100
Tiaotiao.

470
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,619
Captain Ding, we searched the area.

471
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,659
We found no one.
I think she has escaped.

472
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,530
Luo Yifei came prepared.

473
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,940
Captain Ding.

474
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,789
A yacht.

475
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,970
What?

476
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,730
I gave her a yacht during her birthday.

477
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
I haven't had the time
to transfer the ownership yet.

478
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,330
That's why you guys can't find it.

479
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,100
It's at Binhai Road Yacht Club.

480
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,789
Captain Ding.

481
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,100
Let me join you.

482
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,900
Don't move!

483
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,380
Turn around!

484
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,330
Did Ning Zhiyuan tell you guys
that I was here?

485
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,570
He bought me this yacht, you know?

486
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,180
Li Mochou,

487
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,900
do you think you've won?

488
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,940
Listen.

489
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,349
I'll never admit defeat.

490
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,570
Luo Yifei.

491
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,250
You've lost everything.

492
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,330
That's right.

493
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,220
I've lost everything indeed.

494
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,730
But what gives?

495
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,379
I earned all of this myself!

496
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,100
No one can take them away from me!

497
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:41,900
Now, the entire yacht
has been strapped with bombs.

498
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,570
Do you guys dare to play a game with me?

499
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,140
Let's see who can survive.

500
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,290
Hurry! Over there!

501
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,290
(Tomb of Ning Jing)
Life is unpredictable indeed.

502
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,220
Thank you, Mochou.

503
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,400
(Tomb of Ning Jing)

504
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:10,400
(During The Operation)

505
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,269
The Tianxiang Group
drug trafficking case is, so far,

506
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,069
the largest
chain murder case in Baizhou,

507
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,330
with drug trafficking as its foundation.

508
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,219
This case is far-reaching and
involves extremely serious criminal activities.

509
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:32,939
During the case,

510
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,619
Officer Ning Jing
of Gongmen Branch was sacrificed

511
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,900
during her investigation.

512
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,269
After our investigation,
the main culprit, Luo Yifei,

513
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,179
had received professional
psychological training overseas.

514
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,309
She used the techniques she learned

515
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,160
to manipulate Meng Zhengyi,
her accomplice,

516
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,530
to commit numerous crimes on her behalf.

517
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,419
After her deeds were exposed,

518
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,419
Luo Yifei pushed all the blame

519
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,179
on Meng Zhengyi.

520
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,379
To cover up her drug manufacturing
and trafficking tracks,

521
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:58,869
Luo Yifei

522
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,620
plotted the murder of Li Hui,
ex-chairman of Tianxiang Group,

523
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,829
Officer Ning Jing of Gongmen Branch,

524
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,900
Zeng Xiang, suspect of Major Case 219,

525
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,179
Bao Xijie, architect of Glory Tower,

526
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,490
and his family.

527
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,939
Li Guangrong, a hitman
employed by both Luo and Meng,

528
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,269
tried to assassinate Officer Li Mochou
twice but to no avail.

529
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,180
After that, he was silenced by them.

530
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,179
The facts of this case are clear,

531
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,460
and the evidence is sufficient.

532
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,060
The individuals involved in the case
have already been apprehended.

533
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,770
During this period,

534
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:41,379
psychological analysis has played
a significant supporting role

535
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,940
in our frontline
criminal investigations.

536
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,660
Next, we hope
that under the strong leadership of

537
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,900
the municipal party committee
and government,

538
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,349
we will give our all

539
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,700
to overcome difficulties
and tackle challenges.

540
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:58,139
We will complete the tasks
entrusted to us by the Party.

541
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,290
Comrades!

542
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,589
Do you guys
