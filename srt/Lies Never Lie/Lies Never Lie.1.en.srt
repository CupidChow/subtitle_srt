If the whistleblower has a tip,

29
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,680
he could just meet you at the station.

30
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,400
Why make such a big deal out of it
and meet there?

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
An abandoned building

32
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,470
with dim lighting.

33
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,000
Hey,

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,960
and the worst part is,

35
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,430
you're willing to play along with him.

36
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,470
Listen.

37
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,080
He's using the "giant baby" psychology,

38
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,430
trying to manipulate
you emotionally first.

39
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,680
Oh, here we go.

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,080
You're psychoanalyzing again, doc.

41
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,430
Jeez...

42
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,310
If you think my degree is of any use,

43
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,190
I shouldn't even be sitting here.

44
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,150
Collecting visual and audio evidence

45
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,430
is a critical task.

46
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,150
I'm asking you
to save this data remotely

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
to prepare for any potential danger.

48
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,520
Keep the evidence safe.

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,030
Got it, Master.

50
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,710
Integrating psychological analysis
into criminal investigation

51
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,120
is exactly my research topic.

52
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,560
Mochou.

53
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,520
If your analysis really works,

54
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,280
I hope you can find some clues

55
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,630
from this meetup.

56
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,590
It will help with case documentation.

57
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,630
Understood.

58
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,190
Now,

59
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,360
consider me your eyes.

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,310
Remember,

61
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,470
stay safe.

62
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,990
Do not leave your post
without permission.

63
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,150
Copy that.

64
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,800
This place

65
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,150
looks deliberately arranged.

66
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,910
He's not just putting up a show.

67
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,840
This environment could be
his psychological tactic.

68
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,080
Start recording.

69
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,280
Be careful.

70
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,840
Master,

71
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,590
listen to me.

72
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,000
This place is too eerie.

73
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,310
A closed space
is like one's inner world.

74
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,000
What you're seeing right now

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,310
shows his inner thoughts.

76
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,030
The sense of order here,

77
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,190
his desire for control,

78
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,470
and even these characters
all tell something.

79
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,920
I've come as promised.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,680
If you have

81
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,920
any evidence to report,

82
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,040
please present it.

83
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,720
We'll handle the evidence

84
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,680
with a fair and thorough attitude

85
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,510
and enforce the law impartially.

86
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,190
Who is the woman in the photo?

87
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,920
What's your relationship with her?

88
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,680
What's her relationship
with the person you're reporting?

89
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,720
Ning Jing, listen.

90
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,890
That place is dangerous.
You need to leave immediately.

91
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,290
Get out of there!

92
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,130
Get out of there now!

93
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,000
Open this door!

94
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,190
Open this door!

95
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,430
Ning Jing!

96
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,600
Ning Jing!

97
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,510
I'm here!

98
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,480
Ning Jing, behind you!

99
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,070
Over there!

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,630
I was wrong.

101
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,820
No signal. Where's the signal?

102
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,420
=Lies Never Lie=
=Episode 1=

103
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:44,380
(Three Years Later)

104
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,270
Yuan Xi,

105
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,760
you are suspected of illegal detention

106
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,230
and we need to search your residence.

107
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,000
Please cooperate.

108
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,040
Take him away.

109
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,510
Yes, madam.

110
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,120
Wait.

111
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,360
I can walk on my own.

112
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,630
Officer,

113
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,830
I've been waiting for you.

114
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,190
Take him away.

115
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,480
Get started.

116
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,360
Yes, madam.

117
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,510
Captain Ding,

118
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,190
take a look.

119
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,310
Liu Lulu.

120
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,190
Lin Susu.

121
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,040
Hou Ping.

122
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,630
Xu Jing.

123
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,310
There are other girls too.

124
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,180
(Li Jing)

125
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,190
Is there any connection between them?

126
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,070
So far, no clear connection.

127
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,390
This guy did

128
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,830
all these awful things
and still kept so much evidence.

129
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,240
He's got some nerve.

130
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,750
He keeps the evidence

131
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,920
and shows off his victims like trophies.

132
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,310
He must be arrogant, egotistical,

133
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,190
and self-obsessed.

134
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,480
Well, at least the evidence is here.

135
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,000
(Zhang Li)
It could save other girls.

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,540
(Wang Tian)

137
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:27,920
Ms. Wei.

138
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,800
Yeah?

139
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,720
This row has no photos.

140
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,390
You're right.

141
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,950
But there're rubber bands
around them.

142
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,560
Someone might have removed the photos.

143
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,560
I think there's another victim.

144
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,120
Captain.

145
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,680
Any findings?

146
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,480
No.

147
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,510
We found photos
of six kidnapped girls on the bottles.

148
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,510
Another one, for real?

149
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,480
There must be.

150
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,750
Keep searching.

151
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
Found it.

152
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,000
Ms. Wei,

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,270
Chief Ou wants you back now.

154
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,600
Yue.

155
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,310
Yeah?

156
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,430
I'll leave it to you.

157
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,480
We're heading back.

158
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,240
Sort the photos.

159
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,510
Okay.

160
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,830
This scum...

161
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,360
Help...

162
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,080
Anran.

163
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,600
Yes?

164
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,870
When we just arrived there,

165
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,910
was there music playing?

166
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,480
Yes.

167
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,550
Why?

168
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,630
Check what song it was.

169
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,480
Okay.

170
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,300
- Tiaotiao.
- Yes?

171
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,670
Prepare victim profiles now.

172
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,960
I'll interrogate Yuan Xi later.

173
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:42,630
Okay.

174
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,300
(Serve the People)

175
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,000
Master.

176
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,480
Ding Wei.

177
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,080
Chief,

178
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,840
you want to see me?

179
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:51,840
Come.

180
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,790
Let me introduce you.

181
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,910
This is Li Mochou,

182
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,480
a psychologist

183
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,150
assigned here.

184
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,150
The Bureau wants

185
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,270
our team to be a pilot case

186
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,390
to integrate psychology
into investigations.

187
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,790
Hello, Ms. Li.

188
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,200
Ding Wei.

189
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,360
Li Mochou.

190
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,150
Chief,

191
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,750
I have an update

192
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,240
on the serial kidnapping
and murder case.

193
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,030
It's okay.

194
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,870
Go on.

195
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,360
We've arrested the suspect.

196
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,910
At the time of the arrest,

197
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,480
he didn't try to escape

198
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,550
or resist.

199
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,000
Instead, it felt like he was waiting for us.

200
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,390
Also, we found signs

201
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,440
of a possible seventh victim
during the search.

202
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,630
That's the reason

203
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,870
I called you back here.

204
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,720
I just received word

205
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,870
that Ms. Luo, who was supposed to attend

206
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,120
business conference, is missing.

207
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,080
Ms. Luo?

208
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,750
Yes.

209
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,150
Luo Yifei, Chairwoman of Tianxiang Group.

210
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,440
Her secretary said

211
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,150
she went to a gym called Seven,

212
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,030
but never came out.

213
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,320
I'll send Anran to check it.

214
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:48,670
Wait.

215
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,590
I already sent someone.

216
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,030
Chief Ou,

217
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,000
I think I can start with this case.

218
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,480
This case isn't for you.

219
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,480
It's the Bureau's request.

220
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,080
They want to integrate
criminal psychological analysis

221
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,320
into frontline investigations

222
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,240
to improve our efficiency.

223
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,320
Are you questioning
my case-solving abilities?

224
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,600
Chief Ou.

225
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,150
Ms. Wei,

226
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,200
everything is ready.

227
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,510
Gotta go.

228
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,320
You two continue.

229
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,360
Hey.

230
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,240
Hey!

231
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,390
You left these on purpose?

232
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,240
Where is she?

233
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,910
It's no fun

234
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,750
to give you answers.

235
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,600
I have no time to play with you.

236
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Answer my question!

237
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,790
Watch your manners!

238
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,270
Is she still alive?

239
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,870
You're the police officers.

240
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,200
Isn't it your job to find out?

241
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,550
Listen here.

242
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,840
I don't have much patience.

243
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,910
One last chance.

244
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,120
Where did you hide her?

245
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,030
Is she still alive?

246
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,550
Chief Ou?

247
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,440
Chief Ou.

248
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,840
Who's this?

249
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,790
Zhao Tiaotiao.

250
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,320
How did you know my name?

251
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,630
I reviewed your files before I arrived.

252
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,390
I'm your new colleague, Li Mochou.

253
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,320
Nice to meet you.

254
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,670
How's it going?

255
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,550
Still questioning him.

256
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,150
Ms. Wei.

257
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,550
They've reviewed the gym's
security footage.

258
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,720
After Luo Yifei had entered,

259
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,970
Yuan Xi went in shortly after.

260
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,480
This is Luo Yifei,
Chairwoman of Tianxiang Group.

261
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,550
Am I right?

262
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,750
What's so funny?

263
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,440
Your time is running out.

264
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,960
What do you mean?

265
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,030
Chief Ou,

266
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,200
how about let me have a try?

267
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,240
Okay.

268
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,120
Two hours left.

269
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,670
Try me.

270
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,320
Come in.

271
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,550
Captain Ding,

272
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,200
could you step out for now?

273
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,390
I'll handle this.

274
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,150
You stay.

275
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,960
Okay.

276
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,240
Hello.

277
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:51,840
Hello.

278
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,960
I'm new here, Li Mochou.

279
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,440
Hello.

280
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,510
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

281
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,840
So, are you in charge?

282
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,240
Not exactly.

283
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,550
Chief Ou, who is she?

284
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,510
She's a professor

285
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,030
in psychology assigned by the Bureau

286
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,750
to assist with investigations.

287
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,750
Shouldn't you all be out
looking for her?

288
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,870
Well, we should.

289
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,960
But you're the one making it difficult.

290
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,360
So, why don't you just give us
the answer?

291
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,320
Based on our investigation,

292
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,790
Liu Lulu is a liquor distributor,

293
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,840
Lin Susu sells e-cigarettes,

294
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,080
and Hou Ping works in cosmetic surgery.

295
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,320
Could it be that Yuan Xi has a thing
for killing successful women?

296
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,480
We don't have time to analyze

297
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,680
what kind of women he targets.

298
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,120
The Chief wants us

299
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,990
to find Luo Yifei now.

300
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,840
Yes, madam.

301
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,360
Baizhou isn't big.

302
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,670
You still have two hours.

303
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,240
Yes, it's not that big.

304
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,270
Baizhou is about 46.9 km
from east to west

305
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,870
and 32.7 km from north to south.

306
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,630
So roughly it's 1,500 square kilometers.

307
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,550
And that's just the inner city,

308
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,480
not the outskirts.

309
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,670
Yeah, Baizhou isn't big.

310
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,790
Are you giving me a geography lesson?

311
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,440
Well,

312
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,840
I'm not giving you one.

313
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,720
I'm just explaining

314
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,150
that I'm terrible with directions.

315
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,000
So before I go anywhere,

316
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,960
I always check my route.

317
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,080
Taking public transport is too slow

318
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,720
and going to specific stops

319
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,670
is troublesome.

320
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,550
And with how fast the city is growing,

321
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,360
new skyscrapers keep popping up.

322
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,480
You know,

323
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,870
some of those buildings

324
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,510
have multiple basement levels.

325
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,440
Ah.

326
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,670
So?

327
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,360
So,

328
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,390
don't you ever feel like things
were better when we were kids?

329
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,480
The roads were wider

330
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,150
and there were fewer cars.

331
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,750
In a small place like Baizhou,

332
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,840
you'd just cross any bridge,

333
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,360
see an old banyan tree,
and you'd be home.

334
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah.

335
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,750
Things were better back then.

336
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,260
(Li Jing)

337
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,720
I've been waiting for you.

338
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,320
We've been talking for a while.

339
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,360
Want something to drink?

340
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,000
Anything's fine.

341
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,840
Coffee or water?

342
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,150
Water?

343
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,240
Two glasses of water.

344
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,750
Go.

345
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,030
Get him some water.

346
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,720
Get Yue Qun over here.

347
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,360
Yes, Chief.

348
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,720
Thanks.

349
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,670
Okay.

350
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,960
Trying to get close to me.

351
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,720
Master,

352
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,880
will it work?

353
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,070
Give her some time.

354
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,160
Keep an eye on them.

355
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,640
Got it.

356
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,350
Yuan Xi.

357
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:21,640
Male.

358
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,480
Born in Taizhou, 1987.

359
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,160
His parents divorced when he was five.

360
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,550
After his father abandoned them,

361
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,350
his mother became addicted to drugs

362
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,750
and died of a heroin overdose
when he was seven.

363
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,240
He was raised by his aunt.

364
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
Academically gifted,

365
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,880
he studied abroad at public expense.

366
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,440
Found any flaws

367
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,110
in my story?

368
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,350
None at all.

369
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,720
You're honest.

370
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,240
I like that.

371
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,920
I knew you were good at talking.

372
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,400
I know we're running out of time.

373
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,750
But isn't that what you want?

374
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,310
The less time we have,
the more thrilling it gets.

375
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,960
So, any updates?

376
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,790
Captain Ding,

377
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,030
these are the evidence
and photos we found at the scene.

378
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,510
What do we have?

379
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,070
The first victim

380
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,590
(Highway 7)
was dumped near Highway 7.

381
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,580
(Apartment 7)
The second was found at Apartment 7.

382
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,550
(Watch points 7 o'clock)
The third one was found on the rooftop.

383
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,350
But her watch stopped
at exactly 7 o'clock.

384
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,030
The fourth was found
on the seventh section of the track.

385
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,030
Also,

386
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,350
the music that was playing
at Yuan Xi's house.

387
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,240
I checked.

388
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,000
It was Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 4,

389
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,880
Movement 3.

390
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,960
Symphony No. 4.

391
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,350
Movement 3.

392
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,590
When I was little,

393
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,350
I envied kids who got beaten
by their parents.

394
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,830
They envied me for my grades.

395
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,160
I was the child adults always used
to compare their kids to.

396
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,310
So they bullied me

397
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,030
and ostracized me.

398
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,200
I used to dream about being woken up
by my mother's beating.

399
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,790
It made me feel happy.

400
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
But do you know

401
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,750
why I did well

402
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,640
and behaved well at school?

403
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,590
I was scared of parent-teacher meetings

404
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,590
because I had no parents.

405
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,350
- Why always "seven"?
- Ms. Wei.

406
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
We found out that

407
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,240
seven years ago,

408
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,830
Yuan Xi's aunt suicide by overdose.

409
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,790
After she died,

410
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,110
he started dating a girl.

411
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,240
She was a top seller

412
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,200
in health supplements.

413
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,000
But not long after,

414
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,070
she disappeared.

415
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,640
It's the same number again.

416
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,550
And a health supplement seller.

417
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,480
You never talk about your father.

418
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
Why would I?

419
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,270
He's worthless

420
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:58,790
and a trash.

421
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,550
Pardon me for my words.

422
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,880
But that's the truth.

423
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,480
Mr. Yuan, you know what?

424
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,790
From the way you dress,

425
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,350
your hairstyle,

426
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,070
and even the music you listen to,

427
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,310
it's clear

428
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,400
you're well-educated.

429
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,880
You could even be described
as refined and cultured.

430
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,400
But why did you brutally kill

431
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,480
these seven innocent women?

432
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,750
None of them were innocent.

433
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,480
I was stopping them
from hurting more people.

434
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,310
A vigilante?

435
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,680
A savior sounds nice too.

436
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,480
Could he have resented her
for earning more than him

437
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,000
and developed a deep hatred
for successful women?

438
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,200
That would mean his girlfriend

439
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,070
worked in a highly profitable industry

440
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,510
just like the victims.

441
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,030
Also,

442
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,960
Luo Yifei is a successful
businesswoman too.

443
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,400
If my mom hadn't overdosed,

444
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,590
do you know how many more people
she would've sold to?

445
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,160
I watched her suffer

446
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,590
and be trapped in that pain every day.

447
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,110
So I wanted to help her

448
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,400
and set her free.

449
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,070
I thought the more, the better.

450
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,200
I was seven at the time.

451
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,070
You're obsessed with this number.

452
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,750
You meticulously planned everything
you did around the number

453
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,880
all to commemorate the age you were at

454
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,960
when your mother died.

455
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,680
Your unrealistic ideals
and rigid thinking

456
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,750
all stem from childhood memories
that made you withdrawn

457
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,110
and conservative.

458
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,830
Since young,
you have always been a top student

459
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,240
and independent thinker.

460
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,750
So you are resistant
to other people's opinions.

461
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,070
Oh,

462
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,160
you hate being restricted.

463
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
You often question

464
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,880
if you've done the right things

465
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,920
and made the right choices.

466
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,750
That's why you read articles and books

467
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,400
on improving your thinking

468
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,350
to justify the guilt
from your wrong decisions.

469
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,200
Mr. Yuan,

470
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,750
I have to admit
you have a strong sense of justice.

471
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,200
But your methods are wrong.

472
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,200
Chief.

473
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,350
Chief.

474
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,200
How much time do we have?

475
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,160
A little over an hour.

476
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,270
Still nothing from him?

477
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,200
No.

478
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,270
Master,

479
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
if Yuan Xi is telling the truth,

480
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,550
Luo Yifei has less than two hours

481
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,960
of oxygen left.

482
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,550
We can't pin all our hopes on

483
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,720
some psychological analysis, right?

484
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,920
Master, based on all the evidence I have,

485
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,920
none of it connects
to Luo Yifei's abduction.

486
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:19,960
Well.

487
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,750
I need to go back to Yuan Xi's house.

488
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,750
Something may be missed.

489
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,510
Go.

490
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,680
I wonder how you'd handle
the trolley problem.

491
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,880
Would you choose to save one

492
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,830
or the other five?

493
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,070
Mr. Yuan, I haven't even solved
the first problem,

494
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,720
and you're throwing me another dilemma?

495
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,350
We've been having a great talk.

496
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,110
Why don't we relax and play a game?

497
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,680
Sure.

498
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,750
Quick Q&A.

499
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,200
Okay?

500
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,680
You don't want?

501
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,550
What did you say?

502
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,790
You can only answer my questions,

503
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,790
but cannot ask me back.

504
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,240
We've already started.

505
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,550
Let's start again.

506
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,270
Are you 1.83 meters tall?

507
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,240
Yes.

508
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,720
Do you think home is the safest place?

509
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,310
No.

510
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,160
Is a cliff the most dangerous place?

511
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,750
No.

512
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,550
Do you like Baizhou's bridge?

513
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,960
No.

514
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,640
Time is running out.

515
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,920
We still have no clue yet?

516
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,680
We must be missing something.

517
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
Keep searching.

518
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,240
Yes, madam.

519
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,110
Ms. Wei,

520
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,350
do you think
Ms. Li Mochou's lie detection

521
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,270
will work?

522
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,480
I hope so.

523
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,440
Is a cliff the most dangerous place?

524
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,270
No.

525
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,550
Do you like Baizhou's bridge?

526
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,640
No.

527
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,030
Do you like Baizhou's ocean?

528
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:52,880
Yes.

529
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,350
Do you like Baizhou's pier?

530
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,240
No.

531
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,550
These photos were taken with a polaroid.

532
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,400
Each victim was photographed
many times,

533
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,350
from different angles.

534
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,350
Did anyone see the camera
that took the photos?

535
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,550
Tech Liu might have taken it
to the station.

536
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,750
I'll call and check with him.

537
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:19,750
Chen Peng.

538
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,550
Yes, Ms. Wei.

539
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,830
Did you go through the trash
in this room?

540
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,200
When Tech Liu and I were here,

541
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,750
we didn't find any trash.

542
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,830
Do you think subway
is the most convenient way to travel?

543
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,550
No.

544
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,960
Is bus the most crowded?

545
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,400
Yes.

546
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,720
Is plane the fastest?

547
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,240
Yes.

548
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,920
Hey!

549
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,750
What are you doing?

550
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,160
Police. Please cooperate.

551
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,550
Did you collect the trash today?

552
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:48,790
No.

553
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,960
I wasn't feeling well today.

554
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,200
So I planned to do it all at once later.

555
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,200
Is yacht the most costly?

556
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,680
No.

557
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,030
Is it a fishing boat?

558
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,680
No.

559
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,880
Are you sure it's not?

560
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:08,750
Yes.

561
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:10,960
Thanks.

562
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,300
Help!

563
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,540
Is anyone here? Help me!

564
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,200
Found it.

565
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,680
The pier.

566
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,030
Yue Qun,

567
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,920
can't you go any faster?

568
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,070
Master, this is a traffic jam and I can't fly.

569
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,400
I'm just as anxious as you.

570
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,200
We're running out of time.

571
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,270
Yes, Captain Ding.

572
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,590
Yue,

573
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,830
we're at the dock.

574
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,400
Huh?

575
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,590
You guys are at the pier too?

576
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,720
We found a victim's photo.

577
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,590
Based on the background,

578
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,070
Yuan Xi might have hidden the victim

579
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,750
on a fishing boat at the pier.

580
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,240
We're also rushing there
as fast as we can.

581
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,750
You guys?

582
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,960
Yeah, Ms. Li figured it out

583
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,830
through profiling.

584
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,510
Have you found out which boat?

585
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,750
We're on our way.

586
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,030
I need to be on-site

587
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,720
to profile

588
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,920
the exact boat.

589
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
How much time do we have?

590
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,440
According to Yuan Xi,

591
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,350
not much.

592
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,200
Are we sure he's not lying about this?

593
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,830
Unfortunately, no.
The victim is suffocating.

594
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,440
He's telling the truth about this.

595
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,750
We have about thirty minutes.

596
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:20,830
We won't make it.

597
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:21,880
Li Mochou,

598
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,000
let me be your eyes, okay?

599
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,000
Now,

600
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,000
consider me your eyes.

601
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,400
Stay safe.

602
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,920
Li Mochou, say something.

603
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,750
Okay.

604
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,380
Look for boat numbers with seven.

605
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,820
(Police)

606
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,680
Over here! Hurry!

607
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:50,750
A team of three.

608
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,640
You three, that way!

609
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:52,390
- Yes.
- Yes.

610
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,480
You three, search that boat!

611
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,750
The rest, over there.

612
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,920
Focus on boats

613
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,310
with the number seven!

614
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,110
- Yes!
- Yes!

615
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,680
Anything on your side?

616
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,030
Nothing here!

617
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,350
Same here!

618
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,440
One with the number 0127.

619
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:17,880
Anran!

620
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,400
Yes, madam.

621
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,880
- Check 0127.
- Yes, madam.

622
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,980
What about the other side?

623
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,270
Nothing here either!

624
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,400
Nothing!

625
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,350
Nothing here!

626
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,750
Still nothing!

627
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,720
Nothing here too!

628
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,400
Same here!

629
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,790
Any luck?

630
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,830
Nothing!

631
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,960
Ms. Wei.

632
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,070
Ms. Li,

633
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,070
it's not 0127.

634
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,480
Are you sure about your deduction?

635
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,160
Could you have missed something?

636
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,680
Ms. Li, this is about one's life.

637
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,960
Do you really think Anran
and I would be that careless?

638
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,960
- Anything?
- Anything?

639
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,480
Not here!

640
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,070
And your side?

641
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:18,880
Nothing!

642
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,480
Keep searching!

643
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,000
Yes, madam.

644
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,830
Anything up there?

645
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,590
Nothing.

646
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,270
Any signs?

647
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,880
Nothing here either!

648
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,510
Li!

649
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,110
Anything?

650
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,350
Still nothing!

651
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,830
Are you sure it's the number seven?

652
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,790
Ms. Wei,

653
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,310
we checked every boat with a "7".

654
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,310
Some mistakes

655
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,440
aren't intentional.

656
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,780
What's Yuan Xi's building number?

657
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,000
It's not an apartment.

658
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,070
He lives in a villa.

659
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:42,830
Villa?

660
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,790
In what section?

661
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,310
Are villas in sections?

662
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,550
Most villas are divided into sections.

663
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,790
Section One.

664
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,750
Section One.

665
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,590
I got it.

666
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,120
Captain Ding.

667
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,590
My theory wasn't wrong.

668
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,920
It's not a single number seven.

669
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,590
It could be multiples of seven.

670
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,160
What's wrong with her?

671
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,400
If it's in this way,

672
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,640
how am I supposed to find it?

673
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,920
We need to look for numbers

674
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,830
that contain a seven
or are divisible by seven.

675
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,070
Call out the numbers

676
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,200
from farthest to nearest.

677
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,480
I'll figure it out.

678
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,590
Forget it. Time is running out.

679
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,350
We'll skip the back area.

680
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,350
Focus on this area.

681
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,030
That's still a lot.

682
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,960
Ms. Li,

683
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,270
if things at Yuan Xi's home
are extremely organized,

684
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,920
would that habit

685
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,030
influence him picking boat?

686
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,240
Yes.

687
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,720
A person like him

688
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,550
wouldn't change his habits easily.

689
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,960
Then I think I found it.
