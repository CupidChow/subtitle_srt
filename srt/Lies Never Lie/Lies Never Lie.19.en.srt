29
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,299
How's it? Are you alright?
Think about whether you can play or not.

30
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,460
Give me a moment.

31
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,810
Who said it was okay
when we were up there?

32
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,970
If you can't do it, don't act tough.

33
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,580
Feeling better?

34
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,899
I can. I can do it.

35
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,020
Good. Let's keep playing.

36
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,019
I'll see what else is over there.

37
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,780
I'll take a break.

38
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,340
Wait for me to take a break.

39
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,370
- Why don't we play the drop tower again?
- No, no.

40
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,650
I'm not bragging.

41
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,780
In the past,

42
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,779
I wasn't afraid of roller coasters

43
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,060
or drop towers.

44
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,989
Hey, there are bumper cars.

45
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:49,949
Let's go.

46
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,780
- What? Hey.
- Let's go.

47
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,229
Come on.

48
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,810
Ah, don't come over.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,080
Why didn't you take care of me
when I was throwing up?

50
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,810
How? I threw up for you?

51
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,260
Stop there.

52
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,549
Little girl.

53
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,700
Little girl.

54
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,260
Dad.

55
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,850
Don't move.

56
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,260
Chuchu.

57
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,340
He's your dad?

58
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,780
Yes.

59
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,340
Who are you?

60
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,380
Chuchu.

61
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,290
Mr. Fang, I'm sorry about what happened.

62
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,989
It's okay.

63
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,260
Are you from Baizhou?

64
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,059
No.

65
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,340
Neither am I.

66
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,989
Where do you work?

67
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,589
I work in an architectural institute.

68
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,499
An architectural institute, that's good.

69
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,900
Come on, go to your dad.

70
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,680
Listen, this is a normal phenomenon.
It means you've grown up.

71
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,689
In future, when you encounter
this kind of thing, talk to your parents first.

72
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:12,820
Don't run off by yourself.

73
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,850
This is for your daughter.

74
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,789
Sorry about what happened.

75
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,139
We made such a fuss

76
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,380
and even hurt you by mistake.

77
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,700
It's okay. You just care about Chuchu.

78
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,900
How about this?

79
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,460
I'll leave you a number.

80
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,499
My name is Ding Wei.

81
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,400
I'm from Baizhou Criminal
Investigation Team.

82
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,909
If you have any problems,

83
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,490
feel free to contact me.

84
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,939
Why don't we take you home?

85
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,939
It's okay.

86
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,050
I'm really fine, Thank you.

87
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,640
Why don't you go to the hospital
for a check-up?

88
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,850
It's okay. I'm fine.

89
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,020
Mr. Fang, you must
have been scared today.

90
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,290
No.

91
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,739
Well, it's getting late.

92
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,179
My car is parked nearby.

93
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,869
Chuchu, return the clothes to her.

94
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,869
Let's go home.

95
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,530
Okay.

96
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,909
If you insist,

97
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,490
we won't force you.

98
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,460
Thank you, Sister.

99
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,290
Say goodbye.

100
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,229
Goodbye, Sister.

101
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,179
We'll walk you there.

102
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,050
No, stay.

103
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,939
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,050
It's alright.

105
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,530
Let's go home.

106
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,380
What's up?
Is there a problem with this guy?

107
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,490
Not bad. You can tell there's
something wrong with him now.

108
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,589
I don't see a problem with him,

109
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,050
but I see a problem
with the way you look at him.

110
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,349
To be precise, I didn't realize there was
anything wrong with him at first.

111
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,160
Until you told him you're a cop from
Baizhou Criminal Investigation Team,

112
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,549
and he put his hand around his neck.

113
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,909
It was a limbic reaction.

114
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,349
It proves he's afraid of something.

115
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,179
And at that time,

116
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,320
his whole body was facing the way out.

117
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,349
So he wanted to get out of here
as soon as possible.

118
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,380
- It proves that he's running away from something.
- He's guilty of something.

119
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,850
You could say it's a survival instinct.

120
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,640
- Check him out.
- Check him out.

121
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,850
Gosh.

122
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,410
What's going on? Why did you call me here
in the middle of the night?

123
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,909
(Victim's information)

124
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,989
Fang Jinshan's brother, Fang Jinliang,
jumped off a bridge five years ago.

125
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,490
I closed the case.

126
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,589
Suicide. No problem.

127
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,429
I remember all the cases I've worked on.
That's how confident I am.

128
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,499
That's enough, Boss.

129
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,989
You're done here.

130
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,819
We'll check it out for a while
before we go.

131
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,970
You go home first.

132
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,739
I'm going home then.

133
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,699
Goodbye.

134
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,220
My mum has cooked for me.

135
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,369
They've been looking into it all night.

136
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,660
(Criminal Investigation Case File)
I worked on this case.

137
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,340
I remember all the details.

138
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,159
There's nothing wrong with it.

139
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:03,109
If there's anything they want to know,
just ask me.

140
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,700
It's quicker than reading the file.

141
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,139
Yes, you've worked on a lot of cases,

142
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,229
enough to count on one hand.

143
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,739
Unlike Captain Ding, one hand
is not enough to count her cases.

144
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,819
Keep it down.

145
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,850
Jeez.

146
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,869
What does fewer cases mean?

147
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,580
It means the law and order is good.

148
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,199
What does good law and order mean?

149
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,100
Can't you learn something good
from your master?

150
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,800
I've learned
to do psychological profiling.

151
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,499
How's it, Ms. Li?

152
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,370
What's the new discovery?

153
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,850
Something's wrong with the suicide note.

154
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,970
"Mum and Dad, I couldn't leave you.

155
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,180
You are always saying that I am naughty
and give you a lot of trouble.

156
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,109
Have another one

157
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,189
while you're still young,

158
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,940
as a practice for your trumpet.

159
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,949
So far,

160
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,019
I've had a good life.

161
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,739
The kind of life

162
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,019
that I wouldn't regret even if I died."

163
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,580
"Dad, Mum,

164
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,500
Grandma, I'm sorry I can't take care of you
for the rest of your lives."

165
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,349
"For those of you who are coming
to my funeral, you don't have to be sad."

166
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,550
"But I'm still a little bit reluctant
to leave this world.

167
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,429
There are still a lot of places I haven't visited
and food I haven't eaten."

168
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:13,680
"You are the people I care most about
in this world.

169
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,709
But I'm leaving now.
Please forgive me for being unfilial."

170
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,460
"Because it's going to happen to all of us,
sooner or later.

171
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,309
I'm just going ahead
to set up the new place."

172
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,360
"Please donate my body to those in need."

173
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,869
"I hope my funeral
will be an opportunity

174
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,820
to bring together many friends
I haven't seen in a long time.

175
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,840
You have to remember to change the BGM
to a candle and play it three times.

176
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,469
Remember to take care of my plants."

177
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,130
"You guys always think I'm a wimp

178
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,970
and chase me all over the village
with a big stick.

179
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,899
You can't even beat me up from now on."

180
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,660
I'm not sorry I've been single so far,

181
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,000
but I haven't finished the comic
I've been following

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,380
and my favourite CP hasn't
officially announced their romance yet."

183
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,060
- "Do you regret not hitting me more?
- For all the boys I've made cry,

184
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,420
I sincerely apologise to you.

185
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,949
Sorry. Though I don't remember who you are."

186
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,040
"If the comic I follow ends,
please burn it for me,

187
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,120
and remember
to burn the translated version.

188
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,840
I don't want an untranslated version."

189
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,820
"If I had to choose again,

190
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,540
I'd still be a cop.

191
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,739
I'd still wear this uniform
and protect everyone."

192
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,480
(Suicide note)
"Thank you, Dad and Mum.

193
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,890
It's my greatest fortune
to have been your daughter in this life.

194
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,850
And lastly,

195
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,890
I hope that all of you

196
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,660
will live the rest of your lives well."

197
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,010
I won't read mine.

198
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,349
Mochou, don't keep us in suspense.

199
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,899
What's wrong with Fang Jinliang's
suicide note? Tell us now.

200
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,109
The suicide note each of you just read

201
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,869
was very personal.

202
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,250
It's very relevant to your lives.

203
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,850
(Suicide note)
But Fang Jinliang's suicide note

204
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,850
is too cold and objective.

205
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:54,949
Now that you mention it,

206
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,660
I also think there must be
something wrong with this suicide note.

207
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,989
Look.

208
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,829
Fang Jinliang
didn't mention anyone on it,

209
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,010
just why he wanted to die.

210
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,169
He mentioned that he left a property
for his brother. He didn't say anything else.

211
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:09,709
Ms. Li, you're giving us
a hard time again.

212
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,010
Isn't that like asking us
to do hard labor with speculation?

213
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,460
You don't want to?

214
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:18,730
Then, whoever's case it is,
reverse it himself.

215
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,250
I'll do it.

216
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,700
It's my case and I'll reverse it myself.

217
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,820
But where should I start?

218
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,109
I'll call my mum

219
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,090
and tell her I'm not coming home
for dinner.

220
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,460
Hello.

221
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,499
We had always been very close
as brothers.

222
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,250
He'd been clinging to me
since he was a kid.

223
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,379
He didn't talk much.
People didn't know him.

224
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,300
I'm different. I knew what he's thinking.

225
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,490
Later on, he failed the college entrance exam
and went into business.

226
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,869
He learned to smoke
and drink for socializing,

227
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,220
and picked up some social habits.

228
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,010
But even though he's a loner,

229
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,850
I never heard him say
he had any enemies.

230
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,770
You asked about this back then.

231
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,180
Why are you two asking again?

232
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,010
Mr. Fang, you don't have to worry.

233
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,130
Your brother committed suicide,

234
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,779
that's why we need to notify the family

235
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,660
when we archive the case file.

236
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,139
And about the suicide note,

237
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,220
we're just asking a few questions.

238
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:31,829
I see.

239
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,540
That's it for today.

240
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,850
I'll see you out.

241
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:38,869
Mr. Fang,

242
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,189
I like the design of your house.

243
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,869
Did you design it yourself?

244
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,709
Yes.

245
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,069
I designed this villa when my brother

246
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,139
was building it.

247
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,349
As expected
of an award-winning designer.

248
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,660
Thank you for your compliment.

249
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,899
Now that we've finished our brief,

250
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,220
let's go back.

251
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,130
Thank you for today.

252
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,220
You're welcome.

253
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,540
I've been injured before,

254
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,349
so I can't write.

255
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,010
And I definitely can't draw.

256
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,010
Please.

257
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,760
Why did you say archive?

258
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,829
Do you remember
how everyone at the force reacted

259
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,610
when I told them there was something wrong
with the suicide note?

260
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,940
Surprise,

261
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,010
shock,

262
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,259
disbelief.

263
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,619
But all he showed was knowing

264
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,300
and a little bit of fear.

265
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,589
So he must have something to do
with this.

266
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,180
And he's hiding something.

267
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,250
I've got it.

268
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,259
Fang Jinliang transferred US$500,000

269
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,869
to a foreign bank account

270
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,229
before committing suicide.

271
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,419
Didn't he kill himself
because his company went bankrupt?

272
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,970
How come he still had money?

273
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,730
Have Tech Liu see
if he can trace the account.

274
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,700
Okay.

275
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,499
Ms. Li, Xiaorong said it's possible

276
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,989
that the writing changed

277
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,989
due to a hand injury

278
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,250
in theory.

279
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,970
Oh.

280
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,899
Ms. Li, you've been looking at this
for a long time.

281
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,180
What have you found?

282
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,370
Changing posts at 35.

283
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,340
There's nothing wrong with that.

284
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,250
Design to Administration.

285
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,610
Administration...
Administration Department is not busy.

286
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,419
Besides,

287
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:29,480
who doesn't want to be a leader, right?
Is there a problem?

288
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,899
Do you know how much money
Fang Jinshan made on one project

289
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,370
when he was a designer?

290
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,660
How much?

291
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,019
300,000 yuan.

292
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,180
Add a zero.

293
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,659
3,000,000 yuan.

294
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,039
And he's still on the rise.

295
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,779
It's not uncommon
for top designers in China

296
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,820
to make eight figures.

297
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,080
Is it too late for me
to study design now?

298
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,520
Do you know how much an
administrative staff earns in a month?

299
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,580
20,000 yuan.

300
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,130
Something's fishy here.

301
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,760
There's definitely something fishy
going on here.

302
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,109
- Who's going to the architectural institute?
- Me.

303
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,040
Boss, take me with you.
I'm going. I want to go.

304
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,540
No. Anran, let's go.

305
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,820
You take Anran because you're afraid
of being beaten to death, right?

306
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,180
There's definitely something wrong.

307
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,709
Is it normal for something like this
to happen to one of the country's

308
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,610
top designers?

309
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,660
There's nothing unusual about it.

310
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,850
It's very normal.

311
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,610
In our business, it's brutal.

312
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,610
Cases like this one abound.

313
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,540
He can't make the money

314
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,970
you mentioned.

315
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,869
As you know, something happened
to his family.

316
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,379
Yes.

317
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,779
His mind is in turmoil.

318
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,610
Are there no exceptions?

319
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,820
There are.

320
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,090
The year before last,
our director, Mr. Zhao,

321
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,739
his wife ran off with someone else.

322
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,499
He's a mess all day

323
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,850
and drank to drown his sorrows.

324
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:56,610
An artist's talent ended like this.

325
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,460
Design

326
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,090
is an artistic profession.

327
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,349
It's unstable,

328
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,420
easily influenced by emotions.

329
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,829
You cops

330
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,060
don't necessarily understand.

331
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,420
We artists do.

332
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,440
Alright. Mr. Zhou, we've asked
all the questions we need to ask,

333
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,490
so we'll leave now.

334
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,539
Well,

335
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,300
please keep this a secret
from Fang Jinshan.

336
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,313
- Okay?
- Don't worry.

337
00:16:19,314 --> 00:16:20,019
Right,

338
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,539
Mr. Zhou, can we take some
of Fang Jinshan's designs

339
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,779
with us?

340
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,109
No problem.

341
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,659
Wait a minute.

342
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,469
- I'll get them now.
- Okay. We'll go with you.

343
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,420
Okay.

344
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,250
Superficial.

345
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,180
I'm being superficial.

346
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,010
Aren't you always like that?

347
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,019
Is that really what the director said?

348
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,180
Yes.

349
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,300
The director said

350
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,220
he's an artist.

351
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,499
An artist can't be judged
by common sense,

352
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,420
right?

353
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,660
Ms. Li,

354
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,349
you're not always good
at psychological profiling.

355
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,180
Come on, I

356
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,899
also brought back a few designs
of Fang Jinshan.

357
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,940
Look.

358
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,589
You're making progress.

359
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,810
Of course.

360
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,549
My case is a good one.

361
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,900
It's a very nice one.

362
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,589
Take a look.
Has Tan Aiqiu had plastic surgery

363
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,900
on her nose?

364
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,659
Has she?

365
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,810
Seems a bit.

366
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,140
What else do you see besides that?

367
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,899
Look at her. She's not dressed up

368
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,250
or well groomed.

369
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,770
What does that mean?

370
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,220
It doesn't make sense.

371
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,419
You're getting better now.

372
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,349
Make a trip there

373
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,490
and investigate.

374
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:43,419
Boss,

375
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,699
You went with Anran last time.

376
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,050
This time, we'll both go.

377
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,549
- Gosh, it's so hot.
- Go now.

378
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,770
- Please clean it up for me.
- Let's go.

379
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,520
I'm Yue Qun, vice captain
of Baizhou Criminal Investigation Team.

380
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,490
I'd like to talk to Mr. Ge
for some information.

381
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,549
Mr. Ge,

382
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,140
two officers are here to see you.

383
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:00,699
Oh.

384
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,379
Mr. Ge.

385
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:01,829
Yes.

386
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,219
Hi.

387
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,010
Oh.

388
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,659
You're cops?

389
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,490
Yes.

390
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,700
Mr. Ge!

391
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,380
Sorry.

392
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,140
Don't run!

393
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,620
Don't run!

394
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,419
Stay back!

395
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,069
Drop the knife!

396
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,509
Stay back!

397
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,180
How dare you use a knife with a cop?

398
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,659
Gosh.

399
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,549
Boss Yue, you're so mean.

400
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,240
It's not me. It's Tiaotiao's doing.

401
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,050
He resisted arrest and assaulted a
police officer. He deserves a beating.

402
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,659
Not bad. You're getting smarter

403
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,330
and stronger.

404
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,179
How did you get injured?

405
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,699
I was too aggressive.
I couldn't hold back.

406
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,540
He's bragging. His right foot tripped
over his left and he fell to the road.

407
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,490
Tiaotiao.

408
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,379
I treated you milk tea for nothing

409
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,749
Didn't you promise not to say it?

410
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,549
Senior, you're getting old.

411
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,050
Keep fit.

412
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:25,940
My lifetime of fame is ruined
by a single mistake.

413
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:28,939
Tiaotiao.

414
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,900
Yes.

415
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,700
He's yours to interrogate.

416
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,900
Yes, madam.

417
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,220
I've told you everything I need
to tell you about the fake drugs.

418
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,730
What else?

419
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,620
That's all.

420
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,900
Tiaotiao.

421
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,770
Take a look at this.

422
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,140
Do you know this man?

423
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,869
No.

424
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,330
Look carefully.

425
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,109
Right,

426
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,770
I think I've seen her before.

427
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,869
I recognise her nose.

428
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,810
Yes.

429
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,909
I remember now.

430
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,410
It's her.

431
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,530
How did this happen?

432
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,899
She fell.

433
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,250
She accidentally rolled down the stairs.

434
00:20:25,813 --> 00:20:29,140
Doctor, can her nose still be fixed?

435
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,829
You two have come to the right person.

436
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,940
No problem.

437
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,250
Fixed?

438
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,900
Yes.

439
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,860
Her nose was deformed

440
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,659
it only could be fixed.

441
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,320
And there's no way the bruises
on her face were from a fall.

442
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,549
It must be from being beaten.

443
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,619
Are you sure?

444
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,899
In my line of work,

445
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,829
I can tell injuries from falls
and from beatings.

446
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,939
Well, look at it again.

447
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,100
Is this the man
who accompanied her to the hospital?

448
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,069
Yes,

449
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,050
it's him.

450
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,010
I suspect he did that
to the woman's face.

451
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,589
Do you have a picture of him
before he went to the hospital?

452
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,520
Yes. Our hospital receptionists.

453
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,280
You can ask them
to send it to you directly.

454
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,970
Let him sign it.

455
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,380
Come on, sign here.

456
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,010
This disciple of yours is really
becoming more and more like you.

457
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,660
Of course.

458
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,330
A wise teacher trains a fine student.

459
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,970
Jeez.

460
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,180
Thank you.

461
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,109
You two are so funny.

462
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,080
It's not possible.

463
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,899
I've been with Jinshan for years,
and we love each other very much.

464
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,420
Look, he even bought me a cake
for our anniversary.

465
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,509
Then we're done for the day.

466
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,660
We'll leave you to your anniversary.

467
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,290
Goodbye, madams.

468
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,380
Right,

469
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,699
It's a lot of chores for renovation,

470
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,860
it's tiring.

471
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,460
Take care and rest more.

472
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,490
Okay.

473
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,290
Can she be trusted?

474
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,290
She's lying.

475
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,730
She's lying
when she says she wasn't abused,

476
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,660
but it's true
when she said they were in love.

477
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,620
That's why it's so strange.

478
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,420
What's today's date?

479
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,100
9th of May.

480
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,180
What anniversary did she say
they were commemorating?

481
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,860
I think it's their wedding anniversary.

482
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,770
But their wedding anniversary
is the 1st of April.

483
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,700
What's the 9th of May?

484
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,589
9th May? Why is that so familiar?

485
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,730
Let's go back and look it up.

486
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,140
Okay, I got it.

487
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,680
I got it. 9th May is the day
Fang Jinliang committed suicide.

488
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,869
Why don't you go back
to the station first?

489
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,010
I'm going to the hospital
to check on Tan Aiqiu's hand.

490
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,570
I'll take you to the hospital first.

491
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,900
Okay.

(Health Management Center, Outpatient)

493
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,939
Since the hospital changed its system,
these are the only paper copies left.

494
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,589
Here are Tan Aiqiu's medical records
from 2013 to 2018.

495
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,749
You've just seen

496
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,620
the electronic version after that.

497
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,810
Thank you for your hard work.

(Outpatient Resuscitation Record)

499
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,109
Ms. Wei, look.

500
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,899
Fang Jinshan had an extra 500,000 yuan
in his account

501
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,309
on 7 January 2018,

502
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,899
showing it came from a foreign account.

503
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,419
That's the same amount
that Fang Jinliang transferred.

504
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:09,899
Yes.

505
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,749
Mr. Liu said foreign accounts
are more complicated.

506
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,620
So it's hard for him to determine
if it's from the same account.

507
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,700
This is too exciting.

508
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,780
What? Your CP has
officially announced their romance?

509
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,749
No, it's not my CP.

510
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,269
It's Fang Jinliang and Tan Aiqiu.

511
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,220
Take a look at this picture. Look.

512
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,869
Look,

513
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,029
The way Tan Aiqiu looked
at Fang Jinliang

514
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,810
was obviously love.

515
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,699
This look

516
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,699
is love?

517
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,979
Junior, look at me.

518
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,010
Get lost.

519
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,659
No, of course it's more than that.

520
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,140
Look at this picture.

521
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,570
Everyone's laughing

522
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,459
but Fang Jinliang's looking
at Tan Aiqiu.

523
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,810
Psychologically speaking,

524
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,309
when a person is happy,

525
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:56,220
he will subconsciously look
at the person he likes.

526
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,180
And this.

527
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,749
Fang Jinliang's knee

528
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,180
subconsciously moved towards Tan Aiqiu.

529
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,589
What does that mean?

530
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,730
And this.

00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,109
All this

532
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:10,380
proves that Fang Jinliang
loved Tan Aiqiu.

533
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,349
It's so deep.

534
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,460
Tiaotiao.

535
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,250
It's so deep.

536
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,620
Good.

(Fang Jinliang's suicide note)
Come on, I'll sum it up for you.

538

This is the story.

539
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,869
Fang Jinliang did transfer

540
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,920
500,000 yuan from his account
before he died.

541

where it went,

Fang Jinshan did receive

543
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,589
the same amount of money in the end.

544
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,869
That's clear, isn't it?

545
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,219
Okay, so from the suicide note,

546
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,280
Fang Jinshan's villa was given
to him by Fang Jinliang.

547
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,160
There's nothing wrong with that, is there?

548
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,810
Right? So...

549
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,000
(Fang Jinliang, dead)

550
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,220
What did Tiaotiao just say?
What relationship?

551
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,810
Love.

552
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,860
Love. Understood?

553
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:00,659
This is destined
to be a tragic love triangle.

554
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,029
Right? Anyway,

555
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,619
Fang Jinliang can't just
give things to Tan Aiqiu.

556
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,620
What to do?

557
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,179
He gave it to her brother, right?

558
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,549
That way, Tan Aiqiu

559
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:14,109
got the money and the house he deserved,
and his own brother didn't lose out either.

560
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,269
Then Fang Jinliang chose

561
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,139
to withdraw from the tragic

562
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,290
love triangle.

563
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,869
Right? Next, he's dead.

564
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,699
That's why he committed suicide.

565
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,899
There's nothing wrong with it.

566
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,829
No, I think it is like this.

567
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,749
Look, is it possible

568
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,900
that Fang Jinliang was walking slowly
on the bridge,

569
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,029
and there was actually
a man next to him?

570
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,660
With a knife in hand against his waist.

571
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,829
Wait.

572
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,659
Witnesses said

573
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,900
there was no one else.

574
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,659
Fang Jinliang made use
of the blind spot.

575
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,459
Come on,

576
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,050
you've watched too many animated series.

577
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,899
Listen,

578
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,869
here's what happened.

579
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,749
Fang Jinliang looked haggard,

580
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,269
his eyes were full of redness,

581
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,869
and he was holding a mobile phone.

582
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,349
There was a message on the phone.

583
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,490
What did it say?

584
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,309
It said, "Die

585
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,700
and leave the money,

586
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,869
and Tan Aiqiu will be safe"

587
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,220
That's what happened.

588
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,869
Your version seems
to have all the elements.

589
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,400
But we checked the contact list.
It's clean.

590
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,440
When has there ever
been a problem with a case

591
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,660
that Boss Yue has solved?

592
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,699
Qiao Anran, I've realized that you...

593
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,109
Enough. I'll make a version
of this to add a detail.

594
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,000
It was raining that day.

595
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,620
Could he have been
holding an umbrella...

596
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,180
Anran.

597
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,700
Did you say it rained that day?

598
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:25,659
Yes.

599
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,460
Yes.

600
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,349
It's raining. It's pouring heavily.

601
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:28,979
Because of this,

602
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,589
many traces have been washed away.

603
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,979
And I remember that day vividly

604
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,453
that it was foggy before it rained.

605
00:27:33,454 --> 00:27:34,619
In such heavy rain,

606
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,869
how can the witness be sure

607
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,460
she saw Fang Jinliang jump?

608
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,619
Madam, did you see
someone jump off the bridge?

609
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,770
Yes, I did.

610
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,269
What were you doing? Do you remember?

611
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,490
Sweeping the floor.

612
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,860
What time was it?

613
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,970
The time...

614
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,100
I can't really recall.

615
00:27:58,863 --> 00:28:00,003
4PM.

616
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,349
No. It's 4:05PM.

617
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,620
You remember that well?

618
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,659
I was five minutes late

619
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,460
and they docked me 100 yuan.

620
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,659
Do you remember what you saw?

621
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,810
There's a man standing on a bridge.

622
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,699
Get down!

623
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,069
It's dangerous!

624
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,899
Get down! Get down!

625
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,730
It's dangerous!

626
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,530
Get down!

627
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,810
Gosh.

628
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,730
He's gone in a flash.

629
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:36,290
Then the police announced that someone
had jumped off the bridge and died.

630
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,419
I knew it was him.

631
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,179
Madam, how long has it been
since you changed your glasses?

632
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,869
Yeah, the lenses are a little off.

633
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,380
I couldn't bear to change them.

634
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,250
Let's do this.

635
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:50,810
I'll help you remember the day together.

636
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,699
It was a Tuesday,

637
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,140
the weather forecast was for fog,

638
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,309
there weren't too many cars on the road,

639
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,810
and the temperature
was around 16 degree Celsius.

640
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:04,140
And you're more than 100 metres
from the man who jumped off the bridge.

641
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:08,570
So you're sure you saw him jump?

642
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,970
I...

643
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,589
Now that you mention it,
I didn't see him jump with my own eyes.

644
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,420
He's gone in a flash.

645
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,349
So you just saw him standing there

646
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,420
and he's gone in a flash?

647
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,309
Some information

648
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,069
has been summarized on this whiteboard.

649
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,420
Let's take a more careful look
at it now.

650
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,029
Tan Aiqiu's body was more
or less bruised

651
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,589
(Domestic violence)
between 2013 and 2015.

652
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,619
I've been to the doctor about these injuries.

653
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,979
And the doctor confirmed
that the injuries were man-made.

654
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,380
So I think Tan Aiqiu's
domestically abused.

655
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,029
But Captain Ding and I went
to talk to Tan Aiqiu

656
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,810
and she denied this.

657
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,970
Yes.

658
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,509
I observed Tan Aiqiu,

659
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:54,069
and I couldn't tell
from her state of mind or her behavior

660
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,869
that she'd been abused.

661
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:56,459
Yes.

662
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:56,939
Correct.

663
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,240
(9 May 2017)
When Tan Aiqiu's taken to the hospital's

664
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,760
emergency room when she slit
her wrists to commit suicide in 2017,

665
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,939
the person
who signed the papers was Fang Jinliang.

666
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,939
This has also been analyzed by Tiaotiao.

667
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,900
Fang Jinliang loves Tan Aiqiu.

668
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,139
(Slits her wrists)
Then,

669
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,619
(Fang Jinshan's family)
we spoke to Fang Jinshan's friends.

670
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,619
The feedback we got

671
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,509
from those people was

672
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:21,459
(Behavioral differences)
that his behavior changed dramatically.

673
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,459
(Changed, moved, changed jobs)
A person's behavior can be so different

674
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,970
unless he has a split personality.

675
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,269
But we found

676
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,899
no psychiatric records related
to Fang Jinshan.

677
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,459
That's right, and

678
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:38,309
after Fang Jinliang's suicide,
Fang Jinshan was transferred

679
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:41,380
from Design to Administration.

680
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,869
So based on all this

681
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,749
and the fact that they were twins,

682
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,899
which makes things easier,

683
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,620
I'm guessing
they probably switched identities.
