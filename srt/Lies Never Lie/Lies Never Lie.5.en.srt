28

Why did you go to see him?

29
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,750
I have nothing to do with him anymore.

30
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,240
He has a weak heart.

31
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,520
I can't handle stress.

32
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,310
Why did you disturb him?

33
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,080
What do you want?

34
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,240
Tiaotiao, do you need to rest for a bit?

35
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,520
Master, why did Wang Pu

36
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,630
get so worked up just now?

37
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,960
What do you think Coach Liu Aihai is

38
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,400
to him?

39
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,030
Well.

40
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,280
A father.

41
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,710
That's right.

42
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,000
Wang Pu lost his father
when he was young,

43
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,960
so a father figure

44
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,630
holds an important place in his heart.

45
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,710
When he heard that his other father

46
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,960
still trusted him so much,

47
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,430
he broke down.

48
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,000
Aren't we against regulations

49
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,630
by causing a criminal
to have an emotional breakdown?

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,120
I'm a psychologist

51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,030
and a cop,

52
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,710
I know where the line is.

53
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,630
The point is,

54
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,960
Wang Pu's last line of defense

55
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,240
is about to collapse.

56
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,310
Wang Pu must've known Liu Cheng.

57
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,430
You were right, Master.

58
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,040
We still need to find evidence.

59
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,310
Right.

60
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,020

(Police)

63
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,920
Is this the place Ma Da mentioned?

64
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,630
Yes.

65
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,070
According to him,

66
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,870
six of them

67
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,320
assaulted Song Chaoran here.

68
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,310
Tech Liu has collected some samples
for analysis.

69
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,510
The results will be available soon.

70
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,120
Very well.

71
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,070
I'll beat you to a pulp.

72
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,870
Use the bats.

73
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,270
Who are you?

74
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,120
Yue.

75
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,720
Yes?

76
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,680
Has Song Chaoran's car been found?

77
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,560
Yes.

78
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,870
One of Ma Da's guys drove it away.

79
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,720
His family

80
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,160
happened to run an auto repair shop.

81
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,430
The car plate was removed
as soon as the car got there.

82
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,430
I guess they were trying to modify it.

83
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,630
This place is

84
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,870
20 kilometers
from Song Chaoran's office.

85
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,720
Surveillance footage shows

86
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,560
that Ma Da set up everything here
in advance.

87
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,830
But he has no direct connection
to Song Chaoran.

88
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,040
How did he get him to come here?

89
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,830
Do you suspect it was Ma Bo?

90
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,270
That's why you think
Ma Da was covering for him last night.

91
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,070
By the way,

92
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,310
one more thing.

93
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,600
According to some of the thugs involved,

94
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,040
Ma Da paid each of them

95
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,750
10,000 yuan.

96
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,270
Ma Da was serious this time.

97
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,460
(Psychological Counseling)

98
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,560
Excuse me.

99
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,270
This is Ms. Wang Meiqin.

100
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,240
- Sure.
- Hello.

101
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,720
Hello, Ms. Wang.

102
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,490
We're with the Criminal
Investigation Team.

103
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,680
We'd like to ask you

104
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,920
about Liu Cheng's case.

105
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,630
Sure.

106
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,830
Please have a seat, officers.

107
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,570
I noticed that your previous statement

108
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,090
mentioned Liu Cheng had
some inappropriate physical interactions

109
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,480
with his clients.

110
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,240
I'd like to know
to what extent these actions go.

111
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,240
Hasn't the conviction been confirmed?

112
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,360
Is it necessary to bring this up again?

113
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,600
Here's the thing.

114
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,680
We'd like to look further into the details.

115
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,830
We hope you'll cooperate with us.

116
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,430
It was nothing serious, really.

117
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,950
Just physical interactions
with the clients,

118
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:17,510
like rubbing their shoulders,

119
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,990
touching their heads, or patting
their faces during sessions.

120
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,120
Um...

121
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,480
And also

122
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,480
things like this.

123
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,480
I'm sorry.

124
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,680
I saw these actions

125
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,040
with my own eyes.

126
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,160
If I'm not wrong,

127
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,920
all the students Liu Cheng counseled
were girls.

128
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,360
Didn't any parents ever
raise concerns about this

129
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,630
at that time?

130
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,240
They did.

131
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,870
However, since Mr. Liu never crossed
the line any further,

132
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,510
and considering the reputation
of the institution,

133
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,190
the issue was suppressed.

134
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,070
The leader spoke to him,

135
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,830
and he did change his behavior.

136
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,870
Why didn't you mention this earlier?

137
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,510
How could I do that?

138
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,870
Mr. Liu was popular.

139
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,750
Maybe I was overreacting.

140
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,040
Perhaps

141
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,560
Mr. Liu

142
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,790
really did see his clients as family.

143
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,240
Also, if I spoke ill of someone

144
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,840
who just passed away,

145
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,270
people might judge me.

146
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,630
Ms. Li,

147
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,910
I knew something was wrong
with Liu Cheng.

148
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,360
Liu Cheng's behavior

149
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,150
may not be intentional.

150
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,030
Besides, we can't be sure

151
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,360
this has anything to do with Wang Pu.

152
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,870
True. Wang Pu doesn't have a girlfriend.

153
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,030
Even if Liu Cheng is proven
guilty of harassment,

154
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,480
it doesn't concern Wang Pu.

155
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,120
Didn't you find a female student

156
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,390
Liu Cheng sponsored before?

157
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,030
Yes,

158
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,750
her name is Li Na.

159
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,660
(Countdown to Wang Pu's execution:
19 hours and 36 minutes)

160
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,270
I've admitted to everything I did.

161
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,670
I beat him.

162
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,480
What else do you want to find out?

163
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,910
Tell me

164
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,200
how you got Song Chaoran to go there.

165
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,150
I called him.

166
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,390
I told him

167
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,840
to come meet us,

168
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,150
or we'd kidnap his girl.

169
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,120
Then, he showed up.

170
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,270
Ma Da, I'm warning you, stop lying to me.

171
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,960
I heard you paid each of those thugs

172
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,960
10,000 yuan.

173
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,370
Where did that money come from?

174
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,320
I checked your bank account.

175
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,120
You're deep in debt.

176
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,440
I...

177
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,030
Was the money from Ma Bo?

178
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,630
No.

179
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,720
It had nothing to do with my brother.

180
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,480
But based on our investigation,

181
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,670
I think Ma Bo is the most suspicious.

182
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,030
Anran.

183
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,000
Yes, Ms. Wei?

184
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,130
I believe that's all.

185
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,150
We need to summon Ma Bo.

186
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,510
Yes.

187
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,440
Hey, don't.

188
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,270
Officers,

189
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,360
this really has nothing to do with him.

190
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,510
Then where did the money come from?

191
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,080
Someone hired me

192
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,320
to rough up Song Chaoran.

193
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,440
They paid me 100,000 yuan upfront.

194
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,440
In cash.

195
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,900
They promised another 100,000
after the job was done.

196
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,720
Who was it?

197
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,960
I don't know.

198
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,360
They contacted me
through an unknown number.

199
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,360
They even had me pick up the cash

200
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,480
at a designated location.

201
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,030
I swear, I have no idea who they are.

202
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,870
I mean it.

203
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,510
Well...

204
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:53,840
Right.

205
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,500
The place where Song Chaoran was beaten
was also arranged by them.

206
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,440
We were asked to wait there in advance.

207
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,320
That's all I know.

208
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:11,840
Ms. Li.

209
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,510
Hi.

210
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:16,030
Li Na was arrested for prostitution
three days ago.

211
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,440
She's only a sophomore.

212
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,270
Can we really trust what she says?

213
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,080
Let's meet her first.

214
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,840
She might be the only one
who knows the truth.

215
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,790
Do you know Liu Cheng?

216
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,750
You're young.

217
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,990
What's your plan
after getting out of here?

218
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,120
Why worry so much?

219
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,270
I won't starve, anyway.

220
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,030
Right.

221
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,360
You're young.

222
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,270
The new semester is about to start.

223
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,320
You turned to prostitution because
you couldn't afford the tuition fee,

224
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,750
but then, you got caught

225
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,750
and expelled.

226
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,910
Did I get it right?

227
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,080
I got into the university two years ago,

228
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,850
but my family couldn't afford
my tuition fee.

229
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,670
So I went to Liu Cheng for a loan.

230
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,480
I planned to work part-time and pay him
back later after the semester started.

231
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,910
Don't worry too much.

232
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,360
I'll cover all your tuition
and living expenses.

233
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,710
You don't need to pay back.

234
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:22,910
That's great.

235
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,750
Mr. Liu,

236
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,390
I'll work part-time

237
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,080
and pay you back
after my semester starts.

238
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,960
There's no need for that.

239
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,670
You've grown so much.

240
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,480
I...

241
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,440
Mr. Liu, I started school late.

242
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,270
I'm 19 now.

243
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,840
I see.

244
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,960
Ah, youth.

245
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,790
How envious.

246
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,200
Do you think

247
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,960
2,000 yuan a month is enough?

248
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,440
But girls

249
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,910
need to buy a few new clothes,

250
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,240
cosmetics, and all sorts.

251
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,030
I'll give you 3,000 yuan.

252
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,120
Mr. Liu.

253
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,670
Mr. Liu.

254
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,150
It's great to be young.

255
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,240
My university is in town.

256
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,630
He visited me every month.

257
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,270
Everyone thought he was my uncle.

258
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,960
Besides you,

259
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,840
did he have similar relationships
with others?

260
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
Take a look at this.

261
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,600
Do you know this person?

262
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,630
I've never seen him before.

263
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,030
No, I don't know him.

264
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,670
Thank you for your cooperation.

265
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,510
That's all for today.

266
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,960
Come to see me

267
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,080
after your detention ends.

268
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,960
We can talk about your readmission.

269
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,320
Hold on.

270
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,320
Something just came to me.

271
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,840
I'm not sure if it's useful.

272
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,480
What's it?

273
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:11,910
There was once
when we did that together,

274
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,440
he said

275
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,960
I wasn't as obedient as those girls.

276
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,030
Those girls?

277
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,750
Yes.

278
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
Who are "those girls"?

279
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,510
I have no idea.

280
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,240
But that's exactly what he said.

281
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,120
He said those girls.

282
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,840
When was this?

283
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,440
About six months ago.

284
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,440
Three months before his death.

285
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,960
All right.

286
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,360
Yes.

287
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,960
Master,

288
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,030
would "those girls" Liu Cheng said
be prostitutes?

289
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,120
No.

290
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,960
It wouldn't be something
Liu Cheng bragged about.

291
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,840
Could it be other female students?

292
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,080
"Those girls" gives us at least
three takeaways.

293
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,000
First,

294
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,240
it means there are two people
or more than that.

295
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,360
Second, they probably have
a full relationship with Liu Cheng

296
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,870
six months before his death.

297
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,910
Third,

298
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,030
they are obedient.

299
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:21,960
Tiaotiao.

300
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,750
Yes?

301
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,840
When did Liu Cheng
volunteer at the charity event

302
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,690
for individuals
with intellectual disabilities?

303
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:31,910
One year ago.

304
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,080
Eight months before his death.

305
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,270
Speaking of which,

306
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,080
Mr. Liu was one
of the biggest contributors

307
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,100
to helping families
with disabled children.

308
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,670
He was committed to it for a long time.

309
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,680
He was truly admirable.

310
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,030
Really?

311
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,870
Mr. Zhao, here's the name list
you asked for.

312
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,590
This is all the information
you requested.

313
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,620
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

314
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,780
Please don't let us keep you.

315
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,840
Sure. Take care.

316
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,630
Sure.

317
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,150
Excuse me,

318
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,840
where is Mr. Lin's house?

319
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,510
Over there.

320
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,960
Turn left at the next intersection?

321
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,510
Right.

322
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,720
Thank you.

323
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:22,960
Well,

324
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,910
we didn't find anything
from this family either.

325
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,320
How many more are left?

326
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,480
Besides this one,

327
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,270
seven more.

328
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,910
Come on.

329
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,440
Keep going.

330
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,580
(Countdown to Wang Pu's execution:
17 hours and 8 minutes)

331
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,510
Have you found the unknown number
Ma Da mentioned?

332
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,790
Tech Liu traced it.

333
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,000
It's a virtual number registered overseas.

334
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,000
You know what?

335
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
I think Ma Bo was telling the truth.

336
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,240
Why?

337
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,480
Both Ma Bo

338
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,550
and Song Chaoran were already
on bad terms,

339
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,480
you know?

340
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,240
Here you go.

341
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,630
Your skewers are ready.

342
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,080
Well, well.

343
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,870
I've been waiting.

344
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,630
Sure thing.

345
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,030
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

346
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,440
Don't mention it.

347
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,920
- Hahaha.
- Well,

348
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,790
where's Ms. Li?

349
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,400
Ms. Li?

350
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh, she's on a mission.

351
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,790
Li.

352
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,680
Yes?

353
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,480
Less chili

354
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,480
on my skewers later.

355
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Oh, sure.

356
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,790
Haha.

357
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:21,920
Hi, Miss.

358
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,440
Hi.

359
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,240
No thanks.

360
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,110
We just want to ask you

361
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,070
about the family up there.

362
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,000
Are you Wang Kailin's parent?

363
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,510
Yes, I am.

364
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,120
Hi, we'd like to ask you
a few questions.

365
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,270
How often did Mr. Liu Cheng

366
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,310
come for counseling sessions?

367
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,110
Twice a week.

368
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,960
Twice a week?

369
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,790
How long did each session last?

370
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,030
An hour.

371
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,240
About an hour.

372
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,920
What was your impression of him?

373
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,830
Did your child ever mention

374
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,400
feeling uncomfortable

375
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,510
after meeting with Mr. Liu Cheng?

376
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,240
- No.
- No?

377
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,200
I'd like to know

378
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,640
if you were present

379
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,750
during every session.

380
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,310
Sometimes.

381
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,830
Sometimes, I see.

382
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,160
Yes.

383
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,200
You were there the whole time?

384
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,880
Ma Bo and Song Chaoran
had already fallen out.

385
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:11,510
Right? If you were Song Chaoran,

386
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,640
would you agree to meet Ma Bo
on short notice

387
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,720
in the middle of nowhere?

388
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,590
Of course not.

389
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,000
You do make sense.

390
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,880
Plus, we didn't find
any suspicious calls

391
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,510
on Song Chaoran's phone.

392
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,720
If someone really arranged
this meeting with him,

393
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,790
it must've been done face-to-face.

394
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,270
Right.

395
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,590
What should we do next?

396
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,000
Look into who Song Chaoran
has met recently

397
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,640
and what their financial condition is.

398
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,920
Withdrawing 100,000 cash

399
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,400
will leave a trail.

400
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,890
There's no need to go to
so much trouble.

401
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,070
Just ask Song Chaoran directly
when he wakes up.

402
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,920
Oh, okay.

403
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,240
All right. I'll be right there.

404
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,590
What's it?

405
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,640
You know what?

406
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,200
Speak of the devil.

407
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,640
The hospital just called.

408
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,720
Song Chaoran is awake.

409
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,680
Is Mr. Song awake?

410
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,720
Oh, right.

411
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,240
Yes, he is.

412
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,790
Chaoran,

413
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,790
this is Captain Ding
from the Criminal Investigation Team.

414
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,480
She's in charge of your case.

415
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,790
Hi, Captain Ding.

416
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,030
Hi, Mr. Song.

417
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,680
I know this isn't the best time,

418
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,030
but I need to confirm something
very crucial

419
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,070
with you.

420
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,790
Who invited you there that day?

421
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,680
I don't remember.

422
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,240
You don't remember?

423
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,510
I'm sorry,

424
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,310
Officer Ding.

425
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,240
My mind is a mess.

426
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,200
I can't recall anything from recently.

427
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,720
Captain Ding,

428
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,480
if there's nothing else,

429
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,200
please let my friend rest.

430
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,400
Is that okay?

431
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,070
It shouldn't be.

432
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,070
You're saying he's showing signs
of memory loss?

433
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
He's only suffered physical injuries.

434
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,480
Some broken bones.

435
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,510
His brain wasn't injured.

436
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,000
He shouldn't be experiencing
memory loss.

437
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,110
Is it theoretically possible?

438
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,110
Yes, it is.

439
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,190
Aside from physical factors, psychological
factors could also play a role.

440
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,310
For instance,
he was badly attacked that day,

441
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,830
he might've forgotten what happened

442
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,070
out of a defense mechanism.

443
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,790
However, the chances are pretty low.

444
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,510
All right.

445
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,510
Thank you, doctor.

446
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,510
Hello?

447
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,590
Captain Ding,

448
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,160
Qian Pengfei withdrew 100,000 yuan

449
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,830
from his personal account
three days ago.

450
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,920
Captain Ding,

451
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,240
he just fell asleep.

452
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,110
Do you want me to wake him up?

453
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,260
I came here for Qian Pengfei.

454
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,160
Where's he?

455
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,640
He just left.

456
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,030
Summon Qian Pengfei.

457
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,110
He just left the hospital.

458
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,480
Ms. Wei.

459
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,790
Here's Qian Pengfei's withdrawal slip.

460
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,240
Is he here yet?

461
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,100
- Yes, in the interrogation room.
- Let's go.

462
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,110
Pretty officers,

463
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,270
I have a lot on my plate.

464
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,030
Regarding Ma Bo's matter,

465
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,920
didn't you already criticize me
last time?

466
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,480
Are you going to scold me again?

467
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:18,790
Here.

468
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,240
Explain it to me.

469
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,110
What's there to explain?

470
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,440
I withdrew some cash.

471
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,550
What's wrong with that?

472
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,790
Why such a large amount all of a sudden?

473
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,030
I was going to propose.

474
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:38,640
I planned to throw cash in the air
to create the atmosphere.

475
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,350
What's wrong with that?

476
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,830
Where's the money?

477
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,270
In my car.

478
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,480
My plan was delayed

479
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,030
because of Song Chaoran's accident.

480
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,720
I haven't used the money yet.

481
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,640
It's still in my car.

482
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,110
Liu Cheng was a piece of work.

483
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,840
He actually used psychological knowledge
to manipulate his patients

484
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:59,640
for his own desires.

485
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,480
Right. Also, among the families
we've interviewed,

486
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,240
some have congenital disabilities,

487
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,270
while others are victims of accidents.

488
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,640
Those Liu Cheng counseled

489
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,110
are the latter.

490
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,510
Have you found any similarities

491
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,310
in our findings?

492
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,260
(Disabled Individuals
Counseling Name List)

493
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,790
All these patients were sent
to No.3 Hospital

494
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,640
under the same attending physician,
Guo Qian.

495
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,480
You're quite observant.

496
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,750
Contact Guo Qian.

497
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,270
All right.

498
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,030
All right.

499
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,240
Ms. Li,

500
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,590
Dr. Guo went to Tailou City
for an exchange meeting.

501
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,740
She won't be back until late.

502
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,310
Let's go check it out first.

503
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:48,060
(Countdown to Wang Pu's execution:
13 hours and 51 minutes)

504
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,480
Darn it.

505
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,440
We guessed wrong?

506
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,640
Check the security footage.

507
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,070
Pause.

508
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,960
What's wrong with this?

509
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,440
The bag.

510
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,750
It's light.

511
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,830
Light?

512
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,680
Yes.

513
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,590
A single 100-yuan note
weighs around 1.15 grams,

514
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:43,030
so 100,000 should be 1.15 kilograms.

515
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,830
But look at how he's carrying it.

516
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,070
It's too light.

517
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,160
Continue.

518
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,240
He put cash into it.

519
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,880
That shouldn't be.

520
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,480
Where did he get the money?

521
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,440
Company funds.

522
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,480
Let's go

523
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,440
meet Yang Qing.

524
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,640
Ms. Yang,

525
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,030
we're sorry

526
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:21,830
to trouble you.

527
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,000
It's more convenient

528
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,510
if the company staff
handles this internally.

529
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,000
If the police step in,

530
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,740
there'll be a lot of paperwork
to go through.

531
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,680
Understood.

532
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,440
Let's go upstairs.

533
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,240
- Okay.
- Hmm.

534
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,480
Captain Ding,

535
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,200
we lost 100,000 yuan.

536
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,750
Are there any cameras here?

537
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,240
Yes.

538
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,400
Qian Pengfei?

539
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,750
Here, please have some water.

540
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,350
Thank you.

541
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,400
Well,

542
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,350
I'm so sorry about that.

543
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,310
My wife went on a business trip.
She's not home.

544
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,030
It's all right. Here's the thing.

545
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,350
We came here

546
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,480
regarding Liu Cheng's case.

547
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,070
Well,

548
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,680
Mr. Liu was a good man.

549
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,550
What a shame.

550
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,000
What would you like to ask?

551
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,790
You were quite close with Liu Cheng?

552
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,680
Yes, we were quite close.

553
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,030
He was a counselor, and his institution

554
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,160
collaborated with Qian's department.

555
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,480
Qian worked with him.

556
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,750
So I met him a few times.

557
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,160
He was indeed a good man.

558
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,620
(Certificate of Honor,
Outstanding Journalist, Lin Shuai)

559
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,790
Sadly.

560
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,590
- Mr. Lin.
- Yes?

561
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,240
I noticed there's an "Outstanding
Journalist" certificate

562
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,400
on the wall.

563
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,350
You used to be a journalist?

564
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,990
I was for a few years
when I was younger.

565
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,000
I started my business
when I married Qian.

566
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,480
It's been doing pretty well.

567
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,960
Especially after my daughter,
Pengpeng, was born,

568
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,000
everything's been smooth sailing.

569
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,270
I should really thank my wife
and daughter for that.

570
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,030
Sounds like you must be very busy.

571
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,000
Indeed. Clients

572
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
keep coming,

573
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,070
no matter how swamped I am.

574
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,270
Sometimes, I barely have time
to look after the house.

575
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,160
What about your wife?

576
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,480
She's a doctor.

577
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,440
She works day and night
crazily sometimes.

578
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,270
She's also very busy.

579
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,070
Who takes care of Pengpeng, then?

580
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,240
We had a nanny when she was little.

581
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,160
Now that she's older,
she looks after herself.

582
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,110
Here.

583
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,700
Let me show you some pictures of her
when she was little.

584
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,680
Look.

585
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,680
Yes.

586
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,750
- She's very adorable.
- Yes.

587
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,070
Hahaha.

588
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,590
Look,

589
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,640
this child is energetic

590
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
and lively.

591
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,070
Mr. Lin,

592
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,070
there are many pictures of Pengpeng
on the wall.

593
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,160
Mind if I take a look?

594
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,070
Be my guest.

595
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,000
Thank you.

596
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,790
It's not finished yet.
There's one more here.

597
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,990
This looks interesting.

598
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
- Mr. Lin.
- Yes.

599
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,070
This must be Dr. Guo, right?

600
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,200
Yes, it's her.

601
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,920
Judging by her posture,
she looks like a professional boxer.

602
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,960
She interned

603
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,030
with the municipal boxing team
after graduation.

604
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,680
She was their team physician,
so she picked up some skills as well.

605
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,160
I'm still no match for her now.

606
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,030
Hahaha.

607
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,400
From what we found,

608
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,510
Dr. Guo works at No.3 Hospital, right?

609
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,880
Yes.

610
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,590
Please have a look at this.

611
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,480
Do you know this man?

612
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,640
Well.

613
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,590
No, I don't.

614
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,440
What's wrong?

615
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:12,830
I see.

616
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,590
If Liu Cheng's case
isn't directly related

617
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,790
to my family,

618
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,310
you can ask me.

619
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,380
This is a murder case, after all.

620
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,070
We'd like to investigate deeper.

621
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,340
(Countdown to Wang Pu's execution:
12 hours and 11 minutes)

622
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,920
Is there anything you'd like to tell?

623
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,790
I didn't steal the money.

624
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,030
I borrowed it.

625
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,160
Ask Chaoran if you don't believe me.

626
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,000
I wrote him an IOU.

627
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,960
Where did the 100,000 yuan go?

628
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,030
I lost it.

629
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,510
Someone stole it.

630
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,920
Someone stole it?

631
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,160
How?

632
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,550
I put the bag in the trunk,

633
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,960
and I forgot to lock the door.

634
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,510
The money was gone
by the time I got back.

635
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,960
Qian Pengfei, listen.

636
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,960
You'd better confess everything.

637
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,920
Stop playing dumb.

638
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,640
What do you want me to confess?

639
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,750
The money was stolen.

640
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,030
Go investigate if you don't believe me.

641
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,200
I have nothing else to say.

642
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,350
Mr. Song.

643
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:36,830
Officer Ding.

644
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,000
I know why you are here.

645
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,350
I gave the money to Qian Pengfei.

646
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,720
He didn't steal it.

647
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,550
Words travel fast, Mr. Song.

648
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,300
How did you know
what I was going to ask?

649
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:59,160
I've been fully cooperating with you.

650
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,830
Pengfei told me

651
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,030
his money was stolen,

652
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,830
so I gave him the money.
Is there a problem with that?

653
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,310
That's enough.

654
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,830
Let's stop here.

655
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,110
I'm not feeling well.

656
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,440
Please leave.

657
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,350
If so, we won't disturb you any further.

658
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,440
Ms. Wei, I don't get it.

659
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,590
It's obvious that Qian Pengfei hired hitmen
to beat Song Chaoran up.

660
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,880
Why is Song Chaoran still defending him?

661
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,750
Find the reason,

662
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,830
and we'll be close to the truth.

663
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,310
Let's go.

664
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,640
Hello?

665
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,270
They've left.
