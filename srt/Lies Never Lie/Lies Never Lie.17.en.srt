00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,110

33
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,039
(Police)

34
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,209
Meng Zhengyi has asthma.

35
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,110
Logically speaking, he cannot smoke.

36
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,879
This is his lung CT scan.

37
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,849
It's very clean.

38
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,000
He didn't have the habit of smoking
when he was alive.

39
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,320
Therefore, Luo Yifei
was the one smoking.

40
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,230
Why did you kill Ning Jing?

41
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,249
Tell me! Why did you kill Ning Jing?

42
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,910
Why did you kill Ning Jing? Why...

43
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,830
That's right.

44
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,039
Right before Meng Zhengyi died,

45
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,969
he gave it his all
and glanced at Liu Yifei.

46
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,880
I thought he was just
reluctant to part with Luo Yifei.

47
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,350
But actually, his gaze was telling us

48
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,110
that the true culprit was Luo Yifei.

49
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,599
(Meng Zhengyi)
Luo Yifei manipulated Meng Zhengyi completely.

50
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,200
She knew that Meng Zhengyi loved her,
and she manipulated his love for her.

51
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,209
To her, Meng Zhengyi was just a tool.

52
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,070
That's why she could kill him
without any hesitation.

53
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,159
Now, Meng Zhengyi is dead.

54
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,680
There's no evidence to prove her crime.
All the charges have been pinned on him.

55
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,679
Now, Luo Yifei can get away unscathed.

56
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,030
That's right.

57
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,880
Mochou.

58
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,240
We received this news just now.

59
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,680
Luo Yifei and Ning Zhiyuan
have gotten engaged.

60
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,560
We have to act as soon as possible.

61
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,120
Luo Yifei is selling
the assets of Tianxiang Group.

62
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,920
If we can't gather evidence of her crime
before she leaves the country,

63
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,039
if we let her escape,

64
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,710
it'll be difficult to catch her again.

65
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,150
Ning Jing's case has been closed.

66
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,200
The evidence chain is complete.

67
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,200
According to the procedures, there's no way
we can continue the investigation.

68
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,270
If we do proceed with the investigation,

69
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,239
we can only depend on ourselves.

70
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,760
Are you trying to give up?

71
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,800
Do you believe me?

72
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,560
Now, all of the evidence are suggesting
that Meng Zhengyi is the culprit.

73
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,470
And, there's no substantial evidence
to support my suspicion of Luo Yifei.

74
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,840
Even if I'm depending on
the field of psychology,

75
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,760
I might be wrong.

76
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,200
I believe you.

77
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,209
I never expected this to happen.

78
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,470
If I must say,

79
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,030
this has never happened before.

80
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,000
I wouldn't be sitting here if the tigers
in the zoo did devour people.

81
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,579
What should we do with the tiger, then?

82
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:03,360
I don't know what to do either.

83
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,209
Let's lock it up for a few days first.

84
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,679
As for the exact solution, we need to
wait for our superiors' instruction.

85
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,529
Besides,

86
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,390
I dare not let the tiger out either.

87
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,719
If I must say, Xiangxiang
won't be able to escape.

88
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,560
What's the name of the tiger?

89
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,799
Xiangxiang.

90
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,200
Who named it Xiangxiang, then?

91
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,969
The name of the tiger
was Xiangxiang in the first place.

92
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,769
It didn't belong to our zoo in the past.

93
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,409
But it got in trouble in Gongmen Gorge
Wildlife Park three years ago.

94
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,600
That's why it was sent here.

95
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,009
When it was first sent here,
they told us its name was Zhengyi.

96
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,950
But it didn't react to us
when we called that name.

97
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,150
Gongmen Gorge?

98
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,390
That's right.

99
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,120
I heard that it killed someone.

100
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,510
So, the tiger's name
was changed three years ago?

101
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,159
Last year,

102
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,039
a zookeeper who was transferred here

103
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,359
from Gongmen Gorge Wildlife Park
said he knew the tiger.

104
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,960
He said its original name
was Xiangxiang.

105
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,769
Before the tragedy occurred,

106
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,239
for some reason,
another zookeeper was in charge of him.

107
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,360
He changed its name to Zhengyi.

108
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,529
But tigers don't know
that their names can be changed.

109
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,920
It only recognized one name.

110
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,590
That's why we still call it Xiangxiang.

111
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:08,089
So Xiangxiang is actually Zhengyi?

112
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,479
Everything's stated in its profile.

113
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,950
Take a look.

(Animal Adoption Agreement)

116
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,470
Hao Mingxuan,
do you want to get a divorce?

117
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,089
I cannot communicate with you.

118
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,270
Stop avoiding me! Come back!

119
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,200
Are you done messing around?

120
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,000
Am I? Who said I was messing around?

121
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,800
I was too lenient with you usually!
That's why you're bullying me!

122
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,520
I'll tell your family about this!
I'll tell your company about it too!

123
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,510
I'll show everyone
how shameless you are!

124
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,240
Fine! You want a divorce, right?

125
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,039
Fine! Let's get a divorce today!

126
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,440
What are you talking about?

127
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,120
You think you can
get a divorce like that?

128
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,800
Are you trying
to split my assets with me?

129
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,009
Hello?

130
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,320
Is this 110?

131
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,270
A murder has occurred.

132
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,089
Alright. Got it.

133
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:21,479
Got it.

134
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,800
I'll head there immediately.

135
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,279
Captain Yue, you haven't told me
where we're heading yet.

136
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,159
Follow me to Jingmen.

137
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,089
Aren't you going to contact
Ms. Wei and Ms. Li?

138
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,969
I won't be able to shine
with them around.

139
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,599
Today, I'll show you guys
how capable your captain is.

140
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:32,999
Let's go.

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,599
Geez.

142
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,089
Seems like Captain Yue
doesn't have much time left.

143
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,870
They'll return tomorrow.

144
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,440
I knew that was
psychological manipulation.

145
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,950
Zhiyuan told me about it many times.

146
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,830
I secretly searched for
information online as well.

147
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,110
But...

148
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,359
Come in.

149
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,960
But for some reason,

150
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,269
Are you still reviewing the video?

151
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:00,479
I dare not go against him.

152
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,640
I dare not do so.

153
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,929
Here. Have some coffee.
It'll perk you up.

154
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:05,969
Thanks.

155
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,640
I brought you some new leads.

156
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,719
Animal Adoption Agreement?

157
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,870
Take a look.

158
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,470
(Adopter Profile)
Adopter, Meng Zhengyi?

159
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,999
Is this a tiger?

160
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,759
The tiger's name is Zhengyi.

161
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,759
It was adopted by
Meng Zhengyi three years ago.

162
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,599
But before Meng Zhengyi,

163
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,999
Tianxiang Group was its adopter.

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,830
(Adopter Profile)
They also named it Xiangxiang.

165
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,759
They adopted it four years ago.

166
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,929
That means the tiger
was under Tianxiang Group

167
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,950
before Meng Zhengyi joined them.

168
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,519
And, the park director told me

169
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,719
that although tigers have to be fed with
raw meat all year long,

170
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,089
they won't harm people easily.

171
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,680
It's because they don't see
humans as food yet.

172
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,689
However, if a tiger
does devour people time and time again,

173
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,169
it must've been trained to do so.

174
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,849
And, it takes quite some time
for it to develop such a habit.

175
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,519
Therefore, it's likely that Luo Yifei
reared the tiger, huh?

176
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,070
That's what I'm suspecting as well.

177
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,920
But no matter if it's a clip

178
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,350
of Luo Yifei's interrogation

179
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,350
or our encounters lately,

180
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,710
I didn't detect any issues with her.

181
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,399
Anyway, after our investigation,

182
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,239
I do think

183
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,560
that Luo Yifei is related
to Ning Jing's murder.

184
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,470
Initially, I was sitting here.

185
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,230
I was almost asleep.

186
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,399
But suddenly, there was a loud argument

187
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,950
outside.

188
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,680
It woke me up.

189
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,520
Did you identify whether
the voice belonged to a man or a woman?

190
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,710
A woman.

191
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,689
It was a woman!

192
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,119
Oh.

193
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,440
It's a woman, huh?

194
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,800
So, your husband rented this unit?

195
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,479
Yes.

196
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,200
Why did he rent this unit?

197
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,200
I don't know.

198
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,590
It's my first time here as well.

199
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,849
Ms. Yu, you can tell us
if you have any grievances.

200
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,680
We'll uphold justice for you.

201
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,070
Can you tell me what happened back then?

202
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,560
I know you feel terrible now.

203
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,519
But I can only help you out

204
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,969
if you describe what happened.

205
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:18,759
It's all my fault.

206
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,920
I'm serious.

207
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,049
If I didn't do it first, he wouldn't have...

208
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,040
Did you push him?

209
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,110
That's not it.

210
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,800
No.

211
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,470
How did he fall off the building, then?

212
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,359
He fell off the building by himself.

213
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,999
- He was pushed off the building.
- By who?

214
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,400
A man.

215
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,230
A man?

216
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,580
(Qinshou Insurance)

217
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,089
Stay put.

218
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,110
Officer, can you uncuff me?

219
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,280
No.

220
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,230
Come with me.

221
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,399
Tell me. What's your relationship
with the victim?

222
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,719
He's a client of ours.
It has nothing to do with him.

223
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,089
Do you know the woman in the unit?

224
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:00,879
I don't.

225
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,719
You don't? Why do you think
you're here, then?

226
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,399
I came here to do
a follow-up appointment.

227
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Follow-up? But he's dead, you know?

228
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,000
I was discussing
his insurance plan with him.

229
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,780
All of a sudden, his wife kicked down
the door and came in, then slapped him.

230
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,200
- Forget about him, even I was dumbfounded.
- Why did she hit you?

231
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,920
It's all because of the girl on the bed.

232
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,520
I only found out that there was
a girl on the bed after the incident.

233
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,070
Sir, see if he's the one.

234
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,750
It's him!
He pushed him off the building!

235
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,280
Stay put.

236
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,110
It's him?

237
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,880
The old mister said he saw him pushing
the victim off the building.

238
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,599
I brought him here
so that he could point him out.

239
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:36,480
- He saw it himself? Are you sure?
- He said he saw it through the peephole.

240
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,080
Hey. You should only speak
when you have evidence.

241
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,160
Who said I was the one
who pushed him off the building?

242
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,879
It was you!

243
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,470
You pushed him off the building!

244
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,399
Sir, let's head back and rest first.

245
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,689
Captain Yue will interrogate him.

246
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,049
Okay.

247
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,329
I'll stop bothering you guys.

248
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,359
Listen,

249
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,719
my vision is perfectly fine.

250
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,750
Yeah. Be careful.

251
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,569
- Hey! That hurts!
- Tell me about it.

252
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,239
What's going on?

253
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,399
I came back to do
a follow-up appointment.

254
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,449
I was having a great chat

255
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,599
with Mr. Hao.

256
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,680
He was satisfied with our service too.

257
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,399
Just when I was about to leave,

258
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,289
his wife came inside.

259
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,169
Then she slapped him.

260
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:08,759
And then?

261
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,399
And then, Mr. Hao tried to leave

262
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,950
during their argument.

263
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,710
His wife chased after him
and beat him up.

264
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,350
Anyway, I saw him lying on the ground
after I leave the unit.

265
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,359
I stood there watching him.
I didn't push him off.

266
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,160
Don't listen to
that old fool's nonsense.

267
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,280
Captain Yue.

268
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,950
Stay here.

269
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,950
Come here and take a look.

270
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,110
Take a look.

271
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,169
What is it?

272
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,520
Don't you understand?

273
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:42,929
Come.

274
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,230
Look at it from here.

275
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,230
Take a look.

276
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,950
What are you guys looking at?

277
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,399
What's wrong?

278
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,160
Ah, it's nothing.

279
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,230
Here.

280
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,240
I told you already.

281
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,689
Don't listen to his nonsense.
This has nothing to do with me.

282
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,119
Chen Peng.

283
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,519
Yes?

284
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,560
Take him away.

285
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,329
I don't think you need to do this.

286
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,640
This has nothing to do with me!

287
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,070
You don't get to make the call here.
All of you, come.

(Baizhou Police)

289
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,070
Did she say nothing?

290
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,449
Yeah. Maybe she needs
more time to calm down.

291
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,870
Let's wait a little longer.

292
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,379
Hey. Didn't he say Du Wei
pushed him off the building?

293
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:39,920
Why did you guys refute his statement?

294
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,329
Don't bring it up. Mr. Zhang's peephole
is installed backwards.

295
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,950
He couldn't see what was happening outside
from his peephole at all.

(Qinshou Insurance)
Do you know this woman?

297
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,280
I don't.

298
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,449
You two are from the same company.
How could you not know her?

299
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,400
We're just from the same company.

300
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,160
It's not like we're from
the same department.

301
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,590
You can't expect me
to know everyone in the company.

302
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,230
What's the relationship between you two?

She's my girlfriend.

Who was the one who did
the follow-up appointment?

306
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,950
It was me.

"I'm dizzy. Come and pick me up."

308
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,750
What does that mean?

309
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:34,969
I don't know.

00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,160
You don't know?

312
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,320
Captain Yue, sorry for the interruption.

313
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,830
You're pretty stubborn, aren't you?
Just you wait.

314
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,040
He was beaten up?

315
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,359
That's right.

316
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,520
All of these are fresh wounds.

317
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,230
This is pretty harsh.

318
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,399
Yeah.

319
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,920
They must have a deep feud.

320
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,720
What's his cause of death?
Is it related to his beating?

321
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,879
We're not sure yet.

322
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,070
Captain Yue, Yu Yin
is finally willing to speak.

323
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,639
For the questioning session later,
you can tell us at any time

324
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,950
if you feel uncomfortable.

325
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,870
It's fine. Ask away.

326
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,830
I'll tell you everything I know.

327
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,599
Do you know Hao Mingxuan?

328
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,999
He's my client.

329
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,950
Why did you look for him today?

330
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,399
Mr. Hao said he wanted to
sign a new insurance plan with me.

331
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,599
He told me to look for him.

332
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,200
Wasn't it a follow-up appointment?

333
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,440
What follow-up appointment?

334
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,750
Did you meet him, then?

335
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,399
What happened after you met him?

336
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,119
Nothing. I introduced the insurance plan
to Mr. Hao seriously,

337
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,800
just like what I did in the past.

338
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,750
He was listening to me attentively.

339
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,399
But after that...

340
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,710
What happened after that?

341
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:05,599
After that, I felt dizzy. But I was
too embarrassed to tell him about it.

342
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,310
That's why I endured it.

343
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,310
Oh yeah.

344
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,049
I texted my boyfriend as well.

345
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,440
I wanted him to pick me up.

346
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,990
Your boyfriend?

347
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,639
Can you tell me what's his name?

348
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,790
Du Wei.

349
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,879
Did Hao Mingxuan

350
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,529
give you any food or beverages

351
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,440
when you were at his house?

352
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,680
I drank a cup of fruit juice.

353
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,329
It didn't taste like fruit juice.

354
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,710
It had a weird taste.

355
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,160
I can't remember clearly.

356
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,230
Did your boyfriend pick you up, then?

357
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,680
He did.

358
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,270
But...

359
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,880
But what?

360
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,199
I think I was asleep.

361
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,510
But then I woke up.

362
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,230
I was dizzy.

363
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,270
When I opened my eyes, I saw
my boyfriend beating up Mr. Hao.

364
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,639
Listen to me!

365
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,510
To hell with you!

366
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,529
Du Wei, you went
to the police academy as well.

367
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,030
Let's stop beating around the bush.

368
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,089
Hao Mingxuan's body
was covered with injuries.

369
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,440
The hair and follicles on his clothing
match your DNA perfectly.

370
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,729
Your girlfriend also said

371
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,640
that she saw you beating him up.

372
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,840
What else do you have
to say for yourself?

373
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,440
I did beat him up.

374
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,359
He wanted to rape my girlfriend.

375
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,880
I already went easy on him!

376
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,009
- How dare you try to rape my girlfriend?
- That's not true!

377
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,160
- Let me explain myself!
- To hell with you!

378
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,880
Was beating him up
the only thing you did?

379
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,990
I'll only own up
to the things I've done.

380
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,080
He had an affair outside.

381
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,200
His wife caught him red-handed.

382
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,550
He felt shameful. He tried to run away.

383
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,080
Look at him. It's his just desserts.

384
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,249
If you don't believe me,
you can find his wife.

385
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,640
His wife was there as well.
She can testify for me.

386
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,880
Did you witness their fight?

387
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,230
I did.

388
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,049
Stop fighting!

389
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,510
Stop fighting!

390
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,840
Why did you hit my husband?

391
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,199
He raped my girlfriend!

392
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,979
- Why can't I beat him up?
- That's not true!

393
00:19:30,979 --> 00:19:31,639
What did you say?

394
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,809
Check the room yourself!

395
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,880
That's not true!

396
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,440
Hao Mingxuan!

397
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,880
You shameless man!

398
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:45,729
Dear!

399
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,710
Don't leave!

400
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,760
Why didn't you tell us about this
from the start?

401
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,119
Such a deed is very hurtful for a girl
if people hear about it.

402
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,920
How could I bear to do so?

403
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,199
Moreover,

404
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,160
it was my husband's fault entirely.

405
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,840
Actually, I knew that he was
having an affair outside long ago.

406
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,310
He thought he did a great job
at concealing his deeds.

407
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,289
Why did you think he rented the unit?

408
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,399
It's for him to keep his mistresses.

409
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,089
It's just that I never expected him

410
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,440
to commit such a despicable deed.

411
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,030
He tried to ruin
an innocent girl's life.

412
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,049
Please check it.

413
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,750
Sign here if there's no issue.

414
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,249
How did it go?

415
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,120
There's no issue with the way
we're dealing with the case.

416
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,089
Du Wei almost enrolled into
a police academy before.

417
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,880
He almost became one of our colleagues.

418
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,199
To be honest, he's unlucky

419
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,959
to be involved in such a case.

420
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,639
I'm serious.

421
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,400
Hopefully, in the end,
they'll rule it as self-defense.

422
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,560
Have you guys found the beverage
that Yu Yin had drunk?

423
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:55,959
Yeah.

424
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,840
It's red wine.

425
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,880
(Test Report of Yu Yin)
But the red wine bottle was emptied.

426
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,860
(Empty Red Wine Bottle)
The bottle was washed too.

427
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,200
There were no signs of any drugs.

428
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,359
But we detected
components of sleeping pills

429
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,679
in Yu Yin's body.

430
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,679
This proves that she was drugged.

431
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,840
What do you think?

432
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,119
There's nothing wrong
with the case, right?

433
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,729
Listen up.

434
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,119
I, Captain Yue, am
a capable detective as well.

435
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,470
I'm good at my job.

436
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,580
It's just that my junior
is better at it than me.

437
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,089
I had no time to shine because of you.

438
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,440
I suppose
you have no time to shine later as well.

439
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,120
What's wrong?

440
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,790
What's your opinion on it?

441
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,080
They're lying.

442
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,600
Something's off with the case.

443
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,030
Come.

444
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:35,990
Look here.

445
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,360
What's the issue here?

446
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,120
Understood.

447
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,120
Me too.

448
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:47,919
Ah.

449
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,289
Me too.

450
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:49,959
What is it?

451
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,510
How could I not tell at all?

452
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,569
Hey!

453
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,710
Do you understand now?

454
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,270
- Why did you touch my waist?
- How did it feel?

455
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,200
It felt ticklish.

456
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,919
Waist is a sensitive part of the body.

457
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,120
We would react unconsciously even if
someone familiar were to touch our waist,

458
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,289
not to mention a stranger
of the opposite gender.

459
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,560
Du Wei's action felt natural.

460
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,399
Gao Mengqi didn't refuse
his touch as well.

461
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:12,959
That means...

462
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,440
They know each other.

463
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,040
And, they have a special relationship.

464
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,750
It doesn't count.
My waist is ticklish naturally.

465
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,640
What a blockhead.

466
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,200
Wow!

467
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,489
There's an entire set
of Bleach manga here.

468
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,160
It's the first version as well.

469
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,510
I never expected this old mister
to be a hot-blooded youth once.

470
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,729
You read these comics too?

471
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,639
Of course.

472
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,680
They're an important part of my youth.

473
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,680
I thought you only read those youthful,
melancholic novels.

474
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,809
Master,

475
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,680
do you read comics
when you were young as well?

476
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,359
I do.

477
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,750
What kinds of comics do you read?

478
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,809
Calabash Brothers.

479
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:06,639
Ah?

480
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,599
Ms. Wei, I've inspected their phones.

481
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,520
There are no communication records
between them.

482
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,640
What about WeChat?

483
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,879
Du Wei and Gao Mengqi

484
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,840
didn't add each other on WeChat.

485
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,640
And, I kept his phone with me
after the deed.

486
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,190
He had no chance to delete her contact.

487
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,200
What time was it when
you guys reach the crime scene?

488
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,570
How long after the crime had occurred?

489
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,320
He has enough time
to delete her WeChat contact.

490
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,550
Forget about what I said, then.

491
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,750
What is this?

492
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,599
Du Wei's and Gao Mengqi's
Weibo accounts.

493
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,200
So, you suspect them of communicating
with each other through Weibo?

494
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,399
Tiaotiao.

495
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:55,879
Yes?

496
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,030
Come and see.

497
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,769
Did you see that?

498
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,920
Yeah.

499
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,159
All the bags she owned
are luxurious bags.

500
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,289
And, none of them had any accessories.

501
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,030
This is the only bag
with accessories on it.

502
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,840
So this must have
a special meaning for it.

503
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,550
That's right.
This accessory looks cheap.

504
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,080
Yeah.

505
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,200
Let's go.

506
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:35,580
(Baizhou Police)

507
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,950
How did it go?

508
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,840
How's the investigation going?

509
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,080
There were no communication records
between them.

510
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:44,750
They didn't contact each other much
on Weibo as well.

511
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,639
Look at Du Wei's Weibo account.

512
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,760
Each post is an advertisement
for his insurance company.

513
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,080
But Gao Mengqi had a fun life.

514
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:56,030
It's either moments of her enjoying herself,
pictures of her and her husband, or mangas.

515
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,199
Mangas?

516
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,360
That's right.

517
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,920
Don't tell me it's Bleach?

518
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,840
I don't know either. I haven't read
something like that before.

519
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,400
What is it?

520
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,270
It's Bleach.

521
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,879
So, she read the manga, huh?

522
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,009
I thought the mangas
belonged to her husband.

523
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,270
But why?

524
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,880
Hmm. It feels like

525
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,550
she won't read such mangas.

526
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,840
Is there anything else?

527
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,230
I also found out that there's a comment
under each of her manga posts.

528
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,089
I noticed that as well.

529
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,080
Whenever Gao Mengqi posts
a post related to mangas,

530
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,599
someone will react with an emoji.

531
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,329
I checked the main page of his profile.

532
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,679
It's nothing special.

533
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,340
He should be a fellow manga enthusiast.

534
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,470
Eh. Wait a moment.

535
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,920
(Coffee Widely Praised By White-Collar Workers)
That sakura.

536
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,840
That's right.

537
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,529
It's the same as
the one on Gao Mengqi's bag.

538
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:53,360
It's from Nanfeng Cafe
Spring Limited Edition Set Menu.

539
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,360
Is this nice?

540
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,710
It's not bad.

541
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,200
You can have it, then.

542
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,569
Say, why do people nowadays

543
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,990
like to check-in
at trendy spots so much?

544
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,399
I suppose you have no idea.

545
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,550
Come.

546
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,919
Let's take a picture. Smile.

547
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,680
Captain Ding, smile at the camera.

548
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,119
Did you think people
come here for the coffee?

549
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,729
People come here for the venue.

550
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,849
That's the culture
of youngsters nowadays.

551
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,529
They take a picture, post it
on their social media accounts,

552
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,120
and show people their lives.

553
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,840
I don't understand.

554
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,880
You don't understand?
That means you're old.

555
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,640
Gao Mengqi has been a posh housewife
for over a decade.

556
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,750
Would she come to a place like this?

557
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,400
If you drink hand-brewed coffee
for a long time,

558
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,230
you would crave instant coffee
from time to time.

559
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,000
Hello. We've retrieved
the surveillance camera footage.

560
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,879
- Ladies, please follow me.
- Okay. Thank you.

561
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,080
Sorry for the trouble.

562
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,980
(Nanfeng Cafe)

563
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,400
There's nothing.

564
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,640
How's their progress?

565
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,679
(Nanfeng Cafe)

566
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,920
I found it.

567
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,639
They did order a food delivery before.

568
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,600
It's at No. 10, Building 604,
Green Olive Community, Tidal Road.

569
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,489
Who are you guys?

570
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,569
Hello.

571
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,230
We're cops.
We wish to ask you something.

572
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,569
If you don't believe us,

573
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,599
you can call 110

574
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,119
and verify our identity.

575
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,680
Please wait a moment.

576
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,160
Okay.

577
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,809
Master,

578
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,769
it feels terrible when

579
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,270
the public doesn't trust us.

580
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,599
Try to change your perspective.

581
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,040
If the anti-fraud team knew that

582
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,920
the public have
such a high sense of awareness,

583
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,950
they should be relieved.

584
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,329
Please come in.

585
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,120
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

586
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,959
Do you know this guy?

587
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,120
No, I don't.

588
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,440
What about this person?

589
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,080
I don't know her either.

590
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,199
If so, have you heard of the names

591
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,640
Du Wei and Gao Mengqi before?

592
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,569
No.

593
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,879
Alright. We'll stop bothering you.
Sorry for the trouble.

594
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,030
No problem.

595
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:06,959
Master.

596
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,489
Hmm?

597
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:08,919
Are you sure she didn't lie?

598
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,880
No. She's speaking the truth.

599
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,120
I know now.

600
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:24,639
Excuse me.

601
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,729
I wish to ask you something.

602
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,359
When did you come back?

603
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,879
I came back today.

604
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,489
I just arrived home around three hours

605
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:31,750
before you guys arrived.

606
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,480
Why didn't you tell us about it, then?

607
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,080
You guys didn't ask me about it.

608
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,849
And, have you checked

609
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,569
whether or not you've lost anything

610
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,199
or whether or not someone was here

611
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,249
after you came back?

612
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,299
There's no need to worry.

613
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:46,359
I told my friend
to look after my unit before I left.

614
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,009
If someone was here,
he would've told me about it.

615
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,809
Your friend is pretty unreliable, huh?

616
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:54,400
He didn't even water
your plants for you.

617
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,400
You mean that?

618
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,289
I...

619
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,399
The plant was like that before I left.

620
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,750
Oh.

621
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,359
By the way, is your friend around?

622
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,809
Can you contact him for us?

623
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,009
We have something to ask him.

624
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,400
Okay.

625
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,160
That's right.

626
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,640
The unit was vacant anyway.

627
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,750
I could make some pocket money
by renting it out.

628
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,400
Is this the tenant?

629
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,710
Yes, that's her.

630
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,089
Do you know Gao Dayun?

631
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:23,769
Yeah, I do.

632
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,489
No. 10, Building 604,
Green Olive Community, Tidal Road.

633
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,199
Did you rent that unit before?

634
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,920
- That's right.
- Why?

635
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,550
That's my personal affair.

636
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,249
Do I need to tell you that?

637
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,849
We're cops, and we're interrogating you.

638
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,310
This isn't a casual chat.

639
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,919
Why did you rent the unit?

640
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,359
I wanted to hold a party
with my bosom friends.

641
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,680
Who were the participants?

642
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,569
In the end, no one had time.
The party didn't work out.

643
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,400
Are you only using it to hold a party?

644
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,489
That's right.

645
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,710
She's lying.

646
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:53,439
The reasons she gave are unconvincing.

647
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,289
Geez.

648
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,159
That Du Wei is driving me crazy.

649
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,310
What's wrong?

650
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,740
He admitted that he went to
Green Olive Community before.

651
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,259
He was caught by
the surveillance camera.

652
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,550
He had no choice but to admit it.

653
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,959
But do you know what he said?

654
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,879
He said he went there to verify
the policyholder's identity.

655
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,600
If so, have you asked
the insurance company?

656
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,809
Yeah. However,

657
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:12,080
there are policyholders
living in Green Olive Community.

658
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,679
Take the technical investigation team to
604 for a biological sample collection.

659
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,840
Alright. That'll work.

660
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,790
I'll head to the crime scene.
