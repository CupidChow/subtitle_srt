=Lies Never Lie=

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,660
Liu, help look at this.

29
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,029
This type of camera
can be controlled remotely.

30
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,630
It can store footage on a memory card

31
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,470
or upload it to the cloud.

32
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,119
But the memory card

33
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,119
is missing.

34
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,140
This is how I found it.

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,820
If there's no memory card, that means
the footage was uploaded to the cloud.

36
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,349
We just need
to log into the account to access it.

37
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,189
All right, I'll leave it to you.

38
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,380
No trouble.

39
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,530
=Lies Never Lie=
=Episode 18=

40
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,279
That's all I could find.

41
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,239
He gave me

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,749
this MP3 player

43
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,070
when we first got together.

44
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,029
I haven't used it in a long time.
So I'm not sure if it still works.

45
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,400
We'll take it back to the station for analysis.
We'll contact you if we find anything.

46
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,509
We might need to come back again soon.

47
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,959
I'm home every day now.

48
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,629
- You can stop by anytime.
- Thanks for your cooperation.

49
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,750
Let's go, Liu.

50
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,510
Officer Li,

51
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,790
how is Du Wei?

52
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,159
Will he go to jail?

53
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,350
It's not certain yet.

54
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,470
We'll let you know
if there's any update.

55
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,910
This isn't it.

56
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,510
I think it's still with Du Wei.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,999
Why do you think so?

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,399
Think about it.

59
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,789
If Gao Mengqi had it,

60
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,189
it would be over
if Hao Mingxuan discovered it.

61
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,279
But if Du Wei has it,

62
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,959
even if Yu Yin discovered it,

63
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,559
Hao Mingxuan is an outsider, after all.

64
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,140
He can find a way to bluff through it.

65
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,350
Then where would he hide it?

66
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,630
Probably somewhere
even Yu Yin wouldn't think to check.

67
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,420
Captain Ding, there's nothing here.

68
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,629
Where else could Du Wei have hidden it?

69
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,030
These are the only places
where things can be hidden.

70
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,950
Find anything?

71
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,420
How long is this going to take?

72
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,800
I'm not letting
a tiny memory card beat me.

73
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,919
Keep searching!
Search every place with a seam.

74
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,120
Pry them open if you have to!

75
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,060
Yes, madam.

76
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,879
Jeez...

77
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,509
Building LEGO is supposed
to be relaxing.

78
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,470
Tearing it apart is just stressful.

79
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,030
We've dismantled everything.

80
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,910
Are we sure it's even in here?

81
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,710
Not gonna lie,

82
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,540
this thing is kinda fun.

83
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,300
Maybe I'll get one for my mom.

84
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,379
If you're enjoying it so much,

85
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:49,400
you can be in charge
of putting it back together too.

86
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,709
Well, if you don't bother me,

87
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,270
I can play with this all day.

88
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,270
Found it.

89
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,230
She paid me to do it.

90
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,620
It was only a business deal.

91
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,660
I only wanted to make some extra cash.
Is that so wrong?

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,350
If that guy hadn't cheated,

93
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,350
he wouldn't have ended up like this.
So he deserved it.

94
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,740
(Biological Evidence Analysis)
Look at this.

95
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,149
The place is covered
with both of your fingerprints.

96
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,830
What's your relationship?

97
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,540
I only hired him
to investigate something for me.

98
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,830
Investigating with the two of you
ended up in bed together?

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,270
After spending so much time together,

100
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,039
we developed feelings.

101
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,189
You have no idea

102
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,470
what these past few months
have been like for me.

103
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,270
Hao Mingxuan is a monster.

104
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,119
I've been with him for 16 years

105
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,420
since I was 24.

106
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,500
Back then, I was young and beautiful.

107
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,270
He adored me.

108
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,679
But now I'm older,

109
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,740
and he's out chasing other women.

110
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,710
He thought I didn't know.

111
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,150
He thought I didn't check the accounts.

112
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,230
He's spending a fortune on other women.

113
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,790
Where else would the money go?

114
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,559
It's precisely for his mistress.

115
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,509
How can you be so sure
he has a mistress?

116
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,230
I saw it with my own eyes.

117
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,230
He bought an expensive handbag,

118
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,470
and it had "Forever with Ting,"
engraved on it.

119
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,420
Who's Ting?

120
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,350
It's definitely not me.

121
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,830
He even hid the bag,

122
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,620
afraid I'd find out.

123
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,740
Every day, I checked to see
if it was still there,

124
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,559
just to find out

125
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,500
which mistress had seduced him.

126
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,420
He always said

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,030
he'd only buy bags for me.

128
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:09,270
Every year on my birthday,
he'd give me a designer bag.

129
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,420
I kept them on display

130
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,910
so I never even used them.

131
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:23,149
But now, he's buying bags
for another woman.

132
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,470
Then one day, the bag was gone.

133
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,660
So I tracked his location.

134
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,500
I had to know where he was hiding her.

135
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,380
So did you find the place?

136
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,079
Yes, it was right there.

137
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,380
Did you go inside?

138
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,380
No.

139
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,710
What color was the bag?

140
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,900
Green.

141
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,740
Here.

142
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,900
Watch this video.

143
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,500
Mr. Li, look.

144
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,430
Mr. Li, here's the bag you asked for.

145
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,230
I don't want it anymore so return it.

146
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,020
Come on, don't do that.

147
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,149
You had it custom-engraved.

148
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,670
So it's non-refundable.

149
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,199
Mr. Li,

150
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,909
I bought the bag just like you asked.

151
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,509
I even paid it for you first.

152
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,670
You can't just back out now.

153
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,509
Well, women change their minds

154
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,350
every day.

155
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,719
She doesn't want it anymore.

156
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,669
What am I supposed to do with it?

157
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,079
Her changing minds is not my problem.

158
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,710
You asked me to buy it.

159
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,310
So let's complete the transaction.

160
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,430
Is this how you treat your friend?

161
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,549
Not treating you like a friend?

162
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,429
If I didn't care,

163
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,500
would I even be worried about your mess?

164
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,860
Enough talking. Just pay up.

165
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,430
You short on cash?

166
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,389
Come on, it's just one bag.

167
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,670
How much could it cost?

168
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,670
Oh, your wife loves handbags, right?

169
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,959
You can give it to her.

170
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,429
She'll be happy.

171
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,950
No.

172
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,740
Wen,

173
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,500
you're my friend.

174
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,710
Please, I'm begging you.

175
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,959
I have dozens of employees waiting

176
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,549
on their salaries.

177
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,100
To be honest,

178
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,509
I'm completely broke.

179
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,719
Wen.

180
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,980
think about it.

181
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,599
You begged me

182
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,839
to buy this bag for you.

183
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,879
You promised

184
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,909
you'd pay me back

185
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,350
as soon as you got the bag.

186
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,149
I can't afford to buy this bag.

187
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,119
You know that, right?
Wen, please.

188
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,550
I'm begging you.

189
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,670
Looks like you finally got
what you deserve, huh?

190
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,550
Wen!

191
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,230
Wen!

192
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,230
This is impossible.

193
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,710
I've seen this video before,

194
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,319
and this part wasn't there.

195
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,149
Of course, you wouldn't have seen it

196
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,070
because Du Wei deleted it.

197
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,509
Our tech team recovered
the missing footage.

198
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,070
So stop being a fool.

199
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,430
If you keep covering for him,

200
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,839
he'll throw you under the bus

201
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,430
the moment things go south.

202
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,260
That can't be.

203
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,830
There's one more thing.

204
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,749
Your husband's company
was facing a crisis

205
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,900
to the point he could no longer
keep it running anymore.

206
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,079
Over the past few months,
he was scrambling to borrow money,

207
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,959
just so he could pay
his employees one last time.

208
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,509
He even bought a large insurance policy

209
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,950
with you as the beneficiary.

210
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,909
Maybe he had his own plan,

211
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,020
But he never expected things

212
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,740
to end like this.

213
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,070
How could it be him?

214
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,310
Are you sure you want to watch it?

215
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,980
Yes.

216
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,599
This is all

217
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,900
I've got left.

218
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,500
Then I won't hold back.

219
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,860
You don't look well.

220
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,310
I really can't drink anymore.

221
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,230
Let me get you some water.

222
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,470
Okay, go and rest in the bedroom.

223
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,430
Who's there?

224
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,740
Who on earth is it?

225
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,620
Come on, be patient! I'm coming!

226
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,070
What are you doing?

227
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,199
Hey, who are you

228
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,900
and why are you filming me
with your phone?

229
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,230
How dare you sleep
with my girlfriend?

230
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,719
Who says I slept with her?

231
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,389
She's in your bed,
and you still deny it?

232
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,079
Listen, I can explain.

233
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,620
How are you going to explain this?

234
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,500
Hear me out!

235
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,070
I got it all on video.

236
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,230
Do you want me to call the cops

237
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,070
or pay up?

238
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,070
Pal.

239
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,470
Pal.

240
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,260
Pay me 300,000 yuan.

241
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,670
Not a cent less.

242
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,230
Pal,

243
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,260
I can only give you
100,000 yuan first.

244
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,140
I'll pay

245
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,719
the rest later. Okay?

246
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,190
No deal.

247
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,900
I want it now.

248
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,590
But...

249
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,430
But I don't have much now.

250
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,860
Then call your wife
and tell her to bring the money here.

251
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,230
Hao Mingxuan

252
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,230
Hao Mingxuan,
I can't believe you're this shameless.

253
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,740
What do you want to do now?

254
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,470
What else can I do?

255
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,350
Pay up then

256
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,350
But I don't have that much money.

257
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,950
Listen.

258
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,999
If you don't pay today,

259
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,830
you're not leaving.

260
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,079
I get it now.

261
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,470
You two planned this together.

262
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,100
Isn't that...

263
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,359
Then Yu...

264
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,430
Yes.

265
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,620
I spiked her drink.

266
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,430
Now, I have proof of your affair.

267
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,479
You either pay up
or leave without taking a cent.

268
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,860
You choose.

269
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,140
You... You...

270
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,740
I never thought
you two could be this despicable.

271
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,740
I'm calling the police!

272
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,230
That's how it happened.

273
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,149
Du Wei and that woman worked together.

274
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,719
Yes. Hao Mingxuan did bring
the alcohol from home.

275
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,260
But Gao Mengqi and Du Wei
had slipped sleeping pills into it.

276
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:39,100
Did they do it for money?

277
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,550
Well, not entirely.

278
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,920
Gao Mengqi originally hired Du Wei
to investigate her husband's affair.

279
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,389
But one thing led to another,
and they started having an affair.

280
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:54,860
Then Du Wei came up with this plan.

281
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,740
Did you know anything about this?

282
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,340
Gosh...

283
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,669
What took you so long?

284
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,909
- I'm starving.
- I thought we still had instant noodles.

285
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,340
- You could have taken a quick bite.
- You know I hate instant noodles.

286
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,230
You sure are picky. Here's your food.

287
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,149
Wow! Xiaolongbao and shaomai.

288
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,630
These are my favorites.

289
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,389
After running around for so many days,

290
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,559
I've realized something.

291
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,230
Working overtime voluntarily is worse
than being forced to work overtime.

292
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,110
How did it go today?

293
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,820
We checked everything we needed to.

294
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,389
I even went to Gongmen Gorge

295
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,629
and asked a senior

296
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,279
to pull Luo Yifei's records.

297
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,279
I went through

298
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,079
all her schooling,

299
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,229
tutoring,

300
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,820
and training programs.

301
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,710
There's not a single trace
of psychology-related studies.

302
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,340
Come here.

303
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,340
I want to show you something.

304
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,260
What is it?

305
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:16,279
Hermann, a renowned German psychologist,
specialized in hypnotherapy.

306
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,599
Carlos sent me

307
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,630
Hermann's research paper from 2016.

308
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,429
Carlos believes

309
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,519
the theories in this paper

310
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,230
closely resemble Luo Yifei's

311
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,110
psychological manipulation style.

312
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,989
I read it carefully.

313
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,559
Her manipulation methods

314
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,319
are almost identical
to the theories in this paper.

315
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,149
Could it be

316
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,879
that she read this paper and...

317
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,230
That's impossible.

318
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,430
Becoming a psychology expert
just by reading an article?

319
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,079
It takes years of training

320
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,949
and hands-on experience

321
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,430
to be a psychology expert.

322
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,389
I mean,

323
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,279
what if she studied under Hermann

324
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,189
after reading his work?

325
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,390
That's the problem.

326
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,870
Hermann passed away years ago.

327
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,189
Carlos also helped me look into it.

328
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,429
Hermann never

329
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,150
had a female student from China.

330
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,300
Let's eat first. We'll come back to this
after we're full.

331
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,870
All the leads are gone.

332
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,740
We're back to square one.

333
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,319
Can you tell me

334
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,390
what to do after this?

335
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,669
You left me

336
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,110
to deal with this mess.

337
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,629
Zhiyuan is getting engaged to Luo Yifei.

338
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,580
(Tomb of Ning Jing)
Should I tell him my suspicions?

339
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,709
He finally started a new life.

340
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,839
I'm worried...

341
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,110
Mochou.

342
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,340
Zhiyuan.

343
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,630
Mochou,

344
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,190
thank you.

345
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,670
But I'm leaving

346
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,340
with Yifei.

347
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,260
I don't know when I will return.

348
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,980
Maybe

349
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,989
I won't.

350
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,870
Hm.

351
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,820
Good.

352
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,500
Then I wish you

353
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,980
a happy engagement.

354
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,190
I'll get going first.

355
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,340
What's this?

356
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,150
Peace and safety.

357
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,500
Yes.

358
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,390
Just this?

359
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,149
Captain Ding,

360
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,190
- I'll send the details to your office.
- Okay.

361
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,740
Captain Ding!

362
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,150
Mochou already left for the day.

363
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,599
I know. I came to see you

364
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,150
so we can have a chat.

365
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,910
Me?

366
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,500
Chen Peng, you can go first.

367
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,759
There's a nice coffee house nearby.

368
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,430
Let me buy you a cup of coffee. Alright.

369
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:53,820
Okay.

370
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,820
Captain Ding,
you really remind me of my sister.

371
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,559
Mochou

372
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,190
has a temper
and can be careless sometimes.

373
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,149
My sister used to watch over her.

374
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,950
Now, I'm counting on you.

375
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,430
Thank you.

376
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,340
You're thanking me
for watching over Mochou?

377
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,980
What's your relation to this?

378
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,340
A family member, a friend,

379
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,910
or a brother.

380
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,980
Any would be fine, right?

381
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,150
Oh, I forgot.

382
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,189
I haven't congratulated you

383
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,500
for getting engaged.

384
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,230
Yes.

385
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,469
I ask to meet you here today

386
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,469
not just

387
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,670
to thank you for watching over Mochou.

388
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,039
It's also about my engagement.

389
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,469
I know Mochou well.

390
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,389
She's not someone
who gets emotional easily.

391
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,820
But she told me to hold off
on my engagement with Yifei.

392
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,230
Yesterday, I visited my sister's grave.

393
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,470
Mochou left the protective charm there.

394
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,630
Did something happen to her?

395
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,469
It's not convenient to say.

396
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,150
It's related to a case, isn't it?

397
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,780
Mr. Ning.

398
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,950
In all the time
you've spent with Luo Yifei,

399
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,780
do you think
she studied psychology before?

400
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,910
Psychology?

401
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,519
No, I don't think so.

402
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,669
She majored in finance

403
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,389
and later studied business management

404
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,580
in the UK.

405
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,740
This isn't about her, is it?

406
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,500
I was only asking.

407
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:38,759
But marriage

408
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,780
is a big decision.

409
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,540
You should be careful.

410
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,780
I understand.

411
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,949
We're not allowed
to accept meals from civilians.

412
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,340
You can drink this yourself.

413
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,060
I'll get going.

414
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,500
Goodbye. No need to see me out.

415
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,820
(Of all people,
why does it have to be Luo Yifei?)

416
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,390
(I haven't even gotten
to the bottom of it yet.)

417
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,950
(In all the time
you've spent with Luo Yifei,)

418
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,780
(do you think
she studied psychology before?)

419
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,500
Yifei.

420
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:12,570
(The Psychology of Love)

421
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,060
(In all the time
you've spent with Luo Yifei,)

422
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,020
(The Psychology of Love)
(Do you think she studied psychology before?)

423
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,110
What are you looking for?

424
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,980
You're home?

425
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,910
Why are you back so late?

426
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,020
Let me see that.

427
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,740
"The Psychology of Love."

428
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,110
You must be surprised

429
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,780
that I read books
not even kids believe in.

430
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,500
Are you drunk?

431
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,110
I'm not.

432
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,279
I was just waiting for you.

433
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,340
I kept waiting

434
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,989
until I got so bored

435
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,150
that I had just a tiny bit to drink.

436
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,260
Zhiyuan,

437
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,710
I missed you so much.

438
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,020
Silly,

439
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,820
I missed you too.

440
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,680
Didn't we just see each other
this morning?

441
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,150
You went to see her, didn't you?

442
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,110
What are you doing?

443
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,780
You went to see her, didn't you?

444
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,079
Did you go and see her?

445
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,279
What are you looking for?

446
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,980
Where's your protective charm.

447
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,599
Yifei.

448
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,989
I always thought

449
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,980
you wore it

450
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,340
because of your sister.

451
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,950
Or did you wear it because of her?

452
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,670
I'll get you some water, okay?

453
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,300
It's still from the last injury,
isn't it?

454
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,870
It's fine.

455
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,740
It doesn't hurt anymore.

456
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,430
I'll grab some medicine
and apply another layer.

457
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,710
Zhiyuan.

458
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,710
When I was little,

459
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,390
my family was really poor.

460
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,390
We were so poor
that pickled vegetables were a luxury.

461
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,150
So

462
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:00,110
I worked hard and studied
as much as I could.

463
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,670
I finally made it out.

464
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,340
After I graduated,

465
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,540
I threw myself into work
to earn as much as possible

466
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:15,669
because I believed only work and money

467
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:18,500
could give me security.

468
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,150
But after I met you,

469
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,390
I realized the world isn't like that.

470
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,870
My whole world lit up.

471
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,230
Do you remember when we first met?

472
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:45,340
The Tianxiang Group's
New Year's Eve party.

473
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,870
No.

474
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,110
It was three years ago.

475
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:56,260
- Three years ago, at the European...
- The business gala.

476
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,780
That's right.

477
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,020
I remember so many men
were bothering me that night.

478
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,500
Then you stepped in and got me out
by acting as my boyfriend.

479
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,950
I was really drunk that night.

480
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,559
But you didn't take advantage of me.

481
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,340
You just made sure
I got back to my room safely.

482
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,020
Do you remember?

483
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,470
Of course.

484
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,820
Can you tell me

485
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,580
if there were anything between you two?

486
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,879
Be honest with me.

487
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,910
Even if you tell me that both
of you used to be together,

488
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,020
I can accept it.

489
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,390
That's still better

490
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,910
than you not telling me anything.

491
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,150
We're about to get engaged.

492
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,540
Yifei,

493
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,910
Officer Li and I are just friends.

494
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,079
When my sister was still alive,

495
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,870
they were the best of partners.

496
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,300
So the three of us spent
a lot of time together.

497
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,149
I know it bothers you

498
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,300
whenever I mention her.

499
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,540
I'm sorry for that.

500
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,670
I didn't mean to hurt you.

501
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,980
Yifei,

502
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,500
But let's stop bringing up the past.

503
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,430
The moment I returned
that protective charm,

504
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,190
I already said goodbye to the past.

505
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,430
My life used to be all about my sister.

506
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,910
But from now on,

507
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,500
my life is all about you.

508
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,780
Really?

509
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,300
Yes.

510
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,230
I promise you.

511
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,820
I will never leave you.
