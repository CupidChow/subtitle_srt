=Lies Never Lie=

28
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,630
I told the correctional officers
what I wanted for my last meal.

29
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,230
So stop coming already.

30
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,440
Wang Pu,

31
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,280
you're a good father.

32
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,390
Lin Pengpeng

33
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,110
is your daughter.

34
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,280
What makes you think that?

35
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,230
Who said Lin Pengpeng is my daughter?

36
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,969
I may be a police officer.

37
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,999
But my main focus is psychology.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,809
Psychology helps us understand things

39
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,879
that don't seem to make sense
on the surface.

40
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,279
Like what had happened

41
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,630
between you, Liu Cheng, Guo Qian,
and Lin Pengpeng.

42
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,319
=Lies Never Lie=
=Episode 6=

43
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,510
This story goes back many years.

44
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,209
Back then, a young intern doctor
joined the boxing team.

45
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,510
Incredible!

46
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,390
Wow!

47
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,089
At the same time,
the team's rising star won

48
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,200
his first-ever medal.

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,719
1!

50
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,559
2!

51
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,760
3!

52
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,140
(China Combat King Tournament, Champion)

53
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,910
But soon,

54
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,390
Guo Qian's internship ended.

55
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,559
That rising star's life took
a turn for the worse

56
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,320
due to family troubles.

57
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,280
They never saw each other again.

58
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,950
Years later,

59
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,950
they met again.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,409
This time,
at Coach Liu Aihua's son's gym.

61
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,809
That scum worked for me
and was messing around

62
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,479
with a female member.

63
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,239
Her fiancé found out,

64
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,200
and he was a journalist
from the provincial station.

65
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,510
A top reporter?

66
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,239
Wait, you were a journalist?

67
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,009
Yeah, for a few years when I was young.

68
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,529
After I married Qian,

69
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,969
I left to start my business.

70
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,440
Qian

71
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,070
was only trying to help me

72
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,830
out of goodwill.

73
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,070
That night, we drank too much,

74
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,680
and things got out of hand.

75
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,969
Later, Qian told me

76
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,320
she was pregnant.

77
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,150
But because of her health,

78
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,590
she wouldn't be able
to have children again

79
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,630
if she had an abortion.

80
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,409
Who's Guo Qian's family?

81
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,159
I am, doctor.

82
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,150
- How is she?
- Both mother and daughter are safe.

83
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,039
Thank you, doctor.

84
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,209
Congratulations.

85
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,360
Thank you, doctor.

86
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,920
I'm not a good father.

87
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,240
I couldn't take care of Pengpeng.

88
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,120
So

89
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,320
I kept my distance to watch her

90
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,560
and tried not
to make Lin Shuai suspicious.

91
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,800
I watched Pengpeng grow up

92
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,920
little by little.

93
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,390
Do you know how happy that made me?

94
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,000
Mommy!

95
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,320
It was you that day, wasn't it?

96
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,800
I know it was you.

97
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,950
Wang Pu,

98
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,680
I understand
that you want to see Pengpeng.

99
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,880
I want that too.

100
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,590
But I can't.

101
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,920
Why not?

102
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,950
Because there's something wrong with her.

103
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,440
What's wrong?

104
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,510
She has polio.

105
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,680
It's my fault.

106
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,760
It's all my fault.

107
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,119
Does it matter now whose fault it is?

108
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,239
We're doing fine.

109
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,039
Pengpeng's father loves her very much.

110
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,359
I don't want anyone disturbing her life.

111
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,630
And her father...

112
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,070
- It's all my fault.
- Her father is rich.

113
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,320
He can give her the best life possible.

114
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,800
It's my fault.

115
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,329
I don't want my daughter to suffer

116
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,710
because of me or you.

117
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,070
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,590
Please never show up again.

119
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,750
After that, Guo Qian and I lost touch.

120
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,320
Then how did you find out
what happened to Lin Pengpeng?

121
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,289
Guo Qian bought a nanny cam

122
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,320
to keep an eye on the babysitter.

123
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:54,160
But instead, she saw Liu Cheng sending
the babysitter away, and then...

124
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,080
He did something to Pengpeng...

125
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,950
Pengpeng!

126
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,750
Let go of her, you animal!

127
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,350
Get out!

128
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,209
I thought you said
you stopped contacting each other.

129
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,870
I never changed my phone number.

130
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,169
Just in case...

131
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:18,969
Just in case

132
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,070
they ever needed me.

133
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,929
But I never expected
it to be something like this.

134
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,990
I don't have much.

135
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,070
Just these hands.

136
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,990
So

137
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,520
I killed Liu Cheng.

138
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,929
Wang Pu, do you know

139
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,209
that for this reason,

140
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,870
you might not get the death penalty?

141
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,209
No.

142
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,680
Officer Li,

143
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,519
please don't tell anyone.

144
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,350
You can't let this get out.

145
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,879
Just let me die.

146
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,569
Please just let me die.

147
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,289
You don't know.

148
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,399
You really don't know.

149
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,759
If Lin Shuai finds out,

150
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,070
he'll leave Pengpeng and her mother.

151
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,990
Then Pengpeng will suffer.

152
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:10,719
She...

153
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,169
She won't be able to survive.

154
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,719
I'm nothing but a useless father!

155
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,849
Wang Pu, calm down.

156
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,070
I am calm.

157
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,320
I'm really calm.

158
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,599
Officer Zhao, please.

159
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,400
I am begging you.

160
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,070
My life doesn't matter

161
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,110
as long as Pengpeng is happy.

162
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,849
Lin Shuai cannot know the truth
about Pengpeng's birth.

163
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,769
(Countdown to Wang Pu's execution:
4 hours and 23 minutes)

164
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:35,950
I'm sorry, Master.

165
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,520
I brought you trouble again.

166
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,230
What trouble?

167
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,470
You mean the retrial?

168
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,639
Yeah, I was only thinking
about reopening the case.

169
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,680
I didn't think it would affect others.

170
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,230
Mochou,

171
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,320
where do you think a case truly ends?

172
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,470
When we find the truth.

173
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,800
But the truth doesn't reveal
itself completely.

174
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,119
A case truly ends

175
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,320
when

176
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,209
there's no doubt left,

177
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,110
not even the slightest.

178
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,920
That's why

179
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,119
we search so hard,

180
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,200
even following every tiny clue.

181
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,160
But besides the truth,

182
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,590
there are also feelings.

183
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,320
Feelings?

184
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,870
We work so hard to find the truth

185
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,870
so we can protect the victims.

186
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,920
They've already suffered.

187
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,070
We need to think about them.

188
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,200
Of course,

189
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,110
not just the victims.

190
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,950
That includes the suspects too.

191
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,680
If we put in more effort,

192
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,169
we can prevent them

193
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,640
and their families
from being hurt even more.

194
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,680
Isn't that worth it?

195
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,320
Okay.

196
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,160
Master.

197
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,849
What is it?

198
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,400
Do you think if we find Guo Qian

199
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,560
and get that surveillance footage,

200
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,800
along with Pengpeng's paternity test,

201
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,920
we can overturn Wang Pu's case?

202
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,560
Yes.

203
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,359
That's great.

204
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,280
That means Wang Pu won't have to die.

205
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,169
Tiaotiao,

206
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,569
let's go find Chief Ou.

207
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,710
Huh?

208
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,719
Sorry to bother you
while you're eating, Captain Ding.

209
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,280
What's up?

210
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,520
We have new developments
in Wang Pu's case.

211
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:44,990
Pengpeng!

212
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,849
Let go of her!

213
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,350
You animal!

214
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,719
He's a monster!

215
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,119
He... He's a monster!

216
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,870
He's a monster!

217
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,560
A monster!

218
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,750
I see.

219
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:06,479
So

220
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,110
if we reveal the truth,

221
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,110
we can save Wang Pu.

222
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,920
But then Pengpeng's real identity
will be exposed.

223
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,849
If we want to keep that a secret,

224
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,800
Wang Pu will still face
the death penalty.

225
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,750
Yes.

226
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,350
You're hesitating?

227
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,990
Our job is to handle the case.

228
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,230
The family's decisions are up to them.

229
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,569
Whether Lin Shuai finds out the truth

230
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,119
is Guo Qian's decision,

231
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,520
not ours.

232
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,710
But since Pengpeng is a victim
and her identity is sensitive,

233
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,920
we can apply for privacy protection.

234
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,560
The best we can do is make sure
they don't suffer any more harm.

235
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,359
We work so hard to find the truth

236
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,200
so we can protect the victims.

237
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,160
They've already suffered.

238
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,289
We need to think about them.

239
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,440
Of course,

240
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,320
not just the victims.

241
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,280
That includes the suspects too.

242
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,870
If we put in more effort,

243
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,359
we can prevent them

244
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,710
and their families
from being hurt even more.

245
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,320
That's exactly what I was thinking.

246
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,280
So I already told Tiaotiao to apply
for privacy protection.

247
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,710
Then why are you still hesitating?
Hurry up and find Guo Qian.

248
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:24,520
Okay.

249
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,990
Wait.

250
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,519
If you already applied
for privacy protection,

251
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,870
that means you've made up your mind.

252
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,800
So, why are you still asking me?

253
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,590
Why go to Chief Ou this late?

254
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,689
Oh, I get it.

255
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,519
Master, you're worried
that Ms. Wei might not agree.

256
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,359
So you want Chief Ou to step in.

257
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,449
You're very thorough

258
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,230
as expected.

259
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,040
Do you really think
Ms. Wei is that kind of person?

260
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,879
This is about overturning your case.

261
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,400
I need to make sure
you get a proper answer.

262
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,920
Besides,

263
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,209
from a psychological standpoint,

264
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,639
sharing emotions

265
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,569
and keeping a secret together

266
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,590
helps build trust, brings people closer,

267
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,040
and makes them friends.

268
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,320
All the surveillance footage is here.

269
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,750
Are you sure
you want to give this to me?

270
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,110
Lin Shuai said you've been to my house.

271
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,680
I'm guessing
you already know everything.

272
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,400
How about telling us about it yourself?

273
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,160
I met Liu Cheng through work.

274
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,830
I had no idea he was such a monster.

275
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,920
He used his job to get close
to people with disabilities

276
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,750
and took advantage of them
to satisfy his sick desires.

277
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,710
One day,

278
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,160
Wang Pu secretly came to see me.

279
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,160
Liu Cheng saw him.

280
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,990
I have no idea how he found out.

281
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,320
Officer,

282
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,089
I was completely helpless.

283
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,830
Liu Cheng threatened me.

284
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,750
So you went along with him?

285
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,440
What else could I do?

286
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,920
If it was just me, I could take it.

287
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,160
But my daughter...

288
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,169
If she were healthy,

289
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,040
at worst, we could've struggled

290
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,520
through life together.

291
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,070
But this is fate.

292
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,089
If Liu Cheng told Lin the truth,

293
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,590
Pengpeng and I...

294
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,169
I mean Pengpeng.

295
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,830
It would be over for her.

296
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,920
Lin cannot find out about this.

297
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,360
So then you went to Wang Pu?

298
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,310
I had no other choice.

299
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,710
I could endure Liu Cheng's threats.

300
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,790
But he hurt Pengpeng...

301
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,640
Officers,

302
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,230
you're women too.

303
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,679
Please, have mercy on my child.

304
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,289
I'm begging you.

305
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,009
- Get up.
- Please keep this a secret.

306
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,360
Please, I'm begging you.

307
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,750
This involves personal privacy.

308
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,080
So we can apply for confidentiality.

309
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,249
But we are police officers,

310
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,120
So we have to follow procedures.

311
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,639
Outside of our investigation,

312
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,640
we won't say anything to your husband.

313
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,270
I understand.

314
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,990
I will find ways not
to cause trouble for you.

315
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,680
So if we hadn't uncovered the truth,

316
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,790
you would've just stood by
and watched Wang Pu die?

317
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,440
I never thought
he would actually kill someone.

318
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,310
If I had known he'd be this impulsive,
I never would have told him.

319
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,360
Can I ask you something?

320
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,030
Do you really know Wang Pu?

321
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,439
He knows that telling
the truth could save his life.

322
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,809
He knows I'm trying to help him.

323
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,119
But he refuses to cooperate.

324
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,270
He begged me, more than once,
to give up on him.

325
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,639
When I finally uncovered the truth,

326
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,840
he begged me

327
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,680
to let him die.

328
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,809
He lost his mother at a young age
and was raised by his father.

329
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,679
During his fame,

330
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,400
the biggest blow in his life
was when his father passed away.

331
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,809
The only time I ever saw him
let his guard down

332
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,439
was when Coach Liu,
whom he saw as a father figure,

333
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,950
still trusted him.

334
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,600
To him,

335
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:03,030
the word "father" is sacred.

336
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,270
He knew what happened to Pengpeng.

337
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,920
He simply did what a father should do.

338
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,160
Even just two hours ago,

339
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,009
he was willing to die

340
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,529
rather than let anyone find out

341
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,510
he was Pengpeng's biological father.

342
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,990
He shouldn't have killed someone.

343
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,440
But he did it for Pengpeng

344
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,470
and for you.

345
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:34,120
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

346
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,470
My last meal.

347
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,270
Eat up.

348
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,840
After this, a vehicle will take
you back to Chengxi Prison.

349
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,950
- Back to prison?
- Yes.

350
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,920
But I am supposed
to be executed in the morning.

351
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,710
We just got word from the higher-ups.

352
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,750
Your case is being reopened.

353
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,440
A retrial?

354
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,359
I don't want a retrial. I...

355
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,049
Calm down. Ms. Li Mochou
from the Criminal Investigation Team

356
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,600
asked me to pass on a message.

357
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,790
Your case involves
sensitive information.

358
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,160
So it will be held privately.

359
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,120
Enjoy your meal.

360
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,120
This isn't your last meal.

361
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,710
A closed trial?

362
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,089
(Countdown to Wang Pu's execution:
19 hours and 35 minutes)

363
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,169
(Countdown to Wang Pu's execution:
19 hours and 34 minutes)

364
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,169
(Countdown to Wang Pu's execution:
19 hours and 33 minutes)

365
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,249
(Countdown to Wang Pu's execution:
19 hours and 32 minutes)

366
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,169
(Countdown to Wang Pu's execution:
19 hours and 31 minutes)

367
00:20:59,170 --> 00:20:59,829
(Countdown to Wang Pu's execution:
19 hours and 30 minutes)

368
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:10,540
(Countdown to Wang Pu's execution:
19 hours and 29 minutes)

369
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,399
Your psychology skills
are pretty useful.

370
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,049
I'm only here to assist.

371
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,800
We still need the detectives
to solve cases.

372
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,990
Captain Ding, thank you.

373
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,400
I'm only doing my job as a cop.

374
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,920
Same as you.

375
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,440
Hey, let me buy you breakfast.

376
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,300
We were up all night, and I'm exhausted.
I'm going home to get some sleep.

377
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,030
- I'm coming too.
- Get in.

378
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,249
Liu, what's the update?

379
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,470
Any news?

380
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,230
We found a cigarette butt
near the crime scene.

381
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,359
The DNA analysis matches

382
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,120
the one you suspected, Qian Pengfei.

383
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,919
Good work.

384
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,009
Anything else?

385
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,750
- That's it.
- That's all?

386
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,230
This is a single piece of evidence.
It's not enough to prove anything.

387
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,950
Do you think I want that?

388
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,030
This is all you gave me.

389
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,080
What? Do you want me
to dig up more at the crime scene?

390
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,199
Liu,

391
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,049
when those girls come over,

392
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,120
you give them a bunch of evidence.

393
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,040
When it comes to me, you hand over
a single cigarette butt to brush me over?

394
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,360
Do you call yourself a friend?

395
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,249
What do you want me to do?

396
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,160
Should I just magically make
more evidence for you?

397
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,569
Fine, promise me
when I come for evidence next time,

398
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,080
you better put me first in line.

399
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,750
Depends on the case.

400
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,030
Chaoshan Casserole Congee tonight?

401
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,310
First, who's paying?

402
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,399
Come on, we're friends.
Does it even matter who's paying?

403
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,680
Whoever pays, it's still a meal.

404
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,310
Ouch!

405
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,159
Ms. Wei, here's the background
on Song Chaoran and Qian Pengfei.

406
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,920
Our investigation found
nothing particularly special between them.

407
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,809
The only connection is they both grew up
in single-parent households.

408
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,160
Song Chaoran took good care
of Qian Pengfei.

409
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,679
He owns two companies

410
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,120
and even gave Qian Pengfei shares.

411
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,529
That's right.

412
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,769
A lot of Song Chaoran's
classmates know Qian Pengfei.

413
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,959
But based on our findings,

414
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,599
most say he's not a good person

415
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,159
and see him as a burden to Song Chaoran.

416
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,200
But Song Chaoran doesn't seem
to care at all.

417
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,160
It's almost like...

418
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,640
What's on your mind?

419
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:43,990
Like true love.

420
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,950
You young people
and your wild imaginations.

421
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,440
Song Chaoran applied
for a civil service job

422
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,439
but failed?

423
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,199
Yes,

424
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,920
because his father had
a criminal record.

425
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,270
His father?

426
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:03,000
Song Jianjun was convicted of manslaughter
in 1996 and sentenced to seven years.

427
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,680
He died of illness in 2015.

428
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,470
Ms. Wei, look who he killed.

429
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,289
Qian Guoyu.

430
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,030
Qian Guoyu is...

431
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,879
Qian Pengfei's father?

432
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,030
I read it.

433
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,329
That's right.

434
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:20,180
(Serve the People)

435
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,710
Ms. Li,

436
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,249
come with me for an interrogation.

437
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,510
I'll explain on the way.

438
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,149
All right, get in.

439
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:35,049
You two stay here
and keep digging for more leads.

440
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,200
Huh?

441
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,439
What? Anran,

442
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,089
what's going on?

443
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,950
She's leaving us behind now?

444
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,790
What are you doing?

445
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,400
Chaoran,

446
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,119
I'm sorry.

447
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,440
I let you down.

448
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,550
This has nothing to do with you.

449
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,710
It was just an accident.

450
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,160
It wasn't an accident.

451
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,950
I was behind it.

452
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,440
Chaoran...

453
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,950
Why did you do it?

454
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,399
Chaoran.

455
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,080
Chaoran, I had another dream.

456
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,950
I saw Dad.

457
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:30,679
He...

458
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,400
He looked so miserable.

459
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,160
It hurt me so much inside.

460
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,950
I... I wasn't thinking straight.

461
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,119
I just wanted to find someone...

462
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,080
Find someone to teach you a lesson.

463
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,990
I didn't know they'd go that far.

464
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,710
I'm sorry.

465
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,360
Chaoran,

466
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,270
can you forgive me?

467
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,360
who else knows about this?

468
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,080
No one.

469
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,200
I didn't tell anyone about this.

470
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,710
Then just let it go.

471
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:21,260
(Inpatient)

472
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,919
Mr. Song, we already have
a good understanding

473
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,849
of your relationship with Qian Pengfei.

474
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,769
Maybe because of your father,

475
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,359
you feel guilty

476
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,600
and want to protect him.

477
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:34,569
But you need to understand
what Qian Pengfei did

478
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,120
not only hurt you

479
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,199
but also broke the law.

480
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,470
I hope you'll cooperate with us.

481
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,270
Captain Ding,

482
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,030
I'm willing to cooperate.

483
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,160
But first,

484
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,400
I honestly don't remember anything from the three days leading up to the crime.

485
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,270
Secondly,

486
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,640
I told Pengfei

487
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,680
to take that 100,000 yuan.

488
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,790
Otherwise,

489
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,990
how would he have known
the safe's password?

490
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,640
I think you're wrong about him.

491
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,680
Even without your testimony,

492
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,310
we'll still find the evidence.

493
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:23,489
If you're lying,
you could be charged with perjury.

494
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,270
Think carefully.

495
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,200
I am willing to help.

496
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,880
But if I make things up,

497
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,270
wouldn't that be perjury?

498
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,439
Judging by Song Chaoran's reaction,

499
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,089
getting him to testify
against Qian Pengfei

500
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,470
is nearly impossible.

501
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,550
If you don't have a better idea,
then stop being dismissive.

502
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,470
Hello, Tiaotiao.

503
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,729
Okay.

504
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,200
We'll be right back.

505
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,769
We have new leads.

506
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:23,439
Let's put aside
the physical evidence for a moment.

507
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,119
From a psychological perspective,

508
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,529
can you share

509
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:29,270
what you think
was Qian Pengfei's motive?

510
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,440
Revenge.

511
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,809
Revenge?

512
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:35,489
The grudge between them
has existed for years.

513
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,729
Why choose now to act?

514
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:40,119
Something must have triggered him.

515
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,120
Tiaotiao.

516
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:41,959
That's right.

517
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,960
Based on my investigation,

518
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,809
aside from Song Chaoran
getting attacked, the biggest incident

519
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,089
in Qian Pengfei's life
in the past three months

520
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,470
was his breakup.

521
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,729
Pan Xin, a social media influencer.

522
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,729
Two years ago, she was a product model
for Song Chaoran's company,

523
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,470
which is how she met Qian Pengfei.

524
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,639
During their relationship,

525
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,809
Qian Pengfei repeatedly posted online

526
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,790
about wanting to marry her.

527
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,199
But two weeks ago,

528
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,679
Pan Xin broke up with him.

529
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,880
He got completely wasted over it.

530
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,270
What does that have to do
with Song Chaoran?

531
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:15,679
Didn't Song Chaoran and Yang Qing
get engaged two weeks ago?

532
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,919
So, you think

533
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,199
there's a connection?

534
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,599
Why guess when we can just ask?

535
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,679
I checked.

536
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,639
Pan Xin is overseas for a shoot.

537
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,080
She won't be back until next week.

538
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:27,400
It's okay. We can ask someone else.

539
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,270
Do you know this person?

540
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,529
We found out he dated
Qian Pengfei for two years.

541
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,950
Do you know about this?

542
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:42,159
I thought they broke up
three months ago.

543
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,639
How did you know they broke up
three months ago?

544
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,200
And coincidentally, that was also
when you got engaged to Song Chaoran.

545
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,400
We're friends.

546
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,089
Chaoran and I

547
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,959
have always been busy with work.

548
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,200
We never really thought
about getting married.

549
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,919
But three months ago,

550
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,880
he suddenly wanted to get engaged.

551
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,679
Since we've been dating
for so many years...

552
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,030
So this really does have something
to do with Pan Xin.

553
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,310
Honestly, I didn't know at first.

554
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,199
But one time, Pan Xin called Chaoran,

555
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,849
and I overheard their conversation.

556
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,600
That's when he finally admitted it.

557
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:32,550
He said Pan Xin
wouldn't leave him alone.

558
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,790
So, was there actually something
between them?

559
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,809
It was all one-sided.

560
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:38,849
Who?

561
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,360
Pan Xin.

562
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,640
Are you still mad at me?

563
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,230
Actually...

564
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,030
I've already changed my room,

565
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,849
and you're still not giving up.

566
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,990
Chaoran,

567
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,049
these officers

568
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,919
have a few things they want
to talk to you about.

569
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,359
I want to hear it too.

570
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,160
I have nothing to say.

571
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,440
Chaoran, I think you should listen.

572
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,440
Fine.

573
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:13,849
What is it?

574
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,199
Mr. Song, we found a cigarette butt
at the scene

575
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,880
where you were attacked.

576
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,360
The DNA matches Qian Pengfei.

577
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:22,879
That means

578
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,049
there's a high chance

579
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,680
he was there when you were beaten up.

580
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,399
We also found an iron rod

581
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,009
in the trunk of his car.

582
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,329
The size matches

583
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:38,950
the weapon used in the attack.

584
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,009
I don't know what you're talking about.

585
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,049
From what I see,

586
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,009
Qian Pengfei carefully planned this.

587
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,990
He instigated Ma Bo's brother, Ma Da,
who already had a conflict with you,

588
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,729
into attacking you.

589
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,329
He followed him to the scene

590
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,879
and even had a weapon identical

591
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,089
to the one used in the assault.

592
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:54,809
If

593
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:57,489
Ma Da had just left you

594
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,849
after knocking you unconscious

595
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,529
instead of moving you,

596
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:04,009
Qian Pengfei could have stepped in
with his own weapon.

597
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,919
From a criminal investigation
point of view,

598
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,880
this was a setup for a murder framed
as a revenge attack.

599
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:24,578
That's impossible.
