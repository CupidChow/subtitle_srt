33

Did you really think
I would leave you behind?

34
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,840

Hey, Ms. Li.

78
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,360
What a coincidence.

79
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,190
Yeah...

80
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:49,990
What a coincidence.

81
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,600
Since you're here,

82
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,750
why not come in?

83
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,240
It's fine.

84
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,270

85
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,120

00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,630
Yeah, it sure is breezy.

Good thing there's wind here.

88
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,870
Enjoy your food.

89
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,630
Sure.

00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,720

00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,430
Li Mochou,

92
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,560
you did this again?

93
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,040
You don't belong in the kitchen.

94
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,950
Coming.

95
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,240
Zhiyuan?

96
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,120
How did you know where I live?

97
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,830
Captain Ding told me.

98
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,040
Oh, right...

99
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,480
This is her house.

100
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,510
Come in.

101
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,430
I didn't know you were coming.

102
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,510
So all I have is some noodles.

103
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,680
How about noodles for dinner?

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,560
Sure.

105
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,480
Okay.

106
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,310
Huh?

107
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,390
You can cook now?

108
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,630
What's wrong with you?

109
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,800
Come on, this is good.

110
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,680
It's edible.

111
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,480
Move aside.

112
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Ning Jing, I'm sorry.
I won't do it again.

113
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,310
Just save it.

114
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,560
- I won't cook anymore.
- Stop.

115
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,750
I should stick a "No Entry" sign

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,310
just for you.

117
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,680
Stop backing her up.

118
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,480
All of you, out.

119
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,000
It's convenient when living alone.

120
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,920
I came to see Mochou.

121
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,830
I know she's back.

122
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,720
Is she inside?

123
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,480
Zhiyuan, listen.

124
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,950
She's not here.
She went on another assignment.

125
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,950
Also,

126
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,750
could you pass this to her?

127
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,240
Okay.

128
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,600
I promised

129
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,510
to get her a birthday gift every year.

130
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,070
Here you go.

131
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,480
Try it.

132
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,430
Mm.

133
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,270
Good.

134
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,680
I watched the video.

135
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Why didn't you tell me?

136
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
There was nothing to say.

137
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,000
Well, I survived, didn't I?

138
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,630
Why did you come here?

139
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,870
I know

140
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,080
you've rejected Zhiyuan many times.

141
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,270
Then can you help me persuade
Ning Zhiyuan?

142
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,390
Tell him

143
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,510
that Li Mochou is a coward
and a hypocrite.

144
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,840
She's afraid to face herself.

145
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,150
If his heart only has room for one girl,

146
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,270
it's definitely you.

147
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,270
As his sister,

148
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,670
I have to give way.

149
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,240
Captain Ding.

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,890
Did we have a visitor?

151
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:02,910
Yes.

152
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,440
A former colleague's brother
happened to be in Baizhou.

153
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,440
He stopped by to say hi.

154
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,360
Luo Yifei's boyfriend, right?

155
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,270
Did you know Meng Zhengyi before?

156
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,480
Meng Zhengyi?

157
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,360
Why bring him up all of a sudden?

158
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,150
I only met him once
when he came to the station

159
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,120
to deliver that banner.

160
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,840
I was just asking.

161
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,600
Didn't you say he knows psychology?

162
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,320
That was just my assumption.

163
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,150
But in investigations,

164
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,390
it all comes down to evidence.

165
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,150
As for evidence,

166
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,490
we have to count on you for that.

167
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,910
Flattering me, huh?

168
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,510
I'm under someone else's roof now.

169
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,080
I have to read the room.

170
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,000
Oh, right.

171
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,550
Do you want some noodles?

172
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,750
I just made some.

173
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,360
I'll slice some fresh cucumbers

174
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,840
and offer you some garlic.

What you're seeing right now

191
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,240
shows his inner thoughts.

192
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,960
The sense of order here,

193
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,080
his desire for control,

194
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,550
and even the way
he writes the character...

195
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,480
Zeng Xiang isn't the real killer.

196
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,840
What do you mean?

197
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,240
I found random self-inflicted

198
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,150
wounds on Zeng Xiang's body.

199
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,120
But the person
who staged Ning Jing's murder scene

200
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,510
was meticulous and calm.

201
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,390
He also has
a severe obsession with order.

202
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,240
The mastermind behind him

203
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,320
is the real killer.

204
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,420
(Zeng Xiang's birthplace)

205
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,200
Chief Jia,

206
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,720
I want to request a transfer.

207
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,840
Tiaotiao.

208
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,440
Master,

209
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,910
how did you know I was hungry?

210
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,630
Is this another psychological analysis?

211
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,870
Your stomach was growling.

212
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,000
Do I really need analysis?

213
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,720
Well, I skipped breakfast.

214
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,320
Huh?

215
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,150
You skipped breakfast?

216
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:57,960
Yeah.

217
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,320
Are you sure you skipped breakfast?

218
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,670
Ms. Li,

219
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,550
do you know
how much she ate this morning?

220
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,790
Three eggs, a bowl of congee,

221
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,790
and half my youtiao.

222
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,600
That's not breakfast?

223
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:09,750
Jeez.

224
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,670
Are you trying to show off
your good memory?

225
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,200
I'm still growing, okay?

226
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,440
It's not about my memory.

227
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,200
You should learn from Qiao Anran.

228
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,790
Train a little and practice some Sanda.

229
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,720
Look how quick and agile she is.

230
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,080
But you?

231
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:21,840
Girl,

232
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,080
you dodge faster than the criminals
during arrests.

233
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,030
You were still away when it's done.

234
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,910
Come on, how can you
compare me to Anran?

235
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,870
I'm struggling to stay above failure
most of the time.

236
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,840
My focus...

237
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,270
My focus is on brainpower

238
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,480
and mental development.

239
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,120
Well, that brainpower isn't showing.

240
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,200
What's all the noise about?

241
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,030
We're at work.

242
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,720
Anran, want some chips?

243
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,030
Don't mess around

244
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,080
during work hours.

245
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,360
You're so skinny.

246
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,910
How about I treat you a good dinner?

247
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,000
Count me in too.

248
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,840
In your dreams.

249
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,750
Only her.

250
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,440
Captain Ding,

251
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,150
do you have time?

252
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,630
Let's have a talk.

253
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,670
You want to check Baizhou's
past case files?

254
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,870
Yes.

255
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,840
Since I have time,

256
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,440
I figured I'd study
how Team B handles investigations.

257
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,720
If you have issues with my methods,

258
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,240
feel free to report to Chief Ou.

259
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,240
Oh, not at all.

260
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,550
I only want

261
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,440
to work better with the team.

262
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,720
All right.

263
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,910
I'll have Tiaotiao assist you.

264
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,670
Thank you.

265
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,910
Ms. Li,

266
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,200
these are written case files

267
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,440
of major criminal cases

268
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,200
our bureau has solved in recent years.

269
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,960
We're still copying the video evidence.

270
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,080
In the past three years,

271
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,200
our bureau closed 2,352 criminal cases,

272
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,750
including 337 major cases.

273
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,480
Thank you.

274
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,720
Can you sort them by case type?

275
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,910
Sure.

276
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,510
Yes, I admit it.

277
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,670
I killed him.

278
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,840
Everyone saw it.

279
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,960
I did it with my fists.

280
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,600
I used to be a boxer.

281
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,240
Killing an ordinary person
with my bare hands isn't hard.

282
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,120
Why did I kill him?

283
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,440
Why?

284
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,880
Because he kept staring at me.

285
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,310
I didn't like the way he looked at me.

286
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,240
Yeah.

287
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,590
I don't like him.

288
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,030
Who handled this case?

289
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,880
It was Ms. Wei.

290
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,200
Death sentence.

291
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,590
The killer didn't appeal.

292
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,480
The Supreme Court approved
three days ago.

293
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,880
Will be executed in two days.

294
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,030
The day after tomorrow?

295
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,680
Yeah, at 5 AM.

296
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,790
That's less than 40 hours.

297
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,510
Where's Captain Ding?

298
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,750
They should be out having food.

299
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,620
(Countdown to Wang Pu's execution:
39 hours and 28 minutes)

300
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,400
Captain Ding,

301
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,790
I need to talk to you about a case.

302
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,030
Urgent?

303
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,640
If not, we can discuss it after we eat.

304
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,030
A matter of one's life.

305
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,240
Ms. Li, then all the more reason
to sit down and talk.

306
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,790
Sit down.

307
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,110
Bring an extra set of utensils.

308
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,200
Take a seat.

309
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,310
Three months ago,

310
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,920
Wang Pu beat Liu Cheng
to death in public.

311
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,830
Do you still remember?

312
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,400
Yeah, I remember.

313
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,110
The killer, Wang Pu,
was a retired boxer.

314
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,920
Yeah, that's right.

315
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,510
The victim, Liu Cheng,

316
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,750
was a counselor at a psychology clinic.

317
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,720
It happened on Guang'an Road,
in a pedestrian street.

318
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,070
Wang Pu beat Liu Cheng to death
in front of a crowd.

319
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,640
There were witnesses and solid evidence.

320
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,030
He also confessed.

321
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:39,920
So, what's the issue?

322
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,920
I think Wang Pu lied

323
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,720
about his motive.

324
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,960
And I believe he knew Liu Cheng
before the murder.

325
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,310
Captain,

326
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,160
you're a veteran detective.

327
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,830
You know

328
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,030
a killer's motive

329
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,000
can affect sentencing.

330
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,480
Whether it's motiveless or not

331
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,070
may determine his life or death.

332
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,310
Some things can't just be brushed over.

333
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,200
Brushed over?

334
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,200
Wait, Ms. Li.

335
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,240
Let me just say this.

336
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,830
Captain Ding and I handled

337
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,510
Wang Pu's case together.

338
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,310
There was no connection

339
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,720
between Wang Pu and Liu Cheng.

340
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
We checked Wang Pu's phone records too.

341
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,830
Before the day of the murder,

342
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,310
the two had never even met.

343
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,790
Did you run a psychiatric evaluation
on him?

344
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,440
Yes.

345
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,000
No issues.

346
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,680
No issues?
Now, that's the biggest issue.

347
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,200
Why would a sane man

348
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,510
suddenly beat someone to death?

349
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,680
Oh, heavens!

350
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,000
Just because he passed the evaluation

351
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,880
doesn't mean he had control
over his emotions.

352
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,070
He has a history of aggression

353
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,070
and violent tendencies.

354
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,610
You've seen his record.

355
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,480
How many times
has he been involved in fights?

356
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,160
Yeah.

357
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,830
Wang Pu worked

358
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,270
as a security guard before.

359
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,070
He got fired

360
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,960
after he beat up a resident.

361
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,750
So that's it?

362
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,830
Then you closed the case?

363
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,070
Ms. Li,

364
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,610
you suspect Wang Pu lied
about his motive

365
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,270
and the truth could change
his sentence.

366
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,070
Fine. No problem.

367
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,000
Bring me solid evidence,

368
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,830
I'll overturn it.

369
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,000
But until then,

370
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,110
please respect our professionalism.

371
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,310
Don't use your expertise

372
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,680
to stir up drama.

373
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,830
And just so you know,

374
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,200
Yue and I spent

375
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,440
five days comparing
eight years' worth of phone records

376
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,800
just to confirm
they had no prior contact.

377
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,590
Do you have any idea
how much work that was?

378
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,070
Yes.

379
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,400
I just feel like this case...

380
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:54,960
Okay.

381
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,680
Got it.

382
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,480
On my way.

383
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,240
We have a new case.

384
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,280
Need to head to the scene.

385
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,030
Ms. Li,

386
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,070
in our line of work,

387
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,550
you can't just make assumptions.

388
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,750
If you want to solve or reopen a case,

389
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,030
bring the evidence.

390
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:06,880
Yue, let's go.

391
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,160
Okay.

392
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,830
Ms. Li, about Wang Pu's case...

393
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,270
- Yue!
- Coming!

394
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,400
Oh, jeez.

395
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,110
Is this necessary?

396
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,510
Chief Ou,

397
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,960
I only want to see Wang Pu.

398
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,790
He's scheduled for execution
in less than two days.

399
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,030
Without concrete evidence,

400
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,030
meeting him now could

401
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,030
give him false hope...

402
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:24,830
Chief Ou,

403
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,640
it's our duty as police officers

404
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,720
to ensure there are no doubts
in any case.

405
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,110
This case is crystal clear.

406
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,270
Wang Pu confessed at the first trial

407
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,310
and didn't appeal,

408
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,000
right?

409
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,510
So there's no room for debate.

410
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,880
You just joined us.

411
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,200
If you challenge a closed case,

412
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,610
it'll bring you no good.

413
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,350
Mochou,

414
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,350
this is a death penalty.

415
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,110
We, the Procuratorate,

416
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,000
and the courts

417
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,640
all examined it thoroughly

418
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,350
before reaching this decision.

419
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,680
Chief Ou, I'm not denying
that Wang Pu committed murder.

420
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,030
But his motive

421
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,750
is still questionable.

422
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,790
No one would willingly choose death, right?

423
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,350
That's why I need to investigate.

424
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,110
Fine.

425
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,790
I've said my piece.

426
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,240
If you're sure about this,

427
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,510
I'll support you if you stay
within the rules.

428
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,640
Thank you, Chief Ou.

429
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,960
Oh, about Ding Wei...

430
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,310
Don't worry about Ding Wei.

431
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,240
When are you calling
the detention center?

432
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,030
I'll call them right now.

433
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,270
I don't even know
if I want you to find something

434
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,590
or find nothing at all.

435
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,830
Chief Ou,

436
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,640
the truth doesn't change
based on what we want.

437
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,680
Thank you, Chief Ou.

438
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,790
I'll get back to work.

439
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,920
Go.

440
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,060
(Countdown to Wang Pu's execution:
37 hours and 46 minutes)

441
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,480
Please make way.

442
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,590
- Captain.
- Captain.

443
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,310
Where's the body?

444
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,110
Captain Ding.

445
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,680
It was a false alarm.

446
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,160
What do you mean?

447
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,400
We got a report saying

448
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,480
there was a dead body here.

449
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,720
But when we arrived,

450
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,030
the person was still breathing.

451
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,310
We had him rushed to the hospital.

452
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,750
What was his condition
when you found him?

453
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,720
Severely injured

454
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,790
and covered in blood.

455
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,110
It looked like he was beaten up.

456
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,110
Have you identified him?

457
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:06,750
Not yet.

458
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,880
He didn't have any ID on him.

459
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,270
But we took photos

460
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,400
for verification.

461
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:11,920
Yes.

462
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,000
No signs of blood splatter.

463
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,160
This isn't the primary crime scene.

464
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,880
Tire tracks?

465
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,980
(Countdown to Wang Pu's execution:
36 hours and 32 minutes)

466
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,920
Ms. Li,

467
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,590
you really think
there's something wrong with it?

468
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,830
I reviewed the files again.

469
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,350
The evidence is rock solid.

470
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,880
Rock solid?

471
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,350
Let's verify that first.

472
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,880
But this case was handled by Ms. Wei.

473
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,550
I don't think there's much hope
of overturning it.

474
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,110
No internal organ damage.

475
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,510
But a few broken bones.

476
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,030
Luckily, no life-threatening injuries.

477
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,440
Ms. Wei,

478
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,680
we've identified the victim.

479
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,720
His name is Song Chaoran,

480
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,350
a local.

481
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,240
We've already contacted his fiancée.

482
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,240
She's on her way.

483
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,100
(Reform Oneself)

484
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,550
We're from Baizhou Criminal
Investigation Team.

485
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,830
My name is Li Mochou,

486
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
and this is Officer Zhao.

487
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,590
What's there to ask?

488
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,720
My case has already been closed,

489
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,640
and I have already pleaded guilty.

490
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,550
I don't want
to answer any more questions.

491
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,200
So no more questions, please.

492
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,620
(Inpatient)

493
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,480
(During The Operation)

494
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,830
You're Song Chaoran's fiancée, right?

495
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,640
right?

496
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,590
Yes, I am.

497
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,830
How is Chaoran?

498
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,880
He's still in surgery.

499
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,000
It has been two hours.

500
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,590
How did this happen?

501
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,400
He… He was perfectly fine yesterday.

502
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,590
May I ask you a few questions?

503
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,070
Please take a seat.

504
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,070
When was the last time
you met the victim?

505
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,440
Yesterday at 4.30 PM.

506
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:28,960
That's very specific.

507
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,680
Oh.

508
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,510
Well, you see.

509
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,000
It was 4.30 PM at the office

510
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,960
when I asked him
what he wanted for dinner.

511
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,440
He said he had something to do

512
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,590
and told me to go home first.

513
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,160
But he never came home all night.

514
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,310
You didn't try to contact him?

515
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,750
We're both usually busy with work.

516
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,590
And Chaoran has a lot of social events.

517
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,200
I'm already used to it.

518
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,920
We understand you both own
an IT company.

519
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,720
How's the business doing?

520
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,960
Last year, we made a few million
in revenue.

521
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,510
Have you had any conflicts
with anyone recently?

522
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,640
Any grudges? Not that I know of.

523
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,550
But Chaoran said

524
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,030
a major corporation in our city,
Tianniu Technology,

525
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,000
is looking to acquire our company.

526
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,550
But he declined their offer.

527
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,550
The deputy director, Mr. Ma Bo,

528
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,310
had threatened him once.

529
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,590
Threatened him?

530
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,830
Why not just tell the truth?

531
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,720
It might save your life.

532
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,640
Master.

533
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,790
You knew Liu Cheng, right?

534
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,920
You must have had a reason
for killing him.

535
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,510
You can lie to yourself

536
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,640
but not me.

537
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,030
Liu Cheng?

538
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,680
The guy I beat to death?

539
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,160
I already said

540
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,750
I didn't know the guy.

541
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,550
Why did you kill him
if you didn't know him?

542
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,590
To vent my anger.

543
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,200
I was fired

544
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,510
and was in a bad mood.

545
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,400
He ran into me and didn't apologize.

546
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,480
He even cursed at me,
saying people like me deserve to die.

547
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,070
But you previously said
it was because he stared at you.

548
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,640
Yeah.

549
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,720
He bumped into me
and still stared at me.

550
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,350
I got annoyed.

551
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,070
Is that a problem?

552
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,750
A life for a life.

553
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,880
That's only fair.

554
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,070
The truth is,

555
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:26,510
I killed someone. I admit it.

556
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,640
Wang Pu,

557
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,070
you still have time.

558
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,960
Just tell the truth.

559
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,440
I have more than a day left.

560
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,350
So just let me die in peace.

561
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:52,920
Wang Pu...

562
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,830
Officer,

563
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,110
I don't want to talk.

564
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,550
Send me back.

565
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,750
You've noticed something's off
with Wang Pu too, right?

566
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,550
He wants to die

567
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,110
and take that secret to the grave.

568
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,920
He's too calm.

569
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,880
(Countdown to Wang Pu's execution:
35 hours and 6 minutes)

570
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,080
We have to look into him again.

571
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:34,100
(Baizhou Police)

572
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,830
Do you know why we bring you in?

573
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,390
I didn't commit any crime, right?

574
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,790
Please tell us about your relationship
with Song Chaoran.

575
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,720
What's up with him?

576
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,790
I never touch the guy.

577
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,400
Touch him?

578
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,890
What do you plan to do?

579
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,680
Well, you did mention Song Chaoran.

580
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,000
Isn't this about acquisition?

581
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,960
Other than the acquisition?

582
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:05,920
None.

583
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,480
Apart from the acquisition,
we had no connection.

584
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,750
Officer,

585
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,400
did anything happen to him?

586
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,000
I heard you wanted
to acquire Song Chaoran's company.

587
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,270
But he refused to sell it to you.

588
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,400
Things didn't go well between you two.

589
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,200
Yeah.

590
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,350
It's business.

591
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,780
It's normal for negotiations
to fall apart.

592
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,000
Anything else you want to say?

593
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,000
I didn't do anything.

594
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,400
Okay.

595
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,640
Thank you for cooperating.

596
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:50,070
If necessary, we'll call you in anytime.

597
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,750
Sure.

598
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,590
I'll give my cooperation.

599
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,880
Mr. Wu.

600
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,830
Yes, there's no issue.

601
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,440
Don't worry.

602
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,350
I would never do anything illegal.

603
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,960
Okay.

604
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,480
I've arrived at the company.

605
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,310
Yes.

606
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,310
Okay.

607
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,640
Okay.

608
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,070
Don't worry.

609
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,000
