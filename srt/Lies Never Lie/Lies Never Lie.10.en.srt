Go.

29
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,640
On the left.

30
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,520
Yes.

31
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,770
Go.

32
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,240
Outflank him.

33
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,800
Hurry up.

34
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,210
What's going on?

35
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,680
Cover me.

36
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,800
My goodness.

37
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,520
What are you doing?

38
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,489
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,240
Can I have a cigarette?

40
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,680
Go ahead.

41
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,050
Thank you.

42
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,360
Have you come in?

43
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,890
How many?

44
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,379
Hurry up.

45
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,520
Hurry up.

46
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:03,770
How many?

47
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,920
Okay. I'm coming.

48
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,960
Lady-boss,
give me a crepe with two eggs.

49
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,099
Hey.

50
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,450
We've seen each other before.
Don't you remember me?

51
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,490
Hey.

52
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,569
Your breakfast.

53
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,520
Hey.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,659
=Lies Never Lie=
=Episode 10=

55
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,489
It means that Zhao Zimo has definitely
seen Piao Daguang before.

56
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,210
He even approached him on purpose.

57
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,609
But why did he

58
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,050
(The Frozen Corpse Case of Tang Tang)
approach Piao Daguang again and again?

59
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,320
Tang Tang's phone.

60
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,680
Yes.

61
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,659
If Zhao Zimo was telling the truth

62
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,859
and didn't know that Tang Tang is dead,

63
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,329
he would just get the phone back
from Piao Daguang

64
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,770
or report it to the police.

65
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,240
But he didn't do that.

66
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,240
So, he knows that Tang Tang is dead.

67
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,450
Yes.

68
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,539
Also, we missed something.

69
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,049
Zhao Chunhua is an employee
at the meat processing factory.

70
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,339
So, Zhao Zimo must have grown up
at the meat processing factory too.

71
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,369
It means

72
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,979
that other than Zhao Chunhua,

73
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,169
Zhao Zimo is familiar with the layout
of the meat processing factory too.

74
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,720
He has the capability to hide the body
inside the freezer of the meat processing factory.

75
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,979
Besides, why did Zhao Chunhua
break the switch box

76
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,280
to stop us
from investigating the freezer?

77
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,489
If she did it to protect her son,

78
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,400
then everything made sense.

79
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,770
Do you think that I killed her?

80
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,929
On the 5th of November at 10 at night,

81
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,480
where were you?

82
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,659
This is absurd. Madam.

83
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,040
You've gotten this all wrong.

84
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,049
I love her so much. Why would I kill her?

85
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,480
She was my wife.

86
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,560
(No lies, no betrayal. Otherwise,
we'll commit charcoal-burning suicide.)

87
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,160
Come in.

88
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,930
Captain Ding.

89
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,690
A happy marriage?

90
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,250
A perfect relationship?

91
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,249
No lies,

92
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,520
no betrayal.

93
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,930
Otherwise, we'll commit
charcoal-burning suicide

94
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,840
together.

95
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,129
Explain this.

96
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,710
(No lies, no betrayal.)

97
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:21,979
This...

98
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,049
Let me remind you.

99
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,659
This person beside me is a psychologist.

100
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,080
A lie detector.

101
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,520
Don't try lying in front of her.

102
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,370
(No lies, no betrayal.)
I killed her.

103
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,129
Zhao Zimo.

104
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,539
Male.

105
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,369
Age, 25.

106
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,760
He was in a two-year relationship
with the deceased, Tang Tang.

107
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,779
They were married five months
when she was killed.

108
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,169
According to the note found at home,

109
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,130
(No lies, no betrayal.)
Zhao Zimo threatened her with death.

110
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,659
We found a taxi receipt

111
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,809
(Taxi Receipt)
from his home going

112
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,360
to the meat processing factory
on the 5th of November at night.

113
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,129
Also,

114
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,289
after Piao Daguang accidentally
picked up Tang Tang's phone,

115
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,600
Zhao Zimo tried to approach Piao Daguang
multiple times to retrieve her phone.

116
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,720
All of these clues point to one thing.

117
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,929
And that is,
on the night Tang Tang was killed,

118
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,129
Zhao Zimo tailed Tang Tang
to the meat processing factory.

119
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,129
Then, he killed her and hid her body.

120
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,160
So far, Zhao Zimo
is the biggest suspect in this case.

121
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,930
I...

122
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,930
Yes.

123
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,720
Getting married

124
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,840
and having a family

125
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,720
was not as happy as we imagined.

126
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,400
Where did you go?

127
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,930
Why haven't you turned on the lights?
You scared me.

128
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,400
I asked, where did you go?

129
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,480
I was working overtime.

130
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,210
No.

131
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,840
No, Darling.

132
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,339
What's wrong?

133
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,480
Go away!

134
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,840
Darling.

135
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,570
Darling.

136
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,040
Darling.

137
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,570
Darling.

138
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,360
You were working overtime, right?

139
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,939
Did you have to message
someone behind my back

140
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,930
if you were just working overtime?

141
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,009
If you were just working overtime,
did you need to dress up

142
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,840
and come back
in the middle of the night?

143
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,410
What are you talking about?

144
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,360
Give me your phone.

145
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,009
What's wrong? Why do I feel like
I don't know you anymore?

146
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,080
Of course you don't know me anymore.

147
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,690
You have eyes only for your new lover.

148
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,080
Right?

149
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:14,459
Zhao Zimo.

150
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,810
What are you talking about?

151
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,409
Show me your phone.
Give me your phone!

152
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,570
Enough!

153
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,330
Let me tell you what I did.

154
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,579
I went to make money.

155
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,409
Okay.

156
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,330
You want to know what I did, right?

157
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,529
I go out early and
come back late every day

158
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,129
because I'm out making money.

159
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:37,819
Okay.

160
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,059
I need to pay for the rent, water, and
electricity, and I want to buy clothes!

161
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,410
Enough!

162
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,720
In the end, it's because I'm useless

163
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,170
and can't make money.

164
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,170
Finally, you've admitted the truth.

165
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,480
You didn't realize that
before you married me.

166
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,480
So, you regret it now, right?

167
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,000
Right?

168
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,170
You regret marrying
a useless man like me.

169
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,570
No.

170
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,360
It's not like that.

171
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,170
I really don't regret it.

172
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,210
Don't touch me!

173
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,930
It happened so many times.

174
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,960
It wasn't like that before.

175
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,570
At that period of time, I was

176
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,690
really suffering a lot.

177
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,720
Then one day...

178
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,880
Attack!

179
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,760
Tang Tang.

180
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,080
Zhao Zimo.

181
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,050
Let's get a divorce.

182
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,219
She...

183
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,930
She said she wanted to leave me.

184
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,210
She wanted to get a divorce with me.

185
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,819
So, you wanted to kill her to keep her
by your side forever.

186
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,960
I didn't!

187
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,649
I wouldn't kill her. I would never
kill her. Why would I kill her?

188
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,450
Why did you approach Piao Daguang multiple times
to try to retrieve Tang Tang's phone?

189
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,760
I...

190
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,450
Do you remember Piao Daguang?

191
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,920
That day, you told us
that you had never seen him before

192
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,290
at the interrogation room.

193
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,480
But I'm sorry.

194
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,720
Your expression has betrayed you.

195
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,369
Not only you've seen him before, but you
also know that he has Tang Tang's phone.

196
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,440
So, you approached Piao Daguang
multiple times to retrieve Tang Tang's phone.

197
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,600
Am I right?

198
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,099
Yes.

199
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,249
But

200
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,979
I wanted to retrieve Tang Tang's phone

201
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,649
because...

202
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,579
Your wife went missing.

203
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,979
Another man had her phone.

204
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,099
And that man used her phone

205
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,529
to create posts, posing as her.

206
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,819
He could fool others by doing so.

207
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,120
But you should have known.

208
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,000
Why didn't you report it to the police?

209
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,840
You can't explain yourself, right?

210
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,330
Look. What is this?

211
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,170
What is that?

212
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,930
The taxi receipt.

213
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,459
Unfortunately,
you are not a meticulous person.

214
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,699
Although you know that you should
get the phone from Piao Daguang,

215
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,930
you forgot to throw away
this fatal receipt.

216
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,410
Taxi receipts can be seen everywhere.

217
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,410
What can it prove?

218
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,579
It can prove that on the night
of the 5th of November,

219
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,720
the night Tang Tang was killed,

220
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,720
you followed her
to the meat processing factory.

221
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,330
Let's go.

222
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,410
Tang Tang!

223
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,760
Tang...

224
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,059
That day, she went to the meat
processing factory to find your mother

225
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,600
to tell her that she would
file a divorce with you.

226
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,120
You chased after her and killed her.

227
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:30,939
And

228
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,530
you dragged her body into the freezer
of the meat processing factory.

229
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,720
Right?

230
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,489
Anran, play the CCTV footage

231
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,120
that we got from the restaurant.

232
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,450
Okay.

233
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,210
Zoom in on Zhao Chunhua's expression.

234
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,530
Zoom in more.

235
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,699
Zhao Chunhua looked

236
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,210
very nervous here.

237
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,489
Maybe Zhao Zimo called her

238
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,360
after killing Tang Tang.

239
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,290
But it was 9:10.

240
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,579
The estimated time of death
of Tang Tang is at 10.

241
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,339
Even if Zhao Zimo called Zhao Chunhua

242
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,369
right after he killed Tang Tang,

243
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,650
she wouldn't be so nervous at 9:10.

244
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,939
Besides, the particularity
of this case is that

245
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,939
the body was kept in
a cryogenic freezer for three months.

246
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,529
We can't determine
her exact time of death.

247
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,579
Everything is just based
on our estimation.

248
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,299
And all of our estimations are made

249
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,930
based on

250
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,410
Tang Tang's last voicemail on WeChat.

251
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,690
Yes.

252
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,249
At 10 that night,

253
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,249
Tang Tang sent a voicemail.

254
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,050
Right? You can't send
a fake voicemail through WeChat.

255
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,129
If it was fake,

256
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,330
I'm sure her own mother
would be able to tell.

257
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,930
- Come in.
- I have something to report.

258
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,450
Captain Ding.

259
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,210
Zhao Chunhua has turned herself in.

260
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,290
I killed her.

261
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,859
My alibi

262
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,120
was faked.

263
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,760
It was just an accident.

264
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,480
It was a coincidence.

265
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,720
Tang Tang fell at around eight at night.

266
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,930
I never thought that she would die.

267
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,000
So, she was already dead
at around eight.

268
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,680
(Mom)
I dragged her into the freezer.

269
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,819
(Mom)
I picked up her phone.

270
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,720
Then, I joined my colleagues
at the gathering.

271
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,000
We agreed to meet up
since a long time ago.

272
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,859
If I was absent,

273
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,930
others would know
that something was wrong.

274
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,690
So, I went.

275
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,710
(Mom)

276
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,450
Have you heard from our boss?

277
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,600
I want to talk
about our salary increment.

278
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,000
I have to make a call.

279
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,120
- You can continue without me first.
- Okay.

280
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,840
But I knew

281
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,179
that if she called again,

282
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,880
everything would be over.

283
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,720
Mom.

284
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,840
I had a fight with Zhao Zimo again.

285
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,450
I...

286
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,760
Ms. Zhao.

287
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,939
Why do you look so pale?

288
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,859
What?

289
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,120
I'm fine.

290
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,360
- What's wrong?
- My stomach is in pain.

291
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,059
How about I send you home

292
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,889
first?

293
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,769
- No. You don't have to do that.
- Are you really okay?

294
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,339
I'm fine.

295
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,489
Let's go back and drink more.

296
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,450
Let's go.

297
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,169
I think it's about time.

298
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,409
Let's go.

299
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,129
Because I kept

300
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,320
thinking about that phone,

301
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,720
my heart was in my throat
the whole night.

302
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,779
But when I went back for the phone

303
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,890
after the gathering,

304
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,520
I couldn't find it anywhere.

305
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,859
Because of that voicemail I sent,

306
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,850
you thought that she was dead after 10.

307
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,850
Because of that,

308
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,609
I had

309
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,610
something you called

310
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,240
an alibi.

311
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,480
She's telling the truth.

312
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,560
So, do you plead guilty?

313
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,000
I do.

314
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,410
Come in.

315
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,690
Ms. Wei, Ms. Li.

316
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,410
What's wrong?

317
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,099
Zhao Zimo pleaded guilty.

318
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,800
He admitted that he killed Tang Tang.

319
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,760
I killed her.

320
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,280
We fought every day
at that period of time.

321
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,259
She must have cheated on me.

322
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,339
At that period of time,

323
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,520
Tang Tang fought with my son every day.

324
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,169
Mo told me that she cheated on him.

325
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,370
My son gave her many chances

326
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,059
to explain herself.

327
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,800
But she didn't explain herself.

328
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,760
Then she told me
that she wanted a divorce.

329
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,889
My son treated her so well.

330
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,560
How could she do that?
How could she file a divorce with him?

331
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:55,040
So, on the 5th of November at eight,

332
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,760
I asked her to meet me at the freezer.

333
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,779
Mom.

334
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,000
You want to see me?

335
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,000
Why do you want to file
a divorce with Zimo?

336
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,130
Mom.

337
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,960
Stop pressuring me.

338
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,930
I can't be with him anymore.

339
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,450
You can't be with him?

340
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,859
Back then, so many girls
who pursued Zimo

341
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,450
were way better than you.

342
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,960
But I rejected them.

343
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,779
Now, you are telling me
that you can't be with him anymore.

344
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,960
What about Zimo?

345
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,410
Mom.

346
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,480
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,130
You are such a gold digger.

348
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,520
Now that you've found
your Prince Charming,

349
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,370
are you going to abandon my poor son?

350
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,209
What are you talking about?

351
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,130
You said that you loved him.

352
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,040
You were just lying.

353
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,480
You lied to me, an old lady.

354
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,369
And you tricked my foolish son.

355
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,960
I love him.

356
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,850
But I can't deal with him anymore.

357
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,779
It doesn't matter

358
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,369
that I earn

359
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,000
more than him.

360
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,320
But we are out of money now.

361
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,170
And he's not making any money.

362
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,369
I work hard

363
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,859
to earn money.

364
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,610
Is that wrong?

365
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,560
Stop telling me that nonsense.

366
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,409
You already knew how my son was

367
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,130
before you married him.

368
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,609
You made the choice yourself.

369
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,410
You should take responsibility
of your own choice.

370
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,280
You are an adult.

371
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,240
And you are well-educated.

372
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,650
You don't need me to educate you.

373
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,090
Yes.

374
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,690
I chose him.

375
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,850
I loved him and I could tolerate him.

376
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,850
But what about him?

377
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,800
Is he still the same Zhao Zimo?

378
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,000
He is so distrustful.

379
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,369
He's so wary of me as if I'm a criminal.

380
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,520
I'm exhausted.

381
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,800
I can't take it anymore.

382
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,000
He's just a kid.

383
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,760
Can't you just indulge him?

384
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,690
I'm a kid too.

385
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,960
Who will indulge me?

386
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:17,960
I...

387
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,960
Forget it.

388
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,890
I'm really exhausted.

389
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,210
I'll file a divorce with him tomorrow.

390
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,859
What are you doing?

391
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,339
Mom.

392
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,129
Mom, let me go.

393
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:35,929
What are you doing?

394
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,210
Let me go.

395
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,609
That day, I followed her
to the meat processing factory.

396
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,090
We couldn't find my mother.

397
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,170
Then we got into another fight.

398
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,649
Why do you want to see my mom?

399
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,090
Let's get a divorce.

400
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,130
Why?

401
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,690
I won't allow you to leave me.

402
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,969
Let me go.

403
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,889
- Then don't leave me.
- Let go of me.

404
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,610
- Be good.
- Let go of me!

405
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:22,110
(Mom)

406
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,370
A "he said, she said" situation.

407
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,169
They were interrogated separately.

408
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,099
And they both pleaded guilty.

409
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,689
Their testimonies are almost the same.

410
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,740
We can't tell who's lying
and who's telling the truth.

411
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,639
It's hard to determine
based on their testimonies.

412
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:37,240
But their expressions and
body language had exposed them.

413
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,520
Zhao Chunhua was telling the truth.

414
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,850
But not Zhao Zimo.

415
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,779
Are you saying
that Zhao Chunhua killed her?

416
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,889
But if Zhao Zimo didn't kill her,

417
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,339
how did he know so much

418
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,129
about the incident.

419
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,019
He even got all the details right.

420
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,170
An act of collusion.

421
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,209
They tallied
their confessions in advance.

422
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,099
Others tallied their confessions
to get away.

423
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,409
Who would put in so much effort

424
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,609
to come up

425
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,689
with a confession
that would put themselves at risk?

426
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:08,130
What if they worked together
to harm Tang Tang?

427
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,019
Mom.

428
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,169
Tiaotiao.

429
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,099
Inform me at once
when we have the evidence.

430
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,170
Mom.

431
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,609
I've already pleaded guilty!

432
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,520
Why are you arresting my son?

433
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,299
Your son confessed
that he killed Tang Tang.

434
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,449
I killed her!

435
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,409
Hey.

436
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,850
I killed her.

437
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,130
Don't touch her.

438
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,259
Let her go.

439
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,339
Take them away.

440
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,960
Let her go. Mom!

441
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,299
Master.

442
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,610
I'll go up and take a look.

443
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,059
- Tiaotiao.
- Yes?

444
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,210
- Have you found anything?
- No.

445
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,099
Zhao Chunhua didn't lie.

446
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,579
She killed Tang Tang.

447
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,690
And she didn't tell Zhao Zimo about it.

448
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,649
But

449
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,649
how did Zhao Zimo know
so much about the incident?

450
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:22,649
Also,

451
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,449
Tech Liu already took photos
of the crime scene, right?

452
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,259
Why are you taking photos again?

453
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,320
Tiaotiao.

454
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,170
What's the color of this door?

455
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,130
White.

456
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,720
What? What color?

457
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,969
You said that you pushed
Tang Tang, right?

458
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:39,649
Yes.

459
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,579
So, you dragged her
into the freezer yourself.

460
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:41,969
Yes.

461
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,690
What's the color of the freezer door?

462
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,209
Is that important?

463
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,450
Answer me.

464
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,370
Yellow.

465
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,850
Look at this door now.

466
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,000
Why does it look yellow in the photo?

467
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,090
Do you see that light on top?

468
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,859
That light is too strong.

469
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,520
So, the color of the door
looks different

470
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,929
from different angles.

471
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,169
So, it means

472
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,369
that if Zhao Zimo
really killed Tang Tang

473
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,090
or colluded
with Zhao Chunhua to kill her,

474
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:25,210
they would know
that the door was white in color.

475
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,890
So, Zhao Zimo,

476
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,889
you are not the murderer

477
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,169
or the accomplice.

478
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,969
You were just standing in the far corner

479
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,650
while you watched Zhao Chunhua
murdered Tang Tang.

480
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,339
You should take responsibility
of your own choice.

481
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,170
Is he still the same Zhao Zimo?

482
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,019
What are you doing?

483
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,299
Mom, let go of me.

484
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,960
Let go of me.

485
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,450
Amazing.

486
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,170
You are amazing.

487
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,450
Thank you.

488
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,370
But you are arrested.

489
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,760
- You said that I wasn't the murderer, right?
- You aren't the murderer.

490
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,120
- Why are you arresting me?
- You committed a crime.

491
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,609
What crime?

492
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,989
According to the law, a husband and wife
have mutual obligations to support each other.

493
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:10,299
Failure to provide assistance
that results in harm

494
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,499
is considered
intentional homicide by omission.

495
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,930
Zhao Zimo, not only did you kill her,

496
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,560
but you also killed two people.

497
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,609
The two people who are
closest to you in this world.

498
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,609
One is your wife,

499
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,040
one is your mother.

500
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,560
At first, you had the chance

501
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,720
to save her.

502
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,690
But you didn't.

503
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,650
You are still wearing
your wedding ring with Tang Tang.

504
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,960
We are not divorced.

505
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,000
If I'm not wrong,

506
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,539
the plain ring on your other hand

507
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,040
is the same as
what your mother is wearing, right?

508
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,059
Yes. My mother had never worn
a wedding ring before.

509
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:56,339
Now that I have the capability,  I bought
us a pair of rings. Is that a problem?

510
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,689
Of course not.

511
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,259
I just want to know
who's more important to you?

512
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,689
Is it your mother

513
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,099
or your wife?

514
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,560
Or

515
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,890
do you love only yourself?

516
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,520
Zhao Zimo.

517
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,210
Do you regret it?

518
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,760
Tang Tang doesn't love me anymore.

519
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,450
She is dead.

520
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,850
You look

521
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,850
sorrowful and indifferent now.

522
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,410
How contradictory.

523
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,499
My fellow scientist,

524
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,579
not all emotions

525
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,969
can be analyzed
with your scientific theory.

526
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,130
Really?

527
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,650
Then listen to this.

528
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,320
Listen carefully.

529
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,449
You want to know

530
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,539
what Tang Tang was doing
behind your back, right?

531
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,579
That's not important now.

532
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,449
As usual, it'll be 50-50.

533
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,059
Tang Tang,
you need this money too, right?

534
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,699
While you thought
that she cheated on you,

535
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:07,240
she was actually embezzling
public funds behind your back.

536
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,169
And she used the money she got

537
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,259
to buy clothes, shoes,
and a computer for you.

538
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,690
She didn't spend anything on herself.

539
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,000
So, you were wrong
when you said that Tang Tang

540
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,000
didn't love you anymore.

541
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,410
But you are right about one thing.

542
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,240
Tang Tang is dead.

543
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,410
You watched her

544
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,760
die in front of you.

545
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,560
In the end, she got to wear
the most beautiful wedding dress.

546
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,650
But she is married into the grave.

547
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:53,710
(Serve the People)

548
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,850
Anran.

549
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,210
Do you believe in love?

550
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,019
The two of them

551
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,960
went through ups and downs together.

552
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,800
They created so many memories
between them.

553
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,450
I'm sure they loved
each other in the past.

554
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,210
The case has been concluded.
Don't think too much about it.

555
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,689
The Technical Investigation Division
will send Tang Tang's phone here later.

556
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,370
Her parents will come and retrieve it.

557
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,960
Hello, my lovely viewers.

558
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,040
I'm doing this out-of-the-blue
live broadcast today

559
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,370
because I have a huge surprise for you.

560
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,339
Are you seeing this?

561
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,299
I'm at the filming set
of Lu Yao's new drama.

562
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,889
According to my intel,

563
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,819
Lu Yao's sweetheart, Yadong,

564
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,499
will swoop in

565
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,859
and propose to Lu Yao.

566
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,930
The fans of the Lu and Ni Couple
will witness the fruit of their love.

567
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,779
As their top fan,

568
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,410
I'll do a live broadcast to show you...

569
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,000
What is that?

570
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:48,850
Ah!

571
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,650
What's wrong, Tiaotiao?

572
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,450
Ni Yadong is dead.
