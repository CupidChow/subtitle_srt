Well?

30
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,320
Let's talk elsewhere.

31
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,799
You were right.

32
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,409
Zeng Xiang worked here before.

33
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,969
The older employees all know him.

34
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,729
What's more,

35
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,689
I showed them a photo of Meng Zhengyi,

36
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,720
and they remember him, too.

37
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,899
They said three years ago, Meng Zhengyi
brought his men here and started a brawl.

38
00:02:39,899 --> 00:02:41,710
Zeng Xiang fought back.

39
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,710
I need to answer this.

40
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,920
We'll be there right away.

41
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,640
We have a new case.

42
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,199
Come on.

43
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,110
Oh.

44
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,889
Officer, we've confirmed
that 12 bodies were cremated yesterday,

45
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,480
and nine were cremated today.

46
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,760
All remains have been
claimed by their families

47
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,479
except this one.

48
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,409
Have you checked

49
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,040
all the bodies yet to be cremated?

50
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,009
Maybe the cremation workers
made a mistake?

51
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,729
We've checked. Everything's in order.

52
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,009
We still have 32 bodies

53
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,760
still in the morgue,

54
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,240
not one less.

55
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,360
They've crossed-checked

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,670
all the cremated bodies,
and those yet to be cremated.

57
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,900

=Lies Never Lie=
=Episode 13=

59
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,169
Well,

60
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,639
it's all turned to ashes.

61
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,520
Can we even run a DNA test on it?

62
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,950
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

63
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,550
No matter how great you were
when you're alive,

64
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,169
once you enter this furnace,

65
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,520
everything is over.

66
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,150
Once it starts burning,

67
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,249
all biometric traces

68
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,359
and DNAs

69
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,760
are gone.

70
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,550
Liu.

71
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,800
We've handled so many cases,

72
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,319
and this is a perfect example
of obliterating a dead body.

73
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,760
No crime is perfect.

74
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,670
There must be some traces.

75
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,760
Come on, Tiaotiao. Get to work.

76
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,889
(Simingshan Funeral Parlor)

77
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,759
Liu Bin, correct?

78
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,159
Yes, that's me.

79
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,689
So, you discovered
the extra cremation box?

80
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,609
Yes.

81
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,199
Today,

82
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,639
on the 7th, we don't have
any cremations scheduled, but for some reason,

83
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,800
there was an extra cremation box.

84
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,279
How come you didn't notice it
in the first place?

85
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,510
Here's the thing.

86
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,009
The cremation details are
all scheduled beforehand,

87
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,960
including which body
goes into which furnace.

88
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,630
The cremation process is also observed
by the deceased's families.

89
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,990
Didn't you confirm twice
before cremating?

90
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,249
Officer. I've been working in this field
for seven to eight years.

91
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,720
We've never had a single mistake.

92
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,040
This is so creepy.

93
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,480
There's blood everywhere.

94
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,190
The blood trail starts from the door

95
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,160
and extends until Furnace No. 7.

96
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,670
Rong, is there anything?

97
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,689
It's all burned to ashes.
I can't get anything.

98
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,110
Not even a clue?

99
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,369
Cremation furnaces
can reach up to 900°C.

100
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,009
Under such high temperatures,

101
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,840
it's hard to obtain any materials
for biometric identification.

102
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,430
This is probably
the primary crime scene.

103
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,249
After the killer murdered the victim,

104
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,049
they put the body into
Furnace No. 7 to cremate it,

105
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,750
then cleaned the scene.

106
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,209
Judging from the traces,
the killer seemed to be very calm,

107
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:43,160
and they had ample time
to commit the murder.

108
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,430
Ms. Wei, look.

109
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,990
A steel plate?

110
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,519
It's used for treating bone fractures.

111
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,369
The furnace's high temperatures
can destroy

112
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,159
muscles and bones,

113
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,550
but not this.

114
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,920
Look.

115
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,759
There's a serial code.
Surgical steel plates

116
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,249
all come with a unique serial code

117
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,070
that can be traced to its user.

118
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,079
Unfortunately, two numbers

119
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,750
have been wiped out by the fire.

120
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,360
At least we can narrow
our search from here.

121
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,510
This security footage is taken
from 10 PM last night until now.

122
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,550
There's no movement at all.

123
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,430
No.

124
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,800
Replay from the beginning.

125
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,569
It looks the same.

126
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,240
Nothing's fishy.

127
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,839
Haven't you noticed yet?

128
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,839
Oh.

129
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,249
There's a tiny insect here.

130
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,519
Observe how the insect flew in,

131
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,809
where it flew out,
and how it flew around the scene.

132
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,280
What can you see?

133
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,430
These two videos are exactly the same.

134
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,160
Someone tampered with the footage.

135
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,639
So, someone overwrote
the footage from 10 PM to 2 AM

136
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,750
with a duplicate video.

137
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,199
That means someone
went inside the cremation room,

138
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,600
and they didn't want anyone to know.

139
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,990
That might be the killer.

140
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,929
Exactly.

141
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,609
Check who's on duty that night.

142
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,750
Yes, ma'am.

143
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,720
I got it.

144
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,160
The person on duty
that night was Li Qiang.

145
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,580
(Simingshan Funeral Parlor:
Officers on Duty)

146
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,639
Li Qiang, 32 years old.

147
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,630
You're in charge of the cremation room?

148
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,449
Yes.

149
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,519
Where were you last night from 10 PM

150
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,839
to 2 AM?

151
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,759
In my office.

152
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,489
All the time?

153
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,719
Yes, all the time.

154
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,689
Have you noticed anything off
during that time?

155
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,279
No.

156
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,889
That was fast.

157
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,199
Didn't you even have to think?

158
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,400
Huh?

159
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,249
I was in my office,

160
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,129
and I didn't notice anything
out of the ordinary.

161
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,310
Oh?

162
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,959
But your colleague told me

163
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,449
that before the worker on duty leaves,

164
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,889
they'd clean the cremation room first.

165
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,960
Didn't you clean the room that night?

166
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,249
Oh.

167
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,319
Right.

168
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,759
I did go to the cremation room.

169
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,639
I mopped the floor.

170
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,569
Are you sure?

171
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,720
Yes.

172
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,609
So, you mopped the floor
in the cremation room?

173
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,190
Yes.

174
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,870
Take a look.

175
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,990
What's this?

176
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,609
It's a luminol test reaction

177
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,719
that tests for blood.

178
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,870
Blood?

179
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,319
We discovered large amounts of blood

180
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,839
on the floor around Furnace No. 7.

181
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,279
Someone committed a murder there

182
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,929
and cremated the body in the furnace,

183
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,439
then mopped the floor
to clean the scene.

184
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,609
That means anyone
who was in the cremation room

185
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,750
and mopped the floor
that night was the murderer.

186
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,799
No, no.

187
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,960
This is a mistake. I didn't kill anyone.

188
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,200
Sit down.

189
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,279
I'm giving you another chance.

190
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,849
Think carefully before you speak.

191
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,790
Where were you last night
from 10 PM to 2 AM?

192
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,030
I didn't go to work.

193
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,750
Someone switched shifts with me.

194
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,630
Why did you lie?

195
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,680
We switched shifts in secret

196
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,110
without our boss's approval.

197
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,840
Now that something terrible
has happened,

198
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,889
I didn't want to take the rap.

199
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,030
Be more specific.

200
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,200
Usually, there are two people
working on night shift.

201
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,560
It was a weekend yesterday,

202
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,600
and I had to work alone.

203
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,360
I was scared,

204
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,600
and someone offered to switch with me,

205
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,240
so I took his offer.

206
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,360
Who switched shifts with you?

207
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,600
A new guy.

208
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:45,519
He's called

209
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,600
Xu Jun.

210
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,439
Xu Jun, male, 37 years old.

211
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,759
He was convicted three years ago

212
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,089
for assaulting someone during a brawl.

213
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:52,870
He...

214
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,639
Shame on you!

215
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,889
You must be a shameless mother

216
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,630
to have a shameless kid like him!

217
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,849
Who are you calling shameless?

218
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,919
You, of course.

219
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,089
That's what I'm calling you!

220
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,159
Take that!

221
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,089
You have no shame!

222
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,729
That's why you have a shameless kid!

223
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,759
Your daughter is dumb!

224
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,889
That's what I'm saying!

225
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:12,759
Say that again!

226
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,240
Say that again!

227
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,870
You'd better say that!

228
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,489
Who's the shameless one?

229
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,399
You!

230
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,919
You can't even keep an eye on your kid!
I can do a better job!

231
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,329
Seriously,

232
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,560
is that what you're saying?

233
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,600
- Shut up!
- Say that again!

234
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,150
Police!

235
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,790
Say that again!

236
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,249
Stop yelling!

237
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,600
Stop yelling!

238
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,040
Police!

239
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,439
I'm telling you,
if you throw that flask at her,

240
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,200
you can be convicted of assault
and go to jail, so let go!

241
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,849
That's enough.

242
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,729
Go home, everyone.

243
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,200
Let's go, show's over.

244
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,720
Who's Xu Jun?

245
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,440
I'm his wife.

246
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,279
Mom.

247
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,630
It hurts.

248
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,489
I know.

249
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,279
Bear with it.

250
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,480
It'll get better soon.

251
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,209
Mom.

252
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,360
It hurts.

253
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:10,889
Okay.

254
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,390
Let me blow on it.

255
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,840
Now, stay here.

256
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,510
Is your daughter okay?

257
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,790
She's fine.

258
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,129
Xu Jun

259
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:27,889
isn't home.

260
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,150
He's at work.

261
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,750
He told you he's at work?

262
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,630
Yes, what happened?

263
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,270
He didn't go to work
for the past two days.

264
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,750
Did anything happen to him?

265
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,030
Why don't you call him first?

266
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,489
The call didn't go through.

267
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,680
His phone is off.

268
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,039
So, Xu Jun has been
unreachable since the murder,

269
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,510
and his whereabouts are unknown.

270
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,240
Do you think Xu Jun

271
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,249
is running away out of guilt?

272
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,510
That's possible.

273
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,630
Look.

274
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,679
This is the case file
from three years ago

275
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,270
when Xu Jun injured someone in a brawl.

276
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,519
These are the people Xu Jun beat up.

277
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,480
He's savage.

278
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:32,790
Yeah.

279
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,790
We also found large amounts of blood
at the crime scene.

280
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,559
Huh?

281
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,720
Stop.

282
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,110
Zoom in.

283
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,790
Mochou, look.

284
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,840
This guy...

285
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,200
It's Meng Zhengyi.

286
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,129
Ms. Wei. Mr. Luo
from Tianxiang Group is here.

287
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,910
He's saying that their deputy director,
Meng Zhengyi, is missing.

288
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,870
A blackmail letter?

289
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,480
Yes.

290
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,990
It's delivered to Zhengyi.

291
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,159
Yue, take this away.

292
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,480
It's creepy.

293
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,249
Can you explain in detail?

294
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,600
Mr. Meng has been receiving
such items frequently.

295
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,480
Sometimes, he even gets a letter
with the word "die" written in blood.

296
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,080
It's making everyone
in office freak out.

297
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,399
Yesterday afternoon,

298
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,560
we received another parcel like that.

299
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,679
Zhengyi was furious

300
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,439
when he saw it,

301
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,030
so he took his car and drove off.

302
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:34,969
Since then,

303
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,129
all of us hasn't been
able to contact him.

304
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,679
We had an important meeting
this morning,

305
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,039
but Zhengyi didn't show up,

306
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,870
so I was worried.

307
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,039
That's why I asked Zhiyuan
to come with me

308
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,129
to lodge a police report.

309
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,249
How long has he been
receiving such parcels?

310
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,039
About a month.

311
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,039
During this period,

312
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,159
has Meng Zhengyi gotten into any feuds?

313
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,200
Not recently.

314
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,729
But three years ago,

315
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,720
he was involved in a brawl

316
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,849
with a driver.

317
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,030
It was pretty serious back then.

318
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,489
I remember that the driver
even went to jail

319
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,750
because of this.

320
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,440
Anyway, things got very ugly.

321
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,039
I don't remember

322
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,519
the exact details, though.

323
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,439
I think they might have been

324
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,990
holding a grudge against
each other since then.

325
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,729
What's the name of the driver?

326
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,110
I think his surname was Xu.

327
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,489
Xu Jun?

328
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,390
Yes.

329
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,889
I have another question.

330
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,439
Was Meng Zhengyi
injured during the brawl?

331
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,600
Yes.

332
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,110
His arm was seriously injured,

333
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,030
and they even had
to install a steel plate.

334
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,889
Ms. Wei, the steel plate
belongs to Meng Zhengyi.

335
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,439
We collected some DNA samples
from Meng Zhengyi's office

336
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,480
and compared them with
the blood from the crime scene.

337
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,240
Here's the DNA comparison report.

338
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,200
(DNA Test Report)
It's the same person.

339
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,720
We can now identify the victim.

340
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,200
So, the victim was Meng Zhengyi.

341
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,390
Yes.

342
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,110
I feel like I'm trapped
under a huge net,

343
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,080
unable to breathe.

344
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,759
Zeng Xiang forged those files

345
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,480
and lured Ning Jing into his trap.

346
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,639
Just when we got him,

347
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,990
he died.

348
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,870
Li Guorong tried to
assassinate me twice overseas.

349
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,039
It took me a long time

350
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,960
to track him down,

351
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,510
and he's dead, too.

352
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,600
Now, just when we got Meng Zhengyi,

353
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,750
he's dead, too.

354
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,790
Three years.

355
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,910
All our clues have come to a dead end.

356
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,320
We've been going in circles,

357
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,960
and everything is back to square one.

358
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,270
Maybe I'll never
discover the truth after all?

359
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,390
What do you mean, back to square one?

360
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,600
You were alone back then,

361
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,480
but you have me now.

362
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,799
Every year, I'm the top scorer

363
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,990
in the police physical appraisal test.

364
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,769
Now that we're working together,

365
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,920
we've got the best of brains and brawn.

366
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,809
I'm sure

367
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,809
that there's no case

368
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,160
we can't ever solve.

369
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,350
Ding Wei.

370
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,070
You know what?

371
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,640
You resemble her a lot.

372
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,329
Meng Zhengyi may be dead,

373
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,200
but the truth isn't.

374
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,550
We still need to search him

375
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,440
for clues on that event years ago.

376
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,270
Buck up.

377
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,960
There are still many truths
waiting for us to uncover.

378
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,750
Also, I'm not a replacement for anyone.

379
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,999
The traffic police

380
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,999
has retrieved all footage

381
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,569
around the funeral parlor that night.

382
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,440
They spotted Meng Zhengyi's car.

383
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,440
10:02 PM.

384
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,569
Meng Zhengyi drove
into the funeral parlor.

385
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,239
Look.

386
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,070
The camera caught his face clearly.

387
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,880
It really is Meng Zhengyi.

388
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,990
Then,

389
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,849
about two hours later,

390
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,289
at 12:11 AM,

391
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:23,120
the same car left the funeral parlor.

392
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,329
It's the same car,

393
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,750
but probably not driven
by the same person.

394
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,280
This time, the camera
only caught his side profile,

395
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,399
but this guy looks
plumper than Meng Zhengyi.

396
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,399
He's also wearing

397
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,880
the funeral parlor's overalls.

398
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,880
Xu Jun.

399
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,769
Judging from the person's
figure and appearance,

400
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,919
I think we can deduce

401
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,350
that he's Xu Jun.

402
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,310
Ms. Li.

403
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,089
Ms. Li?

404
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,159
Captain Ding.

405
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,830
Here's my conclusion.

406
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,889
On the night of the crime,

407
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,529
Xu Jun asked Meng Zhengyi
to meet him at the funeral parlor.

408
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,719
He committed the murder,

409
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,089
cremated him straight away,

410
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,609
then fled the scene
driving Meng Zhengyi's car.

411
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:19,750
That's the gist of it.

412
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,329
The last time this car appeared
in the security footage

413
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,550
was 12:31 AM,

414
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,719
around Xihuan Road.

415
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,129
Yes.

416
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,959
Then, he headed towards a road
without security cameras

417
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,120
and disappeared.

418
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,480
Let's head to Xu Jun's house.

419
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,329
Anran.

420
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,199
Contact the traffic police to retrieve all
security footage around town

421
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,959
and search for Meng Zhengyi's car.

422
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,639
Tiaotiao.

423
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,679
Inform all transportation hubs

424
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,399
to arrest Xu Jun if he's spotted.

425
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,329
Xu Jun has been missing for 24 hours,
so he's likely on the run.

426
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,289
We need to be quick.

427
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,240
Yes, ma'am.

428
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,849
- Is it in front?
- Over there.

429
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,350
Thank you.

430
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,640
We came out when we heard noise.

431
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,120
Look, it's there.

432
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,049
You see that?

433
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,400
I don't see anything.

434
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,289
Sir.

435
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,160
Have you seen Xu Jun lately?

436
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,160
Why don't you go to his house and ask?

437
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,129
It's upstairs, right?

438
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,510
Thank you.

439
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,440
Well?

440
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,720
They're asking upstairs now.

441
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,640
Okay, thank you.

442
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,329
Hello.

443
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,830
Baizhou City Police, Unit 2.

444
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,049
Got it.

445
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:54,719
They found it.

446
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,199
Meng Zhengyi's car has been spotted

447
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,399
on the outbound highway.

448
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,849
Contact the roadblock unit.

449
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,990
Yes, ma'am.

450
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,920
Suspicious car spotted.
Black Mercedes Benz, Bai C GN065.

451
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,790
Stop!

452
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,889
After them!

453
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,329
Black Mercedes Benz, Bai C GN065.

454
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,750
It turned left at Qilindong Road.

455
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:25,830
Roger that.

456
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,120
Captain Yue!

457
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,960
Stop!

458
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,510
Stop!

459
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,510
Watch out!

460
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,719
Stop right there!

461
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,310
Hands up! Get out of the car!

462
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,720
Get out!

463
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,070
Hands in the air!

464
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:57,880
Get here!

465
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,350
Yang Shuang?

466
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,160
I killed Meng Zhengyi.

467
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,240
My husband has nothing to do with this.

468
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,880
Why?

469
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,880
Because I hate him.

470
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,089
Three years ago, my husband was jailed

471
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,919
all because of Meng Zhengyi.

472
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,750
That's because he got into a brawl
and stabbed someone, right?

473
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,350
What brawl?

474
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,480
He set my husband up.

475
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,439
Daddy!

476
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,639
Daddy's here.

477
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,239
Didn't you say that
someone drunk tried to stab you,

478
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,889
and you're just trying
to defend yourself?

479
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,680
Why did you suddenly plead guilty?

480
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,439
I don't have evidence.

481
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,310
How come you don't have evidence?

482
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,849
You were with Mr. Meng.

483
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,769
There were so many eyewitnesses.

484
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,399
It was those thugs who got drunk

485
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,719
and started the fight.

486
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,609
The knife belongs to them, too.

487
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,329
If you didn't fight back, you'd have died.

488
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,960
Just tell them.

489
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,639
It's useless.

490
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,350
How is it useless?

491
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,639
I'm going to beg Mr. Meng for help.

492
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,439
No.

493
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,550
Why?

494
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,960
Nothing.

495
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,680
Just don't go to him.

496
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,769
Then, what about you? What about me?

497
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,200
What about our daughter?

498
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,959
Daddy, when are you coming back?

499
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,159
Daddy!

500
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,769
Daddy will be back soon.

501
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,640
Stay at home and listen to your mom.

502
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,360
I'm going to talk to Mr. Meng tomorrow.

503
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,480
No.

504
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,960
No, no!

505
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,919
Listen to me.

506
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,350
Don't go to him.

507
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,239
- Those thugs are his underlings. He hired them...
- Visitation's over.

508
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,999
What did you say?

509
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,049
They were after me, you know?

510
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:58,720
- Daddy!
- Hubby!

511
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,439
Go!

512
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,439
Meng hired those goons to kill me!

513
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,239
Take our daughter and run!

514
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,609
Don't worry about me!

515
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,479
Listen to me, darling!

516
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,310
Don't worry about me!

517
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,990
You said Meng Zhengyi
hired someone to kill Xu Jun?

518
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,750
He's been involved in shady businesses.

519
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,199
My husband had been
his driver for two years.

520
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,750
He's done a lot of things for him.

521
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,830
Maybe he stumbled across
one of his secrets,

522
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,750
so he wanted my husband dead.

523
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,160
After that conversation,

524
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,830
I took my daughter and fled.

525
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,679
But as soon as we left,

526
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,030
Meng Zhengyi was hot on our heels.

527
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,439
We moved house three times,

528
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,310
and he found us every time.

529
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,240
I was so scared

530
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,350
until I didn't dare go to work.

531
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,640
I lived in fear day and night.

532
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,679
Later, I was at my wits' end...

533
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,609
Mom.

534
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,640
So I moved back to my hometown.

535
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,639
Mom.

536
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,270
But, that night...

537
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,030
You're running a fever.

538
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,049
Come on.

539
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,480
Let's go to the hospital.

540
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,160
Qiqi.

541
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,720
Qiqi.

542
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,329
Qiqi.

543
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,480
Officer!

544
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,030
Officer!

545
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,439
Officer!

546
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,479
Officer!

547
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,479
What is it?

548
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,529
Can you let me call my wife?

549
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,609
It's not visitation hours now. You're
not allowed to contact anyone outside.

550
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,439
Just this once.

551
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,129
Just this once.

552
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,830
No, rules are rules.

553
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:01,919
Officer!

554
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,719
It's my daughter's birthday today.
I beg you.

555
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,329
I promised to take her to the aquarium.

556
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,129
I beg you.

557
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,310
- I'm sorry.
- I beg you.

558
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,920
Rules are rules.

559
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,240
If you love your daughter, why did you
break the law in the first place?

560
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,719
Officer!

561
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,719
Officer!

562
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,830
Officer!

563
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,120
Excuse me!

564
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,160
Excuse me!

565
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:29,959
Excuse me!

566
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,120
Please stop!

567
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,640
Excuse me!

568
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,679
Excuse me.

569
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,239
What's wrong?

570
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,919
My daughter is running a fever.

571
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,609
Get in.

572
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:11,480
Thank you.

573
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,310
Come on, Qiqi.

574
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,239
Come on.

575
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,680
Thank you so much.

576
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,270
Even so,

577
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,480
Meng Zhengyi didn't let us off the hook.

578
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,200
I should've known

579
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,750
that he had eyes everywhere.

580
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,350
There was no way we could hide.

581
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,830
My husband was
planning to appeal his case,

582
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,030
but after that day, he gave up.

583
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,440
Before we met Meng Zhengyi,

584
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,920
even though our family wasn't rich,

585
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,240
we were happy.

586
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,160
If not for him,

587
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,159
my husband wouldn't
be jailed for three years,

588
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,399
and my bright, lively daughter

589
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
wouldn't be in this state.

590
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,999
Our family is ruined

591
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,480
all because of him.

592
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,750
Is that why you wanted to kill him.

593
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,270
Correct.

594
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,880
After my husband was released,
he got a job in the funeral parlor.

595
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,750
It was the perfect place
to get rid of a dead body.

596
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,240
That's how I came up with the plan.

597
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,889
I used Xu Jun's phone

598
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,720
to make him switch shifts with Li Qiang.

599
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,070
Then, I called Meng Zhengyi to meet me,

600
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,830
and headed to the funeral parlor
wearing my husband's overalls.

601
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,880
Finally, I killed and cremated him.

602
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,769
How tall are you?

603
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,070
169 cm.

604
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,680
Do you know how tall Meng Zhengyi was?

605
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,480
Around 180 cm.

606
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,590
You think I can't kill him?

607
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,719
What do you think?

608
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,120
It's simple, actually.

609
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,350
I used pepper spray.

610
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,369
I hid behind the door,

611
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,920
then sprayed him as soon as he came in.

612
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:22,129
He was in pain and couldn't open his eyes,

613
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,750
so he was no match for me.

614
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,070
At what time
did you schedule the meeting?

615
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,550
10 PM.

616
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,889
I've told you everything.

617
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,550
It was me who killed him.

618
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,480
I plead guilty.
