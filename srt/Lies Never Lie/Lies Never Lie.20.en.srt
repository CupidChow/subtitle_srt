28
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,869
The doctor said
you'll be discharged in two days.

29
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,619
Tomorrow, I'll go pick up Chuchu.

30
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,579
In the afternoon, I'll head to Beishan.
It's Jinliang's seventh-day memorial.

31
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,109
You can't leave the hospital
so I have to go.

32
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,130
I'm leaving now.

33
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,930
=Lies Never Lie=
=Episode 20=

34
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,460
Mister, have you met this person?

35
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,650
No, I haven't.

36
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,930
He's always been a polite

37
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,250
and well-mannered guy.

38
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,220
I never noticed any changes in him.

39
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,109
His wife isn't in good health

40
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,180
so he even quit smoking for her.

41
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,869
Mister,

42
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,779
look at this photo.

43
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,709
Do you remember the last time

44
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,780
he bought something here?

45
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,370
Not really.

46
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,499
But it's been a while
since he bought cigarettes here.

47
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,970
He's always been like this.

48
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,829
After that nightmare,

49
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,340
I like Daddy even more now.

50
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,549
Mr. Fang?

51
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,000
- Oh, Officer Li.
- What a coincidence!

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,640
- Are you here for the exhibition too?
- Are you into architecture too?

53
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,459
I wouldn't say I'm an expert before you.

54
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,739
But I know a little.

55
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,300
What style do you prefer?

56
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,179
Nothing specific.

57
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,229
I like things
that are simple and practical.

58
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,669
But I do admire Lloyd.

59
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,669
When I was studying in Germany,

60
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,810
I visited the Bauhaus School.

61
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,619
Bauhaus represents
modernist architecture.

62
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,530
Lloyd was also a key figure
in modernism.

63
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,900
But Bauhaus was designed
by Walter Gropius.

64
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,780
Lloyd focused on organic architecture,

65
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,619
like the Fallingwater
and the Guggenheim Museum.

66
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,340
I guess I made a fool of myself
in front of an expert.

67
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,819
But I do like your firm's designs.

68
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,029
I think even Mr. Venturi would feel

69
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,139
like he found a kindred spirit
after seeing them.

70
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,669
I wouldn't dare compare myself
to an expert like him.

71
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,490
Unfortunately, he passed away
a few years ago.

72
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,490
Great artists never seem to live long.

73
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,699
By the way,

74
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,179
was your thesis also

75
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,700
about Venturi's work?

76
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,029
It's been so many years

77
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,349
so I don't remember anymore.

78
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,490
Fair enough.

79
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,109
Based on our inquiries,

80
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,499
Fang Jinshan's colleagues say

81
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,090
he's always been gentle

82
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,700
and polite.

83
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,589
But based on my
and Mochou's investigation,

84
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,699
we believe he was involved
in domestic abuse.

85
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,340
Whoa, he's got a double life?

86
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,730
Do you think
he has multiple personalities?

87
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,549
Oh, come on.

88
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,739
You read too many novels.

89
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,139
I pretended to run into him
at an architecture exhibition,

90
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,989
and I tested him

91
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,900
by discussing different design styles.

92
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,059
He genuinely admires

93
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,819
Mr. Venturi.

94
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,989
But I said Venturi died young

95
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,179
when the truth is,
Venturi lived into his 90s.

96
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,140
That's far from dying young.

97
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,530
On top of that,

98
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,139
Fang Jinshan's thesis was actually

99
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,259
about Venturi's work.

100
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,989
But when I asked,

101
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,530
he said he didn't remember.

102
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,789
All of these confirm my suspicion

103
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,290
that this man
is not the real Fang Jinshan.

104
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,989
If that's true,

105
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,410
then where's the real Fang Jinshan?

106
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,780
If Fang Jinshan is still alive,

107
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,340
Fang Jinliang would keep him
under his control.

108
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,490
Yue.

109
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,530
Yeah?

110
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,340
Do you mind going with us?

111
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,970
Sure, let's go.

112
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,340
Let the disabled guy drive for you.

113
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,530
Let's go.

114
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,429
Yue.

115
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,610
Yes?

116
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,170
It's hollow.

117
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,140
Watch your step.

118
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,349
Fang Jinshan sure has taste.

119
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,059
Did you guys notice that pungent smell
when we walked in?

120
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,989
Yes.

121
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,869
Look at the exposed wiring

122
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,650
and the unfinished light fixtures.

123
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,109
This place was recently renovated.

124
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,290
Could it be to erase signs
of someone living here?

125
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,970
It's possible.

126
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,580
Let's go
and have a chat with Fang Jinshan.

127
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,139
Yue, wrap things up.

128
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,819
Okay.

129
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,340
We're leaving this to you.

130
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,669
Why did you build a secret room
in the house?

131
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,490
That's not illegal, right?

132
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,789
The house belongs to my brother.

133
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,179
He wanted it

134
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,700
so I had it built.

135
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,259
Does Tan Aiqiu know?

136
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,730
Not at first.

137
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,259
She didn't like

138
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,499
my designs

139
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,469
So I stored them in there.

140
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,700
She found out during the renovation.

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,170
What happened to the things
that were originally inside?

142
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,699
Most of them were thrown out.

143
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,580
As for the rest,
you guys already brought them here.

144
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,610
Ms. Li, Captain Ding wants to see you.

145
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,340
Okay.

146
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,130
Well, that was embarrassing.

147
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,700
We found nothing.

148
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,060
He said they just renovated
the secret room.

149
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,659
Yue Qun, tell me what you saw.

150
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,820
About what?

151
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,869
There's not much to say.

152
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,130
It's just a room

153
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,189
with nothing inside.

154
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,989
Fresh paint, still smells like it.
Oh yeah, there are a few...

155
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,659
Let's just say,
not-so-kid-friendly paintings.

156
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,869
It's not particularly useful.

157
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,010
I brought them back

158
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,700
and they're in the records room.

159
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,890
Ding Wei, I'm heading there now.

160
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,609
(Court Civil Case Records. Volume)

161
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:28,080
(Police)

162
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:37,600
(Baizhou Police)

163
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,820
What's on your mind?

164
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,180
I get it now.

165
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,189
He renovated the secret room

166
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,730
to erase traces of Fang Jinshan.

167
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,189
Before we could find him,

168
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,090
he moved him somewhere else.

169
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,180
But where?

170
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,309
Could he already be dead?

171
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,460
No way.

172
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,989
When I interrogated him,

173
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,490
he didn't have the mindset of a killer.

174
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,180
If we're out of options,
let's release him first.

175
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,490
We will have Yue Qun tail him

176
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,060
and see where he goes.

177
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,730
You're trying to lure him out?

178
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,660
Hello, Captain Ding.

179
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,490
I lost him.

180
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:47,779
Okay.

181
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,940
Got it.

182
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,499
Hello? There's no one
at Fang Jinshan's house.

183
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,659
Where do I look now?

184
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,069
There's an abandoned building nearby

185
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,739
belonging to Fang Jinliang.

186
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,539
Meet us there.

187
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,700
Okay.

188
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,010
Overtake them.

189
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,540
I don't want to kill you.

190
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,420
But I have no choice. They're onto me.

191
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,060
If you're still alive,

192
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,940
what would happen to me?

193
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,090
What happens to Aiqiu?

194
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,700
From now on,

195
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,940
I'll still be me.

196
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,890
Police! Freeze!

197
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,540
Police!

198
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,850
Stop!

199
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,060
Get up.

200
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,055
Stop right there!

201
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,970
There are really the two of you.

202
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,940
Fang Jinshan.

203
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,060
No.

204
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,220
Should I call you Fang Jinliang?

205
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,370
It doesn't matter if you stay silent.

206
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,220
I can help you piece it together.

207
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,340
You and your brother love Tan Aiqiu.

208
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,180
After Fang Jinshan married Tan Aiqiu,

209
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,370
he abused her for years.

210
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,940
When she fell ill

211
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,419
and couldn't take it anymore,

212
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,010
she attempted suicide.

213
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,660
It was you who saved her.

214
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,379
Watch the woman you loved suffer

215
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,540
at the hands of your own brother,

216
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,660
you came up with this entire plan.

217
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,970
You faked your own suicide

218
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,300
and went into hiding at the villa.

219
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,250
You waited for the right moment

220
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,300
to kill your brother

221
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,890
and take his place.

222
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,010
At first,

223
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,060
you were afraid of slipping up.

224
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,890
So you pretended to be unwell

225
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,090
and stayed in the hospital
for a few days

226
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,010
to adjust.

227
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,229
The first time I visited your house

228
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,109
and asked about the suicide note,

229
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,139
you looked like

230
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,220
you already knew something
and were terrified.

231
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,069
You knew exactly what was written in it.

232
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,019
But you were scared

233
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,890
we would keep investigating.

234
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,250
Then there was the anniversary cake
you ordered for Tan Aiqiu.

235
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,619
Their wedding day
was the worst day of your life.

236
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,869
Why would you celebrate it?

237
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,949
Instead, you picked May 9th

238
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,970
because that was the day
you were reborn.

239
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,659
After switching identities,

240
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,349
you only spent five years
as Tan Aiqiu's husband.

241
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,250
So that's the only block of time
you acknowledged as real.

242
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,309
Your injured hand,

243
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,659
your career change, your thesis,

244
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,180
and your design philosophy.

245
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,220
Mr. Fang,

246
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,420
do you want me to continue?

247
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,700
Officer Li,

248
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,770
that's quite the story
you've put together.

249
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,370
Why did you confine Fang Jinshan?

250
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,940
Take a look at this report.

251
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,869
It shows the abandoned building
belonged to you.

252
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,460
So why was it suddenly left unfinished?

253
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,890
Did you stop construction
so you could lock your brother there?

254
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,090
I am Fang Jinshan.

255
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,460
I'm myself.

256
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,130
He says he's Fang Jinshan.

257
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,850
Are you sure?

258
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,010
When the man in the hospital wakes up,

259
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,060
this won't be a confession anymore.

260
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,730
You should think carefully.

261
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,309
Fine.

262
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,580
Since you won't talk,

263
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,189
we'll ask Tan Aiqiu.

264
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,340
Don't go to her.

265
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,940
Officer Li, you got one thing right.

266
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,730
We both love Tan Aiqiu.

267
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,250
But she loved me.

268
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,370
We made a promise.

269
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,899
If we got into the same university,

270
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,140
we'd get engaged.

271
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,730
But Jinliang failed the entrance exam.

272
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,970
Qiu and I both got in.

273
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,490
But right before registering for school,

274
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,860
I was diagnosed with leukemia.

275
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,970
I couldn't tell my family,

276
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,180
and I didn't want
to drag Qiu down with me.

277
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,860
So I begged Jinliang

278
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,940
to go to the university in my place

279
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,010
and take care of her for me.

280
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,460
But by the time I found out
it was a misdiagnosis,

281
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,770
they were already married.

282
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,459
Chuchu.

283
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,179
Yes?

284
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,789
Why are you here alone?

285
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,940
Hm.

286
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,109
What are you doing?

287
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,659
I'm drawing.

288
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,810
I see.

289
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,810
Who's this?

290
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,069
This is Mommy.

291
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,939
Oh, is this a baby?

292
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,900
- Am I right?
- Yes.

293
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,940
Where are your parents?

294
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,660
They're fighting upstairs.

295
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,309
Okay. Keep drawing.

296
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,250
Okay.

297
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,290
Are you crazy?

298
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,010
I thought they would live
their lives peacefully.

299
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,570
But then Jinliang...

300
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,770
I...

301
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,010
I just want to sleep with her.

302
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,010
What's wrong with that?

303
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,050
She...

304
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:05,290
She already slept with you many times.

305
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,050
Aiqiu!

306
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,460
Aiqiu.

307
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,900
Aiqiu!

308
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,140
I'm only fixing all the mistakes

309
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,010
and taking back the life
that was supposed to be mine.

310
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,860
So after faking your death,

311
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,010
you waited for the right moment
to imprison your brother?

312
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,379
So Chuchu's nightmare

313
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,349
wasn't just a dream, right?

314
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,380
It was what actually happened, right?

315
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,050
You never planned to kill your brother.

316
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:30,900
You were just afraid Tan Aiqiu wouldn't
be able to handle the truth.

317
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,770
Coffee.

318
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,250
Thanks.

319
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,619
Fang Jinshan swapped his identity
with his brother

320
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,050
because of his love for Tan Aiqiu

321
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,010
And then, for the same reason,

322
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,900
he swapped it back.

323
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,180
But that's not love.

324
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,180
That's selfishness.

325
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,290
Do you think Tan Aiqiu knows?

326
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,570
Are you crazy?

327
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,400
No matter how well
someone imitates another person,

328
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,620
there are things in an intimate relationship
that just can't be faked.

329
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,250
If Tan Aiqiu lived with him,

330
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,140
she would've figured it out.

331
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,460
I see.

332
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,139
Hello, Carlos.

333
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,050
I need a favor.

334
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,010
Can you send me the relevant documents?

335
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,029
Carlos checked.

336
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,459
Ralf did promise
to accept a female Chinese student.

337
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,699
But before he could, he passed away.

338
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,029
His widow then passed on
his theories to this student.

339
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,660
But only she knew about it.

340
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,620
No one else.

341
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,290
This female student...

342
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,810
Yes, it was Luo Yifei.

343
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,939
Everything makes sense now.

344
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,380
But she's about to leave the country.

345
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,589
That means we don't have much time.

346
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:23,180
So we must find evidence
before she leaves.

347
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,349
Yes,

348
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,250
before she leaves the country.

349
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,900
Solid proof?

350
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,979
But the case is already closed.

351
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,900
Meng Zhengyi was only the scapegoat.

352
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,420
The real mastermind is Luo Yifei.

353
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,050
Where's the proof?

354
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,620
Police always talk
about evidence, right?

355
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,770
Luo Yifei was a student

356
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,140
of the psychology expert Hermann.

357
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,659
That's how she was able
to pass my lie detection

358
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,939
and manipulate Meng Zhengyi
into doing her bidding,

359
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,109
only to throw him under the bus

360
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,900
in the end.

361
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,460
That only proves she studied psychology.

362
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,100
That's why I need to find evidence.

363
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,770
I hope you can help me.

364
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,330
My sister has been gone for four years.

365
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,530
Do you know what I've been through
these past four years?

366
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,970
Where were you?

367
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,900
I spent a whole year looking for her.

368
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,320
I sent her countless messages.
But she never replied.

369
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,440
It was like she had become
a completely different person

370
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,570
I did suspect Luo Yifei before.

371
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,940
I even investigated her in secret.

372
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,309
But do you know

373
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,839
what it's like having someone
by your side

374
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,840
when you're at your lowest
and completely helpless?

375
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,420
When you're on the brink of death,
someone is willing to risk their life for you.

376
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,100
Would I still doubt her?

377
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,180
And today...

378
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,940
We're getting engaged today.

379
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,940
Can't you just wish me happiness?

380
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,290
I'm sorry for what happened before.

381
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,250
I know you're getting engaged,

382
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,010
and I truly hope you'll be happy.

383
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,800
But have you ever considered

384
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,440
that the person you're about
to spend the rest of your life with

385
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,900
might be the one who killed your sister?

386
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,419
I'll get you some water.

387
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,660
Ning Zhiyuan!

388
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,789
Have you ever thought about this?

389
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,309
All the evidence against Meng Zhengyi

390
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,619
came from Luo Yifei.

391
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,139
How could he possibly
use his own crimes to control her?

392
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,379
It never posed a real threat to her.

393
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,660
She made all of it up.

394
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,860
So, why not verify it?

395
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,029
I only need to know

396
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,940
if Ning Jing and Luo Yifei
ever crossed paths before.

397
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,970
Do this for your sister.

398
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,570
Or if not for her, then at least
to clear Luo Yifei's name.

399
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,730
Just give me one chance.

400
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:07,400
(Gongmen Gorge Police Station)

401
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,010
From now on,

402
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:12,290
I'll help you remember
what happened four years ago.

403
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,660
Ning Jing's incident happened
on May 21st.

404
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,050
So let's start from the day before,
which is May 20th.

405
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,620
What do you remember?

406
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,970
What's your problem?

407
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,029
I just don't get it.

408
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,589
Why do I have to be your brother?

409
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,139
Am I not allowed to have a say anymore?

410
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,290
Yeah.

411
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,330
Zhiyuan.

412
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,050
Zhiyuan!

413
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,290
Zhiyuan!

414
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,620
I had a small argument with my sister.

415
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,900
What was it about?

416
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,970
You.

417
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,349
At the time,
I wanted to confess my feelings to you.

418
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:02,140
So I asked my sister for advice.

419
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,330
But she didn't think it was a good idea.

420
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,730
Were you with her the whole day?

421
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,250
Yes.

422
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,349
We were at home all day.

423
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,140
My sister stayed in her room
and didn't go out.

424
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,699
Then let's go back

425
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,770
to May 19th.

426
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,730
Were you with Ning Jing
the whole time that day too?

427
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,900
May 19th... I think...

428
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,509
Captain Ding,

429
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:43,010
Mochou already told me why you're here.

430
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,939
I've pulled

431
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,459
all the cases Captain Ning handled
four years ago.

432
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,900
Let me know

433
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,899
if you need anything.

434
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,979
Thanks, I appreciate it.

435
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,140
No problem.

436
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,530
May 19th...

437
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,380
Yeah, we were together.

438
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,810
Yeah.

439
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,530
Are you sure?

440
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,269
Yeah.

441
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,619
The day before...

442
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,180
The day before May 19th...

443
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,380
I took my sister to the movies.

444
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:32,109
I remember it was a really hot day.

445
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,380
It can put you in a good mood, right?

446
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,029
Slow down.

447
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,380
Don't run!

448
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:39,789
Sorry!

449
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,869
I'm so sorry!

450
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:41,979
It's okay.

451
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,180
The ice cream spilled on me.

452
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,100
Oh, right.

453
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,250
My sister got a phone call that day.

454
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,100
She was on the phone
for about five minutes.

455
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,069
Wipe it off.

456
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,970
Okay.

457
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,460
Hello?

458
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,730
She looked really serious
after that call.

459
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,459
She told me it was about work.

460
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,420
But I had a feeling
it wasn't that simple.

461
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,460
Work?

462
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,330
Ning Jing had two phones.

463
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,979
One for work

464
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,699
and one for personal use.

465
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,010
Which phone did she get the call?

466
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,490
Work...

467
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,419
I mean her personal phone

468
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,660
because she had a logo sticker
on the back of her phone.

469
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,029
Yes, Mochou.

470
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,010
Ding Wei.,

471
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,459
can you look into

472
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,419
Ning Jing's personal phone records

473
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,749
on May 19, 2018?

474
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,460
Find out who called her
about work that day.

475
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,100
Hold on, let me check.

476
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,589
Got it.

477
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:10,459
On May 19, 2018, at 4:30 PM,
there was a call from a number registered

478
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,549
to Li Hui.

479
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,749
Li Hui?

480
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,900
