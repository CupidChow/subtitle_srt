But I haven't been able
to piece it all together yet.

I must be missing something.

(One Million Yuan Cash)

38
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,740
One million yuan in cash was withdrawn
from AgBank on Chengjiao Street.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,140
The massacre of Mr. Bao's entire family
is on the news. Everyone knows about it.

40
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,479
Mr. Bao and I were
just business partners, nothing more.

41
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,669
A while ago, he told me
he was having financial troubles

42
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,340
and needed cash urgently.

43
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,990
So he came to me for help.

44
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,950
Here's his IOU.

45
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,479
His credit score didn't look too good.

46
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,620
So I was worried
it might affect my company.

47
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,430
That's why I did it off the books
and withdrew the money in cash instead.

I don't usually throw up.

54

00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,950

It's normal for a guy to be timid.

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,220

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,660

00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,900
Come on.

66
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,240
- Just remember not to...
- Yeah, I got it.

67
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:05,415
Take a photo of this.

68
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,327
Okay, got it.

69
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,039
You're here. Captain.

70
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,959
Captain Ding.

71
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,229
The victim, Ni Yadong, age 49,

72
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,200
was a signed artist
under Jingshang Entertainment.

73
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,560
Initial assessment suggests
he died from a high-altitude fall.

74
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,150
Captain, this is the video she recorded.

75
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,109
Zhao Xiaohui, right?

76
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:20,919
So, tell me.

77
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,229
How did you know
the victim was skydiving today?

78
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,159
Officer,

79
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,109
this has nothing to do with me.

80
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,510
It was an accident.

81
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,429
Relax,

82
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,279
you're just a witness.

83
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,830
I'm only asking some questions.

84
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,519
Just tell us what you know.

85
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,510
I'm a fan site master
for "With Lu, There's Ni".

86
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,799
What? Fan site master?

87
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,540
The leader of a fan club

88
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,989
Then "With Lu, There's Ni?"

89
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,669
It's the couple's name
for Qin Luyao and Ni Yadong.

90
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,359
Lu is from Qin Luyao

91
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,869
and Ni is from Ni Yadong.

92
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,479
I see. It all started with a variety show
they were on together.

93
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,159
- Then they...
- Yes, that's it.

94
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,359
You see.

95
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,799
They looked like a real couple

96
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,279
in the show.

97
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,989
As fans, we were invested in it.

98
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,159
Isn't that only a reality show?

99
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,749
Well, I've seen it trending online.

100
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,959
I think it's real.

101
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,870
They were really dating.

102
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,069
After they developed feelings
at the show,

103
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,629
they actually started dating.

104
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,780
Let's get back to the video.

105
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,519
Ni Yadong's agent told me

106
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,429
Ni Yadong was going to propose

107
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,549
while skydiving

108
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,959
and asked me to record it

109
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,900
for publicity.

110
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,020
That's all I know.

111
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:27,959
Ms. Wei,

112
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,429
we confirmed

113
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,549
that the victim took off

114
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,270
from Xingxiang Skydiving Club at 10 AM.

115
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,220
Okay.

116
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,629
Bring in his agent for questioning.

117
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,629
Then we'll head to the skydiving club.

118
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,220
Yes, madam.

119
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,919
Oh, Tiaotiao.

120
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,799
check if Li Mochou's meeting is over.

121
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,109
If it is, tell her to meet me
at the skydiving club.

122
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,869
Yes, madam.

123
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,669
Officer,

124
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,359
we really had nothing to do with this.

125
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,869
Mr. Ni just used our helicopter.

126
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,460
We weren't involved in anything else.

127
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,100
Didn't you inspect his parachute?

128
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,959
He brought his own gear

129
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,900
and maintained it himself.

130
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,150
So

131
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,310
we only did a basic security check.

132
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,989
But he was a bit of a clean freak.

133
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,799
He didn't like

134
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,150
anyone touching his equipment.

135
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,989
He notified us in advance
of today's trip.

136
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,479
So

137
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,630
he was the only one preparing
his gear today.

138
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,510
Anran. Tiaotiao.

139
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,870
Check the surveillance footage.

140
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,020
- Yes, madam.
- Yes, madam.

141
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,950
Ding Wei.

142
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,510
you're here.

143
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,270
I've been briefed on the case.
Any new findings?

144
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,359
This is Mr. Lai,

145
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,159
the club manager.

146
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,839
According to him,

147
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,629
the victim brought his own gear

148
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,869
and refused an inspection.

149
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,630
He only used their helicopter.

150
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,799
Yes, that's correct.

151
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,519
Given Mr. Ni's expertise,

152
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,870
there's only so much we can offer.

153
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,270
Given his expertise?

154
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,109
Can you give me

155
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,399
an idea of his skill level?

156
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,109
Or is there

157
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,669
any chance

158
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,660
that he made an operational mistake?

159
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,480
That's unlikely.

160
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,479
Having an expert like Mr. Ni
to train our coaches

161
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,120
is already a bit of a waste
of his talent.

162
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,220
Ah, one more thing.
Please wait a moment.

163
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,340
This is a well-respected magazine
in our industry.

164
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,599
Mr. Ni was one of the main editors.

165
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,150
He focused on practical training
and real-world techniques.

166
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,479
So, you're saying

167
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,540
the chances of this being
an accident are very low.

168
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,750
I wouldn't say impossible.

169
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,759
But modern skydiving gear

170
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,919
is much safer and easier

171
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,020
to operate than before.

172
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,990
I still can't believe
Mr. Ni had an accident.

173
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,709
Can you tell me

174
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,540
his mental state before the jump?

175
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,279
He seemed completely normal.

176
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,540
He even said that after the proposal,
he'd invite everyone to his wedding.

177
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,060
He looked really happy.

178
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,119
Ms. Wei, we checked the footage.

179
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,660
We found nothing unusual so far.

180
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,300
Hello?

181
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,900
Okay, got it.

182
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,110
Anran. Tiaotiao.

183
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,709
stay here.

184
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,919
Do another thorough search

185
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,549
and see if we missed anything.

186
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,069
Yes, madam.

187
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,999
Ms. Li and I will head back
to the station to talk to the victim's agent.

188
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,759
I want a detailed report
on his mental state before his death.

189
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,879
Okay.

190
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,020
Please come with me.

191
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,390
Ms. Fang,

192
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,110
how much do actors make a month?

193
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,429
What about the food on set?

194
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,469
Officer Yue,

195
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,669
how much longer do I have to wait?

196
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,709
Now that Yadong is gone,

197
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,189
I have a lot of work to deal with
at the company.

198
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,469
Captain Ding is on her way.

199
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,469
The traffic is a bit congested
at this time.

200
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,039
Be patient.

201
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,919
She'll be here soon.

202
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,829
How about this?

203
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,879
I'll go back
and handle some urgent matters.

204
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,260
- Then I'll come back later.
- Wait.

205
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,100
You can't leave.
This is a police investigation.

206
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,350
You can't leave anyhow you want.

207
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,080
- Hey.
- You're finally here.

208
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,749
Sorry, I'm late. We got stuck in traffic.

209
00:09:55,749 --> 00:09:58,600
Hello, I'm Ding Wei. Captain
of the Baizhou Criminal Investigation Team.

210
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,940
I'm Li Mochou.

211
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,429
I'll leave you guys to talk.

212
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,540
I'll be outside.

213
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,399
Captain Ding,

214
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,069
can we finish this quickly?

215
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,069
I have a lot

216
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:10,669
to deal with

217
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,069
at the company.

218
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,069
Okay, I'll go straight to the point.

219
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,519
Before the victim's death...

220
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,300
Can you just call him Yadong?

221
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,940
Calling him "the victim" feels
too harsh.

222
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,940
Did Mr. Ni Yadong have any enemies?

223
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,309
No. Yadong had

224
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,150
a great reputation.

225
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,510
He was well-liked.

226
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,180
Even if there were occasional conflicts
over work opportunities,

227
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,780
it was never serious enough
to take his life.

228
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,399
Let me remind you

229
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,879
that we're questioning you
as part of a murder investigation,

230
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,469
not a press interview.

231
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,469
If we find out you're hiding the truth,

232
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,270
you could be facing criminal charges.

233
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,900
I swear I'm not hiding anything.

234
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,549
But does online threat

235
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,549
count?

236
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,350
What kind of threats?

237
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,799
Someone left comments
under Yadong's Weibo saying

238
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,630
he would get what was coming to him.

239
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,420
Can you be more specific?

240
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,270
It all started because of Qin Luyao.

241
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,309
Ni Yadong's girlfriend?

242
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,420
Yes.

243
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,150
They confirmed their relationship
six months ago.

244
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,660
Yadong was 16 years older
than Qin Luyao.

245
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,309
Even though Luyao is new
to the industry,

246
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,709
she has a fan base.

247
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,759
Some of her fans

248
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,349
didn't like Yadong

249
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,399
and constantly attacked him
on social media.

250
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,799
Other than online harassment,

251
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,060
was there any physical threat?

252
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,549
Not really.

253
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,709
Sometimes,

254
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,799
someone in a crowd would yell at him.

255
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,999
But

256
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,420
it was mostly online.

257
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,429
Yadong told us to ignore it.

258
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,660
So we never reported it.

259
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,279
Qin Luyao also

260
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,020
told her fans to stay calm.

261
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,309
But it didn't seem to help much.

262
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,799
Was there any specific comment

263
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,940
that stood out to you?

264
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:05,230
There was one user with the name
"Ni Yadong Rots in Misery."

265
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,630
He constantly insulted Yadong

266
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,540
and even threatened revenge.

267
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,829
But Yadong thought

268
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,180
it was just some immature kid

269
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,119
trying to talk tough

270
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,239
online.

271
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,990
So he blacklisted the user and moved on.

272
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,940
Could that person have killed Yadong?

273
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,189
The investigation

274
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,069
has only started.

275
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,999
So we can't say much yet.

276
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,709
But Ms. Fang,

277
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,349
I'd suggest you stay in the country

278
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,150
in case we need to contact you again.

279
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,300
I understand.

280
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,600
Captain Ding, found him.

281
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,689
Domestic or international?
Is he within the province?

282
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:43,709
Luckily, he's in this city.

283
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,639
I'll send you the location.

284
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,589
That's great.

285
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,870
We've found the person
who harassed Ni Yadong online.

286
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,940
Okay.

287
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,940
Tao!

288
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,540
Get back here! Why did you run so far?

289
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,239
When you push him,
put some force into it!

290
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,230
Can you?

291
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,150
Afraid to push harder?

292
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,110
Use more force!

293
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,069
Again!

294
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,510
3. 2. 1. Action!

295
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,150
Hey, extra!

296
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,350
That fall looked so fake.

297
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,069
Can't you put in more effort?
Did you not eat today?

298
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:18,949
Sorry, Director.

299
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,820
And you call yourself an actor?
Who hired you?

300
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,660
Get back here and do it again!

301
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,350
Hurry up!

302
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,309
All right!

303
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,750
Good take!

304
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,110
Ding Hao, right?

305
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,700
We're the police.

306
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,239
We need you to cooperate

307
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,630
and come with us.

308
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,039
I was just venting online.

309
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,279
I can't even kill a chicken,

310
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,990
let alone a person.

311
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,540
That's not necessarily true.

312
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,119
You're an actor.

313
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,039
What if this "innocent" act
is just a performance?

314
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,429
What?

315
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,189
Officer, don't make things up.

316
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,519
I'm not even a real actor,
just an extra.

317
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,780
I usually play the guy who gets killed.

318
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,189
I swear I was just venting online.

319
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,630
I didn't kill anyone.

320
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,239
You like Qin Luyao

321
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,780
not just as a fan,

322
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,039
but some romantic feelings.

323
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,829
Am I right?

324
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,940
I admit

325
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,990
I like Qin Luyao.

326
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,470
Everyone likes her.

327
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,239
Last year, I was in a scene

328
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,540
with the second female lead.

329
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,180
It was her.

330
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,279
She was so kind

331
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,829
and took care of me.

332
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,750
So I started liking her.

333
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,829
Is that a crime?

334
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,990
No.

335
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,469
The problem is,
she chose to be with Ni Yadong.

336
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,390
So you hated him for it

337
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,589
and planned his murder.

338
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,669
No, I didn't do it.

339
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,399
I wasn't happy about it at first.

340
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,390
He's way too old for her.

341
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,189
But then who am I

342
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,350
to care about their business?

343
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,039
But later, I heard people say

344
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,420
Qin Luyao didn't
actually like Ni Yadong.

345
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,750
That he used his status in the industry

346
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,540
to force her into a fake relationship.

347
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,549
That was
when I started insulting him online.

348
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,020
Who told you that?

349
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,350
It was a rumor going around.

350
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,799
But I don't know who exactly started it.

351
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,159
So you hated Ni Yadong

352
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,750
over some baseless gossip?

353
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,799
Yes, I hated him.

354
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,189
But I didn't kill him.

355
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,999
I... I... I wouldn't dare.

356
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,020
Come in.

357
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,750
Captain Ding,

358
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,880
we tracked his whereabouts
for the past two weeks.

359
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,009
He was on set the whole time.

360
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:34,020
There was no opportunity for him
to commit the crime.

361
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,779
I think we can rule him out.

362
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,650
(Lu, the Universe's Most Beautiful)

363
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,780
Move!

364
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,630
Step aside! Excuse me!

365
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,390
Qin Luyao! Qin Luyao! Qin Luyao!

366
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,709
Hello, Captain Ding.

367
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,999
Luyao! Qin Luyao!

368
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,700
We just got here and on our way up.

369
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,660
Her agent just called and said
Qin Luyao is trying to kill herself.

370
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,239
Luyao,

371
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,469
come down!

372
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,069
It's too dangerous!

373
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,949
Don't do this!

374
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,999
Please get down from there.

375
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,279
Come down!

376
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,159
Police.

377
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,159
What's going on?

378
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,300
Officer,

379
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,309
Ni Yadong told me

380
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,940
he had a surprise planned
for Luyao today.

381
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,429
But he died,

382
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,039
and in such a tragic way.

383
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,159
Luyao broke down completely.

384
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,750
Please talk to her.

385
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,799
Help me figure this out.

386
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,940
Don't come any closer.

387
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,390
You know?

388
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,390
At first,

389
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,420
I never thought
I'd have anything to do with him.

390
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,590
But he was so good to me.

391
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,709
He taught me how to act,

392
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,309
read poetry to me,

393
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,020
and showed me the ropes
in this industry.

394
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,020
People said our relationship was fake

395
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,270
and it was only a publicity stunt.

396
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,780
They say he only wanted
to revive his career

397
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,750
and I just wanted to climb the ladder.

398
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,780
So he planned to propose to me

399
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,940
to prove to the world
that his love was real.

400
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,350
He was supposed
to give me a surprise today.

401
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,799
But instead,

402
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,390
he left me without saying

403
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,820
any final word.

404
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,900
I know losing Ni Yadong is painful.

405
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,740
But I'm sure

406
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:06,719
your fans

407
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,420
don't want to see another tragedy.

408
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,630
Ni Yadong wouldn't want this either.

409
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,180
He loved you.

410
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,420
Your fans love you.

411
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,830
You need to keep living for them.

412
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,980
Don't you agree?

413
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,439
Master,

414
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,759
you were quiet throughout the drive.

415
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,150
Is something bothering you?

416
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,109
Oh.

417
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,039
Master,

418
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,759
don't you think

419
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,349
Qin Luyao might be lying?

420
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,279
Or maybe she had plastic surgery?

421
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,790
Her facial expressions seem stiff.

422
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,959
Did I analyze that right? Was I right?

423
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,589
Yes.

424
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,799
Based on what we have so far,

425
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,830
that's how it looks.

426
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,799
Right now, it seems Ni Yadong's death

427
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,700
was most likely an accident.

428
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,389
Let's wait for Tech Liu's report.

429
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,550
If nothing suspicious turns up,
then we can confirm it was an accident.

430
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,310
What do you think, Mochou?

431
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,550
I'll go with your call.

432
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,719
Let's wait for the report.

433
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,870
Then we will wait.

434
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,629
Oh?

435
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,279
Everyone's here.

436
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,959
Nice.

437
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,149
Tech Liu, you're finally here.

438
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,719
So?

439
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,349
Was it an accident? If it was, I'll go home.
My mom's waiting for me to have dinner.

440
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,830
According to our investigation,

441
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,519
Ni Yadong's parachute equipment

442
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,070
shows clear signs of tampering.

443
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,030
It looks like
you're not getting off work just yet.

444
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,110
Let me call my mom real quick.

445
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,959
Last time,

446
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,439
you asked me
if Ni Yadong had any enemies.

447
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,390
Well, there's one more person.

448
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,390
Why didn't you mention this earlier?

449
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,589
I didn't dare to suspect him.

450
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,759
Who is it?

451
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,479
Our boss,

452
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,790
Shen Xin.

453
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,110
What kind

454
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,180
of conflict would he have
with Ni Yadong?

455
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,439
Ni Yadong's contract
was about to expire.

456
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,260
Over the past five years, Yadong hasn't
made much money for the company.

457
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,109
So the company

458
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,829
didn't really care about him.

459
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,759
But after his relationship
with Qin Luyao blew up six months ago,

460
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,390
his value skyrocketed.

461
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,320
Ni Yadong planned to leave the company
when his contract ended

462
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,349
and take me with him.

463
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,109
But Mr. Shen wouldn't let him go.

464
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,110
They even had a huge argument over it.

465
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,629
When did this happen?

466
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,350
On the 16th of last month.

467
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,999
I went to deliver a contract to Mr. Shen

468
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,460
and noticed Ni Yadong was there too.

469
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,940
Mr. Shen?

470
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,070
Mr. Shen.

471
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,180
Mr. Shen, I brought your contract.

472
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,940
You ungrateful rascal!

473
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,309
If it weren't for me,

474
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,700
you'd have been hacked to pieces
by the loan sharks!

475
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,660
I've paid off everything I owed.

476
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,590
I only want

477
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,700
my freedom.

478
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,110
Ni Yadong,

479
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,870
listen here.

480
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,759
Stay with the company,

481
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,629
and I'll make you a star again.

482
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,589
But if you dare bring up leaving
one more time,

483
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,800
I'll make sure you're nothing
but a pile of rotting flesh!

484
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,660
Okay.

485
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,109
We've got the gist of it.

486
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,630
We'll go back and verify everything.

487
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,220
Is there anything else you want to add?

488
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,759
Before every skydiving session,

489
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,310
Ni Yadong would always go
to a hot spring club.

490
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,829
He would book a room under my name.

491
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,420
Is this information useful?

492
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,999
Which club?

493
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,150
Baisha Hot Spring Club.

494
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,309
Ms. Wei,

495
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:52,149
this is Baisha Hot Spring Club's
underground parking lot.

496
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,519
After Ni Yadong parked his car,

497
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,110
he got off right after.

498
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,959
About an hour and a half later,

499
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,799
Shen Xin arrived

500
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,660
and took Ni Yadong's parachute equipment
from the trunk.

501
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,629
An hour later,

502
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,280
Shen Xin returned and put
the parachute equipment back in the car.

503
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,619
But after investigating,
we found out it was a company car

504
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:10,149
assigned to Ni Yadong.

505
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,239
So it's not surprising
that Shen Xin had a key.

506
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,320
If he was gone for a full hour,

507
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,240
that would've been enough time
to tamper with the equipment.

508
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,110
So if we bring in Shen Xin,
the case is solved.

509
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,350
Hello?

510
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,030
Okay.

511
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,740
I'll leave the crime scene to you.

512
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,030
What's wrong?

513
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,980
Shen Xin is dead.

514
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,439
His face is pale.

515
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,460
He's likely poisoned.

516
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,790
Take a photo of the edge of his clothes.

517
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,590
Yue.

518
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,549
Is this Shen Xin?

519
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,500
Yes.

520
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,220
Find anything?

521
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,030
There's a folder here.

522
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,390
It was the last thing he looked at
before he died.

523
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,390
It's password-protected.

524
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,740
Then we'll take it back and decrypt it.

525
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,030
What's the matter?

526
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,220
I suspect it's a reflection
from a camera lens.

527
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,679
I think someone captured what happened

528
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,439
before we got here.

529
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,260
Probably some tabloid reporters.

530
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,180
If they got something,
they'll post it soon.

531
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,630
I'll keep an eye on it.

532
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:05,450
(Baizhou Criminal Investigation Team)

533
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,050
(Criminal Case Summary)

00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,690
(Matchmaking Event)

535
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,959
(Police)

536
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,679
Ms. Wei, the cause of death is confirmed.

537
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,759
He died from poison.

538
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,069
It was botulinum.

539
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,149
Botulinum?

540
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,840
Yes, the same stuff used
in cosmetic procedures. It's crazy expensive.

541
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,759
But in this dose, it's lethal.

542
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,039
The estimated time of death

543
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,180
was between 6:30 and 7 PM
the day before yesterday.

544
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,790
Hello?

545
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,180
Do you see what I see?

546
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,829
No.

547
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,980
No.

548
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,790
So far,

549
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,940
this is the most expensive poison
in Baizhou's history.

550
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,759
Liu,

551
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,349
stop being dramatic

552
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,550
and get to the point.

553
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,630
Captain Ding,

554
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,519
someone drilled

555
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,350
a tiny hole into it,

556
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,830
used a syringe to inject the toxin,

557
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,149
and then sealed it with glass powder

558
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,940
before replacing the label.

559
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,239
So someone poisoned the whiskey?

560
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,350
Yes.

561
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,629
Good.

562
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,790
Then we start with the whiskey.

563
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,420
If we find out who last handled it

564
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,439
before Shen Xin,

565
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,759
we'll have a lead.

566
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,900
Captain Ding,

567
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,740
you're the expert

568
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,199
at solving crimes.

569
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,460
But when it comes to whiskey,

570
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,479
I can actually give you some information

571
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,700
to help you narrow things down.

572
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,460
Then tell me.

573
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,740
If I'm not mistaken,

574
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,629
this bottle of whiskey

575
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,069
should be the one

576
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,830
auctioned in Hong Kong last month.

577
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,239
The final price

578
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,150
was about 2.8 million yuan.

579
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,479
That's why I said

580
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,629
it's the most expensive poison

581
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,180
in Baizhou's history.

582
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,109
But

583
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,999
whiskey all looks the same.

584
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,150
Oh, no no no.

585
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,700
See this?

586
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,679
Oh, there's a serial number.

587
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,589
This bottle has a unique identifier.

588
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,549
This sort of whiskey

589
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,199
is only produced in limited batches.

590
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,350
The serial number is one of a kind.

591
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,149
Do you know who bid for it?

592
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,830
That, I don't know.
You'll have to find out yourselves.

593
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,629
Anran, track the source of this whiskey.

594
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,679
Tiaotiao, you and Mochou go over

595
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,829
every lead we have
to see if we missed anything.

596
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,149
We still don't have any solid evidence
to close the case.

597
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,220
- Yes, madam.
- Yes, madam.

598
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,759
Today, we tracked down the paparazzo

599
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,829
who captured photos of the scene
of Shen Xin's death

600
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,349
and got a video from him.

601
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,390
Let's watch it together. Anran, play it.

602
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,199
Two things stand out in this footage.

603
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,759
First,

604
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,030
the whiskey is poisoned

605
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,869
and we already confirmed that

606
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,069
with Tech Liu.

607
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,479
Second, whatever Shen Xin was burning

608
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,549
must have been a secret
he wanted to destroy.

609
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:28,110
Could it be the password
to his computer files?

610
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,759
Tech Liu said

611
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,349
the password was highly complex

612
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,999
and unusually long.

613
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,589
So I think

614
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,799
he probably wrote
something difficult to remember

615
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,220
on a paper.

616
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,869
Tech Liu is still trying
to crack Shen Xin's computer.

617
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:42,279
In the meantime,
we need to interrogate the paparazzo.

618
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,760
He might have more useful information.

619
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,550
Did you take the photos?

620
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,920
Yes, madam.

621
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,840
You saw Shen Xin getting poisoned.
Why didn't you call the police?

622
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,239
Poisoned? I thought he was just drunk.

623
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,500
Do you know
taking secret photos is illegal?

624
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,980
I know.

625
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,900
How long have you been following him?
What did you capture?

626
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,829
Nothing much.

627
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,279
Nothing at all?

628
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:03,869
Yeah.

629
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,679
If you won't tell the truth,
that's fine.

630
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,629
Captain Ding,

631
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,549
let's contact the cyber police.

632
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,240
We'll personally check every gossip site
and entertainment news outlet

633
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,629
he's worked with. What do you think?

634
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,729
- Okay.
- Okay, let's do it.

635
00:28:13,729 --> 00:28:14,199
Hey, wait.

636
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,390
Please don't.

637
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,829
You'll ruin my livelihood.

638
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,239
Then give me the information I want,

639
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,549
and I might reconsider.

640
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,869
About half a month ago,

641
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,869
I followed Shen Xin.

642
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,069
He drove Ni Yadong and Qin Luyao
to a villa.

643
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,719
Then he left the villa by himself.

644
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,940
What happened after that?

645
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,830
That's all.

646
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,069
That's it?

647
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,279
Yes. Once they went inside,

648
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,549
the doors were locked,
and the curtains were shut.

649
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,110
I couldn't capture a thing.

650
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,629
I waited for three hours.

651
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,069
Around 2 AM,

652
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,069
Qin Luyao's agent, Ma Li, picked her up.

653
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,389
Then at 8 AM,

654
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,030
Ni Yadong left on his own.

655
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,120
Why didn't you publish the story
at that time?

656
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,350
I wanted to wait for something bigger.

657
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,980
Just photos of them
at the same villa didn't mean much

658
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,380
because they had already gone public
with their relationship.

659
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,120
The websites wouldn't pay much
and it would just attract competition.

660
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,660
What "bigger" story were you hoping for?

661
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,070
Something

662
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,790
without the curtains closed.

663
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,350
- Then did you capture any?
- No.

664
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,350
Qin Luyao never came back after that.

665
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,999
I waited for over a month.

666
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,039
Every day,
I just saw Shen Xin drinking alone.

667
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,459
We were about to give up.

668
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,930
(Interrogation Room)

669
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,900
Why would Shen Xin

670
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,959
bring them

671
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,630
to his place?

672
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,799
Wasn't he against Ni Yadong

673
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,900
and Qin Luyao being together?

674
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,279
Maybe there's more to the story.

675
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,439
We will need to ask the people
around them to find out.

676
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,629
Or we can bring in Fang Hua
for questioning.

677
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,600
Ms. Wei, we just got an update
from Hong Kong.

678
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,979
The person who bid on that bottle
of whiskey was Luo Yifei.

679
00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:39,589
Luo Yifei?

680
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,260
Yes.

681
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,180
Is there anything unusual
about Luo Yifei?

682
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,700
At least, she didn't lie

683
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,550
about the whiskey.

684
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,630
But based on what we've uncovered,

685
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,279
Ni Yadong sent poisoned whiskey
to Shen Xin,

686
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,239
and Shen Xin tampered
with Ni Yadong's parachute.

687
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,679
Both of them clearly wanted

688
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,980
each other dead.

689
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,279
But something doesn't add up.

690
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,700
What is?

691
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,549
It just wasn't worth it.

692
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:17,349
Ni Yadong's contract with Shen Xin
only had a few months left.

693
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,589
So he had no reason
to buy poisoned whiskey

694
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,829
to kill Shen Xin.

695
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,840
And yesterday, I rewatched all the footage
of Ni Yadong and Qin Luyao together.

696
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,980
I noticed something wrong.

697
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:29,830
Qin Luyao never loved Ni Yadong.

698
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,180
I didn't love Ni Yadong?

699
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:35,759
Madam, I was so heartbroken
I almost took my own life.

700
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,790
You were the one who saved me.

701
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,549
What makes you think I didn't love him?

702
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,629
What gives you the right
to assume our relationship

703
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,790
was just for show?

704
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,220
That's right, madam.

705
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,349
If Yadong hadn't had that accident,

706
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:50,349
Luyao would've accepted
his proposal by now.

707
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,900
They were already discussing
their wedding plans.

708
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,350
Hm.

709
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,959
When someone is in love,

710
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,239
they instinctively show affection.

711
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,679
I watched every video
and photo of you two.

712
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,349
Whether staged or taken in secret.

713
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,790
you were guarded around him.

714
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,110
How do you explain this?

715
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,940
I don't need
to explain my feelings to you.

716
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,550
Can you guys leave?

717
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,389
If you insist on questioning
her more,

718
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,279
I request for a lawyer to be present.

719
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,900
That won't be necessary.
We're done here.

720
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,679
Master,

721
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,199
it looks like

722
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,740
you were right.

723
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,550
Qin Luyao never loved Ni Yadong.

724
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,110
Wow, her acting is incredible.

725
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,909
Guess what?

726
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,109
The suicide story

727
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,909
is going viral.

728
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,070
The traffic is insane.

729
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,790
If she didn't love Ni Yadong,

730
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,350
why accept his proposal?

731
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,549
Maybe the fake marriage
was just for show.

732
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,869
Think about it, one proposal,

733
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:53,999
