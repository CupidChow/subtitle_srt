This project will definitely
be prioritized next year.

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,249
That's why we must pay attention to it.

30
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,320
Alright.

31
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,190
Zhiyuan.

32
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,999
Are you free?

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,649
I have something to ask you.

34
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,440
- Sure.
- You can ask him here.

35
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,599
How's your relationship
with Bao Jiexi in private?

36
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,890
We're purely business partners.

37
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,310
We don't know each other that well.
We merely met several times.

38
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,770
I've already told you everything I knew
in the police station.

39
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,810
So, you guys met each other
several times in private.

40
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,399
Did you two contact each other in private?
Or did your secretaries make the arrangement?

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,249
Our secretaries.

42
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,840
Did he tell your secretary
that he wanted to borrow money from you?

43
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,319
No.

44
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,200
So, he borrowed money from you directly.

45
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,279
Zhiyuan. Falsifying testimony
is a criminal offense.

46
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,790
You were lying just now.

47
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,089
Why are you still...

48
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,439
Mochou, regarding your question,

49
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,840
I can answer it on his behalf.

50
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,689
The sum

51
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,719
was handed to Mr. Bao by Zhiyuan.

52
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,440
Our vice CEO, Mr. Meng Zhengyi,
gave the order using my name.

53
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,050
Mr. Meng was afraid that our
company's reputation might be affected.

54
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,190
That's why he didn't lend it to him
using his own name.

55
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,529
As for the misunderstandings
that had occurred,

56
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,070
I'm truly sorry about them.

57
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,319
And,

58
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,439
my boyfriend

59
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,049
doesn't know the details of the matter.

60
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,649
He hid the truth from you all
in order to protect me.

61
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,950
I'm truly sorry about that.

62
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,439
So, Mochou,

63
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,649
if you still need us
to cooperate with your investigation,

64
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,839
please provide us with
a formal investigation notice.

65
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,400
Zhiyuan and I will definitely do our best
to cooperate with you.

66
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,839
No problem.

67
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,399
Sorry about that.

68
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,790
Sorry for bothering you two.

69
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,000
Not at all.

70
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,880
Let's go.

71
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,750
Time to go.

72
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,630
Meng Zhengyi?

73
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,880
That's right.

74
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,279
Meng Zhengyi,
vice CEO of Tianxiang Group,

75
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,689
instructed Ning Zhiyuan to hand
the money to Bao Xijie under Luo Yifei's name.

76
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,399
It's a huge detour.

77
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,529
In conclusion,

78
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,049
Bao Xijie received
a huge sum on his birthday.

79
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,550
And, it was in the form of cash.

80
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,199
He brought the money to the hotel.

81
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,289
After that, Li Guangrong
murdered Bao Xijie and his family

82
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,550
and took the money while he was there.

83
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,670
Isn't this too much of a coincidence?

84
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,280
And, there are questionable points
throughout the case.

85
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,879
Was Li Guangrong hired

86
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,119
to murder Bao Xijie?

87
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,470
Or was it just a random event?

88
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,609
The entrance of our bureau
was surrounded by reporters

89
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,280
just a few hours
after Bao Xijie's death.

90
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,230
Who leaked the news to them?

91
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,920
Are you saying that there's a mastermind
behind Li Guangrong's action?

92
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,489
And, after the victim's death,

93
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,199
someone incited the public

94
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,199
in order to end the case
as soon as possible, right?

95
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,350
That's right.

96
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,110
I'll request a communication
with the Interpol.

97
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,639
Li Guangrong
had been active abroad all this while.

98
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,689
If Meng Zhengyi did contact him before,

99
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,040
I'm sure we can find traces of it.

Contact Tech Liu.

106
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,169
Have them try all the codes
from the bottles in the victim's home

107
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,289
as passwords.

108
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,200
Alright.

109
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,609
Master.

110
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,040
They found the password.

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,999
Alright. That's enough.

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,199
This video answered
my previous question.

113
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,519
It explained why Shen Xin wanted to stop
Ni Yadong from proposing.

114
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,049
It's because once Ni Yadong
succeeds in the proposal,

115
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,970
the threat that this video will pose
to them will be reduced significantly.

116
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,119
This explains why Ni Yadong purchased
liquor and laced it with poison

117
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,870
in order to kill Shen Xin.

118
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,350
Since Shen Xin couldn't stop him,
he tampered with Ni Yadong's parachute.

119
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,160
So, is the case solved, then?

120
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,350
When did Ni Yadong deliver
the liquor to Shen Xin?

121
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,199
According to the video information, the video
was shot about half a month ago.

122
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,609
This matches the period
Ni Yadong and Qin Luyao

123
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,849
entered the villa.

124
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:42,790
Something's off.

125
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:48,160
It was an excellent bottle of liquor.
And, it was Shen Xin's favorite liquor.

126
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,639
But from what Fang Hua told us,
over the past half month,

127
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,000
not only did their relationship fail
to improve, but it also became more intense.

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,320
That doesn't make sense at all.

129
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,369
However,

130
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,910
Shen Xin did receive the liquor.

131
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,990
Unless, Shen Xin didn't know
that Ni Yadong was the gifter.

132
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,609
That's impossible.

133
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,040
The liquor was very costly.

134
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,350
Don't tell me Ni Yadong used it
to gain someone's favor?

135
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,809
Who's worthy of that?

136
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,840
Qin Luyao.

137
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,640
That's right.

138
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,670
I don't love Yadong.

139
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,609
In my heart, he can be my big brother.

140
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,409
It can be any kind of role.

141
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,400
Why would I treat him as my lover?

142
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,640
If so, why were you two still together?

143
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,400
I don't have a choice.

144
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,289
Competition is stiff nowadays.

145
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,160
It's tough for newcomers
to establish a foothold.

146
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,959
It's rare that the audience
loved us as a couple.

147
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,319
The producer wanted us
to make the show popular too.

148
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,640
They wanted people to discuss us.

149
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,199
I have no right to make demands.

150
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,519
I know.

151
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,559
Yadong truly fancied me.

152
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,960
But to me, it was just an act.

153
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,559
What if I say both Yadong
and I were drugged?

154
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,600
Would you believe me?

155
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,999
Shen Xin forced me to transfer to his
company by blackmailing me with the video.

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,670
If not, he'll upload it
for everyone to see.

157
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,319
He'll also kick up a huge fuss
using the video.

158
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,280
He'll say that I'm a woman who rose
to power through dirty deeds.

159
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,760
It's fine as long as
your conscience is clear.

160
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,430
That's your opinion.

161
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,439
In today's environment,

162
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,910
everyone only wants
to hear what they want to hear.

163
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,200
I'm a female celebrity
who suddenly became popular.

164
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,790
I'm quite pretty.

165
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,430
I have a hot figure too.

166
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,079
That's why they think
that I have to do some shady deals

167
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,759
or something to get to where I am.

168
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,040
If not, the netizens
wouldn't believe it.

169
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,479
They'll say something like,

170
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,289
"How much can you earn per movie

171
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,409
or per advertisement?"

172
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,320
"What gives you the right
to be in this position?"

173
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,439
If you don't conform to their thinking.

174
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,009
aren't ugly,
or don't walk on the gray edge,

175
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,129
it'll make them look useless.

176
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,479
As for whether it's true or not,

177
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,040
it doesn't matter to them.

178
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,009
How do you explain the engagement, then?

179
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,790
Were you guys going to get married?

180
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,880
You guys watched the video as well.

181
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,240
Yadong made a deal with me.

182
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,009
Getting engaged is the only way

183
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,590
to reduce its negative impact
to its maximum.

184
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,889
As for marriage,

185
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,280
I've never thought about it.

186
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,640
He only said
that we would get engaged first.

187
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,480
He would come up with the solution.

188
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,640
The solution was
Shen Xin's murder, right?

189
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,710
He murdered Shen Xin, right?

190
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,430
You got this liquor
from Ni Yadong, right?

191
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,670
No.

192
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,070
I've never received
any liquor from Yadong.

193
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,430
So, you and Ni Yadong haven't
had any contact in the past half month?

194
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:46,289
No. I've been at the set lately.

195
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,760
We never met each other.

196
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,880
How did you guys
discuss the engagement, then?

197
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,280
We...

198
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,590
We discussed it over the phone.

199
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,310
Over the phone?

200
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,479
That was hasty.

201
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,430
Which day was it? What time?

202
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,830
Be specific.

203
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,360
I don't remember.

204
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,160
Have some water.

205
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
She lied during
the latter half of the conversation.

206
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,790
She must've met Ni Yadong
in the past half month.

207
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,040
These speculations
cannot be considered evidence.

208
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,550
Let's go back
and trace Ni Yadong's timeline.

209
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,109
Let's go.

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,590
Has Ni Yadong been to the company
for the past half month?

212
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,319
No.

213
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,409
Not even once?

214
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,590
Yeah.

215
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,839
Alright. Does he have any
special work arrangements?

216
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,760
Like going out of town, for example?

217
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,479
Going out of town?

218
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,649
I don't think so.

219
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,689
No?

220
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,049
Yeah.

221
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,199
Not even once?

222
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,769
Yeah.

No.

If so, did you find

229
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,239
any suspicious individuals

230
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,670
or events at the crime scene?

231

No.

232
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,529
Ms. Wei, based on
our comprehensive analysis,

233
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,809
A week ago, between 9:30 and 10:30 P.M.,

234
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,769
Ni Yadong met with a mysterious person.

235
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,000
He handed the liquor to her.

236
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
By consolidating the clues
about the mysterious person,

237
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,720
we tracked down
some relevant surveillance footage.

238
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,049
We found out that it was Ma Li,

239
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,190
Qin Luyao's manager.

240
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,120
Baby, what's on your mind?

241
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,310
I just feel restless.

242
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,239
Ma Li, tell me the truth.

243
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,590
Are you hiding something from me?

244
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,649
Why would I hide anything from you?

245
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,959
Don't overthink it.

246
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,409
But...

247
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,480
No more buts.

248
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:54,882
This time, Ni Yadong
has done you a huge favor.

249
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,160
This tragic persona of yours
could last for another year.

250
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,500
For this period, you can try to improve
your image and rise through the ranks.

251
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,760
I'll make all
the necessary arrangements.

252
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,240
Alright now. Everything'll be fine.

253
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,120
Thank you so much.

254
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,839
- Captain Ding.
- Hmm?

255
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,070
We received a letter.

256
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,809
We made a discovery.

257
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,359
One of Ma Li's classmates
owns a beauty salon.

258
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,400
They received a batch of goods
just a few days ago. Guess what it was.

259
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,430
It's Botox.

260
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,929
Cai Yun.

261
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,310
Explain this to me.

262
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,009
Where did the batch of Botox,
which belonged to your beauty salon

263
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,160
go?

264
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,599
We used them on ourselves in secret.

265
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,809
Think twice before answering.

266
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,009
I'm investigating a murder case now.

267
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,079
A murder case?

268
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,910
That has nothing to do with me.

269
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,950
Where did all the Botox go?

270
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,880
It's...

271
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:00,959
It was Ma Li.

272
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,359
She said that there were several female
celebrities who couldn't appear in public.

273
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,239
They came to my beauty salon.
We arranged the Botox shots for them.

274
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,400
But this has nothing to do with me!

275
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,590
Tell us.

276
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,790
I had no choice either.

277
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,790
Shen Xin, he...

278
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,310
He blackmailed Luyao using the video.

279
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,310
He wanted to transfer Luyao
to his company.

280
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,009
He wanted to use Luyao

281
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,590
to hold Ni Yadong firmly in his grasp.

282
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,790
And then?

283
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,710
And then, I went to find Ni Yadong.

284
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,430
We came up with a solution,
which was the engagement.

285
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,479
But Shen Xin was urging us to act.

286
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,910
We had no time at all.

287
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,280
Ni Yadong said

288
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,160
that he would deliver the liquor
to Shen Xin.

289
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,160
He would try to stall Shen Xin
and buy some time.

290
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,049
At that moment,

291
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,550
you developed the motive to kill.

292
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,790
I heard from Ni Yadong
that Shen Xin loved alcohol.

293
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,910
When I was young, my family
was in the fake liquor business.

294
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,710
Lacing the liquor with poison,

295
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,310
it was a piece of cake for me.

296
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,839
And, even after the murder,

297
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,310
you could push the blame on Ni Yadong.

298
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:17,910
Did you know
Ni Yadong fancied Qin Luyao for real?

299
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,070
Everything was caused by Ni Yadong.

300
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,880
No matter if it's Shen Xin or him,

301
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,910
don't take Luyao away from me!

302
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,710
I won't allow it.

303
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,120
I won't allow it.

304
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,000
Let go!

305
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,289
It's all your fault!

306
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,559
Let go!

307
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,959
It's all your fault!

308
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,040
Let go!

309
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,880
Mochou!

310
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,910
Mochou? Wake up.

311
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,649
Are you okay?

312
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,790
What's the matter?

313
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,400
Did you have a nightmare?

314
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,190
I interrupted your sweet dream, huh?

315
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,040
You're fine. You're able
to make a sarcastic remark.

316
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,280
That means your dream
wasn't too terrifying.

317
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,760
You can resume your sweet dream.
I'll leave now.

318
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,590
Ms. Wei.

319
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,079
Can you

320
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,000
have a chat with me?

321
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,550
Regarding the case,

322
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,880
I wish to discuss it with you.

323
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,830
Let's discuss the case
of Qin Luyao and Ni Yadong.

324
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,640
Do you believe in my feelings?

325
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,280
Right now, I believe in my feelings
more than evidence.

326
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,860
It's a given for cops to
believe in evidence, don't you think so?

327
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,790
Of course.

328
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,759
I've discussed this question
with Ning Jing countless times.

329
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,630
I don't wish to continue the discussion.

330
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,640
Of course I believe in the evidence.

331
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,280
But I believe in my feelings as well.

332
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,999
Your feelings, huh?

333
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,150
Is it accurate?

334
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,479
If it's about two strangers,

335
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,790
of course it won't be accurate.

336
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,649
But they have

337
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,310
an intimate relationship.

338
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,720
Sometimes, my feelings might be
more accurate than the evidence.

339
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,200
I guess I can understand some of it.

340
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,310
Who do you have feelings for?

341
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,329
Tell me. I'll assess it for you.

342
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,110
I'll see if your feelings are accurate.

343
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,310
Li Mochou, you're such a busybody.

344
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,199
Everyone was curious about
Captain Ding's love life, right?

345
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,110
Why are you being shy
when it's your turn?

346
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,479
Who said I was shy?

347
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,959
We were discussing a case just now.

348
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,200
Forget about me.
Let's talk about Ni Yadong.

349
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,110
Now,

350
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,680
it's likely that Ni Yadong
was murdered by Shen Xin.

351
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,630
And, Ma Li murdered Shen Xin.

352
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,849
Ma Li has nothing
to do with Ni Yadong's death.

353
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,439
Based on the evidence chain

354
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,329
formed through our
evidence collection and investigation,

355
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,479
we can actually

356
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,480
close the case of Ni Yadong's murder.

357
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,759
We can close it by concluding

358
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,440
that Shen Xin was the culprit.

359
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,630
The evidence for this case
isn't conclusive.

360
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,520
Why don't you try and feel it out?

361
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,000
But I don't feel anything right now.

362
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,480
Stop thinking about it.

363
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,799
Go to sleep.

364
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,680
You might obtain hints once you wake up.

365
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,200
Ms. Wei.

366
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,760
Why don't you share
your sweet dream with me?

367
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,350
Erm...

368
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,200
- You can make breakfast tomorrow, then.
- No problem.

369
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,960
Morning, Ms. Wei.

370
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,070
You must be starving.

371
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,790
You should've gotten yourself
a boyfriend long ago.

372
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,110
A boyfriend?

373
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,920
No boyfriend is
as reliable as Captain Ding.

374
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,150
Hurry and move out, okay?

375
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,350
No matter how comfortable the sofa is,
it's better to sleep on a bed.

376
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,479
Who slept on the sofa?
When did it happen?

377
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,550
You.

378
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,369
As the saying goes,

379
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,590
it's easy to invite a guest,
but hard to send them away.

380
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,760
Besides,

381
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,920
if I do leave now,

382
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,959
no one will appreciate
your excellent cooking skills.

383
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,959
I don't feel like serving you.

384
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,830
Listen, breakfast isn't for free.

385
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,780
Have you gotten a hold of something
with your hunch?

386
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,310
I'm almost there. Stop urging me. We shouldn't
ponder while eating. It'll cause indigestion.

Tell everyone to gather
in the meeting room.

Yes, ma'am.

(Serve the People)

394
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,609
Didn't we watch this
on the day the murder had occurred?

395
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,519
That's right.

396
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,479
But I omitted an important detail.

397
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,929
Ni Yadong is an experienced
skydiving enthusiast.

398
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,720
And, I've confirmed this
with the experts of the skydiving club.

399
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,129
When your parachute

400
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,070
is malfunctioning entirely,

401
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,129
keep your face down,

402
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,519
head raised, and hands in a W shape.

403
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,479
Like this.

404
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,929
This is the only safe pose,

405
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,680
even though the chance of success
is only one in ten thousand.

406
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,310
Let's see what Ni Yadong did.

407
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,110
He gave up on
the one in ten thousand chance.

408
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,150
He did a farewell pose.

409
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,200
So,

410
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,110
did he commit suicide?

411
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,390
Wait.

412
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,519
This cannot be used as evidence.

413
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,689
Although that's the case,

414
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,169
Mochou did provide us with
a new investigative direction.

415
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,720
Looking for evidence is our duty.

417
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,959
Mr. Fei,

418
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,479
I found the contact history
between you and Ni Yadong.

419
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,350
May we meet up?

420
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,590
Are you Officer Li?

421
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,830
Hello, Mr. Fei.

422
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,040
Have a seat.

423
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,479
Sorry about this.

424
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,790
You had to come all the way here.

425
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,960
This is the last item
Yadong left behind.

426
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:42,830
Yadong told me

427
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,519
to hand this to you

428
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,600
if you guys looked for me.

429
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,720
He told me to forget it
if the cops weren't looking for me.

430
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,310
He has been tormented mentally
all these years.

431
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:55,280
No one expected society
to change this rapidly.

432
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,519
As his teacher,

433
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,609
I only taught him the principles
of business and survival.

434
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,520
But I didn't teach him
how to face reality.

435
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,479
But Mr. Fei,

436
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,680
judging from your chat with Ni Yadong,

437
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,920
you've always been
his pillar of support.

438
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,350
And,

439
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,680
I don't know how the public views

440
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,959
his relationship with Luyao,

441
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,129
but judging from my understanding
as his teacher,

442
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:29,520
I think Yadong truly fancies Luyao.

443
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,830
Oh.

444
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,040
I sabotaged the parachute myself.

445
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,519
My death will become a circle of light

446
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,680
that will enlighten Luyao's career.

447
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,000
This era no longer
belonged to me anyway.

448
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,240
I should put it this way.

449
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:04,440
I already died
ever since I left the place

450
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,280
20 years ago.

451
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,350
So,

452
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,870
farewell.

453
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,110
Something's off.

454
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,849
If Ni Yadong did sabotage his parachute,

455
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,409
what did Shen Xin do with
that one hour he took?

456
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,089
No one knows.

457
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,590
After Shen Xin realized

458
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,200
that Ni Yadong sabotaged
his own parachute,

459
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,550
he went back and destroyed the password
for the sex video files.

460
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,689
Then he poured a glass of
the liquor Ni Yadong had bought.

461
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,920
He even did a toast when he drank it.

462
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,350
Was that toast meant for Ni Yadong?

463
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:51,169
He knew that Ni Yadong
was trying to commit suicide.

464
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,920
But he didn't stop him.

465
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,390
Why is that the case?

466
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,569
Besides, didn't he rely on
Ni Yadong to make money?

467
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,760
Human relationships
are complex in the first place.

468
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,569
Shen Xin knows Ni Yadong the best.

469
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:06,240
He knew that Ni Yadong
was ready to commit suicide.

470
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,920
That's why he thought
that he should grant his wish.

471
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,310
Mochou, we received an email.

472
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,000
I'll send it to you.

473
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,199
This is the transaction record
between Meng Zhengyi and Li Guangrong.

474
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,720
There are a total of six transactions.

475
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,329
The date of the last transaction
is October 28, 2021.

476
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,760
It's one day before the day
someone tried to assassinate me.

477
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,999
If Meng Zhengyi was the one
who placed a hit on you,

478
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,110
it's likely that he's related
to Ning Jing's death.

479
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,590
Mochou,

480
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,920
the truth you're after
is right in front of you.

481
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,000
Where did he go?

482
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,649
Hey.

483
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,790
- Brother, you're here.
- Yeah.

484
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,169
You're sweating so much.

485
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,039
You must be terrified, huh?

486
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,920
It's not that bad.

487
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,070
Why are you working in a crematorium

488
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,550
when you're this timid?

489
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,520
You should resign and leave.

490
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,000
Why didn't you resign, then?

491
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,830
It's because I'm bold.

492
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,760
I have nothing to fear.

493
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,630
Look. I'll stand here.

494
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:26,799
There's no ghost.

495
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,759
- There's no ghost at all.
- Fine, fine.

496
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,889
Fine. Let's go. Let's go.

497
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,280
Brother.

498
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,000
Those fools. They didn't switch off
the light after work.

499
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,590
Brother, what's wrong?

500
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,070
Are there any ashes left from today's
crematorium that hasn't been picked up?

501
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,439
Nope.

502
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,640
Nine bodies were cremated today.

503
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,760
All of the ashes were retrieved by
their family members.

504
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,070
Whose ash is this, then?
