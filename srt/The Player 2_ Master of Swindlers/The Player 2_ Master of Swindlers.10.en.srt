No.

First off, I'm done with this company because the owner's already one of them.

226
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:26,183
I'll have to contact a different channel.

227
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,313
If that doesn't work, either...

228
00:19:28,337 --> 00:19:32,103
I'll start my own channel or something.

229
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:35,463

Yes.

The reason I'm trying to become the president is to help the people.

If I turn a blind eye to a matter that threatens the people

239
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:12,773
and just focus on becoming the president,

240
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:16,107
I'd be putting the cart far ahead of the horse. Am I wrong?

241
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:24,597
Also, this election won't be mine anyway.
