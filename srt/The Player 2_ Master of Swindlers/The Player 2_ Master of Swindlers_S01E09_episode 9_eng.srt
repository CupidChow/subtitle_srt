1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,290
   

2
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,810
   

3
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,540
   

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,710
   

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,810
   

6
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,970
   

7
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,010
 Stop right there. 
  

8
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,610
 I got it all on film. Your confession. 

9
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,400
 You scammed the same way I do. Ten billion won in damages! 

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,430
 But first of all, Mr. Myeong, they were scammed by you. 

11
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,050
 Once scammed by you for real, and once scammed by us but fake. 

12
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,700
 Your 30 billion won will be returned to the victims. 

13
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,480
 Myeong Joo, you're under arrest for lease fraud. 

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,100
 Take him. 

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,650
 I heard your situation is pretty dire. 

16
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,470
 You don't have to worry. 

17
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,540
 I just got a call from Prosecutor Kwak. 

18
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,080
 Mr. Myeong died while being transferred to the prosecution. 

19
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,660
 Supreme Leader Im. He's a total cult leader. 

20
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,410
 I will reveal everything going forward. 

21
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,300
 The truth behind the Almighty House of Truth. 

22
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,060
 His name is Im Sang Sik. 

23
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,160
 He's the chairman of the Almighty House of Truth. 

24
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,750
 He's a cult leader. 

25
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,090
 All the congregation members who testified about Supreme Leader Im went missing. 

26
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,070
 Wow, so brutal. 

27
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,340
 Searching for Supreme Leader Im's hidden treasures, huh? 

28
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,470
 Ha Ri, you can hear me well, right? 

29
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,280
 Kim Han Jun, a graduate of Brinceton Theological Seminary. 

30
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,030
 Okay. Let's get started. 

31
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,290
 - The almighty Haneulnim spoke.
 - Truth. 

32
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,450
 Did Jin Woong get in okay? 

33
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,780
 Yes, he's currently getting the best of both worlds. 

34
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,820
 What about Su Min? 

35
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,620
 She's not an ordinary woman for sure. 

36
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,600
 Five hundred million won in cash as soon as you join us? 

37
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,240
 Let's include Kim Han Jun in our services starting tomorrow. 

38
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,360
 Nokyang Nursing Home. 

39
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,560
 The purpose is recruiting new believers, not community service. 

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,170
 After it was built recently, a lot of rich old people with cash entered the place. 

41
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,470
 Is Director Bae our next step? 

42
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,770
 It's the beginning of the bloody battle for the crown. 

43
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,100
 She's Lee Seon Ja, and she's 80 years old. 

44
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,410
 She has more than 50 billion won in assets. She's pretty gullible. 

45
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,500
 Let's forget about the other old folks and focus on Lee Seon Ja. 

46
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,140
 So hot! 

47
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,850
 Director Bae said he witnessed a very interesting scene. 

48
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,370
 I saw it all. 

49
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,020
 This grandmother right here is actually an actor you hired. 

50
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,530
 Wait, why is this so... 

51
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,820
 What are you doing right now? 

52
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,720
 S-Supreme Leader, believe me. I clearly saw it! 

53
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,780
 You'll play an important role. 

54
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,550
 I'll show you my holy ground. 

55
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,330
 I'm honored, Supreme Leader. 

56
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,780
 Right now, I have other matters to attend to. So, I'll get going. 

57
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,390
 What do you want? What... 

58
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,810
 I've got something to tell you in private, Supreme Leader. 

59
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,180
 Because I'm really good at reading people's minds. 

60
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,950
 Who are you? 

61
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,490
 Why do you keep doing this to me? 

62
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,870
I'm telling you in advance.

63
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,290
Tonight will be a lot more fun than you expected.

64
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,110
What is it now?

65
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,820
- The prosecution is here. 
- What?

66
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,410
They're trying to force their way in right now!

67
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,510
What nonsense! I already called and asked if there's a warrant—

68
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,180
That's not it!

69
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,610
- They're looking for this sister. 
- Why?

70
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,190
It's regarding allegations of investment fraud in crypto.

71
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,440
You were serious?

72
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,840
   

73
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,640
You're under arrest on allegations of fraud.

74
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,270
Let's go.

75
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:53,930


76
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,810
   

77
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,800
How's her condition?

78
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,450
Nothing is seriously wrong with her physical condition.

79
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,520
but she's unconscious because of the drugs.

80
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,960
The criminal allegations are clear.

81
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,350
Let's charge and arrest Leader Im right away.

82
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,740
We're almost there.

83
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,500
We need to get to the holy ground to get Leader Im.

84
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,020
- I'll soon enter Leader Im's holy ground— 
- Just imagine.

85
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,820
Just imagine if that lady had stayed in the Almighty House of Truth instead of here.

86
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,250
Kang Ha Ri, do you know what's worse?

87
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,690
What happened today can happen again tomorrow.

88
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,900
I agree with you but at this rate—

89
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,020
Your district attorney received more than just a couple of bucks from Leader Im. Did you know?

90
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,720
 Is her guardian here? 

91
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,330
Where's Jin Woong?

92
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,870
Jin Woong!

93
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,960
H-Hey, Jin Woong! Hey, where are you going?

94
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,110
I understand. Okay?

95
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,600
I get it, so let's just sit back this time.

96
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,040
Byeong Min, fuckers like Leader Im shouldn't exist in this world.

97
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,310
A bastard like him shouldn't breathe and live as a human being even for a second.

98
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:13,200
Jin Woong! I promise you.

99
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,740
I'll hand over Leader Im to you at the end.

100
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,370
Yes.

101
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,390
Let's finish him with this.

102
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,210
All right. Jin Woong, listen.

103
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:30,770
Regardless of whatever Prosecutor Kwak, Ha Ri, or Su Min say, I'll stop them for you. Okay?

104
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,070
So, let's j-just hold ourselves back this time.

105
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,560
Was it gross?

106
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,190
A little.

107
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,530
Are you okay?

108
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,090
Good job holding yourself back.

109
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,770
I didn't hold myself back.

110
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,860
We promised to hand Leader Im to him.

111
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,210
What? Hand over what?

112
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,530
The thing is before Leader Im gets locked up—

113
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,150
He means we'll relieve our work stress.

114
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,330
Something like that, right?

115
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,580
Yes, that's right.

116
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,830
There's no one by Mi Na's side, Jin Woong.

117
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,370
Did you get a clear shot?

118
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,030
Of course.

119
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,060
- What? 
- It was perfect, right?

120
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,430
Perfect.

121
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,490
The angle was crazy.

122
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,330
Prosecutor Kwak, how many people can you mobilize tomorrow?

123
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,230
- Tomorrow?
 - We need to get Leader Im.

124
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,040
   

125
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,760
Given the key to heaven, our truth will live forever.

126
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,210
So, tell me. Is it all right in there?

127
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,640
Supreme Leader! Supreme Leader.

128
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,600
- How's your health? 
 - It's fine.

129
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,790
Did you repent?

130
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,190
I've done a lot.

131
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,590
Director Bae,

132
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,240
do you like fried chicken with or without sauce?

133
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:56,170
If you come back after touring the countryside for about half a year, there'll be a spot open for you.

134
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,760
Thank you.

135
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,630
You'll choke. Eat slowly.

136
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,040
Take a break and be on standby.

137
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,010
Thank you!

138
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,120
He's in a pretty good condition. 50 million won.

139
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,440
He doesn't drink or smoke.

140
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,070
His health screenings are also crystal clear.

141
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,780
Fine. Three hundred fifty million won in total.

142
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,220
Deal. You can take him right away.

143
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,530
 Thank you. 

144
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,750
 Thank you, Supreme Leader! 

145
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,550
   

146
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,980
Why you stupid—

147
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,050
Use any means necessary to get them—

148
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,820
- No, just kill them all! 
- Yes.

149
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,370
If you make another mistake, you'll have to pay for it.

150
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,800
- Did you call for me? 
- Yes.

151
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,200
Welcome.

152
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,500
How's it going with Mrs. Lee Seon Ja?

153
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,350
I'm wrapping things up.

154
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,930
Aigoo, Messenger Kim, you barely had time to adapt,

155
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,120
but I'm really overworking you from the beginning!

156
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,840
I'm a worker you personally ordained.

157
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,780
I'm only heading toward your will with a sense of duty as your servant.

158
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,330
Thank you.

159
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,670
If only I had one more man like you working for me,

160
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,980
I'd have put down everything and left for a sabbatical in peace.

161
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,560
Supreme Leader, by the way, about the holy ground you told me about last time...

162
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,450
What about the holy ground?

163
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm curious.

164
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,110
I'd like to store the money I got in a safe place.

165
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,730
Gosh, don't worry about that.

166
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,430
Just bring me all of that old woman's money.

167
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:20,190
If you do, I'll secure your spot in the holy ground, Messenger Kim!

168
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,370
You can do anything there, whether it be stacking gold or locking someone up.

169
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,310
- And there's an online service streamed nationally. 
 - Yes, Supreme Leader.

170
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:37,730
Preaching in front of a camera is vastly different from preaching in front of the congregation.

171
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,010
If you watch what I do from the side, it'll be a big help to you.

172
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,070
I'll keep that in mind.

173
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,360
Messenger Kim, your looks are outstanding.

174
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,750
What do you have to eat to look like you?

175
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,890
Anyhow, you'll be in charge from now on, so keep a close watch.

176
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,190
It's an honor.

177
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,980
Truth.

178
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,920
 Supreme Leader Im Sang Sik of Almighty House of Truth's online sermon will start soon. 

179
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,080
Get the prompter going and start streaming right away.

180
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,070
We'll start.

181
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,880
One, two, cue.

182
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,450
Beloved Believers, hello.

183
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,600
I'm the chairman of Almighty House of Truth.

184
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:45,420
- I'd like to share with you the word about the grapevine and prophecy today. 
- He looks great on camera.

185
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,000
Haneulnim had told us.

186
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,870
I'm the grapevine, and you're the branch.

187
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,110
 You can be a scammer who's after my money! 

188
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,100
 I guess you watch too many movies. 

189
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,480
 No, I don't have the time for movies. It's all from experience. 

190
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,460
 With my hands, those traitors, scammers, spies, and all! 

191
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,710
 My precious experience! 

192
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,630
 What is it now? 

193
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,550
 I think you should escape right now. 

194
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,480
 Why? 

195
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,830
 I think the Prosecution will rush in soon. 

196
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,590
 The Prosecution? 

197
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,010
 I've got a friend inside the Prosecution. 

198
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,520
 You killed a person? 

199
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,230
 No, your question is wrong. 

200
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,700
 "How many people have you redeemed?" 

201
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,760
 That's what you should ask! 

202
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,250
 Redeem? 

203
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,490
 They're not dead. They're still alive. 

204
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,410
 They're only living in numerous people's bodies in separate pieces. 

205
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,880
 They're totally fine— 

206
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,640
 You killed people and sold their organs? 

207
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,850
 That expression isn't quite beautiful. 

208
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,110
What are you doing, idiots? Turn it off right now!

209
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,390
 How many lives did I redeem by sacrificing those bodies? 

210
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,540
-  That's what matters.  
- Get out of the way, idiots!

211
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,040
Who are you?

212
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,400
Who else?

213
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,910
A brother who's pissed at you.

214
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,210
This little!

215
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,760
- It's self-defense from now on. 
 - Self-defense, my ass!

216
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,610
We think he exists in an unknown world, a place that's much like outer space.

217
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,310
However, that's absolutely not the case.

218
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,030
Haneulnim exists next to you, in front of you,

219
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,040
and behind you, all the time, in love.

220
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,350
I wish I could put this video under that and show it to him.

221
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:20,630
But why? Why do we always doubt him?

222
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,690
Prosecutor Kwak arrived.

223
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,720
 We need to get Leader Im. 

224
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,890
 Operation... 

225
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,790
 Rabbit Hunt. 

226
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,780
 We'll make Leader Im go to the holy ground on his own. 

227
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:43,670
 More specifically, Leader Im will take me to the holy ground. 

228
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,290
 You need a hunter who'll corner Leader Im into the rabbit hole? 

229
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:52,670
 Yes, but the important thing here is that you have to only pretend to catch him. 

230
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,110
Let's go in.

231
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,590
Yes!

232
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,610
Let's go this way.

233
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,280
 All right. Prosecutor Kwak is going in now. 

234
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,020
Okay.

235
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,290
That will be the end of today's sermon.

236
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,990
Truth.

237
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,110
I'll cut it here.

238
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,140
Thank you for your work.

239
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,810
The Prosecution's coming inside right now.

240
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,670
What do you mean?

241
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,550
Please look at this.

242
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,980
T-Truth.

243
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,000
Supreme Leader, I think you need to see this.

244
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,360
What is it?

245
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,180
 They're only living in numerous people's bodies in separate pieces. 

246
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,890
I think this video was streamed, not the sermon.

247
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:58,210
You confessed to murder and organ trafficking.

248
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:02,520
Those hell-bound satanic bastards were hiding among us, huh?

249
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,660
Supreme Leader, the Prosecution will barge in soon. You must go.

250
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,130
Let us go.

251
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,180
Damn it!

252
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,420
- Let's go. 
- Yes.

253
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,410
I'll take care of things here. Please escape quickly.

254
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,120
You satanic prosecutor.

255
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,280
You filthy bastard.

256
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,900
You're a damn serpent of Satan.

257
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,060
- He left, idiot.
 - You trash—

258
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,060
Shouldn't we be going after them?

259
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,560
They left.

260
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,120
Excuse me, Prosecutor. This is a secret.

261
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,280
There's a reason Leader Im's holy ground has been hidden thoroughly so far.

262
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,580
 The moment Leader Im leaves House of Truth, 

263
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,200
 at least four teams accompany him right away. 

264
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,700
 - Teams?
 - Yes. 

265
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,010
 That means you just need to follow all of them. 

266
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,850
 He and I already tried following them. 

267
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:16,530
 But Leader Im wasn't in any of the cars we followed. 

268
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,250
 Even the places they arrived at weren't exactly the holy ground. 

269
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,300
Leader Im was in a different car from the beginning.

270
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,600
Those four cars were just decoys.

271
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,280
So, the car Leader Im takes whenever he leaves House of Truth—

272
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,860
We don't know that.

273
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,440
So, what do you know?

274
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,840
Not much, really.

275
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,500
Is our rabbit hopping around well?

276
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,470
Why don't you take a look?

277
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:08,510
Is he a rabbit or a cheetah?

278
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,440
I'm in the parking lot! Hurry up and come!

279
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:21,940
- Please get in this way. 
 - No, we need more people. Hold on!

280
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,620
Supreme Leader!

281
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,220
This is the car. Let's get going. I'll drive.

282
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,310
All right. It's the climax now.

283
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,520
Yes.

284
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,480
Hey, Mr. Kim?

285
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,060
Yes, Supreme Leader.

286
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,650
Or rather...

287
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,980
Ha Ri Kang?

288
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,610
Sorry?

289
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,720
Ha Ri.

290
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,340
Did you find out the destination?

291
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,570
Wh-Why? What's wrong?

292
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,650
You need to go to the parking lot right now.

293
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,140
What?

294
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,430
Hey, isn't this Ha Ri's phone?

295
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,940
Gosh, this is nuts.

296
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,240
- Is this real?
 - Sorry?

297
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,130
Is this another operation that only works if I don't know about it?

298
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,080
I think he was...

299
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,250
kidnapped for real.

300
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,430
What do we do now?

301
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,310
We'll have to find him for sure.

302
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,580
What would've happened if I hadn't received this from him?

303
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,680
Gosh, I was really close, seriously.

304
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,820
Hey, did you report to Jeffrey?

305
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,850
That we completely exposed you?

306
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,680
I'll warn you for the last time.

307
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,590
It would be best to leave this place quickly.

308
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,690
Because my friends will be here very soon.

309
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,700
I'm sure it's already cold.

310
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,450
But it'll become unbearably colder from now on.

311
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,230
That's how this place is built.

312
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,090
And no need to explain how it gets at night.

313
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,630
No, continue.

314
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,550
It's nice and refreshing.

315
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,350
But you know what?

316
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,760
I don't plan to stay here until night, you see?

317
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,030
Kang Ha Ri, what do you think I'll do to you?

318
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:23,470
Well, I wouldn't really know.

319
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,600
How could I ever comprehend the Supreme Leader's will?

320
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,520
But I know one thing.

321
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,260
I think your life will be over pretty soon, too.

322
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,960
Hey, Kang Ha Ri.

323
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,190
See for yourself

324
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:49,780
what it feels like to be frozen ice cold and burn in hellfire.

325
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,240
Continue what you were doing.

326
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,130
 Excuse me, Su Min. 

327
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,220
 Yes, you can speak. 

328
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,720
There's nothing here.

329
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,220
I think he only has videos of his sermons here.

330
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:25,150
The person who knows the holy ground's location besides Leader Im is...

331
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:28,310
- Director Bae.
 - Didn't you say he disappeared?

332
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,960
Byeong Min, send me Director Bae's home address.

333
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,880
I'll go check right now.

334
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,650
No way.

335
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,940
Hey!

336
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,990
Over here.

337
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,040
Hey—

338
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
Hey.

339
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,420
What are you doing?

340
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,490
Hey!

341
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,600
Hey, you bastards!

342
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,000
I guess they're going to burn us all.

343
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:36,210
Guys, I think you should come quickly.

344
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,270
Aigoo, I'm sure they're your cherished possessions.

345
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,790
But you know I really gave you a great deal, right?

346
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:51,310
 Please trade with me even if you're abroad and have a need. 

347
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:55,860
I'm sure it was a rush, but you got it done nicely. Thank you.

348
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,860
  
   

349
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,150
You should've gotten the crypto in your wallet.

350
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,590
 Gosh, what a wonderful world, right? 

351
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:07,160
 You can turn crypto into cash anywhere in the world. 

352
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,990
Yes, good job.

353
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,390
   
  

354
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,560
I've finished the job as you ordered.

355
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,550
Not a single one can get out alive.

356
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,130
Not a single one.

357
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,380
Are you getting discharged now?

358
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,800
Yes.

359
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,680
I should go back home now.

360
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,890
- Mi Na. 
- Yes?

361
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,670
You can still reach Director Bae Seon Wu, right?

362
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:14,200
 Mi Na, how was today? 

363
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,880
 It was all right. 

364
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,960
 I'm so glad. 

365
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,180
 I was worried something might happen to you. 

366
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:32,130
 I want to go back to Japan with you as soon as I can. 

367
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,810
 Me, too. 

368
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:37,330
 Could you wait just a bit longer? 

369
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,620
 I'll make sure to find a way. 

370
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:53,250
You two are seeing each other, right?

371
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:00,180
Where's Director Bae right now?

372
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,870
-  Jin Woong.  
- Why? Is something wrong?

373
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:14,470
Nothing's happened to Ha Ri, right?

374
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:17,190
 I've got bad news and worse news. 

375
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,230
 Which do you want to hear first? 

376
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,200
When are you going back to Japan?

377
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,060
I'll follow you as soon as things settle here.

378
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,640
I'm not sure about that.

379
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,140
You don't actually think you can go, right?

380
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:08,620
I guess you didn't know there's a travel ban on you as Leader Lim's accomplice.

381
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,900
You said there's a way for us to live together!

382
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:23,750
The only way for us to live together

383
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:28,890
is for you to seek forgiveness and change your ways.

384
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,650
Are you able to lure Leader Im?

385
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,440
I'm your last lifeline.

386
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,220
If you hand over Leader Im, I can—

387
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,510
Lifeline?

388
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,500
Don't make me laugh.

389
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:06,220
The moment I hand over Im Sang Sik to you, just like him—

390
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,370
Brothers...

391
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,650
It looks like I was used as bait.

392
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,910
Who knew they would follow me?

393
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,600
Im Sang Sik, that son of a bitch.

394
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,140
Hurry up and call him.

395
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,700
Call who?

396
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,690
Just call anyone.

397
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,710
You don't even know where we're going right now!

398
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:58,840
It's obvious. I'm sure we're headed to the holy ground.

399
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:03,150
Almighty House of Truth.

400
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,160
That's the holy ground.

401
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:21,100
Aigoo, long time no see, Director Bae.

402
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,890
Hi, Romanticist.

403
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,900
What you're thinking is correct.

404
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,910
Look carefully at my mouth.

405
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,450
You were fooled.

406
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,400
You'll meet a very competent prosecutor soon.

407
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,150
To give you a piece of advice, just spill everything.

408
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:52,560
If you make him mad, he'll double your sentence, no matter what.

409
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,850
Director Bae, fighting!

410
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,850
Hello! Everyone!

411
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:03,850
If you stay here like this, you'll be burned to death!

412
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,370
Hey!

413
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:08,690
Can't you hear me? Over here!

414
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,540
Over here!

415
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,130
Those damn bastards.

416
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,170
Hey, you bastards!

417
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,380
You still need to feed us even if you'll kill us!

418
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,230
Shit!

419
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:27,330
Hey, I'm starving. Give me something to eat.

420
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,980
You're such a noisy one.

421
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:33,380
Hey, don't you hear something?

422
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,730
- What?
 - The sound of you dropping into hell.

423
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,180
- What did you say, you asshole? 
- Forget it.

424
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,370
Listening more carefully,

425
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:47,050
it was the sound of pissed-off Leader Im cutting your throat open.

426
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,420
Son of a bitch!

427
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,850
Wh-Why? What? I take it back!

428
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,400
What did you say?

429
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,660
Hey, I said you're going to hell, right?

430
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,950
Hey, what is it?

431
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,340
One, two. Come over here.

432
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,620
What's this?

433
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,020
Why are there so many?

434
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,310
Sure.

435
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,490
The player enters.

436
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,870
Man, it's about time.

437
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:32,200
"The player enters"? What movie is that?

438
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,290
The movie where all these bastards go to hell.

439
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,710
Man, I'm so cool.

440
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,250
Supreme Leader!

441
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:25,360
- What's the matter? 
- We've got an infiltrator.

442
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,530
- An infiltrator?
 - I think you need to escape now.

443
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:34,930
Pack as many things as you can here.

444
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,320
Bastards!

445
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,550
Please pull yourself together, Supreme Leader!

446
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,590
You'll really be in danger if you delay much longer!

447
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,980
   

448
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,180
   

449
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,230
He escaped.

450
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:47,030
Hey, th-the tablet.

451
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,850
Gosh, that's cold.

452
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,010
Don't forget the tablet inside the desk's drawer.

453
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:29,130
Jeong Su Min, I found the rabbit hole.

454
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:32,740
The moment we bring Prosecutor Kwak into this, we have to give up everything in the basement.

455
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,380
You know, right?

456
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,800
We're opening up the goose that lays golden eggs right now.

457
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,780
It's better than opening you up, Ha Ri.

458
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,210
That's for sure— G-Gently.

459
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,330
That's for sure, but...

460
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:49,010
A flaw in this perfect sculpture?

461
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:53,760
 Oh, right. I think now is the time for you to say it. 

462
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,640
Say what?

463
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,570
 That you missed us a lot. 

464
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,600
Yes.

465
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:18,680
I'm really thankful you came to get me. I mean it.

466
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:24,070
Oh, my, Kang Ha Ri. You know how to thank others?

467
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:29,460
Hey, Ha Ri, I thought you didn't even know what "thanks" meant.

468
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:43,940
I'll buy some time, so take whatever you need, if there's any.

469
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:18,240
  
   

470
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,480
 A fence for stolen goods. 

471
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:27,440
 The bastard buys Leader Im's artworks he got from his believers through extortion instead of offerings. 

472
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,980
 This obviously isn't a cash trade, is it? 

473
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,370
 They traded using crypto. 

474
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:36,480
 Hey, I'm going to make some ramen. Do you want some? 

475
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:40,540
 What's with that obnoxious smile? 

476
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,380
 The greatest hacker in the Republic of Korea! 

477
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,650
 I'll make you the ramen. Don't lift a finger. 

478
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,820
 What the hell? 

479
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,260
 What's wrong with him? Did he eat something wrong? 

480
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,980
 I'll even put an egg in it. Okay? 

481
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,690
 Forget— 

482
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,190
 Hey, you're trying to make me do something, huh? 

483
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:59,210
   

484
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,950
Leader Im!

485
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,030
All of his crypto is ours.

486
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,050
Really?

487
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:13,400
That's Im Byeong Min, the greatest hacker in Korea!

488
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,430
Okay, great job! Okay.

489
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,070
But wait. Why are Jae Yi and Jin Woong so quiet?

490
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,930
District Attorney, mark my words.

491
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:27,980
You and your friends in legal and political fields who took bribes from me!

492
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:31,140
I have a list of their names. All right?

493
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,790
If you don't lift the travel ban on me,

494
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:39,090
tomorrow morning's news will be plastered with humiliating stories about you and your friends!

495
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,240
Did you get that?

496
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,390
Those fucking assholes.

497
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,790
Wh-Where's this? Why did we come here?

498
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,770
There's someone you must meet, Supreme Leader.

499
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,170
What's this?

500
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:08,000
Wh-What kind of nonsense is this?

501
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,610
Hey!

502
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,480
I kept my promise.

503
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,590
Step outside.

504
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,830
Shit...

505
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:46,850
Who are you now?

506
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,870
Don't worry too much. I won't kill you.

507
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,710
One minute. Okay?

508
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,330
Geez!

509
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,290
What are you doing? Need a hand?

510
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,650
Need a hand for what, punk?

511
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:15,550
Hold on.

512
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,900
Hey, do you know who I am? 
 (Speaking southern dialect) 

513
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,380
Oh yeah. I heard you're from the south, Hyungnim?

514
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,790
Gosh, this is nuts.

515
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,000
Hold on!

516
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,700
Hold on. Wait a minute.

517
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,140
You said you won't kill me! You said so!

518
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,770
Repent for your sins.

519
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:33,090
 The list of legal and political figures who lobbied is here for sure. 

520
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:08,750
Hurry up and go! Just walk!

521
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,510
Stop pushing!

522
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,020
I told you to stop!

523
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,700
Stop touching me!

524
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,520
Dear Ha Ri, where did you hide Leader Im?

525
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,950
Aigoo, why would I hide him?

526
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:49,890
I'll have him gift-wrapped and delivered by today. Okay?

527
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:53,830
If you lay a finger on Leader Im, I'll really—

528
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:55,450
Hello?

529
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:59,650
Gosh, he's so pissing me off.

530
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:03,450
- Hello—
 -  Prosecutor. 

531
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:05,480
 Leader Im is here. 

532
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:12,420
But I think we need an ambulance right now.

533
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,460
- Hurry up.
 - Yes, hurry up.

534
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,740
These punks, seriously! Hey!

535
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,580
So, where are you right now?

536
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,930
You're nearby, right?

537
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:35,650
Aigoo, Prosecutor Jang, it's me.

538
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:38,850
I'm near your hideout. Do you have a minute?

539
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:40,320
 Right now? 

540
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,940
What brings you all the way here?

541
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:45,570
 Ha Ri, there's something you need to see. 

542
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,000
Okay, I got it. I'll come to you.

543
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:01,190
All ready.

544
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:02,950
I'll be right back!

545
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,440
Wait.

546
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:12,890
What's taking him so long?

547
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,190
Kang Ha Ri?

548
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,870
Whoa, what the hell?

549
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,810
Prosecutor.

550
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:12,550
Prosecutor Jang.

551
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,590
Hey!

552
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:49,670
Prosecutor Jang.

553
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:53,230
Can you hear me? Prosecutor Jang!

554
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:58,420
Prosecutor Jang!

555
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,370
Prosecutor Jang.

556
00:49:56,370 --> 00:50:00,260
Prosecutor Jang! Can you hear me?

557
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,050
- Please hurry up.
 - Yes.

558
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:19,910
 Su Min, how much do you trust him? 

559
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,980
 Ajeossi. 

560
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:06,880
Prosecutor Jang. Prosecutor Jang!

561
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:11,370
Prosecutor Jang. Prosecutor Jang!

562
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,820
You can't enter from here on.

563
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,910
   

564
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:30,180
 Ha Ri, there's something you must see. 

565
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:43,160
   

566
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,400
 I lost a precious friend to Jeffrey Jeong. 

567
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,700
   

568
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:21,480
Welcome!

569
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,200
- Nice to meet you.
 - Nice to meet you.

570
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,060
- I'm a fan. 
- Nice to meet you.

571
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:31,460
They're a company that mainly researches branding and content marketing.

572
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:35,860
Young leaders' ideas are so refreshing.

573
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,270
   

574
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:54,070
Aigoo. Yes, it's okay.

575
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:57,110
- Aigoo, thank you for your work. 
 - Yes.

576
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:58,960
Yes, thank you.

577
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,850
Excuse me. Please let me through.

578
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,130
Oh, it's okay.

579
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,870
I'll get your report after my schedule here is done.

580
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:13,950
You already knew...

581
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,510
that Reporter Sin Hyeong Min would end up like that, right?

582
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:37,460
   

583
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,960
This is a picture of the scene at the time.

584
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,710
- Is it a sudden assault? 
 - Its purpose is different from others.

585
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:54,480
The purpose is different?

586
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,080
It wasn't for money. It was for revenge.

587
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:04,300
It seems the man who was suspected as the assaulter was a close friend of the dead reporter.

588
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:06,180
They knew each other?

589
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,790
Yes, he asked him to write a good article about his business

590
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:12,640
and even handed him some money. Bought expensive meals, too.

591
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,680
But the reporter didn't keep his promise.

592
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,210
Still, how could he murder him?

593
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:21,180
Exactly. I also want to ask him why he killed him.

594
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,160
But I can't do that anymore.

595
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,910
Because the suspect killed himself.

596
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:28,410
The dead are silent, you know.

597
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:31,880
He confessed it was his doing in his suicide note.

598
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,310
The suspect, as a cruel murderer,

599
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:37,400
and the dead reporter, as a corrupt reporter who was bribed by a friend.

600
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,240
That's how the two of them were branded as lowlifes,

601
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,740
and the case was dismissed without any proper investigation.

602
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:53,860
You don't look so happy about this, Prosecutor Jang.

603
00:54:54,990 --> 00:55:05,030


604
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,720
"Illegal lobbying by a foreign investment company."

605
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:13,410
That's the article the reporter was going to write.

606
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:17,120
He was murdered without publishing the article in the end.

607
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:24,290
He's manipulating the nation's political and financial fields?

608
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,570
Jeffrey Jeong?

609
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:37,270
I looked into it, and it seems there was a lot of controversy because of this article.

610
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:41,540
People were saying it must be published or it mustn't be.

611
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,740
It was buried in the end.

612
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,800
What's the reason?

613
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,210
There wasn't enough reason, apparently.

614
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:52,800
According to the article, he secured substantial proof through a news source,

615
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:57,120
but the evidence completely disappeared after the reporter died.

616
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,720
Of course, there might not have been substantial proof in the first place.

617
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:06,560
What can we do, though? Only the dead reporter knows the truth.

618
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,970
- Another thing. 
  - Hm?

619
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:16,970
I'll quit being a prosecutor soon.

620
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:20,410
I'll be Attorney Jang next time we meet.

621
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,070
When did you decide?

622
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:24,320
Decide? Well...

623
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,260
Does that even matter?

624
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:30,490
I don't know. It's what I've been thinking about after I was sent down here.

625
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:33,070
I'm going to live my life comfortably from now on.

626
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:37,000
I'm going to learn golf like others and go travel overseas,

627
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,950
even if it might only be Southeast Asia.

628
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:44,590
I can't imagine you living a life of leisure, Prosecutor Jang.

629
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:50,790
Also, there's a junior in the Central District Prosecutors' Office who used to be close to me.

630
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:53,040
I'll give you his contact.

631
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,870
Contact him from now on if there's anything you need.

632
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:59,030
Okay.

633
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:00,670
Is there anything you need?

634
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:02,420
Nothing, really.

635
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:07,230
Right. If I open up an office, get me an air purifier.

636
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,630
Gosh, I just can't quit smoking.

637
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,880
You can do that much, right?

638
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:17,830
I'll get you two.

639
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:22,110
Whoa, you're so damn charismatic.

640
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:25,040
This is why women fall for you.

641
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:31,260
What do you say? Shall we grab a drink if you have time?

642
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,870
One moment.

643
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:39,120
Aigoo, look how popular you are.

644
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,240
Kang Ha Ri!

645
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,090
Get going.

646
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:45,510
I'll call you.

647
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:48,400
Yes.

648
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,730
Aigoo.

649
00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:59,800
   

650
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:05,400
♫  Almost frantically. Going mad, shocked me again  ♫

651
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:12,690
♫  I stagger. I can kind of see it now. I tricked you, fell in again  ♫

652
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:21,770
♫  Respected like a giant. Blood is flowing fast  ♫

653
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:27,190
♫  When you find the perfect next move. In that happy moment  ♫

654
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:29,830
 How long have you known? 

655
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:34,380
 He's known as a competent and successful entrepreneur. 

656
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,530
 But his true nature gets more mysterious the more you dig. 

657
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:38,250
 Welcome. 

658
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:40,180
 Oh, my God. 

659
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:43,560
 It's the official beginning of the mission. 

660
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:46,320
 How could you, Ajeossi... 

661
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,670
 What you are trying to do might not get you what you want. 

662
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:52,520
 I've never believed in absolute good or absolute evil. 

663
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:57,320
 Every decisive moment comes with the worst and best decision. 

664
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:03,090
♫  I can't help but be surprised  ♫
