1
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,290
   

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,800
   

3
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,630
   

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,620
   

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,840
   

6
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:44,990
   

7
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,170
Aigoo. Yes, it's okay.

8
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,930
- Aigoo, thank you for your work. 
 - Yes.

9
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,740
Yes, stay healthy.

10
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,520
Excuse me. Please let me through.

11
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,410
Oh, it's okay.

12
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,990
I'll get your report after my schedule here is done.

13
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,120
You already knew...

14
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,640
that Reporter Sin Hyeong Min would end up like that, right?

15
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,290
How could you?

16
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,310
How could you, Ajeossi?

17
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,370
Rather, how could you do that to Hyeong Min?

18
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,110
There's nothing to gain from making a scene here.

19
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,120
Let's talk elsewhere.

20
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,490
What is the truth behind that day and ever since?

21
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,820
Did you really...

22
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:51,820
 Timing and Subtitles by the 
 ðŸ’¸ The Players Team ðŸ’¸ @Viki.com 

23
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,770
   

24
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,550
Gosh, they should really use a card key. 
   

25
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,160
- Hey, aren't you done yet?
 - I'm working on it.

26
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,500
H-Hey, hey!
    

27
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,850
I'm almost done here.

28
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,680
- What's this?
 -  The security has been paused. 

29
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,790
- It's done?
 - Oh, it's 1818.

30
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,180
What? The passcode is 1818?

31
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,770
H-Hey, give me the bag.

32
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,950
Hey, search.

33
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,800
It'll be quick.  
  

34
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,580
- You said it's a new machine.  Do you know how to use it? 
 - Y-Yes.

35
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,790
It's made in Germany, you hear?

36
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,910
Gosh, that idiot bought a used one to save money.

37
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,660
   

38
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,120
It worked.

39
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,680
Zero, six, nine, one, five, zero.

40
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,880
H-Hey, hey.

41
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,520
Hey, Ah Ryeong, we're on our way out.

42
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,770
 Kang Ha Ri's gang who ran away while being transferred after their trial 

43
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,750
 was caught on CCTV last weekend, breaking into a nursury located in Seoul. 

44
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,240
- Whose boyfriend is he?
 -  According to the police, 

45
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,940
- He looks so good on camera.
 -  they stole 10 billion won worth of cash and assets in total. 

46
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,400
In my opinion...

47
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,450
 The location where Kang's gang stole... 

48
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,400
You think so, too, right?

49
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,130
Gosh, I'm worried.

50
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,070
What if you live up to your good looks and give me trouble later?

51
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,250
You know, Kang Ha Ri's crew...

52
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,420
They don't seem to be such bad people.

53
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,180
What?

54
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,550
You know, if you look at the people Kang Ha Ri's crew swindled,

55
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,890
they were all evil people and robbers.

56
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,420
Are you a good person if you rob evil people?

57
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,570
You're just as evil as them.

58
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,190
That's not it.

59
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,020
Right, this incident, too. Because they caused a scene there,

60
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,730
the CCTV footage was exposed and the evidence of abuse was found.

61
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,880
Kang Ha Ri knew about it and did that on purpose.

62
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,250
Aigoo, stop fantasizing about vigilantes.

63
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,210
Last time, they even donated the money they stole

64
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,420
from Samgyeong Group owner's family's slush funds in secret.

65
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,980
It's no secret if you know about it, is it?

66
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,650
Also, how can you fall for such fake news as a reporter?

67
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,720
What a great job you're doing.

68
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,920
No, Honey, it's true. Okay?

69
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,960
- Should I tell you the details?
 - Forget it.

70
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,340
Is he Hong Gil Dong or something?
  (Korean folktale, "Robin Hood") 

71
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:46,060
"Hong Gil Dong, Robin Hood, Im Kkeojeong, Kang Ha Ri."

72
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,570
Okay, I got the title for my next article on Kang Ha Ri. Thank you.

73
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,780
- Hurry!
-  Ah Ryeong, when are you arriving? 

74
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,150
You've got one minute left. Byeong Min, are you still not done?

75
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,660
-  Success! 
 - Yes!

76
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,270
I did it, Jin Woong!

77
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,620
 The goods have been acquired. 

78
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,520
 I found the item. 

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,950
I'll see you on that day then.

80
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,570
   

81
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,420
What are you doing?

82
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,420
Can't you tell?

83
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,260
We're going.

84
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,630
- Where?
 - Let's all go our own way.

85
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,890
We should've done this sooner.

86
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,910
We were too late.

87
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,580
We were too late, so Ah Ryeongâ€”

88
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,670
Let's...

89
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,300
not see each other again.

90
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,410
Byeong Min.

91
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,430
Do Jin Woong.

92
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,030
   

93
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:34,640
"His lobbying purpose is the privatization of K-Water and Korail, which are domestic public corporations."

94
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,040
"Beyond being simple illegal lobbying crimes,

95
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,850
it could be a sign of privatization in Korea, which will shake

96
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:47,150
the foundation of the country and damage the lives of its people."

97
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:10,220
"CEO Jeffrey Jeong of NQ Infracapital's Korean branch."

98
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,010
It's all done now.

99
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:28,430
I replaced the intake system, the exhaust manifold, the thermostat housing, and the water pipe.

100
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,420
You'll be able to use it for about ten more years now.

101
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,910
- You can make your payment there. 
- Yes.

102
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,220
- Hey, I said to hand it over. 
- Please don't do this.

103
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,450
You said you'd bring it by today.

104
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,060
Is it in his pockets? Hey, run his pockets.

105
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,010
- Don't do this. Don't do this. 
- Let's see.

106
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,710
Hey!

107
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,880
What are you doing?

108
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,700
Who's this cutie we got here?

109
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,640
How old are you? You want to have fun with us?

110
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,540
I'll introduce you to my friends. Let's go.

111
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,720
H-Hey, I brought a new friendâ€”

112
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,730
Hey, beat her up!

113
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,120
Come over here!

114
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,440
She's just like her big sister.

115
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,920
We'll never bully our friends again.

116
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,760
I'm sorry.

117
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,570
 I'm sorry. 

118
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,340
If you bully someone one more time, I'll come find you.

119
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,090
I'll be watching. Take care.

120
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,810
- Yes, Nuna.
 - Yes, Eonni.

121
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,410
Eonni, Nuna, my foot.

122
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,560
How dare you mix my DNA with yours?

123
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,320
Why are you still here?

124
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,800
You want some more beatings?

125
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,990
- N-No.
 - No.

126
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,850
Please take care.

127
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,220
Thank you.

128
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,170
Raise your head and straighten your shoulders.

129
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,070
Try to be a bit more brave.

130
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,070
Gosh, what the hell.

131
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,720
My goodness.

132
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,310
Are you a fly or something?

133
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,720
A fly, my ass.

134
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,220
What's with you?

135
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,110
Why are you here?

136
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,440
Wouldn't it be the same reason as you?

137
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,630
Hey, carry this for me. It's so heavy.

138
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,400
Ah Ryeong said I'm the only one who knows about her younger sister.

139
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,100
She told me, tooâ€”

140
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,200
- Don't get caught. 
- You think this is my first rodeo?

141
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,950
Are you sure we should be doing this behind her back?

142
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,180
Then, should we go up to her and say, "It's nice to meet you."

143
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,150
"We're Ah Ryeong's old colleagues."

144
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,960
"We've always wanted to meet you." Huh?

145
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,280
- Well, no, but we should at least apologize... 
  - Can someone help me? 

146
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,630
- Yes, I'm on my way. 
- I mean, she'sâ€”

147
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,770
That's something we say just to make ourselves feel better.

148
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,260
It's better for her to remain strangers to people like us.

149
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,810
Hey, hey. She's coming. Hurry, hurry!

150
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,980
I wonder who you might be.

151
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,130
Are you with those folks over there?

152
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,510
What are you doing later after work?

153
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,760
I've got plans.

154
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,390
With who?

155
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,570
Who?

156
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:13,670
It's the person I love the most after Jeong Su Min.

157
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,470
You even love this person?

158
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,650
Yes, I do love this person.

159
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,630
Who is it? Who?

160
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,620
You're not going to talk, huh?

161
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,840
- Hey, i-it's a secretâ€”
 - Tell me.

162
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,090
   

163
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,610
Don't we get too much work?

164
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,210
We get too much work.

165
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,370
You said we should go for a company dinner.

166
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,780
Good morning!
    

167
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,030
- Good morning.
 - Hey, Su Min, you're here.

168
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,550
Yes.

169
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,200
   

170
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,480
   

171
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,250
Hyeong Min. The director wants to see you.

172
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,240
 You want me to drop this story? 

173
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,070
 You know it, too, Director. This case isn't a simple lobbying scandal. 

174
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,220
 The order came from above. Just do as you're told! 

175
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:21,590
 He's known as CEO Jeffrey Jeong of a foreign investment company. 

176
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,270
I'm pleased to meet you, Minister of Justice.

177
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,660
It's my honor to meet you.

178
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:28,410
 He's known as a competent and successful entrepreneur. 

179
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,630
 But his true nature gets more mysterious the more you dig. 

180
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:38,170
 Some say he used to be the leader of a murderous gang. 

181
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,450
 Well, that's only a rumor. 

182
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,020
 Anyway, what's certain is that he'll do anything for money. 

183
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,420
 The crimes he has been committing 

184
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,170
 will also start surfacing in our country within the next few years. 

185
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:06,400
 By then, he'll have become even more unstoppable. 

186
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,450
 The funds he acquires through all kinds of crimes 

187
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:16,200
 are probably being distributed to powerful figures in Korea at all levels. 

188
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,670
That's really nothing.

189
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:25,140
Invest that money in CEO Kang Do Yeong's company I acquired.

190
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,410
You'll be very satisfied with the result after.

191
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,500
 It's the birth of a cartel, 

192
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,030
 where the leaders of this country stick together for money. 

193
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,910
My company plans to buy K-Water and Korail first.

194
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:42,210
 He'll dissect this country into pieces and sell them off in the end. 

195
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,040
 Privatization and sale of Korea's public sectors. 

196
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,910
 That's his actual purpose. 

197
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,220
After they sell everything off and reap benefits among themselves,

198
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,490
the incurred damages will be...

199
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,970
the common people's responsibility to shoulder.

200
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,690
As it has always been.

201
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:10,600
By the way, there's something that still bothers me.

202
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,750
The next president. It's the general election soon.

203
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:21,210
Right. No one can ignore the next presidential candidate's influence.

204
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,440
Who's the most promising candidate right now?

205
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,710
It's about half and half between us and them.

206
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,510
It's either one of the two...

207
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:35,520
But whoever gets voted in, we just need to control him properly.

208
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,300
No.

209
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,320
If there's a problem, I'll be the one controlling.

210
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,360
Let me ask a different question.

211
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,000
Who's the most useful candidate right now?

212
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:58,940
You care about the people more than I do.

213
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,260
But all I do is talk.

214
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,000
I have no idea what to do about it.

215
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,610
So, what's your plan going forward?

216
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,860
First off, I'm done with this company because the owner is already one of them.

217
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,070
I'll have to contact a different channel.

218
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:19,000
If that doesn't work, either... I'll start my own channel or something.

219
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,450
In any case, your answer is that you'll fight?

220
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,970
Yes.

221
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:30,600
All right, then. I'll help you, too.

222
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,420
- Sorry?
 - I said I'll also help you in your fight, Reporter Sin.

223
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,600
Tell me if you need anything.

224
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,590
I'll also think about the solution on my end.

225
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,920
But Assemblyman, you must be busy because it's the election season.

226
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:54,410
Hyeong Min. The reason I'm trying to become the president is to help the people.

227
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,530
If I turn a blind eye to a matter that threatens the people

228
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,660
and just focus on becoming the president,

229
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,070
I'd be putting the cart far ahead of the horse. Am I wrong?

230
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:11,560
Also, this election won't be mine anyway.

231
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,840
All right.

232
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,990
Thank you.

233
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,260
 It looks realistically challenging. 

234
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,680
It doesn't matter.
    

235
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,460
It's not about getting the position.
   

236
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,740
It's about making it.

237
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,170
Yes, and this is what Mr. Kang mentioned earlier.

238
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,960
 There's a reporter called Sin Hyeong Min in my company. 

239
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,410
 And it looks like he's digging into you, Jeffrey. 

240
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:48,220
 He even had the lobby list where I'm included. 

241
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,760
 What should I do? 

242
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,680
 I can have him expelled as a corrupt reporter on my end. 

243
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,280
 No, let's leave him be. 

244
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,750
 Sorry? 

245
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,250
 Let's... 

246
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,300
 give him brief freedom. 

247
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,960
All right. Let's drink.

248
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,900
Welcome.

249
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,200
What's this? He said he was meeting a person he loves, which is why I came.

250
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,540
I was wondering who it was.

251
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,790
Hyeong Min said he loves me?

252
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:29,680
- Whatever.
 - Assemblyman! I'll pour you a shot this time.

253
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,980
- Assemblyman. That's not it. 
- Yes.

254
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:38,120
You're my father-in-law, not "Assemblyman." Right? Like this.

255
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,120
- What's this? He's really drunk! 
- Father-in-law!

256
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,600
 Cheers! 

257
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,060
 What should we do about the reporter? 

258
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:51,240
Who'll be keeping watch on Kang Do Yeong this time?

259
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,710
Here.

260
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,230
It's me.

261
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,820
Let's get you one more job before you go.

262
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,900
   

263
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,240
Was the info I gave you last time good?

264
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,900
Yes, I got to know more about him, thanks to you.

265
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,580
Want me to get you more info?

266
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,800
No, I don't need more info.

267
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,770
You know the thing I asked for last time? My friends' passports and plane tickets.

268
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:29,400
I already sent your friends theirs. Yours is...

269
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,650
I'll get going.

270
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,380
By the way,

271
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,420
why don't you give it another thought?

272
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,030
I stayed in that organization for ten years.

273
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,910
It's too big of a mountain for you to shoulder alone.

274
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:15,160
Why? Are you worried you'll lose a customer?

275
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,140
There's that too.

276
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,520
More than that,

277
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,530
let me tell you one thing as a friend who owes his life to you.

278
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,630
What you are trying to do

279
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,800
might not get you what you want.

280
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,960
Hey, what are you doing here?

281
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,920
Oh, Byeong Min!

282
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,190
You live here? I was just looking for the bathroom around here.

283
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,390
The bathroom is downstairs.

284
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,740
I see. Nice seeing you.

285
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,300
Hey.

286
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,020
Come in.

287
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,320
All right.

288
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,290
What's the matter?

289
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,420
Well, it's nothing much.

290
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,470
   

291
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,440
You got one, too?

292
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:15,540
Did that idiot think we wouldn't know it was him if his name was not on it?

293
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,210
Will you do it?

294
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,490
I don't know.

295
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:33,210
Was there anything else you got from him?

296
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,160
I'm sure he's doing fine.

297
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,180
Geez, what are you drinking your alcohol with?

298
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,530
H-Hey, you can't smoke here. Go outside and smoke.

299
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:50,370
- All right. I got it.
 - Why you little...

300
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,710
   

301
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,160
   

302
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:09,570
 The press you introduced me said they'll publish it. 

303
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,370
 This is all thanks to you, Assemblyman. 

304
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,640
 I didn't do anything. 

305
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,210
 You did it all. 

306
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,420
Assemblyman, it's time for you to leave.

307
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,570
Is it already time?

308
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,150
Why did you want to see me, Assemblyman?

309
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:35,210
It's nothing. I'm just asking for your favor before the election.

310
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,740
Am I in the position to grant anyone a favor?

311
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,400
You'll see about that if you just wait.

312
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,980
Oh, it's this way. I'm sorry, but I'll make a call and come right in.

313
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,440
Yes.

314
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:00,680
Welcome, Assemblyman Choi Sang Ho.

315
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,550
Make me the president?

316
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,640
How will you do that?

317
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,040
You'll see if you just wait.

318
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,420
No, thanks.

319
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:26,920
I've no interest in messing around with a person like you.

320
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,040
 Breaking news. 

321
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,560
 Yu Gwang Min, the top candidate in the presidential election, 

322
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,580
 has allegedly illegally gained profit from stock price manipulation. 

323
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,640
Does it still look like I'm messing around?

324
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,580
 It's causing commotions in the financial market and political field. 

325
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,150
 And it's garnering the nation's attention. 

326
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,290
 We'll talk to Reporter Lee Yeong Jun, who's at the scene. 

327
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:02,190
 Yes, this is Reporter Lee Yeong Jun, speaking from the scene. 

328
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,170
 It was just found out that Candidate Yu Gwang Min gained illegal profit from 

329
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:10,020
 stock price manipulation and used it to create a slush fund. 

330
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,820
 The Prosecution issued a warrant this afternoon 

331
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,550
 and is known to have started an investigation on Candidate Yu Gwang Min. 

332
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:19,630
 With this incident, Candidate Yu Gwang Min's presidential election opponents are 

333
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,970
 expecting him to drop out of the race. 

334
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:27,500
 This means Candidate Yu won't be able to gain the people's votes through a fair election. 

335
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,980
 This incident poses a grave problem that's shaking the foundation of the national economy. 

336
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,160
 The people are calling for strong punishment and transparent investigation 

337
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:40,830
 into these irregularities for the sake of national security and a fair economic environment. 

338
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,370
 So, this is how you use your power? 

339
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,930
You live up to your rumors.

340
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,970
I'm already aware of what the rumors say about me

341
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:57,610
and what you think of me, Assemblyman.

342
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:02,400
Then you probably know what my answer is, too.

343
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,330
Of course, I do.

344
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:08,530
But let me tell you, Assemblyman. If you reject me,

345
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:14,020
my power you just mentioned will be given to another candidate.

346
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,360
Are you alright with that?

347
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,340
You know better than anyone, Assemblyman.

348
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,980
You're this country's best option.

349
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:37,240
To willingly become the worst for the best of the country...

350
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,460
How beautiful that sounds.

351
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:47,210
Isn't that a true sacrifice for the people?

352
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:01,340
It's not what you desire, but you just need to close your eyes and concede a few things.

353
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:07,100
It's always one deal after another, whether it's politics or business.

354
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,360
Don't you agree,

355
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,910
President... Choi Sang Ho?

356
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:35,380
Besides that business you're carrying out and that organization of yours...

357
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,700
Is there anything else

358
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,720
I have to concede?

359
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,830
That will do.

360
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:56,500
The rest are too trivial and pathetic compared to the prospect

361
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,800
 of you becoming President.
   

362
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:07,600
You won't have anything to worry about.

363
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,610
 It's not something we can avoid. 

364
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,730
 Even if I'm able to turn a blind eye as a reporter, 

365
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:45,200
 I'll eventually run into it as a citizen of this country. 

366
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,100
 The Public Official Election Act prohibits candidates 

367
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,800
 from donating in any form in principle. 

368
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,320
 Regarding candidates' book of pledges, they're only allowed to be 

369
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,400
 published according to regulations and sold through ordinary means. 

370
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,160
 The Supreme Court has, regarding candidates... 

371
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,150
We're like a couple who's been married for 20 years.

372
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,540
Hyeong Min, look at me.

373
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,750
Okay.

374
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,760
How do you feel? Does your heart flutter when you look at me?

375
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,500
 There were big and small fluctuations between the candidatesâ€” 

376
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,910
Yes, of course. That's a given.

377
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:45,350
You'd be in big trouble if you had answered a second later.

378
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,800
- Honey. 
- Yeah?

379
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,330
Do you want to go on a date this weekend?

380
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,650
A date? What's the big occasion?

381
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:02,220
Well, there's something I want to tell you, too.

382
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,360
Something to tell me? What is it? Tell me now.

383
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,890
Well, you see...

384
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,030
Be patient until this weekend, Jeong Su Min.

385
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,260
So lame.

386
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,800
 ...has been confirmed. 

387
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:23,510
 According to public opinion surveys, candidate Choi Sang Ho's popularity continues to grow. 

388
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:27,190
 - The question of whether they will continue to support him...  
 - Whoa, that's insane!

389
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,930
Ajeossi's in the first place! First place!

390
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,490
Y-You're right. That's great.

391
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:38,120
 Choi Sang Ho's overwhelming approval rating suggests that confidence in the direction 

392
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,220
 - of his policies and leadership is...  
 - That's a big difference.

393
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:46,110
 The focus is on whether candidate Choi Sang Ho will continue to lead the race. 

394
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,290
   

395
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:20,090
   

396
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,160
   
  

397
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:52,280
- I made it on time.
 - I rushed all the way over here.

398
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:57,690
   
  

399
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:03,280
The schedule in Korea this time is really meaningful until the end.

400
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,820
Never thought I would visit a zoo.

401
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,070
 May I have your attention, please? 

402
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:15,880
 CEO Jeffrey Jeong's special lecture will begin soon. So if you are seated, 

403
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,960
 please turn your phone to silent or vibration mode in advance. 

404
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,230
Once again, may I please have your attention?

405
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,100
Kang Ha Ri wants to get rid of Jeffrey?

406
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:28,080
CEO Jeffrey Jeong of NQ Infracapital, a global company, will start his seminar soon.

407
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:32,820
I believe it'll be possible if it's Kang Ha Ri.

408
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,930
But how, when Jeffrey already rigged everything?

409
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,730
 E-Excuse me! Excuse me! 

410
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,380
 How can you suddenly cancel the broadcast? 

411
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,630
 I said there was a mistake. 

412
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:47,160
 The contents you prepared are way too far off from our company's direction. 

413
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,060
 I'm sorry. 

414
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,350
 What's your direction, then? 

415
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,700
 Is it NQâ€” Or being Jeffrey's henchman? 

416
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,060
 How dare you! 

417
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,500
Kang Ha Ri got rid of cunning bastards like Jeffrey in a cunning way.

418
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,140
In the end, he did serve justice right.

419
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,820
I'm saying I hope he'll do the same about Jeffrey.

420
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,740
You're mistaken.

421
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,350
Kang Ha Ri is an evil person just like him.

422
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:18,070
Fighting evil with evil? That can never become justice.

423
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:22,600
So, you need to quit having false hopes for criminals.

424
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,670
Kang Ha Ri's different.

425
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,940
Kang Ha Ri's actions always contained compassion for others.

426
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,670
Get yourself together.

427
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:33,440
- Is Kang Ha Ri the hero of justice or something?
  - We'll invite CEO Jeffrey Jeong to the stage. 

428
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,000
 Please welcome him with a round of applause. 

429
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,910
   
  

430
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:50,470
A world where the more competent people get to enjoy more things.

431
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,810
That might sound like an obvious premise,

432
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:57,160
but in fact, our world isn't like that.

433
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,720
One who succeeded with so much effort

434
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,330
and one who belittles others' success sitting in a room

435
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,710
both enjoy the same rights and the same privileges

436
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:08,500
just because they're the citizens of the same country right now.

437
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:14,840
That's an insult to people who lived with their lives on the line.

438
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,420
That in itself is another inequality.

439
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:22,240
I think that's the fault of equality and an error of systematic equality.

440
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,220
Such faults and errors are abound right now, which is why it's time to change this world.

441
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:33,590
NQ and I will be leading the start of such change.

442
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,490
 What you are trying to do 

443
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:03,750
 might not get you what you want. 

444
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,060
- Mr. Jeong. You're just as great as I heard. 
- Not at all.

445
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,310
Hey, Honey.

446
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,750
Yes, I'm almost there.

447
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:21,620
Okay. I'll be there soon.

448
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,290
Okay.

449
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,360
What's this?

450
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,260
- Wh-What's going on?
 - What's happening?

451
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,380
- What's going on here? 
- Hurry up and move.

452
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,220
Stay with me. It's time to go.

453
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,020
The stairs.

454
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,160
No one is here.

455
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,170
Stay down. Stay still.

456
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,910
He's gone.

457
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,670
You crazy bastard!

458
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:38,350
I knew you'd get yourself into trouble, man.

459
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:40,040
What?

460
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,140
How did you know to come here?

461
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,750
You think I can't find you?

462
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,030
Forget it, man!

463
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:52,380
Is Ah Ryeong coming back, just because you kill that bastard?

464
00:41:54,540 --> 00:42:00,140
Hey, let's think about a way together.

465
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,480
How did you come here?

466
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,400
How else? I took a taxi, asshole.

467
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:19,150
So, I shouldn't come?

468
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,220
When a friend seems to be getting himself in trouble without saying a word?

469
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:41,350
Hey, man! You didn't hold me back!

470
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,220
Give me a break. You and your pride.

471
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,970
You need to fix that.

472
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:50,190
Being proud for no good reason.

473
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:05,860
The night wind is chilly.

474
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,070
My nose is running.

475
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,820
Let's go.

476
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,720
   

477
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,310
Hello?

478
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,280
Pardon?

479
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,170
What are you talking about...

480
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,440
   

481
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:06,770
You! You bastard!

482
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,050
I told you. That you have to concede a few things.

483
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:13,750
Is a human life a joke to you?

484
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,970
You didn't have to take it that far!

485
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:20,730
I determined whether it was necessary or not.

486
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,490
You...

487
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:30,090
I will not let you get away with it. Never.

488
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,740
You must've forgotten.

489
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:42,810
If I get hurt, you'll get hurt as well.

490
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:48,370
I've worked so hard on your current approval ratings. Each and every detail of that.

491
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:54,750
Don't forget that we're on the same team.

492
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:58,750
That reporter. We killed him together.

493
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,660
Congratulations.

494
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:11,100
As of today, instead of a noble loser, you've become a bloody winner.

495
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:26,610
 What is the truth behind that day and ever since? 

496
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:29,900
Did you really...

497
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,530
Let's wrap up for the day. Be sure to gag the reporters.

498
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:41,020
Yes, sir.

499
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:46,550
Ajeossi! Ajeossi!

500
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,650
Ajeossi!

501
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:54,460
 My truth is that... 

502
00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:00,560
 I have never deceived you. 

503
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,260
 Okay. 

504
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:07,720
 Ajeossi. 

505
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:17,380
 Whether it's the media or the police, what they're saying about Hyeon Min is all lies. 

506
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:23,590
 I'll be sure to find out what exactly happened to Hyeon Min. 

507
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:30,020
Of course, I couldn't leave you alone to dig into Hyeon Min's death.

508
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,570
 Su Min. 

509
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:36,370
 After you send him off, come and see me. 

510
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:40,210
 I have something to tell you. 

511
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,260
That's why I came up with the idea.

512
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,240
Since it's come to this,

513
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:54,490
I'll have you fight him within my boundary.

514
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:17,880
   

515
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:20,280
   

516
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:24,480
 Jeffrey Jeong. 

517
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,800
 It's him. 

518
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,720
 The man behind Hyeon Min's death. 

519
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:40,570
 It will be a very long fight starting now. 

520
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:52,040
I know what a cowardly and heartless choice this is.

521
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:56,990
I will readily accept the punishment for that.

522
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,720
 Su Min. 

523
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:07,430
 Please take good care of her until the very end. 

524
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:09,400
 Yes, sir. 

525
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:02,740
 What is this place? 

526
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,760
 It's a hideout. 

527
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,440
 A hideout? 

528
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,960
 It's the official beginning of the mission. 

529
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:17,600
 These are candidates who will be working with us. 
   

530
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,710
 Could you look into these people? 

531
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,550
   

532
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,210
 Eonni was right. 

533
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:30,810
 My sister had good oppas. 

534
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:39,460
 Should I slowly get started? 

535
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,440
 Let me in, too. What you guys are preparing for right now. 

536
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,160
 - No, never!
 - Oh, okay, okay! 

537
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,220
 What do you mean okay? 

538
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,810
 I won't say I look forward to working with you. 

539
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:57,470
 Let's each survive to the best we can. 

540
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:03,010
 As you mentioned, these guys have some debt as well. 

541
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,110
 The debt they owe Jeffrey. 

542
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:10,150
 So, they have a definite motivation. 

543
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:18,250
 Then, shall we test them to see if they qualify? 

544
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,890
 It's you, right? The person who called me. 

545
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,530
 Thank you everyone for being here tonight! 

546
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:34,560
 Have you looked into how you will catch him? 
  

547
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,150
 After he gathers a bunch of investors regarding a new project he's starting, 

548
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:39,770
 he suddenly cancels the project for some ridiculous reason. 

549
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:41,590
 The estimated damages are about 230 billion won. 

550
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:43,520
 That's the money we will be stealing from Kang Do Yeong. 

551
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,140
 - The method is actually quite simple. 
- It's sent. 

552
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,640
 Install malware in his digital wallet to let us hack it. 

553
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,280
 In the cryptocurrency field, this is called crypto-jacking. 

554
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,040
 It's as common as the rug pulling he's been doing. 

555
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,080
 Just one year. If you'll work with me for one year... 

556
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,820
 - What happened?
 - ...I'll have your records erased permanently. 

557
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:06,250
 Whoa, 4090T! Daebak! 

558
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,850
 - Whoa, I love this. 
- What's the job? 

559
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:11,880
 What's the first job we're to take while we're here? 

560
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:17,060
 All kinds of hallucinogens and drugs are being distributed with Club Libido at the center of it all. 

561
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:20,510
 - I'll tell you! 
- CEO Kim Yun Gi of KU Entertainment. 

562
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:25,350
 Slave contracts and forcing the trainees to be escorts. Dealing drugs. 

563
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,570
 The troubleshooter for Korea's VVIPs. 

564
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,870
 I really don't know anything about this! Prosecutor! 

565
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,470
 Two years ago, there was a huge real estate fraud in the city of Gangha. 

566
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:45,330
 Over 50 billion won in damages and several hundreds of victims. 

567
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:46,970
 - Myeong Ji Hwan.
 - Myeong Jeong Oh. 

568
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:48,770
 - I said it's Myeong Jin Wu.
 - Myeong Won Seok. 

569
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:52,540
 There are four more names Mr. Myeong uses. 

570
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,420
 Satan, get behind me. 

571
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:59,920
 His name is Im Sang Sik. 

572
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,410
 He's the chairman of the Almighty House of Truth. 

573
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:04,630
 I'm your Haneulnim. 

574
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:09,110
 Let's teach Supreme Leader Im, who sells out heaven and does all kinds of dirty deeds, 

575
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:11,660
 what the real hell is. 

576
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:19,420
   

577
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:29,510
Jeffrey is in the country.

578
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:36,750
Oh, okay.

579
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:01,970
   

580
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:18,540
 Prosecutor Jang. Prosecutor Jang! 

581
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,940
   

582
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:47,230
 What is the truth behind that day and ever since? 

583
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:51,390
 Ajeossi! Ajeossi! 

584
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:53,600
 Ajeossi! 

585
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:21,520
 - Father-in-law, I'll pour you a glass. 
- Goodness. 

586
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,050
 Cheers! 

587
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,780
   

588
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,660
 After you send him off, come and see me. 

589
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,480
 I have something to tell you. 

590
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,890
 Ha Ri, there's something you must see. 

591
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,090
   

592
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,810
Didn't you cut me off?

593
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:42,960
I did. At the time.

594
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,310
So, why are we meeting today?

595
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:47,660
I got shot. A sniper.

596
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:51,050
By chance, are you suspecting me?

597
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:53,480
Right? You were the one, weren't you?

598
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,850
Did you get shot in the head?

599
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:57,260
What? No, my shoulder.

600
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,540
I almost died.

601
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:02,940
Well, are you asking me to catch the culprit?

602
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:06,630
Or in case there's a chatroom for snipers or something?

603
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:09,450
Right. Is there really something like that?

604
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:11,550
Don't you share the latest trends and stuff?

605
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:13,960
You did. You did get shot in the head.

606
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:17,510
I'm leaving if you're going to ramble on. I have no idea.

607
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:20,520
Come on, I'm just kidding.

608
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,020
I think it's about time you know about it.

609
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:29,640
We exposed the people who were under Kang Do Yeong, but they all died.

610
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,870
And since you were involved in the Kang Do Yeong case, your safety isn't guaranteed.

611
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:36,070
So, be careful.

612
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,130
Don't worry too much, though.

613
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:41,940
I'm telling you, so you know.

614
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,510
Contact us if anything comes up.

615
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:45,540
We'll pay attention.

616
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,000
Okay.

617
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,370
Sin Wu Yeong.

618
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:55,280
It's best not to fight, to begin with. But...

619
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,140
if you've begun the fight already, do your best to protect yourself.

620
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,820
Don't let them take away what you cherish ever again.

 About that bastard and Ajeossi's relationship. 

631

 You're greedy, but you don't want to take responsibility?

 If you kill one person, it's murder. 

634
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:08,830
 But if that number goes up to a hundred or a thousand, it becomes a revolution. 

635
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:11,690
 What? Hey, no, no! 

636
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:16,130
 Our hideout has been attacked.
