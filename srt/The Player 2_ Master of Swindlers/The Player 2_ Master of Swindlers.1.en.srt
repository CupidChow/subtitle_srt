What? What can you do with our amazing legal system?

8
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,690
Isn't the law supposed to catch criminals and protect the innocent?

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,300

- Setting, complete.

10

Okay, let's get started.

11
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,870
We only get involved as much as we can handle.

12
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,700
It fits right into our business principles.

13
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,150
If we're stealing, we might as well only steal what they can't report.

Hey, hey, look at this. There's no end to how much I could fill in this bag.

How about it? I'll rescue you from here, so come and work with me.

Bingo, I found it.

38
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,910
He's rumored to have been scouted by the NIS when he was 20

39
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,150
and he's revered as a genius in this field.

40

That's it! I bypassed it all!

41

He can't do anything without me.

My abilities are special.

It's known as an EV company, but it's actually a foreign paper company

that is smuggling out national treasures overseas.

Today, we will steal the national treasure they smuggled out, the brass Buddha statue.

While I lead away the security to the rooftop, Byeong Min will disarm the access security,

There's just 10 seconds left.

That's 300 million won per person in cash.

111
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,600
It's an illegal slush fund from the paper company on the third floor, so they can't even report it.

Hey, pull the car out and pull over there. He says he's quitting.

178
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,100
Seriously, I'm not joking. I'm quitting. Stop.

179
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,710
- Yeah, just quit. Let just us three do it.
- Stop the car. Hey, I said, stop the car.

180
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,880
I'll study computers myself.

181
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,830
Gosh, get off, get off.

182
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,250
- Hey, I can just do it.
- I mean, that's not it. I'm not really quitting!

183
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,890
Hey, wake them up!

184
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,290
Drag them away.

185
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,500
You're awake.

186
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,380
You don't know how much I've suffered because of you.

187
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,340
You all are supposed to be dead,

188
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:09,880
but our boss has so much affection that he's letting you live.

189
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,910
You see over there?

190
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,790
You should be grateful.

191
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,790
So, listen to me carefully.

192
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,030
If you try to pull something to escape,

193
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:32,310
I'll kill one of your friends for every antic of yours.

194
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,550
But you know, my boss says not to kill all of you.

195
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,190
Letting you guys live...

196
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,860
Just one person! Just shoot one!

197
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,240
Then, nothing will happen to the remaining three.

198
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,380
You bastard!

199
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,420
Let him go.

200
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,590
All right. Take this.

201
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,190
Just kill the most useless one.

202
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,400
That is the most reasonable.

203
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,160
I'll give you 10 seconds.

204
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,600
If you don't decide within that time, you'll all die.

205
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,300
That's right.

216
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,660
Boring.

217
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:40,130
I thought you'd be different since you dared try to steal my stuff.

218

No!

223
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,240
I shouldn't have flipped out at Unni...

Take this.

225
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,360
It was Ah Ryeong's share. Take it.

You think I came here for something like this?

227
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,250
I don't really care why you came here.

228
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,020
You're quite...

229
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,340
exceptionally rude.

230
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,170
Yeah, I tend to be exceptional in most areas.

231
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,300
- Let me in, too.
- On what?

232
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,920
What you guys are preparing right now.

233
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,760
What we're preparing for? There's nothing like that.

234
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,400
All of our MBTIs happen to be P's, so we don't plan.

235
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,560
No, that's not even in our dictionary.

236
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,220
Just go and live like everyone else.

237
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,060
As an ordinary person.

238
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,590
I knew you would be like this.

239
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,870
I'll see you again.

240
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,090
What do you mean? I'll never see you again!

241
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,250
Hey, take this with you!

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,030
You're leaving?

Hey!

What did she say?

245
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,810
Well, you know.

246
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,380
Hey, don't you hear something?

247
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,630
Gosh, the more I think about it, the more it's pissing me off.

248
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:13,750
- Yes?
- I don't think you should just sit back like that.

- This is our car!

- Give it back! You're stealing it!
- Hey, move, move.

- No, I don't want to.

261

Then let us in.

262
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,550
- If I let you in?
- Then what?

263
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,690
Then let me on your team.

264
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,150

How did they know about this place?

272
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,960
Because I reported to them.

Everyone, hang tight!

The gang who scammed the suspects in the mysterious crime case

292
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,700
disappeared without a trace.

293
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,920
It appears to be a similar method as the one used by Kang Ha Ri's gang in the past

294
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,000
who fled while in transit after their trial.

295
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,880
They ransacked the scammers' base

296
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,890
and turned over the files to the police station.

297
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:37,200
It became the conclusive evidence for solving the case.

298
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,650
The violent incidents and thefts by this gang have been targeting criminals thus far.

299
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,790
There are many interpretations as to

300
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:49,760
what their goal is and why they are helping police investigations.

301
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,550
The police say though they are helping police investigations,

302
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,950
they would not be able to avoid legal ramifications.

303

Candidate Choi Sang Ho of the Hanguk Party was elected.

306

After two attempts, President-Elect Choi

307
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:14,160
caused a stir by taking advantage of the public's desire for a change of government.

308
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,780
It's been exactly one year since President Choi Sang Ho assumed office today.

The bell of hope is ringing to mark the new year of 2023.

I-I mean, how could that be?

322

329
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,690
It's value.

330
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,810

Those around the world who have become rich,

They always focused on the distant future.

334
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:43,070
That is the difference between becoming rich or poor.

00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:49,060
I believe with all my heart that you here are those who understand that difference.

356

Hey. Maybe it's because of the time difference, right?

So, I thought you were trying to get revenge.

477
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,040
But seeing you today, I don't think that's it.

478
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,480
Why do you think it's not?

479
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,730
Because there's no desire for revenge against Kang Do Young in your eyes.

480
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:15,470

00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,950
What do you do?

529
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,910
I'm running a scam through a small website.

530
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:08,380
It's nothing compared to you, Sunbaenim.

531
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:12,360
Gosh, no, no. That's how I got started at first, too.

532
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,290
Gosh, you're really my hoobaenim, I see.

533
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:17,720
Thank you.

534
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,240
But what brought you here to this faraway country?

535
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:29,200
I also happen to run a small laundering business in Korea.

536
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:31,860
Yes.

537
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,470
Oh, you're diligent.

538
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,170
It's nothing.

539
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:40,440
But I happened to get connected to someone who's running a big laundromat here.

540
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,840
So I came out here, thinking I'd do a big business with him.

541
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,970
Oh, someone like that was here, I see.

542
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:54,690
Yes. He happens to handle only VIPs quietly.

543
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:05,740
- Please take care.
- Yes, yes. You should also get home safely, Hoobaenim.

544
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:08,470
- Okay.
- Let's meet again soon.

545
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:09,880
Yes, Sunbaenim. I'll be going.

546
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,470
- All right.
- Yes.

547
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,600
Shall we hug?

548
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,670
Pardon? Oh, yes.

549
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:19,710
- Sewoon High, fighting!
- Sewoon High, fighting!

550
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,320
Then, good night. I'll be going.

551
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,570
All right, good night.

552
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,350
Look into who he is.

553
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:38,020
Yes, understood.

554
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,950
Da In, Daddy's here.

555
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:46,090
Da In, Daddy's here.

556
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:48,050
Oppa, you're home.

557
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:50,360
Da In. Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo.

558
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,190
You're hungry, right? Let's eat.

559
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:54,320
Da In, let's eat! Let's eat.

560
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,520
Let's eat!

561
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:24,010
This is your wife's will.

562
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:30,070
It appears your wife suffered losses from an NFT scam.

563
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,250
And she was recently diagnosed with depression.

564
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,280
We'll have to investigate further,

565
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,130
but it appears she suffered from immense guilt.

566
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:46,990
I wanted to reduce your load,

567
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,180
but I've become a burden instead.

568
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,940
I'm sorry, Honey.

569
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,000
I'm really sorry.

570
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:02,650
Let's work hard and buy a house like that later.

571
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:06,380
All right, I'll try even harder.

572
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:44,330
Oh, is that food?

573
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,560
Hey, did you sleep well?

574
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,570
The bed was comfy, right?

575
00:48:58,570 --> 00:48:59,850
You...

576
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:03,480
Gosh, the sofa was so hard.

577
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,330
What happened?

578
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:07,940
What do you mean, what happened?

579
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:10,150
I told you I'll save you.

580
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,400
Let's eat breakfast first.

581
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,130
Gosh, you spread the jam weird!

582
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:17,950
Ha Ri, look, look at the celebrity news.

583
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:21,740
Hey, where is the meat I bought last time?

584
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,350
What meat? We ate it all already.

585
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:25,540
I told you I can't do without meat. I'll suffer muscle loss!

586
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,440
- I think you've suffered brain loss.
- Gosh!

587
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,620
Stop it!

588
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:31,180
What are you guys doing!

589
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,880
We're just trying to have a meal together.

590
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,190
What did you say?

591
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:39,900
I'm saying you shouldn't detonate and ruin your life just because of a scammer.

592
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,860
You don't even know me!

593
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,310
Your name is Shin Woo Young.

594
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:47,010
You were born on June 23rd, 1996, at 2:15 p.m.

595
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:49,700
Rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram. Hour of the Ram, right?

596
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,330
You joined the 1st Air Brigade in January 2015

597
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:54,310
and transferred to the 707th Special Missions Group in June.

598
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:58,060
Your military number is 15-530624. And skip, skip.

599
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:02,120
In early September of 2022, your wife Kang Ji Ae got a loan with her art academy as collateral

600
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,510
and invested in NFTs run by Kang Do Young.

601
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:07,510
After the investment fraud, she overdosed on medication and-

602
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:10,940
If you know so much about me, you must know why I'm doing this.

603
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:14,800
I'll be leaving.

604
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:19,100
I'm doing this because I know.

605
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,270
Whether you believe me or not is your choice.

606
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:32,950
But I'm doing this because I know it.

607
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:37,360
Smile with your child and eat good food.

608
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,120
Go back to your ordinary everyday life like that.

609
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,120
That's what you need to do.

610
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:57,820
After he gathers a bunch of investors regarding a new project he's starting,

611
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:00,910
he suddenly canceled the project for some ridiculous reason.

612
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:05,980
Of course, he doesn't return a single penny despite the project canceling.

613
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,880
This is a method in this field called rug-pull that Kang Do Young uses.

614
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,600
Rug-pull?

615
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,240
So, to put this easily, it's basically an eat-and-run.

616
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,450
Eating and then running away, you moron.

617
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:17,950
People actually fall for this?

618
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:20,820
You wonder how many people would actually fall for something like this,

619
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:25,120
but over 1,200 victims fell for Kang Do Young this time.

620
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,840
Oh, no...

621
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,510
Why... what happened?

622
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:30,440
What do we do!

623
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,070
My money!

624
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,510
What are you going to do! Do you know how I got that money?

625
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:36,010
I didn't know this would happen.

626
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,500
If you didn't know, you shouldn't have-

627
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:42,080
And among them are victims who ended their lives like that guy's wife.

628
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,090
The total losses amount to about 230 billion won.

629
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:47,620
That's the money we will be stealing from Kang Do Young.

630
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:51,290
He keeps all that money in his electronic wallet as cryptocurrency.

631
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:53,510
That's why he's looking for a way to launder it.

632
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:54,980
His name is Lee Shin Woo.

633
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,080
According to our company's information team,

634
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:01,060
he's quite famous in the money laundering field.
[Lee Shin Woo]

635
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:06,390
And he's quite resourceful, and he's never been caught by the legal system.

636
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,570
So, he's done it without knowing the taste of prison.

637
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:11,120
Yes.

638
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,960
He's good.

639
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,490
What do you think? Do I look like a laundering expert?

640
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:31,050
You look like my neighborhood laundromat owner.

641
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:33,600
- Pretty witty.
- Gosh, my eyes.

642
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,420
- Watch your mouth.
- Gosh, look at that face.

643
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,490
Hey, you definitely look like a scammer.

644
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:39,850
If you're jealous, just say so.

645
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:41,680
Talk about brutal.

646
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,480
- Should I put this on?
- Geez!

647
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:57,010
Be careful.

648
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:00,330
What?

649
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,340
Are you nervous?

650
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:14,040
No, why would I get nervous?

651
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,610
Let's go.

652
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,030
Smile.

653
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:36,580
Hello.

654
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:46,730
How are you?

655
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:51,110
I-It's hot, right?

656
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:17,050
Aigoo, aigoo. Aigoo, you would come to such a lowly place.

657
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,590
Did you experience any discomfort coming here?

658
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,670
Oh, no.

659
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:22,980
This is Nason Jang, as I mentioned.

660
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,570
I'm Nason Jang.

661
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:29,070
Maybe it's because you do such a clean business. You look quite neat.

662
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:31,160
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

663
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,930
Shall we sit down and talk?

664
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:34,730
Let's go.

665
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:37,830
Take the call.

666
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:40,940
- It's a video call. Is that okay with you?
- Sure, a video call. It's fine.

667
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:46,820
Nason gets business day and night. Please do understand.

668
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,970
Aigoo, Chairman Kim Woo Seong.

669
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:51,390
What brings you to call me at this hour?

670
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:57,930
Oh, Nason, the thing is...

671
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:02,770
My grandson caused some trouble.

672
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:06,520
It looks like he'll need to stay abroad for some time.

673
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,640
So, I need your help.

674
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,080
Then, should I send him through one cycle like last time?

675
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,080
Yeah, I think that will be good.

676
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,360
Please do that for me.

677
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:21,140
- I'll pay you more than last time.
- Is that Chairman Kim Woo Seong of Sanhwa Group?

678
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,560
- Oh, no need for that.
- Yes.

679
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:26,080
It is the Sanhwa Group that's ranked third in the financial world.

680
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,290
I feel much better, thanks to you, Nason Jang.

681
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:31,290
This is nothing.

682
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:34,530
Chairman, don't worry about a thing and rest easy.

683
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:37,050
All right, okay, okay. Goodbye.

684
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:39,650
All right, thank you, yes.

685
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,370
Geez...

686
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:46,130
- My apologies.
- If you're done, come this way.

687
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:48,010
- Let's go.
- Wow...

688
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:53,940
Gosh, Sanhwa Group, Sanhwa Group, Sanhwa Group.

689
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,060
Sanhwa Group! Wow!

690
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,210
Someone that even chaebols would use!

691
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:05,000
I should have recognized who you were sooner, Mr. Nason!

692
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,810
Thank you, CEO.

693
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:09,790
If you want, we can take you to the next step.

694
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:13,760
We can get you citizenship in St. Kitchens-Evies or Vanuatu

695
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,570
so you can use the money you laundered right away.

696
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:22,120
For someone like you, time is money.

697
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:28,890
Seriously, I'm so touched that I'm about to cry!

698
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:31,900
Hoobae, I'll never forget what you've done for me.

699
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,140
Gosh, it's nothing.

700
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,890
Aigoo.

701
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,370
But CEO.

702
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:45,680
I'm thinking about wrapping up such minor jobs

703
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:50,280
and running a major NFT business like you, CEO.

704
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,790
- Really?
- Yes.

705
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:54,610
We've already started preparations for it.

706
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:58,350
And Mr. Nason happens to be an NFT minting expert.

707
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:02,030
Oh, you've got many talents, I see.

708
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:03,520
Thank you.

709
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,480
Since we're on the topic, how about we show the CEO?

710
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,720
Since actual players in the field may have another level of discernment.

711
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,240
Oh, sounds good.

712
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,760
Then, let's take a look. Taking a look isn't anything difficult.

713
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:19,680
Then I'll connect directly to your e-wallet right now, CEO.

714
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,840
Please take a look for us since we lack discernment.

715
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:26,770
Okay, I sent it to you.

It's good. It's great.

719
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:44,400
With this quality, you can get people to fall for it if you just say the right things.

720
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,940
Whoa...

721
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,100
But you know how that's the difficult part.

722
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,000
That's why someone like you are amazing, CEO.

723
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,980
It almost sounds like you want me to do this together.

724
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,840
If you would do that, we would be so grateful! Isn't that right, Nason?

725
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,150
No doubt about it! Of course!

726
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:06,970
We'll give you half of our profit. Fifty percent!

727
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:08,990
Half?

728
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:10,920
Half, you say?

729
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,840
50/50.

730
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:27,750
Half?

731
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:32,120
Half!

732
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,450
Half!

733
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:39,420
Shit...

734
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:42,630
hey, you sons of bitches!

00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,260
Come over here, damn it.

736
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:52,500
Gosh, these sons of bitches are trying to scam a scammer.

737
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,530
CEO, i-is there some kind of problem-

738
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:57,440
- Shut up, you bastards.
- On your knees.

739
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,070
Get down!

740
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:05,040
Don't you think I know you will try to steal my money if I rush to hop on board?

741
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:10,870
Gosh, I came to do some laundering, and I'm dealing with shit water instead.

742
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,690
Hey, CEO, I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding. Please calm down-

743
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:19,170
What misunderstanding!

744
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,930
Did I misunderstand?

745
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,810
No, there's no way.

746
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,540
What did I tell you?

747
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:41,880
I told you they're all scammers.

748
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:55,980
