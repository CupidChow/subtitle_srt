- Preaching in front of a camera is

177
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,606
vastly different from preaching in front of the congregation.

178
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,926
If you watch what I do from the side, it'll be a big help to you.

179
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,986
I'll keep that in mind.

180
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,276
Messenger Kim, your looks are outstanding.

181
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,766
What you have to eat to look like you?

182
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:06,906
Anyhow, you'll be in charge from now on, so keep a close watch.

183
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,430
It's an honor.

184
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,720
Truth.

185
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:29,660
<i>Supreme Leader Lim Sang Sik of Almighty House of Truth's online sermon will start soon.</i>

186
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,996
Get the prompter going and start streaming right away.

187
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,986
We'll start.

188
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,720
One, two, cue.

189
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,366
Beloved Believers, hello.

190
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:51,516
I'm the chairman of Almighty House of Truth.

191
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,036
I'd like to share with you the word about

192
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,456
- the grapevine and prophecy today.
- He looks great on camera.

193
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,016
Haneulnim had told us.

194
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,710
I'm the grapevine, and you're the branch.

195
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:45,050
<i>You can be a scammer who's after my money!</i>

196
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,116
<i>I guess you watch too many movies.</i>

197
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,496
<i>No, I don't have the time for movies. It's all from experience.</i>

198
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:57,376
<i>With my hands, those traitors, scammers, spies, and all!</i>

199
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,626
<i>My precious experience!</i>

200
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,546
<i>What is it now?</i>

201
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,566
<i>I think you should escape right now.</i>

202
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,396
<i>Why?</i>

203
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,846
<i>I think the Prosecution will rush in soon.</i>

204
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,606
<i>The Prosecution?</i>

205
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,926
<i>I've got a friend inside the Prosecution.</i>

206
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,536
<i>You killed a person?</i>

207
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,146
<i>No, your question is wrong.</i>

208
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,716
<i>"How many people have you redeemed?"</i>

209
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,676
<i>That's what you should ask!</i>

210
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,166
<i>Redeem?</i>

211
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,506
<i>They're not dead. They're still alive.</i>

212
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,326
<i>They're only living in numerous people's bodies in separate pieces.</i>

213
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,896
<i>They're totally fine-</i>

214
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,556
<i>You killed people and sold their organs?</i>

215
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,766
<i>That expression isn't quite beautiful.</i>

216
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,026
What are you doing, idiots? Turn it off right now!

217
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:45,406
<i>How many lives did I redeem by sacrificing those bodies?</i>

218
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:48,280
- <i>That's what matters.</i>
- Get out of the way, idiots!

219
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,880
Who are you?

220
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,316
Who else?

221
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,926
A brother who's pissed at you.

222
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,850
This little!

223
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,076
It's self-defense from now on.

224
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,710
Self-defense, my ass!

225
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,526
We think he exists in an unknown world, a place that's much like outer space.

226
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,226
However, that's absolutely not the case.

227
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,946
Haneulnim exists next to you, in front of you,

228
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,956
and behind you, all the time, in love.

229
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,266
I wish I could put this video under that and show it to him.

230
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:33,570
But why? Why do we always doubt him?

231
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,606
Prosecutor Kwak arrived.

232
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,636
We need to get Leader Lim.

233
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,806
Operation...

234
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,630
Rabbit Hunt.

235
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,696
We'll make Leader Lim go to the holy ground on his own.

236
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,686
More specifically, Leader Lim will take me to the holy ground.

237
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,206
You need a hunter who'll corner Leader Lim into the rabbit hole?

238
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:05,686
Yes, but the important thing here is that you have to only pretend to catch him.

239
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,126
Let's go in.

240
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,530
Yes!

241
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,550
Let's go this way.

242
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,196
<i>All right. Prosecutor Kwak is going in now.</i>

243
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,760
Okay.

244
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,570
That will be the end of today's sermon.

245
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,930
Truth.

246
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,050
I'll cut it here.

247
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,980
Thank you for your work.

248
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,726
The Prosecution's coming inside right now.

249
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,510
What do you mean?

250
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,190
Please look at this.

251
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,896
T-Truth.

252
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,740
Chairman, I think you need to see this.

253
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,200
What is it?

254
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,196
<i>They're only living in numerous people's bodies in separate pieces.</i>

255
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,806
I think this video was streamed, not the sermon.

256
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,400
You confessed to murder and organ trafficking.

257
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,436
Those hell-bound satanic bastards were hiding among us, huh?

258
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,176
Chairman, the Prosecution will barge in soon.

259
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,616
You must go.

260
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,146
Let us go.

261
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,020
Damn it!

262
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,060
- Let's go.
- Yes.

263
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:38,250
I'll take care of things here. Please escape quickly.

264
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,136
You satanic prosecutor.

265
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,020
You filthy bastard.

266
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,916
You're a f***ing serpent of Satan.

267
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,000
- He left, idiot.
- You trash-

268
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,900
We really don't have to go after them, though?

269
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,400
They left.

270
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,136
Excuse me, Prosecutor. This is a secret.

271
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,220
There's a reason Leader Lim's holy ground has been hidden thoroughly so far.

272
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,496
<i>The moment Leader Lim leaves House of Truth,</i>

273
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,116
<i>at least four teams accompany him right away.</i>

274
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,716
<i>- Teams?
- Yes.</i>

275
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,926
<i>That means you just need to follow all of them.</i>

276
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,766
<i>He and I already tried following them.</i>

277
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:29,446
<i>But Leader Lim wasn't in any of the cars we followed.</i>

278
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,266
<i>Even the places they arrived at weren't exactly the holy ground.</i>

279
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,216
<i>Leader Lim was in a different car from the beginning.</i>

280
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,616
Those four cars were just decoys.

281
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,296
So, the car Leader Lim takes whenever he leaves House of Truth...

282
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,876
We don't know that.

283
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,280
So, what do you know?

284
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,780
I wouldn't know.

285
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,416
Is our rabbit hopping around well?

286
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,410
Why don't you take a look?

287
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:21,450
Is he a rabbit or a cheetah?

288
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:28,380
I'm in the parking lot! Hurry up and come!

289
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,680
- Please get in this way.
- No, we need more people. Hold on!

290
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,560
Chairman!

291
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,936
This is the car. Let's get going.

292
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,660
I'll drive.

293
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,806
All right. It's the climax now.

294
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,460
Yes.

295
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,396
Hey, Mr. Kim?

296
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,076
Yes, Chairman.

297
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,590
Rather...

298
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,920
Ha Ri Kang?

299
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,450
Sorry?

300
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,660
Ha Ri.

301
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,280
Did you find out the destination?

302
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,486
W-Why? What's wrong?

303
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,566
You need to go to the parking lot right now.

304
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,980
What?

305
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,346
Hey, isn't this Ha Ri's phone?

306
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,956
Gosh, this is nuts.

307
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,256
- Is this real?
- Sorry?

308
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,070
Is this another operation that only works if I don't know about it?

309
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,920
I think he was...

310
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,190
kidnapped for real.

311
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,370
What do we do now?

312
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,726
We'll have to find him

313
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,260
for sure.

314
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,520
What would've happened if I hadn't received this from him?

315
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,596
Gosh, I was really close, seriously.

316
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,736
Hey, did you report to Jeffrey?

317
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,790
That we completely exposed you?

318
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,596
I'll warn you for the last time.

319
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,506
It'd be best to leave this place quickly.

320
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,630
Because my friends will be here very soon.

321
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,716
I'm sure it's already cold.

322
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,366
But it'll become unbearably colder from now on.

323
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,146
That's how this place is built.

324
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:18,006
And no need to explain how it gets at night.

325
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,546
No, continue.

326
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,466
It's nice and cool.

327
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,266
But you know what?

328
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:28,676
I don't plan to stay here until night, you see?

329
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,946
Kang Ha Ri, what do you think I'll do to you?

330
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,386
Well, I wouldn't really know.

331
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,540
How could I ever comprehend the Supreme Leader's will?

332
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,436
But I know one thing.

333
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,200
I think your life will be over pretty soon, too.

334
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,300
Hey, Kang Ha Ri.

335
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,206
See for yourself...

336
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:02,620
what it feels like to be frozen ice cold and burn in hellfire.

337
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,080
Continue what you were doing.

338
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,046
<i>Excuse me, Soo Min.</i>

339
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,136
<i>Yes, you can speak.</i>

340
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,160
There's nothing here.

341
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:25,060
I think he only has videos of his sermons here.

342
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:38,066
The person who knows the holy ground's location besides Leader Lim is...

343
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,226
- Director Bae.
- Didn't you say he disappeared?

344
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,876
Byeong Min, send me Director Bae's home address.

345
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,820
I'll go check right now.

346
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,590
No way.

347
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,880
Hey!

348
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,830
Over here.

349
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,980
Hey-

350
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,156
Hey.

351
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,336
What are you doing?

352
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,506
Hey!

[Epilogue]

600
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,900
This is a picture of the scene at the time.

601
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,766
- Is it a sudden assault?
- Its purpose is different from others.

602
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:07,396
The purpose is different?

603
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:10,996
It wasn't for money. It was for revenge.

604
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,516
It seems the man who was suspected as the assaulter

605
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:16,910
was a close friend of the dead reporter.

606
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,196
They knew each other?

607
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,806
Yes, he asked him to write a good article about his business

608
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:25,556
and even handed him some money, buying expensive meals, too.

609
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:28,696
But the reporter didn't keep his promise.

610
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,226
Still, how could he murder him?

611
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:34,196
Exactly. I also want to ask him why he killed him.

612
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:36,076
But I can't do that anymore.

613
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,650
Because the suspect killed himself.

614
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,326
The dead are silent, you know.

615
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:44,796
He confessed it was his doing in his will.

616
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,226
The suspect, as a cruel murderer,

617
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:50,316
and the dead reporter, as a corrupt reporter who was bribed by a friend.

618
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:53,156
That's how the two of them were branded as low-lives

619
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:57,680
and the case was dismissed without any proper investigation.

00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:30,060
He was murdered without publishing the article in the end.

624
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:37,230

626
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:50,286
I looked into it, and it seems there was a lot of controversy because of this article.

627
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:54,556
People were saying it must be published or it mustn't be.

628
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,656
It was buried in the end.

629
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,716
What's the reason?

630
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,226
There wasn't enough reason, apparently.

631
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:05,816
According to the article, he secured substantial proof through a news source,

632
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:10,136
but the evidence completely disappeared after the reporter died.

633
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:14,736
Of course, there might not have been substantial proof in the first place.

634
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:19,400
What can we do, though? Only the dead reporter knows the truth.
