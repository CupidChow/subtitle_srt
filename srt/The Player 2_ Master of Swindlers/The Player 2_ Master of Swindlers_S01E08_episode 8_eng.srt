1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,560
   

2
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,050
   

3
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,780
   

4
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,870
   

5
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,060
   

6
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,160
   

7
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:54,960


8
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,710
Supreme Leader, please save me!

9
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,860
Supreme Leader! Supreme Leader!

10
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,420
Supreme Leader! Supreme Leader!

11
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,780
Please save me! I'm sorry!

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,370
Go drug them or something. It's so damn loud.

13
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,890
- Bring me that punk from earlier.
 - Yes.

14
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,300
Shut the fuck up, you assholes!

15
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,390
Senior Manager Han Seong Seok?

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,670
Supreme Leader Im...

17
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,680
p-please save me.

18
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,780
Are you Senior Manager Han Seong Seok at Hanbit Investment Bank,

19
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,000
who is in charge of laundering my funds?

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,320
Yes, I am.

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,720
Why do you seem so unfamiliar to me?

22
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,680
Are you the one in that photo?

23
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:15,780
Just what on earth had happened for you to voluntarily show up at the Prosecution without a summons

24
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,900
and to collude with the prosecutor?

25
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,050
- T-The thing is—
 - I heard you stole my precious funds and got caught.

26
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,400
So, were you trying to avoid an arrest warrant or something?

27
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,680
Th-That's not it. Wait.

28
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,760
To sell me out,

29
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,600
so you can get out of there?

30
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,260
No! That's not it! P-Please spare me!

31
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,000
Please spare me! Please spare me—

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,550
No, that's wrong, Senior Manager.

33
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,820
It's not, "Please spare me."

34
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,520
"It's my fault. I'm sorry."

35
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,360
"I've committed a deathly sin!"

36
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,850
That's what you need to say!

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,890
 You even danced in front of my congregation. 

38
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,330
 The payment should be made accurately. 

39
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,530
 By chance, were you an actor? 

40
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,270
 You struggled to get up from the wheelchair 

41
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,360
 and started bawling as you were acting. 

42
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,600
 I was moved. 

43
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,730
All right. I'll introduce you two.

44
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,290
This over here is Traitor One.

45
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,870
Senior Manager is Traitor Two.

46
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,200
Haneulnim* whispered to me today,
  (Sounds like "the one in heaven") 

47
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,400
telling me to forgive only the one of you who survives.

48
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,190
I wonder who'll be forgiven.

49
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:33,680
   

50
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,850
Ha Ri, you can hear me well, right? 
   

51
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,850
Kim Han Jun, a graduate of Princeton Theological Seminary.

52
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,870
 - Kim Han Jun—  
 - Okay. Let's get started.

53
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,150
The almighty Haneulnim spoke.
    

54
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,420
I'll reprimand the devourer for your sake and

55
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,420
he'll not be able to destroy the fruits of your land.

56
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,280
 Truth! 

57
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,050
Dear everyone, you're robbing when you don't give tithe.

58
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,080
The tithe is a gift from Haneulnim.

59
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,690
It's how you send your faith to the heavens as a whole.

60
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,330
It's the path back to the heavens.

61
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,820
It's how you can save abundant blessings in the heavens.

62
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,960
"Aigoo, my life is so hard."

63
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,900
"I don't have money." These are all excuses.

64
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,400
Everyone, you must give tithe with offerings.

65
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,020
Your young children.

66
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,890
They don't have income or financial abilities.

67
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,410
They're all excuses, too.

68
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,900
The parents must collect their allowances and whatnot to give tithe in your children's names in their places.

69
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,250
 Truth! 

70
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,190
Haneulnim collects tithe in any way, shape, or form.

71
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,270
He allows accidents, diseases, and disasters

72
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,670
to those who don't give a tithe to retrieve the offerings they didn't give.

73
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:47,020
Everyone, I hope you'll give tithe properly and respect Haneulnim.

74
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,800
-  Truth!
 - Forever! 

75
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,720
-  Forever! 
 - Forever! 

76
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,980
-  Forever! 
 - Forever! 

77
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,200
The Supreme Leader's sermon today was such a blessing.

78
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,340
Right? It was so gracious. 
   

79
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,150
- I even had tears. 
- Seriously.

80
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,990
- Truth.
 - Truth.

81
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,890
Truth.

82
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,770
   

83
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,840
It's me, Supreme Leader.

84
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,840
Excuse me. Excuse me.

85
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,970
Could you be Brother Kim Han Jun?

86
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,200
Yes, that's me.

87
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,830
Please spare some time.

88
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,760
Supreme Leader is waiting for you.

89
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,610
Please come with me.

90
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,270
   

91
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,770
Brother Kim Han Jun!

92
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,230
It's a pleasure to meet you, Supreme Leader.

93
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,090
Yes, it's a pleasure. Please take a seat.

94
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,660
Let me see now.

95
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,540
Five hundred million won in cash as soon as you join us?

96
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,160
We have an extraordinary man here.

97
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,180
So, please tell me. How did you get to join our Almighty House of Truth?

98
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,320
You're as decisive as I heard.

99
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,520
As you heard?

100
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,750
Do you know me well?

101
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,910
I'm your fan, Supreme Leader Im.

102
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,590
I graduated from Brinceton Theological Seminary, too.

103
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,170
Brin- Brince...

104
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,860
You could've led a ministry in the U.S., then.

105
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,670
Why did you bother to come to us?

106
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,750
Well, to be honest, the U.S. is full of cults.

107
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,880
Supreme Leader—

108
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,610
I might as well join the best if I was going to.

109
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,300
The best...

110
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,390
So, you're saying,

111
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,550
I'm the best cultist there is?

112
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,610
All new religious leaders who are gathering believers in the U.S. right now

113
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,410
received professional training.

114
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,550
They learn public speech for charismatic sermons

115
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,980
and even study techniques like cold reading to read the believers' minds.

116
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,860
Cold reading?

117
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,700
It's how you find out about someone using non-verbal communication and

118
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,000
the way they dressed without any prior research.

119
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,310
Just like how you read your believers' minds by just looking at them.

120
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,400
Keep going.

121
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,790
You've managed your religion for more than 20 years

122
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,160
with your innate skills alone, without receiving any professional training.

123
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,890
Further, the Almighty House of Truth has never stopped growing

124
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,160
and it's also evading government regulations.

125
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,360
Such cases don't exist even in the U.S.

126
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,510
That's exactly why I had to come back to Korea.

127
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,420
We've got quite an interesting fellow.

128
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,400
Nevertheless, you speak as though you know everything about me.

129
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,290
But I'm completely different from ordinary ministers you know.

130
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:56,140
I need someone who can do anything to bring salvation to this world.

131
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,880
Mr. Kim?

132
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,050
Are you ready to charge ahead with bombs on your body for the sake of your faith?

133
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:12,680
I'm asking if you're ready to endure the pain of your body ripping apart for the god you believe in!

134
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:22,860
Haneulnim doesn't test you beyond your abilities.

135
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,640
So funny. I like you.

136
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,250
Director Bae, let's include Kim Han Jun in our services starting tomorrow.

137
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,260
Yes, I understand.

138
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,800
Thank you, Supreme Leader.

139
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,970
It's too soon to thank me.

140
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,500
I'm thankful you gave me a chance.

141
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,330
I mean it.

142
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,950
 Okay, Ha Ri's got it worked out. 

143
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,330
We got the CCTV, too.

144
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,480
What's this now?

145
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,700
 What concept is he going for? 

146
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,330
 He said he's a man with a deep story. 

147
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,150
 Single for 30 years? 

148
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,480
   

149
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,490
I-I'm here to register.

150
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,310
Register?

151
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,550
Admission?

152
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh, yes.

153
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,250
A-Admission.

154
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,690
Please fill out the paperwork first. 
   

155
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,880
I want to meet Leader Im first.

156
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,000
You can meet the Supreme Leader during the sermons anytime.

157
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,190
Yes, that's right.

158
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,730
- Fill out everything? 
- Yes.

159
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,310
   

160
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,970
Did Jin Woong get in okay?

161
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,630
- Yes, he's currently getting the best of both worlds. 
 - What?

162
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,770
 Hitting two birds with one stone, and meeting your crush at the library. 

163
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,390
That's what he's up to.

164
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,320
What about Su Min?

165
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,860
 She's not an ordinary woman for sure. 

166
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,850
Haneulnim said a loyal servant

167
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,570
will be entrusted to own everything.

168
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:46,380
Supreme Leader is a loyal servant of this church.

169
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:52,020
So, I'll also become a loyal servant of the Supreme Leader with all I have.

170
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,680
By the way, what kind of person is Director Bae?

171
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,200
He's a great man who started as a brother and worked to be ordained as a messenger.

172
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,350
By the way, where do you live?

173
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,340
Could you tell me your MBTI? I'm ENTJ.

174
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,630
- What's your blood type? 
- Boyfriend?

175
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,350
- What's your ideal type? 
 - It's Haneulnim.

176
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,010
Oh, truth!

177
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,280
Thank you. Thank you so much!

178
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,310
I think I can live properly now, thanks to you, Supreme Leader.

179
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:26,830
I'll really become a new person and do my best to live happily with my baby.

180
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,130
After you leave, walk the Path of Repentance alone.

181
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,100
When you finish walking the Path of Repentance, all your sins will be gone

182
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,250
and you'll be able to live a new life of glory.

183
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,770
Yes! Truth.

184
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,030
You must walk all by yourself with a repenting heart.

185
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,700
You must walk alone.

186
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,550
Thank you.

187
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,840
Director Bae.

188
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,790
Dear Director Bae!

189
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:15,240
I think your power of faith has weakened a lot these days.

190
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,120
When Han Seong Seok went to the Prosecution, what was my dear Director Bae doing loafing around?

191
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,210
I've committed a grave sin, Supreme Leader.

192
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,100
I'm not that generous a person.

193
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,560
You'll have to give your life if there's another mistake.

194
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,060
Thank you, Supreme Leader!

195
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,850
How did Han Seong Seok's HELICOPTER go?
   

196
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,320
They said it's worth at least 300 million won. 
   

197
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,980
- And the fetus capsule? 
 - It's in preparation with double the capital.

198
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,150
Be well prepared for tomorrow's community service at Nokyang Nursing Home as well.

199
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,730
Yes, I understand, Supreme Leader.

200
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,140
Are you going to stay here doing this?

201
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,130
I'll send a car to the Path of Repentance right now.

202
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,800
Go.

203
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:24,540
Haneulnim's love and forgiveness give us strength and courage,

204
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,890
helping us overcome the challenges in life.

205
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,450
Haneulnim's love and forgiveness gives us strength─

206
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,080
Over here. Nokyang Nursing Home.

207
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,890
Almighty House of Truth will go volunteer there tomorrow.

208
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,270
The purpose is recruiting new believers, not community service.

209
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,130
Aigoo, ma'am, have you been doing well?

210
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,150
- How are you feeling?
 -  This place isn't that high-end, 

211
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,360
 but it's one of the more luxurious nursing homes. 

212
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,220
 After it was built recently, 

213
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,230
 a lot of rich old people with cash entered the place. 

214
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,390
Almighty House of Truth has taken the place of your children now.

215
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:29,700
 We make sure you eat every day and make sure everything's fine with you. 

216
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,790
 We're actually better than your children. 

217
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,050
 And, most of all, dear Elders, 

218
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,900
you've got to meet Haneulnim and go to heaven, right?

219
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,010
- You're right. 
- We get it.

220
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,550
Your ticket to heaven.

221
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,950
Your ticket to heaven and eternal life.

222
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:46,950
You can get it guaranteed for sure!

223
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,030
- Truth! Truth! 
- Truth.

224
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,800
   

225
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,400
Aigoo!

226
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,930
- Aigoo. 
- Aigoo, you're here.

227
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,000
Nice to meet you.

228
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:22,200
There are people who were chosen by Haneulnim in every age.

229
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,060
Now, who has received Haneulnim's calling in this age?

230
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,870
It's our chairman, Supreme Leader Im Sang Sik.

231
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,630
 Truth. 

232
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,950
You're right.

233
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:41,700
We can say the Supreme Leader's words and the doctrine we know have equal levels of authority.

234
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,780
Yes.

235
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:49,630
We must listen more closely to Supreme Leader's teachings than the doctrines from the past.

236
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,900
- Truth.
 - Truth.

237
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,680
She's an outstanding believer.

238
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,830
- Oh, Supreme Leader!
 - Supreme Leader!

239
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,860
- Truth!
 - Eternal truth!

240
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,470
- Truth, truth!
 - Eternal truth!

241
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,570
- Truth!
 - Eternal truth!

242
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,690
Congratulations on joining us.

243
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:23,120
Haneulnim will always be with you.

244
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,630
Thank you, Supreme Leader.

245
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:34,350
All right. I hope you all have a great time, and I'll see you at the orientation.

246
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,010
 Truth. 

247
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,490
- Truth.
 - Eternal truth.

248
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,070
- Eternal truth. 
- Eternal truth.

249
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,580
- Eternal truth. 
- Eternal truth.

250
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,490
Truth. Truth—

251
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,910
Truth.

252
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,760
That's my Director Bae.

253
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,210
Our new believers here are very wealthy,

254
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,770
but they don't have much time left until they go to the heavens.

255
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,710
They'll be of great help to us, Almighty House of Truth.

256
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,780
You all saw what Director Bae did, right?

257
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,060
I trust you have learned a lot.

258
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,020
You can all go now.

259
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,720
What? Got something to say?

260
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,300
There's something I would like you to see.

261
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,000
She's Lee Seon Ja, and she's 80 years old.

262
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,590
She has more than 50 billion won in assets.
   

263
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,920
She's pretty gullible.

264
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,420
She burned a few hundred billion won on shamanistic rituals before moving to the nursing home.

265
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,890
Shaman?

266
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,120
Are you comparing us to those vulgar—

267
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,050
Whoa, whoa.

268
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,930
Keep going.

269
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:14,340
I'm saying she easily falls for superstition and religion.

270
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,310
And this man, Hwang Jang Hyeok, currently manages her wealth.

271
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,350
I guess you can call him her personal secretary.

272
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,860
I nudged him lightly, and he was very cooperative.

273
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,880
Ah. Director Bae, you were there, you must have seen.

274
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,540
Dear Believer.

275
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,710
I see your potential to become an Almighty House of Truth's messenger.

276
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,560
Truth.

277
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,710
How beautiful is it to see his passion and enthusiasm?

278
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,530
It's always quality over quantity for everything.

279
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,710
Many little is still little in the end, isn't it?

280
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,210
You're right.

281
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,730
Let's forget about the other old folks and focus on Lee Seon Ja.

282
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,940
Oh, and you're coming back tonight, right?

283
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,970
I'd like to invite you to a gathering where I only invite my special people.

284
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,160
As a messenger, you see.

285
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,070
Thank you, Supreme Leader.

286
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,600
I'm sorry.

287
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,460
It got all wet.

288
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,450
D-Daijoubu.
  ("It's okay" in Japanese) 

289
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,340
Daijoubu.

290
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,760
Excuse me, Mi Na.

291
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,230
Yes?

292
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,010
When did you come to Korea?

293
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:12,090
I used to be in the Japanese district of Almighty House of Truth.

294
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,490
I came here after my mother passed away a few years ago.

295
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,600
I see.

296
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,080
I'm sorry.

297
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,000
It's okay!

298
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,770
My mother was a heavenly bride.

299
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:35,420
Wait... th-that means Leader Im is your father...

300
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:40,390
Supreme Leader is different from ordinary people like us.

301
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:45,790
My mother was chosen as a bride for Haneulnim.

302
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,760
- Heavenly bride, huh? 
- Yes.

303
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,280
Gosh, it's really different when a man does it.

304
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,970
Your calves are as big as Lee Man Gi's. 
(A former champion traditional Korean wrestler ) 

305
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,530
Please help out over there later.

306
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,320
Huh? Supreme Leader Im!

307
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,660
- Hello!
 - Hello!

308
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,480
Hello!

309
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,420
This is the messenger candidate, Kim Han Jun, I told you about.

310
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,380
He's an important man who'll boost the betterment of the House of Truth.

311
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,970
This is a gathering for our messengers who work day and night for the House of Truth.

312
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:10,240
We meet once a month like this to have a time of recovery.

313
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,470
Take a seat and enjoy your time here.

314
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,590
All right.

315
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,640
You shall now know I'm him.

316
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,980
There's no other god besides me.

317
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,500
I'm your Haneulnim.

318
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,470
 Truth! 

319
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,490
I'll make you strong and resilient.

320
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,200
I'll truly help you out.

321
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,440
I'll hold you with my rightful hand.

322
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,490
 Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened. 

323
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,930
 And I'll give you rest. 

324
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,820
Heavenly Brides of the House of Truth, chosen by the heavens,

325
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:21,550
shall celebrate with all their strength for becoming servants of the heavens.

326
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,550
You'll go and eat your plants with joy

327
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,620
and drink your wine with a merry heart.

328
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,210
Have a good time, everyone.

329
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,400
Ha Ri will be okay, right?

330
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,620
It can't be helped.

331
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,310
To avoid suspicion,

332
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:55,740
he can't help but show them he's just as trashy as they are.

333
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,290
Messenger candidate Kim Han Jun!

334
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,400
- Yes, Supreme Leader!
 - What a tiresome guy.

335
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,440
You didn't even learn how to have fun at that age?

336
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,480
Don't be like this.

337
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,300
There's a ritual we can't skip at our time of recovery!

338
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:38,810
New messengers and messenger candidate Kim Han Jun, come out to the front altogether!

339
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:56,020
All right! Do what we always do.

340
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:02,350
Let your imaginations unfold and show us what we all want to see!

341
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,120
 What fucking scum. 

342
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,840
That trashy bastard.

343
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:31,110
I'll grind him up in a blender into a pulp.

344
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,780
That fucking—

345
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,260
Hey, is there anything worse I can say?

346
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,210
Hey, Mr. Kim!

347
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,870
Gosh, what an annoying guy. What are you doing right now?

348
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:52,030
If you can't even do this, I don't think we'll be able to work together.

349
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,890
I'll give it a try.

350
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,220
Really?

351
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,390
Clap again now!

352
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,760
It's me.

353
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,570
Everyone's really asleep, huh?

354
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,370
Gosh, that was a close call.

355
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,310
Good job.

356
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,990
 The moment you drink this, you'll start to feel drowsy very slowly. 

357
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:53,600
 It'll be a very nice and deep sleep. 

358
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,080
 This is the antidote. Take it in advance. 

359
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,060
 You can drink all you want, but you won't fall asleep. 

360
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,630
Gosh, that damn scum.

361
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,960
Is Director Bae our next step?

362
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,140
Yes, it's the beginning of the bloody battle for the crown.

363
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,880
Get some sleep, so you won't be suspected.

364
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,210
I'm sensitive, so I can't sleep well if I don't have my bed.

365
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,620
Wait, at least sing me a lullaby—

366
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:03,230
What a waste of muscles!

367
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,490
Gosh, be gentle!

368
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,140
Look at you after doing some laundry.

369
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,620
Some laundry?

370
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,910
- Some laundry?
 - Aigoo!

371
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,800
Don't laugh at household labor. They're very sacred jobs.

372
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,040
You went overboard to impress her, huh?

373
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,910
Right?

374
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,000
You weren't sent in there to flirt.

375
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,900
You went in to cut the throat of Leader Im, whom she worships as a god!

376
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,500
- I said it's not!
 - My gosh.

377
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,430
- He smiled, right?
 - Forget it and put one on your mouth.

378
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,240
- Gosh, stop!
 - Your mouth is your problem.

379
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,800
Stop it! It's making me drool.

380
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,540
- You like her that much?
 - I said to stop!

381
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,120
Just move in with her.

382
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,530
Get dressed. Can't stand the sight.

383
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,240
Do it properly. I need to do the laundry tomorrow.

384
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,900
What's the test result?

385
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,930
No special substance was found, even from the messengers.

386
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,890
It's the same for Kim Han Jun, right?

387
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,610
Yes, that's right.

388
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
How odd.

389
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,230
All right. Good work.

390
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:28,560
- Excuse me, Supreme Leader. I think yesterday's situation is a bit... 
 - Huh?

391
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,740
Everyone fell asleep due to fatigue, all at about the same time, too.

392
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,780
It has never happened before,

393
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,950
until Kim Han Jun joined us.

394
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,050
It's not Kim Han Jun. It's Messenger Kim Han Jun!

395
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,090
Haneulnim is watching everything.

396
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,910
Stop making a fuss and get your job done quietly.

397
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,800
I apologize, Supreme Leader.

398
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:09,640
Where there's envy and fights, there's only noise and evil.

399
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,840
Hey, welcome.

400
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:27,180
Thanks to you, my soul was well-fed last night. Thank you.

401
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,200
Gosh, don't mention it.

402
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,150
You're one of my men now, so we need to walk together now.

403
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:37,190
But I think I'll have to teach you how to have fun personally.

404
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,620
I'll learn anything properly.

405
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,800
And I had such a great sleep.

406
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,410
I don't think I've felt this refreshed in a long time.

407
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,950
That's good.

408
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:52,010
Also, there's a new believer orientation today.

409
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:55,380
I'd like to see if you're as good at sermons as you're with missions.

410
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,100
Please leave everything to me.

411
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:02,540
I'll prepare well so the new believers will be willing to even offer their souls to you, Supreme Leader.

412
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,150
Souls...

413
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:09,850
Everything is possible for he, who believes.

414
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,740
I'll look forward to it.

415
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,360
Truth.

416
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,260
   

417
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,680
Hey, Director Jeong. Do you have time for a call?

418
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,970
Have you heard of Brinceton Theological Seminary graduate named Kim Han Jun?

419
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:38,380
I've been taking care of the graduates of Brinceton.

420
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,280
But I've never heard of that name.

421
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,820
 Are you sure he's a Brinceton grad? 

422
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,860
I contacted you because I don't think he is.

423
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,760
There's always those scamming bastards.

424
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,280
Yes. Thank you.

425
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,340
   

426
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,160
You bastard.

427
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,770
I knew it.

428
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:07,510
Responsibility is truly a heavy and painful thing.
    

429
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,060
They say there's no job as hard as parenting

430
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:14,700
because you need to shoulder the responsibility of a child's life.

431
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:20,890
The heavy pain Haneulnim suffered 2,000 years ago began

432
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:25,390
with the responsibility he had to forgive the sins of all believers in this land.

433
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:30,010
It began with the responsibility of having to redeem all believers!

434
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,590
 Truth! 

435
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:37,140
And it's such an enormous responsibility and pain

436
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:42,190
that our Supreme Leader is shouldering alone!

437
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:47,990
Just think about what those lowly beings out there are saying without knowing anything.

438
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:51,200
- Truth.
 - Our Supreme Leder is...

439
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:58,100
right now enduring a pain greater than the pain from 2,000 years ago.

440
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:02,380
And it's all for our sakes!

441
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,620
 Truth! 

442
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,680
- Truth!
 - Eternal truth!

443
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,550
Eternal truth!

444
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,560
Truth! Eternal truth!

445
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:17,110
Truth! Eternal truth!

446
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,830
 Truth! 

447
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:22,990
 Truth! 

448
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,220
Truth!

449
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,540
 Truth! 

450
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,810
Director Bae will become a bird and fly away.

451
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:42,600
And our Mr. Kim will become Leader Im's successor to fly away even higher.

452
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,150
Aigoo, thank you for the sermon.

453
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:50,010
My, you're handsome, and your sermon is good, too. You're the best!

454
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,120
You're so great.

455
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,590
 I was touched. 

456
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:57,520
Supreme Leader, there's something I must tell you.

457
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:04,870
You see, Messenger Kim Han Jun wasn't actually a graduate of Brinceton Theological Seminary.

458
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,710
So?

459
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,760
Sorry?

460
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,180
Is it a problem he lied to me, or that he's not a graduate of a prestigious university?

461
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,180
No, the thing is—

462
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:23,700
Do you still not understand what I want from you?

463
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,970
I'll keep it in mind, Supreme Leader.

464
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,800
Keep a close watch on Lee Seon Ja.

465
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,660
Also, give me the report on how you'll work on her.

466
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,010
Gosh, it's so hot.

467
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,730
Gosh, it's so hot!

468
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,030
Great job.

469
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,960
I really thought I was going to die.

470
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,370
Yes, Mi Na.

471
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,010
I came outside briefly for some business.

472
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,090
No, no.

473
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,730
I'm a man of my word, no matter what.

474
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,020
Yes, I'll treat you to dinner later at a great place.

475
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:24,020
Don't they say love blooms even during wars?

476
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:28,120
He's here. Let's go now. He came just in time.

477
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,270
Oppa, let's go.

478
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,280
Welcome aboard, Grandmother.

479
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:50,490
I knew you had what it takes.

480
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:54,280
But the problem is whether or not you know not to cross the line.

481
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,140
Well, I'm not too sure about crossing the line.

482
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:03,250
But I'm not dumb enough to forget you're Haneulnim and the god in the Almighty House of Truth.

483
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:07,230
Oh, regarding Lee Seon Ja, the grandmother you brought.

484
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,680
I also did some research.

485
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,200
But she's not an easy old person to mess with.

486
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,460
Will it be okay?

487
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,180
I'll have to make sure she can't find anything after the job, even if she sues.

488
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,110
I'll make sure nothing traces back to Almighty House of Truth or you.

489
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,430
That's right.

490
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:25,060
I'll tell you the specific details later.

491
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,380
Go now.

492
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,220
 - Hello.
 - Hello. 

493
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:43,070
 We made a new brochure. Do you want to see? 

494
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,730
 Sure. 

495
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:50,480
If you look inside, we made a section for our believers...

496
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:15,560
He's shooting a romance film by himself.

497
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,670
Can you really say it's a romance with that mirror?

498
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,320
It's more of a thriller or a horror.

499
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,200
I've got a plan today.

500
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,710
No matter what happens, don't call me.

501
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,070
Why is he so excited?

502
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:35,010
- He's got a date today.
 - A date?

503
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:37,460
Man, who knew this could happen, right?

504
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:41,250
I lived to see a punk like him going out on a date.

505
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:48,360
But what makes you so different from him?

506
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,500
Jin Woong and I are the same?

507
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,280
Your confidence is good.

508
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,750
But if you lived this long, I think you should know yourself, at least.

509
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,460
Are you flating with me right now?
    

510
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,850
It's "flirting," you idiot.

511
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,900
Hey, hold on.

512
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,330
It's Leader Im.

513
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,170
- Yes, Supreme Leader.
 -  Hey, it's me. 

514
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,640
 I need you to come right now. 

515
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,860
- Right now?
 -  Yes, and when you come, 

516
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,890
 bring Lee Seon Ja with you as well. 

517
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:27,170
Is something going on right now?

518
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:29,030
 Let's talk after you get here. 

519
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,810
Oh, yes.

520
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:33,200
But it'll take me some time. Will that be okay?

521
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,370
 You'll have to hurry up, though. 

522
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,110
I see—

523
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:01,080
Supreme Leader, what's the matter at this late hour?

524
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,860
I had forgotten it briefly.

525
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:09,000
When you receive a great gift, you must first suspect it.

526
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,820
Suspect?

527
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,650
Are you talking about me?

528
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,860
Director Bae said he witnessed a very interesting scene.

529
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:24,570
W-Wait, what are you doing right now? Huh?

530
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:30,380
Director Bae, reading the air is my specialty, but I have no idea right now.

531
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,000
Huh?

532
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,230
I saw it all.

533
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:44,150
This grandmother right here is actually an actor you hired.

534
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,790
You planned to deceive the Chairman and us with this fake grandmother,

535
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:51,000
so you could stab us in the back.

536
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,830
A fake grandmother?

537
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:58,070
Supreme Leader, you even personally researched Lee Seon Ja, didn't you?

538
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:02,440
It's not at all difficult to create such fake data,

539
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:08,330
compared to creating a fake grandmother with a disguise as elaborate as this.

540
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,390
A disguise?

541
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:12,370
Are you kidding me right now?

542
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,670
Director Bae said he saw it clearly with his own eyes.

543
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:19,920
How that grandmother got rid of her disguise and turned into a young woman.

544
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,200
Wait, are you going to keep listening to this nonsense?

545
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,320
Let's take the Madam and get out right now!

546
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,030
All right!

547
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:33,230
Let me show you the truth now.

548
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,970
It's flawless.

549
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:10,160
Wait, why is this so...

550
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,260
What are you doing?

551
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,500
What kind of rude behavior is this?

552
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:18,250
I'm sorry.

553
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:23,050
Supreme Leader, I clearly saw it.

554
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:25,120
This grandmother got rid of her disguise

555
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,820
and she's supposed to turn into a young woman—

556
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:39,290
Envy is a really frightening emotion.

557
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:44,930
It turned Director Bae into such a mental patient and it even turned me into a fool like this.

558
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,680
Guys.

559
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:54,080
Gather the wheat into the barn, but the chaff he'll burn with unquenchable fire!

560
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:58,140
S-Supreme Leader, believe me. I clearly saw it!

561
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,490
Supreme Leader!

562
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:01,660
   
  

563
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,490
 Ha Ri. 

564
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:19,180
 This is Mrs. Lee Seon Ja. 

565
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:23,990
 Her husband was fooled by Leader Im and lost his entire life savings. 

566
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:26,910
 She said she wanted to help us. 

567
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:33,840
 I came because I was told there was something I could do. 

568
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:39,780
 Thank you. You came to the right place. 

569
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,910
 I'm Cha Jae Yi, and I'll be playing your role from now on. 

570
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:48,190
 Nice to meet you, Jae Yi. 

571
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,320
 No, I saw it! 

572
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,400
 - You can't let that man fool you!  
- That damn moron.

573
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:01,260
What a bunch of rude people.

574
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,820
Madam, we should leave.

575
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,460
I've really made a fool out of myself.

576
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,560
Director Bae has always been so smart.

577
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,200
"If you think you're standing firm, be careful that you don't fall."

578
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:24,680
Perhaps his position was too much for him to handle.

579
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,050
Because your shadow is just as deep and wide, Supreme Leader.

580
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:31,310
Since Director Bae isn't here anymore,

581
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:34,830
you'll be playing an important role from now on, Messenger Kim.

582
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,730
I'm ready.

583
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:39,020
That's why I came back to Korea.

584
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,470
Messenger Kim.

585
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:49,580
There's a place we call the holy ground.

586
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,810
Holy ground?

587
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:04,020
There are only a few who know of its existence, and even fewer people know of its location.

588
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,140
And you can say that place

589
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:09,890
is where my everything resides.

590
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:14,390
Everything, you say?

591
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:18,540
Yes, my everything.

592
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:22,780
After we're done with Lee Seon Ja, let's convert it all to gold.

593
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,760
And that's when I'll...

594
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:30,790
show you my Holy Ground.

595
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:34,320
I'm honored, Supreme Leader.

596
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:42,220
I've got something to do right now. So, I'll get going.

597
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,780
Truth.

598
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:54,150
Get it ready.

599
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:03,390
B-Boss, please make it beautiful.

600
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:06,270
It's for a really beautiful person.

601
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:09,010
Mi Na chan.
  (Chan is a Japanese term of endearment) 

602
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:10,870
Anata no tame ni...
  ("For your sake," in Japanese) 

603
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:12,770
For...

604
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:15,860
For you...

605
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,790
   I'm sorry, Jin Woong. 

606
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:27,310
 I was leaving, but the Supreme Leader suddenly wanted to see me. 

607
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,790
 Hey, Mi Na. This thing called the heavenly bride. 

608
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:36,600
 Don't you think it's a bit weird? It's like sinning— 

609
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:42,740
 If Supreme Leader says it's not a sin, then it's not a sin without question. 

610
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,790
Hey, Byeong Min, it's me. Can you take a look at the CCTV right now?

611
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:05,320
How did it go?

612
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:09,900
If they go that way...

613
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,730
They're headed to Leader Im's personal prayer room.

614
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:13,780
 Have you ever been there? 

615
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:16,150
That room is off-limits for regular believers.

616
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:17,430
 It's the same for messengers. 

617
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:20,680
 It's Leader Im's private space, so he's the only one allowed to enter. 

618
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:25,220
What? So, no one would know what happens in there.

619
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,550
So, to his own daughter— Gosh!

620
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,730
There's no way he would.

621
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:34,180
Come on! That can't be.

622
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,820
No way.

623
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,860
What's the matter?

624
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,510
I mean...

625
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:00,240
Haneulnim whispered to me today.

626
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:08,050
"Let Sister Mi Na bask in the glory of a Heavenly Bride."

627
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,420
You'll listen to Haneulnim's prayer directly.

628
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:49,720
You're getting the glory of talking to me alone.

629
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,190
Who can stand before my wrath and

630
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:00,990
who can survive in front of my fearful anger?

631
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,130
If you're not truthful to me,

632
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:27,830
I shall have you killed by my hands.

633
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:37,130
 The call is not going through. 

634
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:41,120
Mi Na, please! Please pick up. Mi Na!

635
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:45,460
 The call is not going through. 

636
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,250
What's this?

637
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:57,230
   

638
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,920
What's the matter?

639
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,160
Someone ran that way in a hurry just now.

640
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,690
Get him!

641
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:09,680
Toward the emergency exit.

642
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:17,350
Okay, I lured them away. Go inside now.

643
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,010
What's going—

644
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:32,860
What brings you here at this late hour, Sister?

645
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,290
Supreme Leader.

646
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:39,990
I've got something to tell you in private.

647
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,620
Right here?

648
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:52,020
Yes, right here.

649
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,240
Hey, which way is it?

650
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,960
Oh, i-it's the personal prayer room.

651
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,470
 Go straight down the hallway! 

652
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,200
 Supreme Leader. 

653
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,970
Yes, come in.

654
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,680
I think someone was messing around.

655
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,610
We're chasing a suspicious person right now.

656
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:17,190
We'll take care of it quietly.

657
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:20,200
Make sure not to lose him and wrap it up without fail.

658
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,540
Yes.

659
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:26,040
Oh, and also, take Believer Mi Na and leave.

660
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:39,340
- Continue—
 - I've got something to tell you, Supreme Leader.

661
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,770
This place is off-limits.

662
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:42,770
It's okay!

663
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,600
What is it now?

664
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,000
I think you should escape right now.

665
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,780
Why?

666
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,620
I think the Prosecution will rush in soon.

667
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:58,670
- Why would they? 
 - I've got a friend inside the Prosecution.

668
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:02,710
I think they'll attack the House of Truth when no one is suspecting it.

669
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:05,510
Wait a minute.

670
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,650
Yes, District Attorney.

671
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:13,830
No, I just heard you're coming over this way.

672
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,120
Yes, I'll greet you at a nice place soon.

673
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:24,680
He said they're not.

674
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,240
There's no way.

675
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,740
Leave.

676
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,380
I'm sorry, Supreme Leader.

677
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,400
You're going to spend tonight with me.

678
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,440
By the way, there are so many odd things happening lately.

679
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:03,200
Things I can't understand keep happening.

680
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,890
On the same day, the messengers and I fell asleep

681
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:09,140
at the same time while we were having fun together.

682
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,760
The blood test didn't detect any substances.

683
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,200
And there's no suspicious record in the CCTV.

684
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:18,470
As if someone had manipulated them perfectly!

685
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,060
Who are you?

686
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:25,680
Why do you keep doing this to me?

687
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,200
Wh-What about Mi Na?

688
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,680
The brothers took her out.

689
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,510
 J-Jin Woong, it's the night-duty room. 

690
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:55,480
Listen carefully. Mi Na was moved to the night-duty room!

691
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,310
I got it.

692
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:06,390


693
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:08,730
It's me.

694
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:11,690
Wait, Supreme Leader.

695
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:14,420
Yes, speak the truth.

696
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:16,760
There's a really good investment opportunity.

697
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,760
Investment?

698
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:22,380
The enormous amount of offerings you collect from your believers.

699
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,320
It's a failproof investment.

700
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,140
You won't ever regret it.

701
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:32,710
Rather... you'll be satisfied beyond what you would expect.

702
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,200
Continue.

703
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:55,850
Invest in crypto.

704
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:02,380
- Crypto?
 - It's perfect for money laundering

705
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:05,480
and you can store it safely, too.

706
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,110
You think I don't know about that stuff?

707
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:09,900
Knowing it and knowing it well are two different things—

708
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,010
No, they're not different.

709
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:16,840
Because I'm fully aware that everything your mouth is uttering is nonsense!

710
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,230
Why?

711
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:21,880
Because I'm really good at reading people's minds.

712
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:27,280
You pulled the strings to save that Japanese believer from earlier, right?

713
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,930
- Why would I?
 - Who knows?

714
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:33,550
Well, you can be a spy for the Prosecution

715
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,820
or you can be a scammer who's after my money!

716
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:39,740
I guess you watch too many movies.

717
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:41,940
No, I don't have the time for movies.

718
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,610
It's all from experience.

719
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:47,970
With my hands, those traitors, scammers, spies, and all!

720
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:50,390
My precious experience!

721
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,670
I'm telling you in advance.

722
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,640
Tonight will be...

723
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,270
a lot more fun than you expected.

724
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,540
♫  We're going down, down, down to the dirty place  ♫

725
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:22,900
♫  Go round, round, one more time  ♫

726
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:28,960
♫  Don't, don't cry, it can't be helped, one more time  ♫

727
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,440
♫  Good cash gone bad, good cash gone, good cash gone  ♫

728
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,320
♫  We're coming back, good cash gone, we're coming back  ♫

729
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,000
♫  Try getting burned up slowly, bye  ♫

730
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,200
   

731
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,630
 We're almost there. 

732
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:53,080
 We need to get to the holy ground to get Leader Im. 

733
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,960
 There's an online service streamed nationally. 

734
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,500
 What are you doing, idiot? Turn it off right now! 

735
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,040
 Operation Rabbit Hunt. 

736
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,700
 Prosecutor Kwak arrived. 

737
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:05,720
 There's a reason Leader Im's holy ground has been hidden thoroughly so far. 

738
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,210
 Ha Ri, there's something you need to see. 

739
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:10,730
 Gosh, this is nuts. 

740
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:14,470
 Guys, I think you should come quickly. 

741
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:16,600
 We'll have to find him for sure. 

742
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:22,610
♫  Don't, don't cry, it can't be helped, one more time  ♫

743
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:24,800
♫  Good cash gone bad  ♫
