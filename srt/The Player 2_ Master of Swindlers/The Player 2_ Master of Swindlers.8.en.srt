Cold reading?

120

what kind of a person is Director Bae?

180
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:13,633
He's a great man who started

181
00:13:13,657 --> 00:13:15,953
as a brother and worked to be ordained as a messenger.

182
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:19,083
By the way, where do you live?

183
00:13:19,107 --> 00:13:20,673
Could you tell me your MBTI?

184
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:22,083
I'm ENTJ.

185
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:24,363
- What's your blood type?
- Boyfriend?

186
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,783
What's your ideal type?

187
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:27,253
It's Haneulnim.

188
00:13:27,277 --> 00:13:28,743
Oh, truth!

189
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:31,013
Thank you. Thank you so much!

190
00:13:31,037 --> 00:13:34,043
I think I can live properly now, thanks to you, Chairman.

191
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:38,827
I'll really become a new person and do my best to live happily with my baby.

192
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:42,863
After you leave, walk the Path of Repentance alone.

193
00:13:42,887 --> 00:13:45,833
When you finish walking the Path of Repentance, all your sins will be gone

194
00:13:45,857 --> 00:13:48,983
and you'll be able to live a new life of glory.

195
00:13:49,007 --> 00:13:51,427
Yes! Truth.

196
00:13:56,327 --> 00:13:59,063
You must walk all by yourself

197
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:00,963
with a repenting heart.

198
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:03,357
You must walk alone.

199
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:08,207
Thank you.

200
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:19,397
Director Bae.

201
00:14:20,377 --> 00:14:22,447
Dear Director Bae!

202
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:27,973
I think your power of faith has weakened a lot these days.

203
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:29,653
When Han Seong Seok went to the Prosecution,

204
00:14:29,677 --> 00:14:32,717
what was my Dear Director Bae doing loafing around?

205
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:36,043
I've committed a grave sin, Chairman.

206
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:38,833
I'm not that generous of a person.

207
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:42,393
You'll have to give your life if there's another mistake.

208
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:43,893
Thank you, Chairman!

209
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,583
How did Han Seong Seok's HELICOPTER go?
[HELICOPTER: HEart, Liver, COrnea, PAncreas, TEndon, Retina.]

210
00:14:46,607 --> 00:14:49,153
They said it's worth at least 300 million won.
(A slang for organ trafficking)

211
00:14:49,177 --> 00:14:50,213
And the fetus capsule?

212
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:52,763
It's in preparation with double the capital.

213
00:14:52,787 --> 00:14:54,883
Prepare tightly for tomorrow's community service

214
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:57,013
at Nokyang Nursing Home as well.

215
00:14:57,037 --> 00:14:59,287
Yes, I understand, Chairman.

216
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,897
Are you going to stay here doing this?

217
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:12,963
I'll send a car to the Path of Repentance right now.

218
00:15:12,987 --> 00:15:14,457
Go.

219
00:15:33,107 --> 00:15:37,373
Haneulnim's love and forgiveness give us strength and courage,

220
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:40,823
helping us overcome the challenges in life.

221
00:15:40,847 --> 00:15:45,207
Haneulnim's love and forgiveness gives us strength-

222
00:16:14,127 --> 00:16:15,913
Over here. Nokyang Nursing Home.

223
00:16:15,937 --> 00:16:18,723
Almighty House of Truth will go volunteer there tomorrow.

224
00:16:18,747 --> 00:16:21,003
The purpose is recruiting new believers, not community service.

225
00:16:21,027 --> 00:16:23,963
Aigoo, ma'am, have you been doing well?

226
00:16:23,987 --> 00:16:26,883
- How are you feeling?
- <i>This place isn't that high-end,</i>

227
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:29,093
but it's one of the more luxurious nursing homes.

228
00:16:29,117 --> 00:16:31,053
<i>After it was built recently,</i>

229
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:33,963
a lot of rich old people with cash entered the place.

230
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:38,223
House of Truth has taken your children's place now.

231
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,333
<i>We make sure you eat every day and</i>

232
00:16:40,357 --> 00:16:42,473
<i>make sure everything's fine with you.</i>

233
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:44,623
<i>We're actually better than your children.</i>

234
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:46,883
<i>And, most of all, Dear Elders,</i>

235
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:49,733
you've got to meet Haneulnim and go to heaven, right?

236
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:50,743
- You're right.
- We get it.

237
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:52,283
Your ticket to heaven.

238
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:54,783
Your ticket to heaven and eternal life.

239
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:59,707
You can get it guaranteed for sure!

240
00:17:01,597 --> 00:17:03,887
- Truth! Truth!
- Truth.

241
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,257
[New Believer Registration Card]

242
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:19,857
Aigoo!

243
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:23,663
- Aigoo.
- Aigoo, you're here.

244
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:25,457
Nice to meet you.

245
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:34,933
There are people who were chosen by Haneulnim in every age.

246
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:39,717
Now, who's the person who received Haneulnim's calling in this age?

247
00:17:40,497 --> 00:17:44,703
It's our chairman, Supreme Leader Lim Sang Sik.

248
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:46,363
<i>Truth.</i>

249
00:17:46,387 --> 00:17:47,883
You're right.

250
00:17:47,907 --> 00:17:50,933
We can say the Chairman's words and the doctrine we know

251
00:17:50,957 --> 00:17:54,613
have equal levels of authority.

252
00:17:54,637 --> 00:17:55,807
Yes.

253
00:17:56,537 --> 00:17:58,563
We must listen more closely to

254
00:17:58,587 --> 00:18:02,443
Chairman's teachings than the doctrines from the past.

255
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:04,633
- Truth.
- Truth.

256
00:18:04,657 --> 00:18:07,337
She's an outstanding believer.

257
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,563
- Oh, Supreme Leader!
- Supreme Leader!

258
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:14,693
- Truth!
- Eternal truth!

259
00:18:14,717 --> 00:18:17,203
- Truth, truth!
- Eternal truth!

260
00:18:17,227 --> 00:18:20,327
- Truth!
- Eternal truth!

261
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,523
Congratulations on joining us.

262
00:18:30,547 --> 00:18:35,953
Haneulnim will always be with you.

263
00:18:35,977 --> 00:18:39,287
Thank you, Chairman.

264
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:47,083
All right. I hope you all have a great time, and I'll see you at the orientation.

265
00:18:47,107 --> 00:18:49,867
<i>Truth.</i>

266
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:54,223
- Truth.
- Eternal truth.

267
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:56,803
- Eternal truth.
- Eternal truth.

268
00:18:56,827 --> 00:19:00,237
- Eternal truth.
- Eternal truth.

269
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:11,247
Truth. Truth-

270
00:19:19,977 --> 00:19:21,567
Truth.

271
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,493
That's my Director Bae.

272
00:19:30,517 --> 00:19:32,943
Our new believers here are very wealthy,

273
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:35,503
but they don't have much time left until they go to the heavens.

274
00:19:35,527 --> 00:19:38,543
They'll be of great help to us, Almighty House of Truth.

275
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:40,513
You all saw what Director Bae did, right?

276
00:19:40,537 --> 00:19:42,793
I trust you have learned a lot.

277
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:44,677
You can all go now.

278
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,377
What? Got something to say?

279
00:19:55,477 --> 00:19:57,957
I want to show you something.

280
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:06,833
She's Lee Seon Ja, and she's 80 years old.

281
00:20:06,857 --> 00:20:08,423
[Lee Seon Ja]
She has more than 50 billion won in assets.

282
00:20:08,447 --> 00:20:10,653
She's pretty gullible.

283
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:14,437
She burned a few hundred billion won on shamanistic rituals before moving to the nursing home.

284
00:20:14,937 --> 00:20:16,723
Shaman?

285
00:20:16,747 --> 00:20:18,853
Are you comparing us to those vulgar-

286
00:20:18,877 --> 00:20:20,807
Whoa, whoa.

287
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:23,763
Keep going.

288
00:20:23,787 --> 00:20:27,073
I'm saying she easily falls for superstition and religion.

289
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:31,143
And this man, Hwang Jang Hyeok, currently manages her wealth.

290
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:33,083
I guess you can call him her personal secretary.

291
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:36,693
I nudged him lightly, and he was very cooperative.

292
00:20:36,717 --> 00:20:40,437
Oh, I'm sure you know since you saw, Director Bae.

293
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,373
Dear Believer.

294
00:20:49,397 --> 00:20:53,267
I see your potential to become the House of Truth's messenger.

295
00:20:54,227 --> 00:20:55,393
Truth.

296
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:59,543
How beautiful is it to see his passion and enthusiasm?

297
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:02,263
It's always quality over quantity for everything.

298
00:21:02,287 --> 00:21:05,543
Many little is still little in the end, isn't it?

299
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:07,043
You're right.

300
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:11,463
Let's forget about the other old folks and focus on Lee Seon Ja.

301
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:15,673
Oh, and you're coming back tonight, right?

302
00:21:15,697 --> 00:21:18,103
I'd like to invite you to a gathering where

303
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:20,587
I only invite my special people.

304
00:21:21,587 --> 00:21:23,917
As a messenger, you see.

305
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:28,827
Thank you, Chairman.

306
00:21:55,627 --> 00:21:57,357
I'm sorry.

307
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:01,017
It got all wet.

308
00:22:02,817 --> 00:22:05,107
D-Daijoubu*.
("It's okay" in Japanese.)

309
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:08,097
Daijoubu.

310
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,593
Excuse me, Mi Na.

311
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:17,063
Yes?

312
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:19,743
When did you come to Korea?

313
00:22:19,767 --> 00:22:24,923
I used to be at the Japanese district of Almighty House of Truth.

314
00:22:24,947 --> 00:22:29,247
I came here after my mother passed away a few years ago.

315
00:22:31,757 --> 00:22:33,357
I see.

316
00:22:34,457 --> 00:22:35,813
I'm sorry.

317
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:37,833
It's okay!

318
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:41,527
Because my mother was a heavenly bride.

319
00:22:42,637 --> 00:22:44,253
Wait...

320
00:22:44,277 --> 00:22:48,273
t-that means Leader Lim is your father-

321
00:22:48,297 --> 00:22:53,123
The Chairman is different from ordinary people like us.

322
00:22:53,147 --> 00:22:58,547
My mother was chosen as a bride for Haneulnim.

323
00:23:00,177 --> 00:23:02,693
- Heavenly bride, huh?
- Yes.

324
00:23:02,717 --> 00:23:07,013
Gosh, it's really different when a man does it.

325
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:09,703
Your calves are as big as Lee Man Gi's*.
(A former traditional Korean wrestler champion)

326
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:12,263
Please help out over there later.

327
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:14,153
Huh? Supreme Leader Lim!

328
00:23:14,177 --> 00:23:16,393
- Hello!
- Hello!

329
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:18,237
Hello!

330
00:24:06,997 --> 00:24:11,153
This is the messenger candidate, Kim Han Joon, I told you about.

331
00:24:11,177 --> 00:24:15,113
He's an important man who'll boost the betterment of the House of Truth.

332
00:24:15,137 --> 00:24:19,703
This is a gathering for our messengers who work day and night for the House of Truth.

333
00:24:19,727 --> 00:24:23,073
We meet once a month like this to have a time of recovery.

334
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:25,227
Take a seat and enjoy your time here.

335
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,347
All right.

336
00:25:00,137 --> 00:25:04,373
You shall now know I'm him.

337
00:25:04,397 --> 00:25:06,813
There's no other god besides me.

338
00:25:06,837 --> 00:25:10,233
I'm your Haneulnim.

339
00:25:10,257 --> 00:25:12,203
<i>Truth!</i>

340
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:15,223
I'll make you strong and resilient.

341
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,033
I'll truly help you out.

342
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:20,273
I'll hold you with my rightful hand.

343
00:25:20,297 --> 00:25:23,323
<i>Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened.</i>

344
00:25:23,347 --> 00:25:26,763
<i>And I'll give you rest.</i>

345
00:25:26,787 --> 00:25:29,553
Heavenly brides of the House of Truth, chosen by the heavens,

346
00:25:29,577 --> 00:25:34,383
shall celebrate with all their strength for becoming servants of the heavens.

347
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:37,383
You'll go and eat your plants with joy

348
00:25:37,407 --> 00:25:41,453
and drink your wines with a merry heart.

349
00:25:41,477 --> 00:25:43,967
Have a good time, everyone.

350
00:25:50,557 --> 00:25:54,157
Ha Ri will be okay, right?

351
00:25:58,937 --> 00:26:01,353
It can't be helped.

352
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:04,043
To avoid suspicion,

353
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:08,497
he can't help but show them he's just as trashy as they are.

354
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:30,947
Messenger candidate Kim Han Joon!

355
00:26:31,737 --> 00:26:34,233
- Yes, Chairman!
- What a tiresome guy.

356
00:26:34,257 --> 00:26:38,097
You didn't even learn how to have fun at that age?

357
00:26:38,957 --> 00:26:40,313
Don't be like this.

358
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:45,033
There's a ritual we can't skip at our time of recovery!

359
00:26:45,057 --> 00:26:49,043
New messengers and messenger candidate Kim Han Joon,

360
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:52,347
come out to the front altogether!

361
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:08,753
All right! Do what we always do.

362
00:27:08,777 --> 00:27:15,107
Let your imaginations unfold and show us what we all want to see!

363
00:27:32,427 --> 00:27:34,877
<i>What a f***ing scum.</i>

364
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:39,573
That trashy bastard.

365
00:27:39,597 --> 00:27:43,843
I'll grind him up in a blender into a pulp.

366
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:45,613
That f***ing-

367
00:27:45,637 --> 00:27:49,017
Hey, is there anything worse I can say?

368
00:27:50,757 --> 00:27:52,867
Hey, Mr. Kim!

369
00:27:56,517 --> 00:27:59,703
Gosh, what an annoying guy. What are you doing right now?

370
00:27:59,727 --> 00:28:01,863
If you can't even do this,

371
00:28:01,887 --> 00:28:04,747
I don't think we'll be able to work together.

372
00:28:08,957 --> 00:28:10,623
I'll give it a try.

373
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,053
Really?

374
00:28:12,077 --> 00:28:14,147
Clap again now!

375
00:29:40,637 --> 00:29:42,417
It's me.

376
00:29:48,447 --> 00:29:51,303
Everyone's really asleep, huh?

377
00:29:51,327 --> 00:29:54,203
Gosh, that was a close call.

378
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:56,067
Good job.

379
00:29:58,977 --> 00:30:02,823
The moment you drink this, you'll start to feel drowsy very slowly.

380
00:30:02,847 --> 00:30:06,333
It'll be a very nice and deep sleep.

381
00:30:06,357 --> 00:30:08,913
This is the antidote. Take it in advance.

382
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:12,817
You can drink all you want, but you won't fall asleep.

383
00:30:33,847 --> 00:30:36,387
Gosh, that f***ing scum.

384
00:30:37,457 --> 00:30:40,693
Is Director Bae our next step?

385
00:30:40,717 --> 00:30:44,897
Yes, it's the beginning of the bloody battle for the crown.

386
00:30:49,507 --> 00:30:52,613
Get some sleep so you won't be suspected.

387
00:30:52,637 --> 00:30:55,867
I'm sensitive, so I can't sleep well if I don't have my bed.

388
00:30:56,787 --> 00:30:59,377
Wait, at least sing me a lullaby-

389
00:31:11,647 --> 00:31:15,963
Aigoo, your muscles are such a waste.

390
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:17,323
Gosh, be gentle!

391
00:31:17,347 --> 00:31:19,973
You only did some laundry, and look at you.

392
00:31:19,997 --> 00:31:21,453
Some laundry?

393
00:31:21,477 --> 00:31:23,743
- Some laundry?
- Aigoo!

394
00:31:23,767 --> 00:31:25,733
Don't take light of chores and labor.

395
00:31:25,757 --> 00:31:27,603
They're very sacred jobs.

396
00:31:27,627 --> 00:31:29,873
You went overboard to impress her, huh?

397
00:31:29,897 --> 00:31:31,643
Right?

398
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:34,833
You weren't sent in there to flirt.

399
00:31:34,857 --> 00:31:38,757
You went in to cut the throat of Leader Lim, whom she worships as a god!

400
00:31:38,787 --> 00:31:41,257
- I said it's not!
- My gosh.

401
00:31:42,327 --> 00:31:44,263
- He smiled, right?
- Forget it and put one on your mouth.

402
00:31:44,287 --> 00:31:46,073
- Gosh, stop!
- Your mouth is your problem.

403
00:31:46,097 --> 00:31:47,633
Stop it! It's making me drool.

404
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:49,273
- You like her that much?
- I said to stop!

405
00:31:49,297 --> 00:31:50,953
Just live with her.

406
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:52,363
Get dressed. Can't stand the sight.

407
00:31:52,387 --> 00:31:55,197
Do it properly. I need to do the laundry tomorrow.

408
00:32:16,057 --> 00:32:17,633
What's the test result?

409
00:32:17,657 --> 00:32:21,687
No special substance was found, even from the messengers.

410
00:32:22,777 --> 00:32:24,723
It's the same for Kim Han Joon, right?

411
00:32:24,747 --> 00:32:26,367
Yes, that's right.

412
00:32:27,077 --> 00:32:29,077
How odd.

413
00:32:29,777 --> 00:32:32,037
All right. Good work.

414
00:32:35,397 --> 00:32:40,593
Excuse me, Chairman. I think yesterday's situation is a bit...

415
00:32:40,617 --> 00:32:44,073
- Huh?
- The fact everyone fell asleep due to fatigue,

416
00:32:44,097 --> 00:32:46,487
all about at the same time, too.

417
00:32:50,617 --> 00:32:52,613
It's never happened before.

418
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,783
Until Kim Han Joon joined us.

419
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,807
It's not Kim Han Joon. It's Messenger Kim Han Joon!

420
00:32:59,097 --> 00:33:02,847
Haneulnim is watching everything.

421
00:33:10,527 --> 00:33:13,667
Stop making a fuss and get your job done quietly.

422
00:33:14,377 --> 00:33:16,533
I apologize, Chairman.

423
00:33:16,557 --> 00:33:18,373
Where there's envy and fights,

424
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:22,407
there's only noise and all evil things.

425
00:33:26,107 --> 00:33:28,597
Hey, welcome.

426
00:33:36,187 --> 00:33:39,913
Thanks to you, my soul was well-fed last night. Thank you.

427
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:42,033
Gosh, don't mention it.

428
00:33:42,057 --> 00:33:44,983
You're one of my men now, so we need to walk together now.

429
00:33:45,007 --> 00:33:50,023
But I think I'll have to teach you how to have fun personally.

430
00:33:50,047 --> 00:33:52,353
I'll learn anything properly.

431
00:33:52,377 --> 00:33:55,633
And I had such a great sleep.

432
00:33:55,657 --> 00:33:59,143
I don't think I've felt this refreshed in a long time.

433
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:00,607
That's good.

434
00:34:01,287 --> 00:34:04,843
Also, there's a new believer orientation today.

435
00:34:04,867 --> 00:34:08,213
I'd like to see if you're as good at sermons as you're with missions.

436
00:34:08,237 --> 00:34:09,833
Please leave anything to me.

437
00:34:09,857 --> 00:34:12,873
I'll prepare well so the new believers will be willing to

438
00:34:12,897 --> 00:34:15,423
even offer their souls to you, Chairman.

439
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:16,907
Souls...

440
00:34:18,287 --> 00:34:22,607
Everything is possible for him, who believes.

441
00:34:24,507 --> 00:34:26,473

[Kim Han Joon]

444
00:34:37,817 --> 00:34:41,337
Hey, Director Jeong. Do you have time for a call?

445
00:34:42,077 --> 00:34:46,803
Have you heard of Brinceton Theological Seminary graduate named Kim Han Joon?

446
00:34:46,827 --> 00:34:51,213
I've been taking care of the graduates of Brinceton.

447
00:34:51,237 --> 00:34:53,113
But I've never heard of that name.

448
00:34:53,137 --> 00:34:54,653
<i>Are you sure he's a Brinceton grad?</i>

449
00:34:54,677 --> 00:34:57,693
I contacted you because I don't think he is.

450
00:34:57,717 --> 00:35:00,593
There's always those scamming f***ers.

451
00:35:00,617 --> 00:35:03,037
Yes. Thank you.

[Pastoral Ministry Plan]

453
00:35:09,097 --> 00:35:10,717
You bastard.

454
00:35:11,497 --> 00:35:13,327
I knew it.

455
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:20,243
[Almighty House of Truth]
Responsibility is truly a heavy and painful thing.

456
00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:22,793
They say there's no job as hard as parenting

457
00:35:22,817 --> 00:35:27,533
because you need to shoulder the responsibility of a child's life.

458
00:35:27,557 --> 00:35:33,723
The heavy pain Haneulnim suffered 2,000 years ago began

459
00:35:33,747 --> 00:35:38,223
with the responsibility he has to forgive the sins of all believers in this land.

460
00:35:38,247 --> 00:35:42,743
It began with the responsibility of having to redeem all believers!

461
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:45,423
<i>Truth!</i>

462
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:49,973
And it's such an enormous responsibility and pain

463
00:35:49,997 --> 00:35:55,023
that our chairman is shouldering alone!

464
00:35:55,047 --> 00:35:58,823
Just think about what those lowly beings out there

465
00:35:58,847 --> 00:36:00,833
are saying without knowing anything.

466
00:36:00,857 --> 00:36:04,033
- Truth.
- Our chairman is...

467
00:36:04,057 --> 00:36:07,033
enduring a pain greater than

468
00:36:07,057 --> 00:36:10,813
the pain from 2,000 years ago right now.

469
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:15,113

And our Mr. Kim will become Leader Lim's successor to fly away even higher.

Aigoo, thank you for the sermon.

<i>I was touched.</i>

486
00:37:06,547 --> 00:37:10,277
Chairman, there's something I must tell you.

487
00:37:11,517 --> 00:37:13,803
You see, Messenger Kim Han Joon wasn't

488
00:37:13,827 --> 00:37:17,577
actually a graduate of Brinceton Theological Seminary.

489
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:21,367
So?

490
00:37:22,037 --> 00:37:23,037
Sorry?

491
00:37:23,677 --> 00:37:25,313
Is it a problem he lied to me, or

492
00:37:25,337 --> 00:37:27,877
that he's not a graduate of a prestigious university?

493
00:37:28,887 --> 00:37:30,737
No, the thing is-

494
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:36,357
Do you still not understand what I want from you lot?

495
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,727
I'll keep it in mind, Chairman.

496
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,533
Keep a close watch on Lee Seon Ja.

497
00:37:43,557 --> 00:37:46,317
Also, give me the report on how you'll work on her.

00:38:09,427 --> 00:38:11,487
Gosh, it's so hot!

500
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:14,487
Great job.

501
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:17,517
I really thought I was going to die.

502
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:20,127
Yes, Mi Na.

503
00:38:21,297 --> 00:38:23,767
I came outside briefly for some business.

504
00:38:24,517 --> 00:38:25,823
No, no.

00:38:39,577 --> 00:38:40,933
He came right in time.

510
00:38:40,957 --> 00:38:42,427
Oppa, let's go.

511
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:49,037
Welcome aboard, Grandmother.

512
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:03,323
I knew you had what it takes.

513
00:39:03,347 --> 00:39:07,113
But the problem is whether you know not to cross the line or not.

514
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:09,973
Well, I'm not too sure about crossing the line.

515
00:39:09,997 --> 00:39:11,783
But I'm not dumb enough to forget

516
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:16,063
you're Haneulnim and the god in the House of Truth.

517
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:20,063
Oh, regarding Lee Seon Ja, the grandmother you brought.

518
00:39:20,087 --> 00:39:22,513
I also did some research.

519
00:39:22,537 --> 00:39:25,033
But she's not an easy old folk you can mess with.

520
00:39:25,057 --> 00:39:27,193
Will it be okay?

521
00:39:27,217 --> 00:39:29,913
I'll have to make sure she can't find anything after the job, even if she sues.

522
00:39:29,937 --> 00:39:32,843
And make sure not to leave any traces of House of Truth or you.

523
00:39:32,867 --> 00:39:34,163
That's right.

524
00:39:34,187 --> 00:39:37,717
I'll tell you the specific details later-

525
00:39:41,607 --> 00:39:43,137
Go now.

526
00:39:50,357 --> 00:39:52,453
- Hello.
- Hello.

527
00:39:52,477 --> 00:39:55,803

528
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:57,187
Sure.

00:39:58,577 --> 00:40:03,137
If you look inside, we made a section for our believers...

530
00:40:24,807 --> 00:40:28,293
He's shooting a romance film by himself.

531
00:40:28,317 --> 00:40:31,503
Can you really say it's a romance with the face he has?

532
00:40:31,527 --> 00:40:34,153
It's either a thriller or a horror.

533
00:40:34,177 --> 00:40:36,033
I've got a plan today.

534
00:40:36,057 --> 00:40:39,467
So, please don't look for me, no matter what.

535
00:40:44,287 --> 00:40:45,803
Why is he so excited?

536
00:40:45,827 --> 00:40:47,943
- He's got a date today.
- A date?

537
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:50,193
Man, who knew this could happen, right?

538
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:54,007
I lived to see a punk like him going out on a date.

539
00:40:55,767 --> 00:41:01,117
But why do you keep drawing the line, saying you're different from him?

540
00:41:01,897 --> 00:41:05,233
Jin Woong and I are the same?

541
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:07,013
Your confidence is good.

542
00:41:07,037 --> 00:41:09,083
But if you lived this long,

543
00:41:09,107 --> 00:41:12,557
I think you should know yourself, at least.

544
00:41:13,727 --> 00:41:15,293
Are you flating me right now?
[Supreme Leader Lim]

545
00:41:15,317 --> 00:41:16,683
It's "flirting," you idiot.

546
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,557
Hey, hold on.

547
00:41:19,387 --> 00:41:20,987
It's Leader Lim.

548
00:41:23,177 --> 00:41:25,903
- Yes, Chairman.
- <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

549
00:41:25,927 --> 00:41:28,397
<i>I need you to come right now.</i>

550
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:32,693
- Right now?
- <i>Yes, and when you come,</i>

551
00:41:32,717 --> 00:41:35,647
<i>bring Lee Seon Ja with you as well.</i>

552
00:41:37,347 --> 00:41:40,003
Is something going on right now?

553
00:41:40,027 --> 00:41:41,863
<i>Let's talk after you get here.</i>

554
00:41:41,887 --> 00:41:43,643
Oh, yes.

555
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,033
But it'll take me some time. Will that be okay?

556
00:41:46,057 --> 00:41:48,203
<i>You'll have to hurry up, though.</i>

557
00:41:48,227 --> 00:41:49,767
I see-

558
00:42:09,887 --> 00:42:13,837
Chairman, what's the matter at this late hour?

559
00:42:14,807 --> 00:42:16,693
I had forgotten it briefly.

560
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:21,733
When you receive a great gift, you must first suspect it.

561
00:42:21,757 --> 00:42:23,577
Suspect?

562
00:42:24,307 --> 00:42:26,407
Are you talking about me?

563
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:31,693
Director Bae said he witnessed a very interesting scene.

564
00:42:31,717 --> 00:42:37,127
W-Wait, what are you doing right now? Huh?

565
00:42:38,067 --> 00:42:40,513
Director Bae, reading the air is my specialty,

566
00:42:40,537 --> 00:42:43,283
but I have no idea right now.

567
00:42:43,307 --> 00:42:44,833
Huh?

568
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:46,787
I saw it all.

569
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:56,907
This grandmother right here is actually an actor you hired.

570
00:42:57,907 --> 00:43:00,523
You planned to deceive the Chairman and us with this fake grandmother,

571
00:43:00,547 --> 00:43:03,733
so you can stab us in the back.

572
00:43:03,757 --> 00:43:05,487
A fake grandmother?

573
00:43:06,287 --> 00:43:10,803
Chairman, you even personally researched Lee Seon Ja, didn't you?

574
00:43:10,827 --> 00:43:15,273
It's not at all difficult to create such fake data,

575
00:43:15,297 --> 00:43:21,163
compared to creating a fake grandmother with a disguise as elaborate as this.

576
00:43:21,187 --> 00:43:23,123
A disguise?

577
00:43:23,147 --> 00:43:25,127
Are you kidding me right now?

578
00:43:25,837 --> 00:43:28,503
Director Bae said he saw it clearly with his own eyes.

579
00:43:28,527 --> 00:43:32,653
How that grandmother got rid of her disguise and turned into a young woman.

580
00:43:32,677 --> 00:43:36,033
Wait, are you going to keep listening to this nonsense?

581
00:43:36,057 --> 00:43:38,053
Let's take the Madam and get out right now!

582
00:43:38,077 --> 00:43:39,787
All right!

583
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:45,987
Let me show you the truth now.

584
00:44:09,617 --> 00:44:11,727
It's flawless.

585
00:44:19,267 --> 00:44:22,893
Wait, why is this so...

586
00:44:22,917 --> 00:44:24,917
What are you doing right now?

587
00:44:25,777 --> 00:44:28,257
What kind of rude behavior is this?

588
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:30,907
I'm sorry.

589
00:44:32,377 --> 00:44:35,883
Chairman, I clearly saw it.

590
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:37,853
This grandmother got rid of her disguise

591
00:44:37,877 --> 00:44:41,077
and she's supposed to turn into a young woman-

592
00:44:48,167 --> 00:44:52,023
Envy is a really frightening emotion.

593
00:44:52,047 --> 00:44:54,263
It turned Director Bae into such a mental patient

594
00:44:54,287 --> 00:44:57,823
and it even turned me into a fool like this.

595
00:44:57,847 --> 00:44:59,437
Guys.

596
00:45:02,147 --> 00:45:04,213
Gather the wheat into the barn,

597
00:45:04,237 --> 00:45:06,873
but the chaff he'll burn with unquenchable fire!

598
00:45:06,897 --> 00:45:10,973
C-Chairman, believe me. I clearly saw it!

599
00:45:10,997 --> 00:45:12,323
Chairman!

600
00:45:12,347 --> 00:45:14,317
[Almighty House of Truth]
[Leader Lim Sang Sik]

601
00:45:23,497 --> 00:45:25,247
Ha Ri.

602
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,913
This is Mrs. Lee Seon Ja.

603
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,523
Her husband was fooled by Leader Lim

604
00:45:34,547 --> 00:45:36,873
and lost his entire life savings.

605
00:45:36,897 --> 00:45:39,667
She said she wanted to help us.

606
00:45:42,687 --> 00:45:46,597
I came because I was told there was something I could do.

607
00:45:49,527 --> 00:45:52,537
Thank you. You came to the right place.

608
00:45:53,237 --> 00:45:57,667
I'm Cha Jae Yi, and I'll be playing your role from now on.

609
00:45:58,807 --> 00:46:00,947
Nice to meet you, Jae Yi.

610
00:46:03,977 --> 00:46:06,153
No, I saw it!

611
00:46:06,177 --> 00:46:09,157
- You can't let that man fool you!
- That f***ing moron.

612
00:46:11,067 --> 00:46:13,917
What a bunch of rude people.

613
00:46:15,677 --> 00:46:17,577
Madam, let us leave.

614
00:46:22,607 --> 00:46:26,193
I've really made a fool out of myself.

615
00:46:26,217 --> 00:46:29,393
Director Bae has always been so smart.

616
00:46:29,417 --> 00:46:32,957
If you think you're standing firm, be careful that you don't fall.

617
00:46:34,407 --> 00:46:37,413
Perhaps his position was too much for him to handle.

618
00:46:37,437 --> 00:46:40,807
Because your shadow is just as deep and wide, Chairman.

619
00:46:42,017 --> 00:46:44,143
Since Director Bae isn't here anymore,

620
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:47,663
you'll be playing an important role from now on, Messenger Kim.

621
00:46:47,687 --> 00:46:49,463
I'm ready.

622
00:46:49,487 --> 00:46:51,777
That's why I came back to Korea.

623
00:46:55,377 --> 00:46:57,227
Messenger Kim.

624
00:46:58,707 --> 00:47:02,337
There's a place we call the holy ground.

625
00:47:06,567 --> 00:47:08,567
Holy ground?

626
00:47:11,017 --> 00:47:13,653
There's only a few who know of its existence

627
00:47:13,677 --> 00:47:16,743
and far fewer people know of its location.

628
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,897
And you can say that place

629
00:47:20,247 --> 00:47:22,647
is where my everything resides.

630
00:47:24,747 --> 00:47:27,147
Everything, you say?

631
00:47:28,267 --> 00:47:31,373
Yes, my everything.

632
00:47:31,397 --> 00:47:33,613
After we're done with Lee Seon Ja,

633
00:47:33,637 --> 00:47:35,683
let's convert it all to gold.

634
00:47:35,707 --> 00:47:37,517
And that's when I'll...

635
00:47:39,597 --> 00:47:43,547
show you my holy ground.

636
00:47:44,967 --> 00:47:47,077
I'm honored, Chairman.

637
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:54,977
I've got something to do right now. So, I'll get going.

638
00:47:55,867 --> 00:47:57,537
Truth.

639
00:48:05,227 --> 00:48:06,807
Get it ready.

640
00:48:13,537 --> 00:48:15,813
B-Boss, please make it beautiful.

641
00:48:15,837 --> 00:48:18,717
It's for a really beautiful person.

642
00:48:20,057 --> 00:48:21,533
Mi Na chan*.
(Japanese expression of endearment.)

643
00:48:21,557 --> 00:48:23,767
Anata no tame ni*...
("For your sake," in Japanese.)

644
00:48:33,517 --> 00:48:35,213
[Mi Na]
<i>I'm sorry, Jin Woong.</i>

645
00:48:35,237 --> 00:48:39,757
<i>I was leaving, but the Chairman suddenly wanted to see me.</i>

646
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:46,313
Hey, Mi Na. This thing called the heavenly bride.

647
00:48:46,337 --> 00:48:49,047
Don't you think it's a bit weird? It's like sinning-

648
00:48:49,737 --> 00:48:52,263
If the Chairman says it's not a sin,

649
00:48:52,287 --> 00:48:55,307
then it's not a sin without question.

650
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:05,237
Hey, Byeong Min, it's me. Can you take a look at the CCTV right now?

651
00:49:15,897 --> 00:49:17,767
How did it go?

652
00:49:21,097 --> 00:49:22,423
If they go that way...

653
00:49:22,447 --> 00:49:24,253
They're headed to Leader Lim's personal prayer room.

654
00:49:24,277 --> 00:49:26,203
<i>Have you ever been there?</i>

655
00:49:26,227 --> 00:49:28,673
That room is off-limits for regular believers.

656
00:49:28,697 --> 00:49:29,953
<i>It's the same for messengers.</i>

657
00:49:29,977 --> 00:49:33,103
<i>It's Leader Lim's private space, so he's the only one allowed to enter.</i>

658
00:49:33,127 --> 00:49:37,643
What? So, no one would know what happens in there.

659
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:40,497
So, to his own daughter-Gosh!

660
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:44,253
There's no way he would.

661
00:49:44,277 --> 00:49:46,627
Come on! That can't be.

662
00:49:47,707 --> 00:49:49,167
That's not it.

663
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:05,207
What's the matter?

664
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,757
I mean...

665
00:50:09,307 --> 00:50:12,687
Haneulnim whispered to me today.

666
00:50:14,767 --> 00:50:20,497
"Let Sister Mi Na bask in the glory of a heavenly bride."

667
00:50:56,507 --> 00:50:58,943
You'll listen to Haneulnim's prayer directly.

668
00:50:58,967 --> 00:51:02,167
You're getting the glory of talking to me alone.

669
00:51:07,467 --> 00:51:09,613
Who can stand before my wrath and

670
00:51:09,637 --> 00:51:13,437
who can survive in front of my fearful anger?

671
00:51:22,947 --> 00:51:25,477
If you're not truthful to me,

672
00:51:37,557 --> 00:51:40,277
I shall have you killed by my hands.

673
00:51:47,777 --> 00:51:49,653
<i>The call is not going through...</i>

674
00:51:49,677 --> 00:51:53,467
Mi Na, please! Please pick up. Mi Na!

675
00:51:55,557 --> 00:51:57,907
<i>The call is not going through.</i>

676
00:52:06,047 --> 00:52:07,773
What's this?

677
00:52:07,797 --> 00:52:09,677
[Fire alarm]

678
00:52:14,487 --> 00:52:16,343
What's the matter?

679
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:18,683
Someone ran that way in a hurry just now.

680
00:52:18,707 --> 00:52:20,213
Get him!

681
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:21,827
Toward the emergency exit.

682
00:52:26,657 --> 00:52:29,873
Okay, I lured them away. Go inside now.

683
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:31,357
What's going-

684
00:52:40,997 --> 00:52:45,107
What brings you here at this late hour, Dear Sister?

685
00:52:45,867 --> 00:52:47,713
Chairman.

686
00:52:47,737 --> 00:52:52,437
I've got something to tell you in private, Chairman.

687
00:52:57,347 --> 00:52:59,067
Right here?

688
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:04,467
Yes, right here.

689
00:53:08,847 --> 00:53:10,663
Hey, which way is it?

690
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,383
Oh, i-it's the personal prayer room.

691
00:53:12,407 --> 00:53:14,917
<i>Go straight down the hallway!</i>

692
00:53:17,387 --> 00:53:18,623
<i>Chairman.</i>

693
00:53:18,647 --> 00:53:20,417
Yes, come in.

694
00:53:23,427 --> 00:53:26,203
I think someone was messing around.

695
00:53:26,227 --> 00:53:28,133
We're chasing a suspicious person right now.

696
00:53:28,157 --> 00:53:29,713
We'll take care of it quietly.

697
00:53:29,737 --> 00:53:32,623
Make sure not to lose him and wrap it up without fail.

698
00:53:32,647 --> 00:53:34,063
Yes.

699
00:53:34,087 --> 00:53:38,387
Oh, and also, take Believer Mi Na and leave.

700
00:53:49,297 --> 00:53:51,863
- Continue-
- I've got something to tell you, Chairman.

701
00:53:51,887 --> 00:53:53,293
This place is off-limits.

702
00:53:53,317 --> 00:53:55,117
It's okay!

703
00:54:00,327 --> 00:54:02,123
What is it now?

704
00:54:02,147 --> 00:54:04,423
I think you should escape right now.

705
00:54:04,447 --> 00:54:05,627
Why?

706
00:54:06,357 --> 00:54:08,143
I think the Prosecution will rush in soon.

707
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:09,393
Why would they?

708
00:54:09,417 --> 00:54:11,183
I've got a friend inside the Prosecution.

709
00:54:11,207 --> 00:54:15,157
I think they'll attack the House of Truth when no one is suspecting it.

710
00:54:16,317 --> 00:54:17,957
Wait a minute.

711
00:54:20,307 --> 00:54:22,097
Yes, District Attorney.

712
00:54:23,097 --> 00:54:26,277
No, I just heard you're coming over this way.

713
00:54:29,007 --> 00:54:32,567
Yes, I'll greet you at a nice place soon.

714
00:54:35,267 --> 00:54:37,127
He said they're not.

715
00:54:39,407 --> 00:54:40,663
There's no way.

716
00:54:40,687 --> 00:54:41,987
Leave.

717
00:54:42,987 --> 00:54:44,827
I'm sorry, Chairman.

718
00:55:02,927 --> 00:55:05,823
You're going to spend tonight with me?

719
00:55:05,847 --> 00:55:07,963
By the way,

720
00:55:07,987 --> 00:55:10,747
there are so many odd things happening lately.

721
00:55:12,717 --> 00:55:15,723
Things I can't understand keep happening.

722
00:55:15,747 --> 00:55:18,413
On the same day, the messengers and I fell asleep

723
00:55:18,437 --> 00:55:21,663
at the same time while we were having fun together.

724
00:55:21,687 --> 00:55:24,283
The blood test didn't detect any substances.

725
00:55:24,307 --> 00:55:26,723
And there's no suspicious record in the CCTV.

726
00:55:26,747 --> 00:55:30,817
As if someone had manipulated them perfectly!

727
00:55:33,787 --> 00:55:35,583
Who are you?

728
00:55:35,607 --> 00:55:38,127
Why do you keep doing this to me?

729
00:55:56,067 --> 00:55:57,723
W-What about Mi Na?

730
00:55:57,747 --> 00:56:00,127
The brothers took her out.

731
00:56:02,877 --> 00:56:04,933
<i>J-Jin Woong, it's the night-duty room</i>

732
00:56:04,957 --> 00:56:08,003
Listen carefully. Mi Na was moved to the night-duty room!

733
00:56:08,027 --> 00:56:09,657
I-I got it.

734
00:56:19,637 --> 00:56:21,177
It's me.

735
00:56:22,497 --> 00:56:24,213
Wait, Chairman.

736
00:56:24,237 --> 00:56:26,943
Yes, speak the truth.

737
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:29,183
There's a really good investment opportunity.

738
00:56:29,207 --> 00:56:30,607
Investment?

739
00:56:31,327 --> 00:56:34,627
The enormous amount of offerings you collect from your believers.

740
00:56:36,947 --> 00:56:38,843
It's a failproof investment.

741
00:56:38,867 --> 00:56:41,663
You won't ever regret it. Rather...

742
00:56:41,687 --> 00:56:44,957
you'll be satisfied beyond what you would expect.

743
00:56:59,987 --> 00:57:01,647
Continue.

744
00:57:06,137 --> 00:57:08,297
Invest in crypto.

745
00:57:12,017 --> 00:57:14,903
- Crypto?
- It's perfect for money laundering

746
00:57:14,927 --> 00:57:17,903
and you can store it safely, too.

747
00:57:17,927 --> 00:57:19,533
You think I don't know about that stuff?

748
00:57:19,557 --> 00:57:22,423
Knowing it and knowing it well are two different things-

749
00:57:22,447 --> 00:57:24,433
No, they're not different.

750
00:57:24,457 --> 00:57:29,363
Because I'm fully aware that everything your mouth is uttering is nonsense!

751
00:57:29,387 --> 00:57:30,753
Why?

752
00:57:30,777 --> 00:57:34,403
Because I'm really good at reading people's minds.

753
00:57:34,427 --> 00:57:39,803
You pulled the strings to save that Japanese believer from earlier, right?

754
00:57:39,827 --> 00:57:42,353
- Why would I?
- Who knows?

755
00:57:42,377 --> 00:57:45,973
Well, you can be a spy for the Prosecution or

756
00:57:45,997 --> 00:57:49,267
you can be a scammer who's after my money!

757
00:57:50,317 --> 00:57:52,163
I guess you watch too many movies.

758
00:57:52,187 --> 00:57:54,363
No, I don't have the time for movies.

759
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,133
It's all from experience.

760
00:57:56,157 --> 00:58:00,493
With my hands, those traitors, scammers, spies, and all!

761
00:58:00,517 --> 00:58:02,837
My precious experience!

762
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,117
I'm telling you in advance.

763
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:14,063
Tonight will be...

764
00:58:14,087 --> 00:58:16,717
a lot more fun than you expected.
