1
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,330
   

2
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,930
   

3
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,640
   

4
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,710
   

5
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,870
   

6
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:45,230
   

7
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,860
 This drug isn't for personal use, is it? 
   

8
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,350
 Hey, do you think you'll be safe after doing this? 

9
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,710
 Whoa, he really can't read the air. 

10
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,820
 Fuck! I said I'll talk! I will! 

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,280
 All right. Shall we start by talking about CEO Kim Yun Gi, then? 
  

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,010
 You'll draw CEO Kim's attention by acting like a drug dealer? 

13
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,010
 - Oh, Eddie Jung? 
 - Oh, Assemblywoman. 

14
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,800
 This is Eddie Jung. 

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,610
 - I'm Eddie Jung. 
- That's his real job. 

16
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,020
 How much can you bring in this time? 

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,950
 And I'd like to check out the goods myself. 

18
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,600
 Then, CEO Kim, who found the sales channel, 

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,910
 will bring in the goods from the supplier. 

20
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,850
 What did you just say? 

21
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,260
 Get them at the scene? At the drug deal? 

22
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,190
 Money, drugs, and that trash. 

23
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,490
 You can get all of them at once. 

24
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,890
 You're awake. 

25
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,530
 Stop it, you asshole! 

26
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,210
 No! 

27
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,240
 As I thought, you didn't come to make money. 

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,570
 Did you come to get killed by me again? 

29
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,070
 Hi. Everyone, stop. 

30
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,590
 Gosh, you took your sweet time. You know? 

31
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,260
 Go get them all! 

32
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,380
 Good shot! 

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,930
 Don't shoot. 

34
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,000
 I guess you really don't know well, Prosecutor. 

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,030
 I won't be arrested for something like this anyway. 

36
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,130
 Prosecutor Kwak, CEO Kim has... 

37
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,940
 CEO Kim was found dead at the detention center. 

38
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,930
 The day CEO Kim was arrested, the drug smuggler escaped from the scene. 

39
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,400
 Cherish your life more. 

40
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,740
 His reinforcement came to his rescue at the end. 

41
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,390
 Damn it. 

42
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,570
 - What are you doing? 
- Since we got one job done, we need to get on with the next job now. 

43
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,020
 Dad... 

44
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,210
 Dad, I think I'm in trouble. What do I do? 

45
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,280
 - Wait, only a probation?
 - This is totally that kind of case. 

46
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,540
 - What kind?
 - It's that somebody's got his back. 

47
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,540
 He is sentenced to probation. 

48
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,500
 Yes, that's right. He's a third-gen chaebol. 

49
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,020
 There's a person who blurs out the clear truth for them. 

50
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,980
 The problem solver for Korea's VVIPs That's who Director Baek is. 

51
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,090
 Aigoo, this one's going to be a headache. 

52
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,820
 It seems Kang Ha Ri's got a rough idea now. 

53
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,590
 Please call him over right now. 

54
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,880
 I think you need to come with me. 

55
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,240
 Where, at this hour? 

56
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,970
 You'll see when you're there. 

57
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,780
 Come with me. 

58
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,910
 I brought him. 

59
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,850
 It's a pleasure to meet you, Kang Ha Ri. 

60
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:11,940


61
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,910
I did expect to meet someone great,

62
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,870
but I didn't think you'd be here, Mr. President.

63
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,420
I didn't mean to surprise you.

64
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,070
I apologize. It's just that I needed confirmation.

65
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,160
What did you need to confirm with me?

66
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:38,700
Whether you're really someone who can join my cause to the end together.

67
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,200
Your cause?

68
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,670
I'm sure you've caught on,

69
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,770
that all of us here have a mutual enemy.

70
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,910
It might become a very long and tedious fight.

71
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,880
And someone always betrays in fights as long as this one.

72
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,230
So, I don't want to allow people like that into my inner circle.

73
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:13,520
I need someone who can finish the  job,

74
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,940
no matter what happens.

75
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,330
People like you, Kang Ha Ri, and Secretary Jeong Su Min.

76
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,060
Oh, I see.

77
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,800
I understand what you mean. However,

78
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,060
I have doubts.

79
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,800
Why would you need someone like me?

80
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,480
Because evil needs to be crushed with evil.

81
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,180
You can't lecture someone with words when they're coming at you with guns and knives.

82
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,260
But in the position you're in right now,

83
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,720
aren't you able to fight anyone off with enormous power?

84
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,820
Being a president isn't about fighting.

85
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,170
It's about compromising and accepting.

86
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:19,120
If I wanted to fight in the first place, I shouldn't be where I am right now.

87
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,830
Every single thing I do and say comes with great responsibility.

88
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,690
I'm not free and I shouldn't be so.

89
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,640
 So, I'm making a request. 

90
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:46,670
 Kang Ha Ri, please become my player who will represent me. 

91
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:51,510
   

92
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,570
 Cheers! 

93
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,110
Let's fill up sad thoughts with work.

94
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,940
What did you say your name was? 
   

95
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,190
- Me? Hyeon Seo. 
- Hyeon Seo?

96
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,090
Hyeon Seo, what's wrong with your outfit?

97
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,920
What's the Grim Reaper doing?

98
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,600
Letting bastards like him roam free.

99
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,350
Hey, I can't understand how the law can be like that.

100
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,100
I'm going to kill that asshole today.

101
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,090
Geez.

102
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,420
Didn't I say we shouldn't play cards at the end?

103
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,800
Let's just consider it charity work.

104
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,540
That's bullshit!

105
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,150
The poor will always be the poor!

106
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,350
Shit.

107
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,670
Who the fuck put this shit here?

108
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,820
H-Hey! What are you doing?

109
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,440
Damn it!

110
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,310
Thinking about the trouble I had because of that—

111
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,740
Why'd you park here?

112
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,020
Assholes who drive that should travel elsewhere,

113
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,640
so they can't be seen. That asshole—

114
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,340
Hey, man.

115
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,320
Shit, what the hell—

116
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,880
Long time no see. It's been forever!

117
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,340
Gosh, who are you?

118
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,600
- This bastard's joking with me! 
 - Hey...

119
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,680
Hey, how are you still the same?

120
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,490
You didn't change one bit. I'm quite surprised.

121
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,720
L-Let go! Let me go—

122
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,950
What? Got something to say?

123
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,380
No, no. Not at all. Have fun with your friend.

124
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,700
- Hey!
 - Go, go. Go home! Punk.

125
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,590
- Who are you?
 - Man, this asshole's joking with me to the end, huh?

126
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,410
A-Ahjeossi, please talk it out!

127
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,150
- We're buddies. We're just messing. 
- Buddies, my foot! I don't think so.

128
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,420
- Are you kidding me? 
- No, Ahjeossi. We're friends.

129
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,320
- Are you really friends? 
- We're friends.

130
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,260
- Have fun, then. I'm going. 
- Aigoo, thank you.

131
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,140
Hey!

132
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,690
You're really starting to make me upset.

133
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,160
We trained together at the Nonsan Army Training Center.

134
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,210
Look at this asshole pretending not to know me.

135
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,940
Training Center?

136
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,530
I'm exempt from military service!

137
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,530
Wait a minute.

138
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,060
Oh, you're not, huh? I'm sorry.

139
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,140
I drank so much here.

140
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,740
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,720
- What a fucking lunatic. 
 - Gosh. A fucking lunatic?

142
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,410
Please don't curse. You shouldn't use bad words. You're scaring me.

143
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,520
You're a total nutcase, huh?

144
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,510
You're calling me a nutcase now.

145
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,450
That's why I'm apologizing right now.

146
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,270
So many people don't apologize after killing someone, these days.

147
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,240
Let's just shake hands and be done. Okay?

148
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,140
I take it you understood, then?

149
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,270
I see you didn't kill him.

150
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,590
It felt great to see that asshole getting the rough treatment.

151
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,640
It was a good idea to come out, right?

152
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,230
- Don't try me. 
- I barely held myself back from killing him.

153
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,060
- Is it done now? 
- Aigoo, of course.

154
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,580
- The first step is done. 
 - Gosh, you're really fast.

155
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,890
   

156
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,330
Why on earth?

157
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,380
Prosecutor, is something wrong?

158
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,750
Please find a phone number for me.

159
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,520
A number?

160
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,810
It's been a long time.

161
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,140
You're right. It's our first time after law school.

162
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,300
You really know how to surprise people.

163
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,220
You were at the top of the class, so I thought you'd be the first to take a seat at the Prosecution or the Court.

164
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,270
How can you get caught on my radar?

165
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,290
I didn't like the sword or the balance as much as I thought I would.

166
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,230
And you like hanging out with criminals?

167
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,050
Who are you?

168
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,010
If I had to lay it out, I'd be me, myself, and I.

169
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,580
I don't think a play on words will be enough in this situation.

170
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,550
I don't know what you're scheming, but Kang Ha Ri's gang is clearly a group of criminals.

171
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:41,790
But a law school grad like you is hanging out with them.

172
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,870
Am I wrong?

173
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,440
Then, you can prosecute me.

174
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,760
Of course, you would need to secure clear evidence first.

175
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,050
- Ta-da. 
- What's that?

176
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,580
I'm going to make this the main work.

177
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,420
What are we going to do with it?

178
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,690
Get it in and infiltrate the enemy grounds.

179
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,620
- Wow, it's totally the Trojan Horse. 
 - Bingo.

180
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:11,820
   

181
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,350
Excuse me.

182
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,480
Artist?

183
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,040
Artist?

184
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,560
Artist Jeon Jeong Ho!

185
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,590
   

186
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,890
   

187
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,750
Hello.

188
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,920
You are?

189
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,080
You're Artist Jeon Jeong Ho, right?

190
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,190
Seohan University's Professor Seo told me about you.

191
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:14,420
To artists, our workshop is our soul's room.

192
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:20,140
Would you be happy if someone barged into your soul's room like this without permission?

193
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,980
I don't know. I've never had a room like that.

194
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,620
Oh, more importantly, I'd like to commission a project.

195
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,340
I want to make something like this. The size should be about—

196
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:39,400
I don't want to talk about my works with someone who doesn't understand art!

197
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,300
Please leave!

198
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,180
Artist?

199
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,060
What was that about the size?

200
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,000
About... this tall.

201
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,620
Okay.

202
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,670
Oh, my. You're here, Eun Na?

203
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,120
   

204
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,760
   

205
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,710
Please promote my gallery.

206
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,480
Your gallery's so unique.

207
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,770
I'll be looking forward to it.

208
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,650
Nuna.

209
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,500
I'll film it now.

210
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,610
Yes, let's go with this one.

211
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,860
This one gives a more intellectual vibe.

212
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,520
All right, then. The title will be, "Meeting a strange side of me."

213
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,990
Nuna's hot place, Baek Gallery.

214
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,720
Hashtag, "not a sponsor" and "not an ad."

215
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,270
Yes.

216
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,890
It's her. Let's go.

217
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,360
How do you do, Eun Na? I always have—

218
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,860
- Is it a blind date?
 - I'm working right now.

219
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,070
I'm getting into character right now. Stop distracting me!

220
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,830
Gosh, why does my hair keep splitting here?

221
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,920
- Let's go now.
 - Hey, my hair's messy in the back here, right?

222
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,530
Let's go before the world gets messy.

223
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,380
Okay. Here we go.

224
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,290
I'm so nervous.

225
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,070
- E-Eun Na!
 - My goodness.

226
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,980
- She's Eun Na, right?
 - Y-Yes, she is.

227
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,230
Whoa, she looks a thousand times prettier in person!

228
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,480
Whoa, nice to meet you! I-I'm- No, I'm—

229
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,330
No, let me go for a second. I'm really a huge fan.

230
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,370
I follow her on Instagram and YouTube!

231
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,190
I even have the notifications turned on!

232
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,080
Gosh, she's really the best, huh?

233
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,720
Y-Yes, thank you for your support for Nuna. Okay?

234
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,380
N-No, wait. I've got something to show her. Just one thing.

235
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:04,020
I'm serious. L-Look at this. You see, this is the list of London Art School's graduates.

236
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,230
But Eun Na is not on the list here. These lunatics. 
   

237
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,160
Does this make sense? I'm going to sue them even if I die.

238
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,680
And look at this here. What's this?

239
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,360
Unlabeled ad contracts?

240
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,110
Gosh, unlabeled ad contracts!

241
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,460
It's not, right? They're not unlabeled ads?

242
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,860
This isn't it. There's more. Look here.

243
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,640
Tax evasion—

244
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,290
You didn't do tax evasion, right? They got it wrong about tax evasion, right?

245
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:29,570
- There's more. Gosh, fraud record! 
- Whoa, a fraud record.

246
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,360
This has to be really wrong. A fraud record is nonsense.

247
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,980
- Right?
 - Of course. It can't be.

248
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,550
- What kind of— 
- What's your deal?

249
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,680
Are you blackmailing me right now?

250
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,530
W-What do you mean I'm blackmailing you? I'm your biggest fan!

251
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,760
You're making me upset, seriously.

252
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:50,210
I mean, I do have a favor to ask of you.

253
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:58,740
   

254
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,950
   

255
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,870
There's no time to look around like this.

256
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,640
Excuse me! The auction's going to start soon.

257
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,580
We've barely enough time to look for a piece!

258
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:33,210
- Let's go. 
- Choose one. It's on me.

259
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,850
There. That's it, right? Let's go now.

260
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,000
Yes, you've got good taste, as expected.

261
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,730
Yes, that's great.

262
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,030
The clink. No, no. The prison.

263
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,290
Okay! It'll be called the Flower Prison.

264
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,980
It might look like a normal vase to people.

265
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,790
But to the flowers, this is what a prison would look like, right?

266
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,380
Don't you think you can hear the flowers' screams of despair?

267
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,990
I want to get out. Please save me. I can't breathe. Let me out!

268
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,520
What?

269
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,620
Sorry.

270
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,970
Okay! Three-hundred million won sounds about right.

271
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,910
You're not telling me this will be...

272
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,690
Baek Nam Joon, the world-renowned artist, said this. Art is a scam.

273
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,560
I don't think you're supposed to use that here.

274
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,560
All right. We've got the piece.

275
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,880
We just need one more thing done. Come.

276
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,440
Wait, what's there left to do?

277
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,110
Hey, you need to pay for that!

278
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,040
Aigoo! Aigoo, I'm sorry.

279
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,180
- How much is it?
 - 30,000 won.

280
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,920
30,000 won? Can you do it for 20,000 won?

281
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,960
 I'm giving it to you for cheap. 

282
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,790
   
  

283
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,930
What are you scheming this time?

284
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,770
- Hey!
 - Hey, hurry!

285
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,080
- Hey, go ahead!
 - Go first, Jae Yi!

286
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,410
Go! I'll take care of things here.

287
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,160
Hey! Gosh, help me up.

288
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,090
We're here!

289
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,930
Good job. Well done.

290
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,350
I told you we should move faster!

291
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,370
Jae Yi, that was the fastest I ran in 10 years.

292
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:46,340
Hey, they'll still have enough for us, right?

293
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,020
I don't think we're safe.

294
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,000
See what happens if we don't get in.

295
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,040
Hey, I'll fry some eggs for you.

296
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,570
- Please enjoy.
 - Thank you.

297
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,820
Can we eat it?

298
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,400
It's delicious.

299
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,740
Wait, you haven't even taken a bite.

300
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,290
I can just tell with a glance.

301
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,720
Geez.

302
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,040
Why? You don't like it?

303
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,700
It's too delicious.

304
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,200
It's not fair that I only found out about this place now.

305
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,820
The Maillard reaction (attraction to browned food) is bombing my tongue right now.

306
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:20,310
It feels like I'm watching the Philharmonic Orchestra.

307
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,780
By the way, why did Ha Ri say he doesn't want to eat this delicious thing with us?

308
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,920
Was he full? He did eat up a lot of insults.

309
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,680
You sounded like we had an important thing to do.

310
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,620
Of course, it's important. We're doing all this to feed ourselves.

311
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,070
What's the matter? You live like there's no tomorrow all the time.

312
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:51,060
Aigoo, you were mistaken. I'm going to live a long and happy life.

313
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,150
Take a bite. This place is good.

314
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,830
I know.

315
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,620
Wait, you didn't even try it.

316
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,770
I've been here before.

317
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,490
With whom?

318
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,220
- With someone I love. 
- I see.

319
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,470
You're in love? How romantic.

320
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,500
I used to be.

321
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,660
Shall we change the topic?

322
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,340
I contacted Byeong Min earlier and...

323
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,960
You're right. How are things going with them?

324
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,370
Of course. Mr. Damien Lee.

325
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,010
   

326
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,890
Okay, it's done.

327
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,470
   

328
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,150
   

329
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,840
   

330
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,830
   

331
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,830
   

332
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,200
Please move this way now. There.

333
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,130
That's nice.

334
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,340
How handsome. Hold the vase like it's your lover.

335
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,140
Gosh, you can become a professional.

336
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,660
Aigoo, how nice. Raise your head!

337
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,850
- That's great. 
- This is a first for me.

338
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,100
That's great! That's great.

339
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,930
All right, here we go. Don't move now!

340
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,960
That's great.

341
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,570
Come say hi to Damien now.

342
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,670
- Whoa.
 - The pictures came out great.

343
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,270
Nice! Okay.

344
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,250
   

345
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,010
   

346
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,360
   

347
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,100
   

348
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,980
Artist Oh Eun Ji's "Deadend."

349
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,190
150 million won. 150 million won.

350
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,020
150 million won is the final price!

351
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,460
Now, this piece is "Flower Prison."

352
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,500
This is the work of Damien Lee, the global rising star.

353
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,690
Through the existential tension between flowers and vases,

354
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:12,540
it's a piece that visualizes freedom and restraint.

355
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,790
The bidding price starts at 50 million won (~$50.000).

356
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,910
- 100 million won!
 - Yes, 100 million won.

357
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,660
- 120 million won.
 - We've got 120 million won.

358
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,620
- 150 million won. 
 - Yes, 150 million won.

359
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,200
- 200 million won. 
 - 200 million won! We've got 200 million won.

360
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,720
250 million won.

361
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,620
Yes, it's going up fast. 250 million won.

362
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,910
270 million won.

363
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:40,910
We've got 270 million won. Are there any other bids?

364
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:44,490
- 300 million won.
 - We've got 300 million won!

365
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,000
3-320 million won!

366
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,560
We've got 320 million won!

367
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,190
320 million won.

368
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,230
Is there anyone else?

369
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,450
350 million won (~$350.000)?

370
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,710
350 million won!

371
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,430
We've got 350 million won! 350 million won.

372
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,210
350 million won.

373
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:16,070
350 million won has won the bid!

374
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,060
Congratulations.

375
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,360
Thanks.

376
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,610
Look into that guy.

377
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,210
Yes.

378
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,120
 Gosh, why'd you get carried away and overreact? 

379
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,420
You know, I think I'm meant to gamble. It got my heart pumping.

380
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:01,190
What a shame.

381
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,550
Hearing that is making my heart stop.

382
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:08,380
Okay, we've got something. One moment.

383
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,800
Yes!

384
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,200
"You're invited to this Friday evening's party at Baek Gallery."

385
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,680
Yeah. There.

386
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,300
As expected, she responds fast.

387
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,080
She can smell money from a mile away.

388
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,800
Oh, Jae Yi, how's Damien Lee's new work coming along?

389
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,860
 Artist, hi! 

390
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,600
 - What are you doing here?
 - Gosh! 

391
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,270
 I'm complete garbage! 

392
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,890
 Are you saying it's not done? 

393
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,380
 I just can't finish it up. 

394
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,140
 Let's look at what you have done so far. 

395
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,360
 Come on! 

396
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,580
 What the heck? It's all done. 

397
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:15,290
 I... I have to put the eyes in to finish it. 

398
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,930
 My eyes! 

399
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,120
 Gosh, my eyes! 

400
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,350
 Put them in right now. What's the matter? 

401
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,190
 So terrible! 

402
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:27,090
 This is why you don't communicate with people who don't understand art. 

403
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,880
 Icing on the cake! 

404
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,080
 Just like the painting of the dragon that soared into the sky after the eyes were drawn in! 

405
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,760
 This horse also needs eyes that will blow life into it, 

406
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,240
 so it can become a horse! 

407
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,920
 - You know...
 - What... 

408
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,240
 you never thought you'd lose your life 

409
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,680
 while looking to blow life into a fake horse, right? 

410
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,130
   

411
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:04,940
I also checked with the school and they said he's indeed their graduate. 
   

412
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,000
But a genius like him has been quiet all this time?

413
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,460
And now, out of nowhere.

414
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,600
- The party prep is almost done, right? 
- Yes.

415
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,350
Artist Damien Lee?

416
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,910
How do you do? You're Director Baek, right?

417
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,560
Thank you for the invitation.

418
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,290
It's my honor to have you here.

419
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,980
I was impressed by your work at the auction.

420
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,090
Thank you for the compliment.

421
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:51,790
That's right. I heard you graduated from the British National Academy.

422
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:57,060
Oh, yes. It's been about five years since I graduated.

423
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,410
I also visited a few times during overseas exhibitions.

424
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,980
I had a cup of coffee whenever I went to the annex's lounge.

425
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,420
Oh, you know, huh?

426
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,160
The window seat by the garden used to be my spot.

427
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:17,250
You can't forget the view around sunset.

428
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,070
Really?

429
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,610
How odd.

430
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:24,690
The annex's lounge was built three years ago.

431
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,990
Because the exhibition room was moved.

432
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,700
Oh, is that so?

433
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,200
I must've confused it with the lounge in the third exhibition room.

434
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,200
Well, that happens.

435
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,380
Would you like to have a drink?

436
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,700
Your guest has arrived.

437
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,920
Hey, Jonathan!

438
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:01,530
 So, these three Korean graduates from this school are still active. 

439
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:04,090
 Those two are living abroad. 

440
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:07,680
 This guy is the only one who's living in Korea. 

441
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,180
 Jonathan Joe. 

442
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,280
Thank you for coming.

443
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,520
Oh, you're from the same school, right?

444
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,470
There aren't many Korean students at the British National Academy.

445
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,150
So, I think you'd know each other well.

446
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,930
I couldn't really keep in touch with other graduates.

447
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:31,570
Long time no see, Damien Lee.

448
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,780
I didn't think you'd remember me since I was so quiet at school.

449
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,590
It's been a long time. You're Jonathan, right?

450
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,320
Yes, of course!

451
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,900
I'm doing well! How about you?

452
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,150
 You're Jo Yeong Woong, right? 

453
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,310
 It's my Korean name. 

454
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:58,390
 We're from the Special Crimes Team of Sooseo Police Station. 

455
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:02,140
 Police? W-What do the police need from me? 

456
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:07,990
 Oh, there's an ongoing investigation on artworks being used to supply corporate slush funds. 

457
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:12,010
 But it seems like some current artists are involved in it. 

458
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,260
 It has nothing to do with me. 

459
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,030
 Those problems within the art industry... 

460
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,710
 I am really sick and tired of it. 

461
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,710
 I know. 

462
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,240
 I know, but... 

463
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:32,800
 I'd like to ask for your cooperation with our investigation. 

464
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,570
 Cooperation... 

465
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,610
It must be nice to see each other after a long time.

466
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,760
- Yes.
 - Now, then. Please enjoy your time.

467
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,610
Oh, yes.

468
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:49,670
Hey, how've you been doing? It's been forever.

469
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,830
Thank you for your help.

470
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,230
I thought I was going to die from the nervousness.

471
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,250
Look how shaky my hands are.

472
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,850
You've done a really important job.

473
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,240
You don't need to overreact like that.

474
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,050
   

475
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,590
- Hello!
 - You said you would come during the day.

476
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,530
How can you come so late?

477
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,300
The Chairman and his wife were waiting until they had to leave.

478
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,670
I'm sorry. A defect was found in the product.

479
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,540
So we had to urgently replace it with a new one.

480
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,510
One moment!

481
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:31,970
I'm sorry, but could I use your bathroom, please?

482
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:34,860
- The bathroom?
 - Yes.

483
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,250
- You can use the second-floor bathroom.
 - Thank you.

484
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:42,540
H-Hyeong, please wrap this up for me. I-I have to...

485
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,690
Excuse me! Please be careful not to leave scratches.

486
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,380
Oh, yes.

487
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,640
 What are you saying right now? 

488
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,040
How can you say that at this point? The piece arrives first thing tomorrow!

489
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,740
Gosh, that's not right.

490
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:22,110
Gosh, forget it. Let's just call this agreement off.

491
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,110
You were here.

492
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,230
I thought you already left.

493
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,880
Oh, yes.

494
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,790
I'm sorry for being loud.

495
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:39,500
I couldn't help but overhear, but is there an issue?

496
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,070
Oh, it's nothing, really.

497
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,740
Oh, don't be like that. Tell me.

498
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,460
Is it something related to your work?

499
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,920
To be honest, one of my works from the U.S. is arriving tomorrow.

500
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,150
I need a place to store it until the presentation.

501
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,030
- But there seems to be a serious problem. 
- Oh.

502
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:04,770
The piece is quite big, and it's not easy to store.

503
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,580
So this is a big problem for me.

504
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,930
How great.

505
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,030
Sorry?

506
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:18,130
I think it's something I can help you with.

507
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,160
But the piece is really quite large.

508
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,570
So it won't be easy.

509
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:35,290
Baek Gallery.

510
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,290
This was it, huh?

511
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,830
Can you look into contact information for me, please?

512
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,240
 It's going to arrive in an hour. 

513
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,220
 Yes, we'll also be preparing. 

514
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,560
 I'll see you later. 

515
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,420
Who is it?

516
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,710
   

517
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,900
Is this how the Greek soldiers inside the Trojan Horse felt?

518
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,360
Greek? Isn't the Trojan Horse from Troy?

519
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,710
It went to Troy from Greece, you know.

520
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,250
Where's Troy located, then?

521
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,690
Troy?

522
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,830
Was Troy where Turkey is?

523
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:31,010
- No, wait. Is it just a myth? 
 - No, it's not Turkey.

524
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,940
Hold on. Move over a bit more.

525
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,410
Hold on now.

526
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,400
Turkiye! Yes, it's Turkiye.

527
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,040
Turkiye is Turkey, you idiot. It's where they sell Turkish ice cream.

528
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,470
Hey, Turkey! Why don't we eat kebabs for dinner?

529
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:47,510
Kebabs sound great. And since it's Greece, wouldn't it be delicious to use Greek yogurt as a sauce?

530
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,820
Your brain works best when you're hungry.

531
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,310
- Of course.
 - Man, this guy...

532
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,730
 Unified a prehistoric war with food. 

533
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:57,900
 Okay, great. It's a deal! 

534
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,730
 I think I'll just have turkey instead. 

535
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,610
 Jae Yi, is kebab good? 

536
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,290
Come this way, now. That's right.

537
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,360
Yes, that's good.

538
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,300
Look out the side for me.

539
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,030
It must've been a lot of work for that piece.

540
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,730
It's nothing special.

541
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,490
It's the fate of artists.

542
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:19,270
I emptied a spot, so let's go right away.

543
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:31,250
   

544
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,900
Let's go.

545
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,670
It's all done.

546
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,200
Can you just sign here?

547
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:01,670
- Thank you. 
- Yes, thank you.

548
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:09,430
Whoa... The lighting, temperature, and humidity.

549
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,410
They're all perfect.

550
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:15,840
If you look over there, you can see our automated system.

551
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,460
I'm glad it's to your liking.

552
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:23,740
There aren't that many pieces compared to how spacious it is.

553
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,140
Is there something else behind this?

554
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,570
Do you have good intuition? You're on a roll finding them out.

555
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,980
You're on a roll finding them out.

556
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,600
   

557
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,990
Oh, my God.
  
 

558
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,290
It's so amazing!

559
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:51,570
Each piece is worth at least 20 billion won.

560
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,850
I see the pictures I only saw in books here.

561
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,690
Shall we go to the office now?

562
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,080
You need to sign the storage agreement.

563
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,450
Oh, yes.

564
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,760
Ugh, my legs.

565
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:50,890
 I really had doubts about this, but... 

566
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,120
 you're telling me to go inside this? 

567
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,790
 Just think of it as an amusement park ride. 

568
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,660
 - What kind of horse shit— 
- It's a horse. 

569
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,750
 This is a horse. A horsey. 

570
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:05,650
 I would've ridden it if it was a tad bit larger. What a shame. 

571
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:09,300
 Oh, really? I'll ask him to change it to a larger size in that case. 

572
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,020
 - H-Hey, hey.
 - Hey, Jae Yi. 

573
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,070
 - What do you want?
 - This is what I think. 

574
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,690
 This horse is also a type of vehicle, right? 

575
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:20,490
 All right. Our number one. Who's our number one best driver? 

576
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,800
 Of course, it's Cha Jae Yi. 

577
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,390
I'm finally relieved now.

578
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,260
It'd be really hard to find a storehouse like this in Korea, right?

579
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,680
Of course.

580
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,580
I paid a lot of attention to everything from interior conditions to security.

581
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,930
Your work will be stored properly in a complete vacuum.

582
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:00,060
So please rest assured, Artist Damien Lee.

583
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,680
Director.

584
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,890
A complete vacuum?

585
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:14,630
Yes, it activates the moment the storage unit's door is closed.

586
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,150
Vacuum?

587
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,400
They suck all the air out. What about Jae Yi, then?

588
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,820
S-Suck the air out?

589
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,330
The air out—  Wh-Why take the air out?

590
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,230
H-Hey, you didn't even charge the battery—

591
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,460
Shush! One second. Why take the air out?

592
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,040
 Gosh, I don't know. 

593
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,330
Excuse me, Director.

594
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,880
Could I use the restroom, please?

595
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,810
You'll find one over there.

596
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:43,720
I'll go on first, then.

597
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,160
Yes.

598
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,520
Everyone heard, right?

599
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,510
Byeong Min, access the security system and turn the power off now. Hurry!

600
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,880
H-Hold on. I'll give it a try. Wait for me.

601
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,320
 - Hurry it up.  
- It's my first time doing this, so— Wait, this is...

602
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,110
Damn it!

603
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,460
Jae Yi, get out of there as soon as possible. It's too dangerous.

604
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,210
Cha Jae Yi, you hear me, right?

605
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,960
I can hear you clearly.

606
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,260
 Jae Yi, don't risk it and come out for now. Listen to me. 

607
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:19,380
 Jae Yi, we can postpone the operation. So, get out right now. 

608
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,000
 Jae Yi. 

609
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,030
By the way...

610
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,910
 I guess the vacuum device 

611
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,190
is really strong.

612
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,380
I'll try to hurry.

613
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,670
-  Jae Yi. Do you hear me, Jae Yi?  
- Come on, hurry up.

614
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,060
Jae Yi, answer me if you can hear. Cha Jae Yi!

615
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,650
I can't...

616
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,450
Can't breathe...

617
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:52,880
Byeong Min, are you done yet?

618
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,730
W-Wait up! I got through the first step.

619
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,430
Jae Yi, hang in there for a bit! Okay?

620
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,010
- Diaphragm breathing!
  - Jae Yi, he got the first step done. 

621
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:00,320
 He got the first step. Hang in there. 

622
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,620
-  Breathe a bit more slowly. 
- Breathe with your abs! 

623
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,450
 Hold up. I've never done this before. 

624
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:07,170
 Byeong Min, hurry up now. Come on! 

625
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,100
Cha Jae Yi!

626
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,810
Jae Yi.

627
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,700
 Hey, Cha Jae Yi! 

628
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,080
 Forget this. Operation abort. 

629
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,550
This operation has been aborted completely.

630
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,980
Director Baek!

631
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,820
Why are you running?

632
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,400
It took you quite long at the restroom.

633
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,220
I actually...

634
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,940
have constipation.

635
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,480
I eat probiotics every morning, but...

636
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,590
I see.

637
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:50,510
Morning probiotics are important.

638
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,920
We have a guest.

639
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,960
Please say hi.

640
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:07,340
 Hello, I'm Artist Jeon Jeong Ho. 

641
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,430
 - And?
 - You have a storehouse, right? 

642
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:13,970
 - That storehouse is getting robbed right now. 
 - What did you say? 

643
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:17,490
 Damien Lee. His real name is Kang Ha Ri. 

644
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,580
I don't need to introduce you, right?

645
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,010
Because you two know each other already.

646
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,050
Director. Director.

647
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,150
I'll explain. Please hear me out—

648
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,620
Please be quiet and follow me.

649
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,370
- Are you looking for something?
 - Pardon?

650
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,440
You look unwell.

651
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,040
Are you sick?

652
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,470
No.

653
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:55,500
Actually, my stomach has been bothering me all day.

654
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:00,730
Here he is. Right on time.

655
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,480
I invited a guest.

656
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,060
Prosecutor.

657
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,940
 Hello? Yes. 

658
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,970
 Why is the Prosecutors' Office calling me? 

659
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,520
 Kang Ha Ri? 

660
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,580
Wow, I'm glad that you look healthy.

661
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:27,080
I thought you were in a coffin instead of prison.

662
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,260
Do you know how worried I was?

663
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,710
This is it.

664
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,140
What Damien...

665
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,210
- Open the door.
 - Yes, sir.

666
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,600
What are you doing with my artwork?

667
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,390
It's okay. It's not artwork.

668
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,300
How does a prosecutor know anything about art?

669
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,770
Of course, I do. I'm an artist, too.

670
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,190
Master of Criminal Psychology.

671
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:50,340
No matter how much you run, you're in the palm of my hand.

672
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,820
There's nothing in here.

673
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,800
Geez, come on, people.

674
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,600
What are you looking for, people? Move.

675
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,620
I'm sorry.

676
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:17,820
   

677
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:20,060
Madam?

678
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:24,310
 The people of Ipsun Village who got cancer from water waste sued them. 

679
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:28,410
 But the Hona Industry easily won due to lack of evidence. 

680
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,620
Could you turn off 
    

681
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:33,090
the computer in the secretary's office?

682
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,800
Thank you.

683
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:42,930
 Nokan Construction won their case against the homeless residents. 

684
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:46,340
Where's the water leak?
    

685
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,190
 Chairman Jang who raped his student's girlfriend and caused his student 

686
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:56,810
 to kill himself was acquitted as well. 

687
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:05,420
Unbelievable.

688
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:11,300
Why? Is something wrong?

689
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,680
There must've been an error.

690
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,070
My apologies, Prosecutor. I made you come here for nothing.

691
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:25,850
I'll make it up to you for this.

692
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:28,430
Well, no need to make it up.

693
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:32,910
Come on. Now that we're acquainted, it would be great to  get to know each other.

694
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:35,250
Prosecutor Kwak Do Su.

695
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:38,770
Is that so? I...

696
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,360
I don't think so.

697
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,380
Director Baek, it would've been nice if you owned a gym.

698
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:51,700
My gym membership ended not too long ago.

699
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:55,310
Anyway, I'm sorry about today.

700
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:58,790
All right, you must be busy. Let's call it a day—

701
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:09,850
Aigoo, what's that?

702
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:16,750
Aigoo. What's that? What's going on?

703
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,680
Aigoo. Oh, aigoo.

704
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:23,160
This is a ledger.

705
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,050
A record of briberies.

706
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:31,360
Gosh, you said you'd make up for this later, but it looks like you did so already.

707
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:35,320
Okay, gather all these pieces of evidence.

708
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,460
Please respectfully escort our Director Baek.

709
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,440
Prosecutor, I don't know anything about this.

710
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,050
Wait a minute. Let go. I really don't know about these!

711
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:45,680
- Prosecutor!
 - Bye now.

712
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:50,890
She's not my type at all.

713
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:53,750
I guess I should get to know her for real.

714
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,470
Hey.

715
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:00,860
- Me?
 - Yeah, you.

716
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,430
- Why?
 - You should go, too.

717
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:05,350
What? M-Me, too?

718
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:07,100
Yeah.

719
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,030
Let's put on a bracelet.

720
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,610
Yeah, yeah.

721
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:15,730
I'll put it on myself.

722
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,760
- What's the charge? 
- Kang Ha Ri, you're under arrest for fraud.

723
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,500
You have the right to remain—

724
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,550
- You know all this. We're all in the know. 
 - Yeah, of course.

725
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,640
Okay!

726
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,200
Excuse me.

727
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:37,230
This...

728
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:48,050
 - Continue.
 - You have artwork worth billions of won in your storage, don't you? 

729
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:50,240
 He's a fraud targeting those artworks. 

730
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,730
 Damien Lee or Kang Ha Ri. 

731
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:58,290
 Whoa, whoa. If you go out without a plan, you'll lose everything. 

732
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:01,810
 Lose the evidence as well as the artwork. 

733
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,540
 What do you want from me? 

734
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,700
 Well, what do I want? 

735
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:14,640
 You know the money you got from the Chairman Min of WQ Group? 

736
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,570
 Half of that money. Give me one billion won. 

737
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:20,230
 I never got anything like that. 

738
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:25,330
 Wow, I've come all this way. Do you think I came here without any intel? 

739
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:27,520
 Let's keep it at one billion won. 

740
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,350
 You get to keep the secret and also the artwork. 

741
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:33,990
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 

742
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:36,050
 I have no choice if you want to do this. 

743
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:38,180
 Then, let's forget it. 

744
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:40,150
 Five hundred million won! 

745
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:43,520
 Let's settle it at 500 million won. 

746
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:53,610
 One billion won. 

747
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:57,270
 Half of Chairman Min's money is one billion won. 

748
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:02,140
 I got one billion from Chairman Min. How dare you ask for the whole thing? 

749
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:06,160
Let's take a break.

750
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,130
The ledger?

751
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:12,740
They're all fabricated. I never wrote in a ledger like that.

752
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:17,640
If it turns out that was fabricated, you can prove that all this is slander.

753
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,600
So, verify that first.

754
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:24,400
I thought you were a lawyer just now.

755
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,730
We'll verify it. But as for fabricating the ledger

756
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:31,710
and your confession are two separate issues.

757
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:38,070
So, "You never wrote in a ledger like that"

758
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:41,100
means you did have a ledger, though, right?

759
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,230
You're pretty good at confessing, huh?

760
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:45,650
 All right, cheers! 

761
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:48,150
 Cheers! 

762
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:52,350
- Good work!
- Good work, good work!

763
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:57,840
Great work, everyone! Especially Jae Yi.

764
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,010
Great work this time.

765
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:03,320
Just words? Put it under worker's compensation.

766
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,240
I almost died.

767
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,380
Jae Yi, I got so scared this time. For real.

768
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,800
She was quiet, I was running out,

769
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,820
I was hitting the keyboards, and my hands were shaking. So afraid she'd die...

770
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:18,530
Aigoo, aigoo, our Jae Yi, thank you for being safe.

771
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:21,180
I'll be good to you, okay?

772
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,870
Aigoo, so proud of you.

773
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,920
This is a case of worker's comp!

774
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,790
I approve! It's worker's comp.

775
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:30,570
Mr. Hwang, you heard me, right?

776
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,330
No, I didn't hear you.

777
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:35,110
- Pardon?
 - My hearing is failing with old age.

778
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:37,740
I only hear what I want to hear.

779
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:41,890
Will you all be like this?

780
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:46,690
Whenever I think of that time, I'm still triggered!

781
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:49,290
 Answer me if you can hear me. Cha Jae Yi! 

782
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:51,820
 - I'm coming in.
 - Wait, wait, wait! 

783
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,900
 Ha Ri, got it! Next step! 

784
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,350
 Five seconds. Give me five seconds. 

785
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:58,600
 - Director!
 - Wait, wait, wait! 

786
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,890
 Jae Yi, Jae Yi! 

787
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:02,330
 I had a bad case of constipation. 

788
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:10,970
 Director, I'll explain it to you. Please hear me out— 

789
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:13,430
 Please be quiet and follow me. 

790
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:16,580
 Mission accomplished. 

791
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,490
 Hey... 

792
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:22,740
 I won. 

793
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:27,870
 There's nothing in here. 

794
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:43,210
 Excuse me. 

795
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:49,510
How did you convince the other artist?

796
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:54,560
He wanted to help out so that no more artwork gets sold on the black market.

797
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,040
I thought he was an oddball, but I guess he's serious about artwork.

798
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,420
But the ledger. Will the ledger be okay?

799
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:03,060
We have to trust cutting-edge technology.

800
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,390
Hey, hey. The cutting-edge technology isn't what makes it work.

801
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:11,640
Even if there's a printer this big without the ink,

802
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:16,820
who'd copy that Director Baek's PC if I weren't around?

803
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:19,540
- That's true.
 - This, this hand...

804
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:23,200
This... this is the hand of gods.

805
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,380
It doesn't matter if the ledger is real or fake.

806
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,330
What matters is that we have a clue like that.

807
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:32,840
So that we could compare the accounts.

808
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,390
It's like a trigger for the investigation itself.

809
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:39,120
All right. Then, shall we wrap this up nicely to the end?

810
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,920
Let us eat and enjoy for now.

811
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,430
 - All right! 
 - Let's eat and die!

812
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:54,310
Why am I the only one who got arrested?

813
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:57,780
Kang Ha Ri or whatever. Why don't you arrest that scammer?

814
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:02,280
He pretended to be an artist and sold an item at the auction, too.

815
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,640
He didn't.

816
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,460
 Seung Gyu. 

817
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,660
 Oh, sir! Damien! 

818
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:15,020
 - Yes.
 - I need to talk to you about something. 

819
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:18,690
 - Sure. 
 - He gave him back the money.

820
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:20,830
All of it.

821
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:31,290
It worked out.

822
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:34,220
I'm sick and tired of partying in Korea. This is great.

823
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,290
Chairman said that you should stay low for a while...

824
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:37,890
I'll take care of it, man!

825
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:41,020
Okay. I'm sorry. Things are chaotic in the press.

826
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:44,720
Geez! Why is everyone freaking out over what happened in the past?

827
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,840
- Those losers have nothing better to do!
  - WQ's Chairman Min's son 

828
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,970
 is wanted for assault and hit-and-run. 

829
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:53,400
 However, he seems to be on the run at the moment. 

830
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,160
 The police will request an arrest warrant for Min. 

831
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,160
 Here is Reporter Hong Seung Chan. 

832
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:04,160
 We have a video clip of Min throwing a drunken fit on the day of the incident. 

833
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,260
 He can't seem to control himself and is falling over. 

834
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:10,570
 But he ends up getting behind the wheel. 

835
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:13,980
Don't look around, and go straight.

836
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,480
Min Won Jun!

837
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,520
Wait a minute. Is it true you fabricated the incident?

838
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,290
Mr. Min, the travel ban was placed on you just now. Please say a word.

839
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:22,350
- Mr. Min.
 - Just a moment.

840
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,520
I think you're mistaken... wait... no, no...

841
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,600
Please move. Please step aside.

842
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:56,980
We're not open yet.

843
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:01,730
Oh, yes. Well, do you happen to be Lee Sang Wuk's parents?

844
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:05,790
Who are you?

845
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:08,060
Yes.

846
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:12,060
I'm the executive director of the Dreamstar Scholarship Foundation.

847
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,300
How do you know our Sang Wuk?

848
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:21,460
Here you go.

849
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:29,090
   

850
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:35,020
It's a donation sent to our foundation on behalf of Lee Sang Wuk.

851
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:38,060
What do you mean... Our Sang Wuk is...

852
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:43,660
Yes, well, I know about your son. You don't have to tell me.

853
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:49,620
An anonymous donor wanted to donate on behalf of Lee Sang Wuk.

854
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,890
- W-Who could that be...
 - He didn't want to be identified.

855
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:57,350
He only said he knows Lee Sang Wuk very well.

856
00:54:57,350 --> 00:55:00,190
 He said he was a diligent and upright young man. 

857
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:04,960
 He's sure Lee Sang Wuk would've become a great teacher. 

858
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,410
 And after he became a teacher, 

859
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:13,200
he would've been generous and giving for the sake of his students.

860
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:20,610
He said he was just doing what Lee Sang Wuk would've done.

861
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:25,580
Who could it possibly be... I'm so grateful.

862
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:30,980
Thank you so much. Thank you.

863
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:34,500
Thank you.

864
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,100
I just realized it.

865
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,330
What?

866
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:49,430
This is what "flexing" means.

867
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:52,500
- Geez.
 - It's worth spending the money.

868
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:56,050
I feel so proud.

869
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:58,630
Then, you'll donate everything you make from now on.

870
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:00,530
I'd become penniless if I flexed all the time.

871
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:02,500
I'll do it from time to time.

872
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,600
That's still a lot.

873
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,590
I'm proud of you.

874
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,980
 Hey, hey, we have to wait for Mr. Hwang. 

875
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:16,130
 Oh, he said he's coming after he eats chicken. 

876
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,730
Okay. Good work.

877
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:23,350
Okay.

878
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,690
Did he deliver it to them?

879
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:30,160
Yes.

880
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,940
Good work, Ha Ri.

881
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:35,260
Secretary Jung Su Min, you, too.

882
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:48,440
Su Min.

883
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,490
How much do you trust him?

884
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:56,300
Why are you asking me that all of a sudden?

885
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,950
Well, I don't mean much by it. I just...

886
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:01,030
I was just curious.

887
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:09,540
To me, he's like a father.

888
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:15,740
He was a friend of my late father

889
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:18,810
and after my father passed away,

890
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,380
he's been my sponsor.

891
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:25,960
Whenever I went through a hardship,

892
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,190
he was always there as my support.

893
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:53,400
 Ahjeossi. 

894
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:57,210
 What do I do? 

895
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:01,780
 What do I do... 

896
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:05,340
I had no idea.

897
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:10,710
Of course not. You don't know anything about me, Ha Ri.

898
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:24,150
 With someone I love. 

899
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:26,850
 Oh, nothing. 

900
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:30,230
 An accident. It was just an accident. 

901
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:34,800
 - What happened? 
 - I need more time on this.

902
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,340
 How long? 

903
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:40,120
Well? I need to check a few more things.

904
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:44,380
 The reporter, Jung Su Min's boyfriend, was murdered a few years ago. 
  

905
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:48,440
 The case closed suddenly while looking for the killer. 
  

906
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,030
 There's a rumor the President is linked. 

907
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:55,260
 I'll find out if there's someone behind it. 

908
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,980
   

909
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:10,360
   

910
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:45,280
   

911
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,390
 Su Min, how much do you trust him? 

912
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:58,490
   

913
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:10,110


914
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:12,980
   

915
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,940
Wow, awesome.

916
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:20,240
Oh, my! Yamada san!

917
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,280
Hi, long time no see.

918
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,600
What's up? Are you going to purchase Damien Lee's artwork?

919
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,600
You, too? Really?

920
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:31,050
The rumor sure travels fast in this field.

921
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:33,030
I didn't think you'd know him since he's new.

922
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:37,260
Only the losers don't know about him.

923
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:42,350
I heard his work has a high rate of return, just like an apartment in Gangnam.

924
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:44,530
High rate of return?

925
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:47,120
Secret, secret.

926
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,890
Let's go this way.

927
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:53,600
   

928
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:59,400
♫  Almost frantically. Going mad, shocked me again  ♫

929
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:06,570
♫  I stagger, I can kind of see it now. I tricked you, fell in again  ♫

930
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:15,680
♫  Respected like a giant. Blood is flowing fast  ♫

931
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:21,280
♫  When you find the perfect next move. In that happy moment  ♫

932
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,210
 How long has he been watching us? 

933
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:27,580
 It was confirmed Villa King owned more than 200 villas. 

934
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:31,340
 Mr. Myeong. A hidden hand in the real estate market. 

935
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:33,790
 - Ha Ri was already...
 - Oh, my gosh! 

936
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:37,340
 planning to approach Mr. Myeong. 

937
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:40,540
 They seem serious. 

938
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:42,700
 Mr. Myeong. 

939
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:46,760
 - Perhaps I might get to see him today. 
 - Mr. Myeong? 

940
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:51,780
♫  I stagger, I can kind of see it now. I tricked you, fell in again  ♫

941
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:54,610
♫  I can't help but be surprised  ♫
