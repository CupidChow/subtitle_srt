What? So all that ruckus today was...

335
00:28:40,653 --> 00:28:43,049
It's a self-made play by Jeffrey.

336
00:28:43,073 --> 00:28:45,189
W-Why would he bother with a self-made play?

337
00:28:45,213 --> 00:28:48,419
If he turns the protesters who oppose him into a crazy terrorist group,

338
00:28:48,443 --> 00:28:50,659
he can dismiss the protesters and

339
00:28:50,683 --> 00:28:53,499
win back the public opinion he lost for raising the fares.

340
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,669
He's right. For the privatization project Jeffrey's leading right now,

341
00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:00,109
the biggest problem for it is public opinion.

342
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:03,679
Jeffrey knows the public will oppose him more and more.

343
00:29:03,703 --> 00:29:08,469
Do you know why? Because he knows better than anyone

344
00:29:08,493 --> 00:29:11,519
his project's goal is to exploit the public, in fact.

345
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:13,349
That's why he pulled something like what happened today.

346
00:29:13,373 --> 00:29:16,159
To imprint a frame on the public.

347
00:29:16,183 --> 00:29:19,009
"Those who oppose me are all terrorists."

348
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:22,039
The most efficient way to manipulate the public is to

349
00:29:22,063 --> 00:29:25,813
attack with a messenger, not refute the message.

350
00:29:26,813 --> 00:29:29,459

I'm starting to feel lonely today.

352
00:29:33,103 --> 00:29:34,749
- No time to feel lonely.
- What?

353
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,869
Because what really matters is from hereon.

354
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:39,533
Here's a question.

355
00:29:40,603 --> 00:29:44,623
Is this incident really just a show?

356
00:29:46,203 --> 00:29:47,539
If it's not a show, then...

357
00:29:47,563 --> 00:29:49,729
All right! Let's eat before we continue!

358
00:29:49,753 --> 00:29:51,279
- Eat?
- Eat!

359
00:29:51,303 --> 00:29:53,199
- What's on the menu?
- Some frog dishes.

360
00:29:53,223 --> 00:29:55,889
- Move aside!
- Hurry up now. It'll get cold.

361
00:29:55,913 --> 00:29:57,839
Where did you get a frog? Is it a meal kit?

362
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,409
- Soo Min?
- Oh, I'm on a diet.

363
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:02,529
- Oh, a diet.
- Gosh, you still can't leave me behind. Wait up.

364
00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:04,353
Come on!

365
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:09,869
If you kill one person, it's a murder.

366
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:12,809
And if you kill 10 people, it's a serial murder.

367
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:18,233
But if that number goes up to a hundred or a thousand, it becomes a revolution.

368
00:30:19,593 --> 00:30:22,129
And all of you who gathered here today

369
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,283
must become the leaders of the said revolution.

370
00:30:26,643 --> 00:30:30,249
People don't remember trivial sacrifices.

371
00:30:30,273 --> 00:30:34,989
On that day, we'll imprint fear that...

372
00:30:35,013 --> 00:30:38,493
people will remember for a long time.

373
00:30:52,883 --> 00:30:55,643
I'm glad everyone is livelier than I expected.

374
00:30:57,163 --> 00:30:59,959
That's the charm of those guys.

375
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,989
But how did you know?

376
00:31:03,013 --> 00:31:07,023
That real terrorism will happen, not just a show.

377
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:15,809
Aigoo, CEO Seo!

378
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:18,273
I'm Senior Manager Park. Have you been well?

379
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:20,999
You're not CEO Seo Jae Hyeon.

380
00:31:21,023 --> 00:31:24,949
I'm sorry. I mistook you for someone else. I'm sorry.

381
00:31:24,973 --> 00:31:27,583
What a nutcase.

382
00:31:34,623 --> 00:31:38,329
<i>Yeah. It looks like he's going to do a really big show.</i>

383
00:31:38,353 --> 00:31:40,139
<i>He'll invite some singers, too.</i>

384
00:31:40,163 --> 00:31:42,723
<i>This is more or less a festival.</i>

385
00:31:44,213 --> 00:31:45,469
<i>But, you see,</i>

386
00:31:45,493 --> 00:31:49,309
I'm the only one Jeffrey invited to this show.

387
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:53,319
It seems he trusts me a lot for sure.

388
00:31:53,343 --> 00:31:58,609
<i>I mean, I do say what I need to say even next to Jeffrey.</i>

389
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:01,019
Jeffrey is suddenly hosting a show?

390
00:32:01,043 --> 00:32:02,919
I knew something was off.

391
00:32:02,943 --> 00:32:06,373
Because he'd never do something that wouldn't benefit him.

392
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:11,309
And when something like today happened, the puzzle came together.

393
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,939
Today's happening was a teaser

394
00:32:13,963 --> 00:32:16,313
and the main event is coming soon.

395
00:32:20,393 --> 00:32:22,169
What about you?

396
00:32:22,193 --> 00:32:26,193
Have you found the answer since that day?

397
00:32:32,363 --> 00:32:35,289
I started this work for my revenge.

398
00:32:35,313 --> 00:32:39,393
But I thought Ahjussi was doing this for the greater good.

399
00:32:40,463 --> 00:32:44,679
<i>Because that's the kind of person I thought he was since I was young.</i>

400
00:32:44,703 --> 00:32:46,733
<i>Like the absolute good.</i>

401
00:32:47,723 --> 00:32:54,243
So, I guess I couldn't accept that Ahjussi had committed corruption back then.

402
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:58,239
What about now?

403
00:32:58,263 --> 00:33:00,663
Have you accepted it a bit?

404
00:33:01,723 --> 00:33:06,423
It's more accurate to say I'm doing my best to look the other way.

405
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:10,019
Regardless of the motivation,

406
00:33:10,043 --> 00:33:14,203
we share the same goal according to you, Ha Ri.

411

If you really can't trust him,

412
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:45,569
just trust me for now.

I hope you'll take it as a symbol of the creation of our brotherhood, Jeong Gyu.

00:46:27,903 --> 00:46:29,739
There's a bomb-Wait, hold on!

524
00:46:29,763 --> 00:46:31,639
I'm serious! There's a bomb!

525
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:34,283
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

526
00:46:46,923 --> 00:46:50,299
Please don't run. It's okay.

527
00:46:50,323 --> 00:46:52,219
<i>He passed booths 4, 5, and 6.</i>

528
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:55,023
<i>Search each one. I'm on my way to the stage.</i>

529
00:47:09,783 --> 00:47:12,613
- Come on!
- Please remain calm!

530
00:47:32,253 --> 00:47:35,449
Don't run! Please don't run.

531
00:47:35,473 --> 00:47:37,929
Please exit carefully.

532
00:47:37,953 --> 00:47:41,843
Hey, get out of there! You should come out before the bomb explodes.

533
00:48:02,523 --> 00:48:04,283
I think I found it.

534
00:48:08,763 --> 00:48:10,079
You found it?

535
00:48:10,103 --> 00:48:11,639
Director Hwang, please take my place.

536
00:48:11,663 --> 00:48:12,839
Slowly! Slowly!

537
00:48:12,863 --> 00:48:15,323
How much time do we have?

538
00:48:17,913 --> 00:48:19,643
1 minute 30 seconds.

539
00:48:20,643 --> 00:48:23,529
What? Forget it. It's going to explode. Get out of there!

540
00:48:23,553 --> 00:48:25,123
Hold on! Hold on!

541
00:48:25,893 --> 00:48:27,899
I'm going to defuse it here.

542
00:48:27,923 --> 00:48:29,469
I'm starting.

543
00:48:29,493 --> 00:48:32,299
You think you got it? Do as you practiced. Don't be nervous, okay?

544
00:48:32,323 --> 00:48:35,189
- Okay.
<i>- You just have to cut the inner wire.</i>

545
00:48:35,213 --> 00:48:37,503
You see the red one? Just cut that!

546
00:48:39,073 --> 00:48:42,159
Byeong Min. There are two red wires.

547
00:48:42,183 --> 00:48:44,449
<i>Two? What shade of red?</i>

548
00:48:44,473 --> 00:48:48,639
It's like a... Fire-engine red and pillar-box red.

549
00:48:48,663 --> 00:48:51,279
What? F-f... Say it in Korean.

550
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,789
So, it's like... It's...

551
00:48:53,813 --> 00:48:57,309
The color of a firetruck and... What do you call it...

552
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:59,289
A mailbox! The color of a mailbox.

553
00:48:59,313 --> 00:49:03,259
Okay, got it! A mailbox and a firetruck?

554
00:49:03,283 --> 00:49:04,999
Mailbox! Cut the mailbox red!

555
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,433
Mailbox red? Okay!

556
00:49:11,943 --> 00:49:13,909
Wait.

557
00:49:13,933 --> 00:49:17,899
Im Byeong Min, are you taking a shot in the dark since it's not your life on the line?

558
00:49:17,923 --> 00:49:21,149
Just shut up and cut the mailbox red!

559
00:49:21,173 --> 00:49:22,863
Okay.

560
00:49:25,053 --> 00:49:27,019
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

561
00:49:27,043 --> 00:49:29,049
<i>No, wait. No...</i>

562
00:49:29,073 --> 00:49:32,559
<i>No, no, no, no!</i>

563
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:34,569
<i>No! It's the firetruck red!</i>

564
00:49:34,593 --> 00:49:36,843
<i>Cut the firetruck red!</i>

565
00:50:02,373 --> 00:50:03,843
Defused.

566
00:50:24,573 --> 00:50:28,529
Gosh, I should just go die for trusting you, Im Byeong Min!

567
00:50:28,553 --> 00:50:30,019
I'll see you when I get back.

568
00:50:30,043 --> 00:50:31,753
Kang Ha Ri?

569
00:50:33,893 --> 00:50:37,103
Oh, I think you got the wrong person.

570
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,853
Kang Ha Ri!

571
00:50:44,883 --> 00:50:49,689
You're under emergency arrest for attempted use of an explosive and attempted murder.

572
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,669
What?

573
00:50:51,693 --> 00:50:53,189
- Wait, under arrest?
- Yes.

574
00:50:53,213 --> 00:50:55,189
You can refuse to give unfavorable testimony.

575
00:50:55,213 --> 00:50:57,169
You have the right to an attorney.

576
00:50:57,193 --> 00:50:59,279
You can also request a trial for improper arrest.

577
00:50:59,303 --> 00:51:01,139
- Arrest him.
- Yes.

578
00:51:01,163 --> 00:51:03,103
Gosh, this is nuts.

579
00:51:04,963 --> 00:51:07,059
W-Wait a minute. L-Look here. Why?

580
00:51:07,083 --> 00:51:08,753
Over here!

581
00:51:12,293 --> 00:51:13,499
When's he coming out?

582
00:51:13,523 --> 00:51:14,963
Did you ask?

583
00:51:16,283 --> 00:51:17,849
How long do we have to wait?

584
00:51:17,873 --> 00:51:19,589
Please make sure you can get the whole view.

585
00:51:19,613 --> 00:51:23,963
I'm not the one who did it. I'm the one who stopped it! Do you understand?

586
00:51:25,643 --> 00:51:28,459
Prosecutor. Prosecutor!

587
00:51:28,483 --> 00:51:30,883
You're listening to me right now, right?

588
00:51:42,813 --> 00:51:44,889
If a delinquent who usually acts out finds

589
00:51:44,913 --> 00:51:47,639
the wallet that disappeared inside a classroom,

590
00:51:47,663 --> 00:51:51,039
do you know what the teacher and the other students think?

591
00:51:51,063 --> 00:51:52,779
"Isn't he the one who stole it?"

592
00:51:52,803 --> 00:51:55,869
"Gosh, is all the money there?"

593
00:51:55,893 --> 00:51:59,269
"That asshole's putting on a show after stealing it."

594
00:51:59,293 --> 00:52:01,183
That's how the world is.

595
00:52:05,773 --> 00:52:09,279
It doesn't matter what you did in this case.

596
00:52:09,303 --> 00:52:12,129
It matters what kind of an asshole you've been so far.

597
00:52:12,153 --> 00:52:14,609
My gosh.

598
00:52:14,633 --> 00:52:17,329
I really lived quite a diligent life.

599
00:52:17,353 --> 00:52:18,999
I paid all my taxes.

600
00:52:19,023 --> 00:52:22,909
Anyway! I really didn't do it this time!

601
00:52:22,933 --> 00:52:24,613
Really?

602
00:52:25,573 --> 00:52:27,369
What a shame, though.

603
00:52:27,393 --> 00:52:30,969
People don't believe in a branded evil person's good deed.

604
00:52:30,993 --> 00:52:34,279
Man, this is crazy. I'm going to lose it.

605
00:52:34,303 --> 00:52:35,993
Kang Ha Ri.

606
00:52:37,093 --> 00:52:39,233
Let's settle it this way.

607
00:52:41,913 --> 00:52:46,739
These guys are the protesters we arrested recently.

608
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:49,393
Let's have those punks be the culprits.

609
00:52:53,523 --> 00:52:57,149
You didn't really know much and just helped out a little.

610
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:58,713
How is it?

611
00:53:05,073 --> 00:53:06,573
Yes.

612
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:10,049
Of course.

613
00:53:10,073 --> 00:53:13,969
<i>If he takes the fall, he'd rot in prison for life. So he has to say okay.</i>

614
00:53:13,993 --> 00:53:16,163
I knew he'd do that.

615
00:53:17,163 --> 00:53:19,349
Great job, Prosecutor Han.

616
00:53:19,373 --> 00:53:21,573
I'll see you in person after the job is done.

617
00:53:22,553 --> 00:53:24,523
Yes, I understand.

618
00:53:35,553 --> 00:53:42,099
We'll say the protesters who failed the bombing took their own lives here.

619
00:53:42,123 --> 00:53:46,133
Leave evidence of joining the protest after holding a grudge over the layoff.

620
00:53:47,153 --> 00:53:48,893
Yes, I got it.

621
00:53:51,543 --> 00:53:55,223
It's really hard to become the revolutionist who changed the world.

622
00:53:57,143 --> 00:53:59,749
Since you failed the revolution,

623
00:53:59,773 --> 00:54:03,393
you'll have to find its main culprit and make them pay for the consequences.

624
00:54:09,693 --> 00:54:12,973
That will be the last opportunity left for you.

625
00:54:14,673 --> 00:54:21,563
I believe you know well I'm not as generous as you expect me to be.

626
00:54:23,783 --> 00:54:25,623
I'll keep it in mind.

627
00:54:29,383 --> 00:54:32,963
Sir, you should see this.

628
00:54:35,963 --> 00:54:38,279
Choi Sang Ho?

629
00:54:38,303 --> 00:54:39,809
What the hell is he up to?

630
00:54:39,833 --> 00:54:43,853
Because of this, Choi Sang Ho is already planning the press conference.

631
00:54:45,173 --> 00:54:48,493
He was the one who was acting so innocent.

632
00:55:04,423 --> 00:55:08,643
All the reporters have gathered.

633
00:56:12,293 --> 00:56:14,249
Hello.

634
00:56:14,273 --> 00:56:16,819
I'm Choi Sang Ho, the president.

635
00:56:16,843 --> 00:56:19,133
I'll start the interview.

636
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:30,629
- Kang Ha Ri!
- Kang Ha Ri!

637
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:34,173
Kang Ha Ri, do you admit to having attempted a terrorist act?

638
00:56:37,743 --> 00:56:38,849
Yes.

639
00:56:38,873 --> 00:56:43,093
Are you admitting to the claim from the video?

640
00:56:44,253 --> 00:56:47,063
Yes, that's correct.

641
00:56:50,763 --> 00:56:54,189
Find the original copy of that video.

642
00:56:54,213 --> 00:56:57,279
The one with the guy that gives the money.

643
00:56:57,303 --> 00:56:58,833
Yes, sir.

644
00:57:04,753 --> 00:57:06,753
CEO, we have a problem.

645
00:57:08,733 --> 00:57:10,069
According to the prosecution's investigation,

646
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:13,613
you even confessed who was behind you. Is that correct?

647
00:57:16,983 --> 00:57:18,149
That's correct.

648
00:57:18,173 --> 00:57:21,969
From when I was an assemblyman before the election,

649
00:57:21,993 --> 00:57:27,509
it's true I've been getting slash funds regularly under the name of campaign funds.

650
00:57:27,533 --> 00:57:32,809
As you saw in the video, I mostly received payments in cash,

651
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:37,289
delivered by a person from NQ.

652
00:57:37,313 --> 00:57:41,509
<i>President Choi Sang Ho admitted to obtaining illegal slash funds.</i>

653
00:57:41,533 --> 00:57:46,349
<i>From Branch Manager Jeffrey Jung of NQ Infracapital's Korean branch,</i>

654
00:57:46,373 --> 00:57:50,259
<i>ever since the President was an assemblyman from the time of election until now...</i>

655
00:57:50,283 --> 00:57:54,413
The one behind me is the one who has been with me for a long time,

656
00:57:55,413 --> 00:57:57,669
a CEO of NQ Infracapital...

657
00:57:57,693 --> 00:57:59,903
- Jeffrey...
- Jung.

00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:14,163
[Epilogue]

659
00:58:16,023 --> 00:58:18,093
Thank you for back then.

660
00:58:20,233 --> 00:58:21,809
That day...

661
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:23,413
Excuse me!

662
00:58:25,583 --> 00:58:27,069
Can we talk?

663
00:58:27,093 --> 00:58:29,373
<i>Because you held me back,</i>

664
00:58:33,173 --> 00:58:35,129
<i>- I beat up that bastard
- What's this?</i>

665
00:58:35,153 --> 00:58:39,039
<i>- What's this, I said!
- And got to relieve some of my anger.</i>

666
00:58:39,063 --> 00:58:42,933
If I didn't even get to do that, I would've been really

667
00:58:43,873 --> 00:58:46,599
frustrated, I think.

668
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:48,489
I'm glad.

669
00:58:48,513 --> 00:58:51,129
But that's the end.

670
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:55,053
I think I did well in stopping myself from crossing the line more.

671
00:58:56,553 --> 00:59:01,199
Are you saying that was enough for your revenge?

672
00:59:01,223 --> 00:59:03,039
Of course, it's not enough.

673
00:59:03,063 --> 00:59:05,239
Nor can it ever be enough.

674
00:59:05,263 --> 00:59:08,703
There's no such thing as a fulfilled revenge in the first place.

675
00:59:10,183 --> 00:59:15,549
It's agonizing to cling to something that won't ever be fulfilled in your life.

676
00:59:15,573 --> 00:59:18,579
I didn't finish my revenge.

677
00:59:18,603 --> 00:59:21,023
I only let go of my suffering.

678
00:59:22,713 --> 00:59:24,589
You're going?

679
00:59:24,613 --> 00:59:28,573
Yes. I need to go see my baby.

680
00:59:29,773 --> 00:59:32,299
You should also take care of your babies.

681
00:59:32,323 --> 00:59:34,899
They're such troublemakers.

682
00:59:34,923 --> 00:59:36,909
Hey, give me a hand here.

683
00:59:36,933 --> 00:59:40,359
- Gosh, you're such a handful.
- I hurt my hand.

684
00:59:40,383 --> 00:59:43,449
Is it delicious? Huh? Gosh, you're so gross.

685
00:59:43,473 --> 00:59:45,169
Gosh, you eat so f***ing much!

686
00:59:45,193 --> 00:59:46,949
It's delicious.

687
00:59:46,973 --> 00:59:49,259
Eat more. Eat up. Eat some kimchi, too.

688
00:59:49,283 --> 00:59:52,179
Here. Gosh, what a filthy asshole.

689
00:59:52,203 --> 00:59:55,709
Eat it all, okay? Must be nice to be full.
