00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,490
Yes, I got it.

176
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,450
There's no way, right?

177
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,780
That's why we decided to use his skepticism in reverse.

178
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,190
Meet me. I have a request for you.

179
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,940

00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,970
Let me have a word with you.

181
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,310
So his doubts can turn into convictions.

182
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:38,370
I'm sure he doubted us as scammers who fraud our business partners all day.

183
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,470
Because we directed his doubts to think that.

184
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,500
- Because he might have a different perspective. 
 - I sent it.

185
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,680
As a result, he was too concerned about a nonexistent scam

186
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,890
that he overlooked what happened in the process

187
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,550
Just like how you can't see the forest if you're too focused on a tree,

188
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,750
you'll easily miss a tree standing outside the forest

if you're too focused on the forest, on the other hand.

190

Gosh, would he have caught on by now?

191
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,450

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,420
Aigoo, you've got so much time, huh?

349
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,170
Hurry up and get off. What are you doing?

350
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,340
Just hurry up and get off. There's no time.

351
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,880
You get off, too, Mi Woo. Thanks for coming.

352
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,690
Hey, Director, I think I'll just go home.

353
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:40,790
What are you saying after coming all the way here?

354
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,020
This is just...

355
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:47,030
Hey, I heard the CEO say he'll get your contract wrapped up.

356
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:51,300
He said he'll get the contract canceled even though he invested in you, right?

357
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,500
The company is being so considerate toward you.

358
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,130
Shouldn't you also do your part for the company?

359
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:01,490
You'll really get the contract canceled, right?

360
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,980
Of course!

361
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,090
Hurry up.

362
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,110
Let's go.

363
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,670
Let's go.

364
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,940
Aigoo, I got it. Okay.

365
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,970
Aigoo, Chairman, thank you for waiting!

366
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,490
- I'm so sorry.
- What took you so long?

367
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,700
It took me some time to prepare the best for you.

368
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,420
These are the girls who will debut soon, as I mentioned.

369
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,410
Hey, I can just tell you're Chairman's type. Go sit next to him.

370
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:42,050
This one's our ace, Hyungnim!

371
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,560
- I haven't seen you in a long time.
- Long time no see, Hyungnim.

372
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,420
It was really hard to get the Chairman to come-

373
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,360
- One moment.
- Yes.

374
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:54,400
I'll take care of you separately, so don't worry.

375
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,800
Chairman!

376
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,660
The night is long, and we've got more than enough time.

377
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,390
Now, please have fun. I'll provide whatever you need.

378
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,890
- Sure.
- Sit down.

379
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,600
Chairman, please let me pour you a shot.

380
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,270
I'll pour you a strong one.

381
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,860
The girls are quite pretty today.

382
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,670
Yes, I worked hard to get them ready.

383
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,670
Hey, Mi Woo! That's right. It's bottoms up!

384
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,510
Yes, yes.

385
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,200
Of course.

386
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,240
No need to worry.

387
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,180
They're having a blast.

388
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,140
He'll probably sign the contract if we give it to him now.

389
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,980
Great.

390
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,240
Wrap things up properly.
[CEO Kim Yun Gi]

391
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,970
- You can do it, right?
- Of course, CEO Kim. Don't worry.

392
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,830
Okay, take care.

393
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,180
Oh, right, CEO Kim.

394
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,380
I was wondering could I take Mi Woo separately today?

395
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,550
You figure it out.

396
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,760
I got it. Please take care!

397
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,910
Okay, you were so full of fighting spirit today!

398
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,660
Take care of the Chairman. Hey, get the driver waiting at the lobby first!

399
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,630
Hey, here. This is your tip. Don't forget it.

400
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,590
Chairman, please get home safely!

401
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,010
Chairman, it's a passionate night!

402
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,320
Hey, take care of him properly to the end, you punk. You got that?

403
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,330
You're quite drunk, too, Mi Woo.

404
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,120
- I'll get going first.
- Mi Woo!

405
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,440
Let's just have one glass. Okay?

406
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,840
And let's relax and talk, too.

407
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,260
Yes.

408
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,160
You'll be leaving our company now.

409
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,700
You can call me "Oppa" and take it easy.

410
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,100
Don't you have a lot of worries these days?

411
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,760
Okay. Have a drink with this oppa.

412
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,260
You also need to talk about the contract cancellation with me.

413
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,830
Drink up! I won't eat you up.

414
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,990
Come on!

415
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,690
[Libra Restaurant]

416
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,220
According to our intel...

417
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,840
[Club Libido: Mirrorless Hotel, Seowoon Metropolitan City]
all kinds of hallucinogens and

418
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,110
drugs are being distributed with Club Libido at the center of it all.

419
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:56,070
And Lee Jin Soo, the club's operator and the director of KU Entertainment,

420
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,680
is at the center

421
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,750
KU... KU? Wait, isn't KU Entertainment

422
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,250
the major entertainment agency that has NTry?

423
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:07,790
How can such a big company fail to manage its employees?

424
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:10,600
Are they failing, or are they not doing it?

425
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,950
They probably aren't doing it.

426
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,100
That's what I also think, based on the circumstances.

427
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,130
However, we can't act solely based on the circumstances.

428
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,870
KU Entertainment is famous for having an insider

429
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:28,270
even at the police, on top of the political and the business sectors.

430
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,220
Your friends who were there with you just spoke up.

431
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,630
That you're mistaken, young lady.

432
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,550
Sorry?

433
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:37,870
From what I heard, you even have depression, right?

434
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,990
If you take a lot of medicine regularly, you can get confused and stuff.

435
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:45,520
Still, your company was so worried about you.

436
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,740
Go and talk it over with them.

437
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,370
So, if we move without caution,

438
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,970
they'll just cut their tail off.

439
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:58,280
- So what?
- We'll catch their tail before they cut it off.

440
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,900
So, the real body of this case can't escape.

441
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,520
Mi Woo, you had me worried.

442
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,970
How can you just act as you please?

443
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,030
CEO Kim.

444
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,040
Director Lee has a weird drug or something.

445
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:29,180
H-He used that drug that day, too.

446
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,560
I see.

447
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,560
Hey.

448
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,730
Do you think that drug

449
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,440
belongs to him?

450
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,650
You should be at the Olympics. Why did you come here?

451
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:25,160
Oh, yes. Well, I'm tired of working out now.

452
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,780
Oh, and I love dancing, too. Do you want to see?

453
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,170
Aigoo, but guards aren't allowed to dance!

454
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,510
I apologize.

455
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:41,780
Don't close your jacket. Your physique is...

456
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,210
- This is muscle, too?
- I-It's muscle.

457
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,090
My, your physique is really...

458
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,020
- out of this world.
- Y-Yes.

459
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,320
Yes, thank you.

460
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,000
All right. Are you good at keeping secrets?

461
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,170
- Oh, my hobby is
- Yes.

462
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:56,260
doing monastic silence at a temple stay.

463
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,150
- Really?
- Oh, yes. Of course.

464
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,390
Are you going to start working with me today?

465
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,000
- Well, of course. Yes.
- Huh?

466
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,820
- Today's our day one?
- Y-Yes.

467
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,760
Okay?

468
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,140
- Okay! Yes.
- Okay?

469
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,490
- Promise?
- Yes.

470
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,590
- It's a promise.
- I promise.

471
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:36,020
Your TPOs* are perfect today.
(Time, Place, Occasion)

472
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,950
This much is nothing.

473
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,840
Gosh, I'm perfect again today.

474
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,490
Let's switch roles, then.

475
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,490
There was no intel saying he likes men.

476
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,540
You never know. Since you're too perfect.

477
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,930
Aigoo, I'd like to decline respectfully.

478
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:55,270
All right. Don't get nervous, and stay calm now. Fighting.

479
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,380
No need to worry about me.

480
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,380
Hey, Newbie. The manager wants to see you.

481
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,980
Oh, I got it.

482
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,710
You, too, Ki Hwan.

483
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,520
Oppa, did you come alone?

484
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:12,510
Well, no. I came with a group.

485
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,650
Where are your friends? Where are they?

486
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,910
Well, I'm sure they're having fun here and there.

487
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,790
Then, bring all of them over, and let's party together.

488
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,070
Together?

489
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,890
Shall we? Really?

490
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,750
Let's meet at the bar on the second floor exactly in an hour. Okay?

491
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,100
Bye.

492
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,810
Have fun. Bye.

493
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:44,480
All right. Let's get this over with. I've got a lot to do today.

494
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:52,570
Okay. Confirmed location. The bar on the second floor.

495
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,750
Come on in, hon. Move these with them.

496
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,780
Oh, yes. O-One second, please.

497
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,520
What is it?

498
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,690
What the f*** is he doing?

499
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:41,180
What's this? Are you rebelling right now, honey?

500
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,570
Yes, hon. I'm rebelling right now.

501
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,330
Shall we practice as well?

502
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,630
- Shall we?
- Y-Yes.

503
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,300
- Me?
- Yes.

504
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,790
Yes.

505
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,810
Well, then. H-Here you go.

506
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,620
No, no. Your body.

507
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,340
- My body?
- Your body.

508
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,240
- My body... Like this, then?
- Oh, yes.

509
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,640
All right. Hold onto this part.

510
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,980
Oh, okay.

511
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,390
All right.

512
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,730
Aigoo, it's been too long. It's not working too well.

513
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:26,130
You're a bit too close- My goodness.

514
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,780
Wait, have you done this before?

515
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,330
Yes, a few times in the past.

516
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,910
A few times.

517
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,910
All right. There you go. Now, your legs...

518
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:39,340
- My legs? H-How should I...
- Yes, your legs.

519
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,170
- Like this?
- No, cross them.

520
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:44,440
- Cross them? Like this?
- Yes.

521

Y-You're doing it well.

What did you do before this, Director?

523
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,080
It's a secret.

524
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,360
- There.
- Aigoo, I can't move an inch.

525
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:58,010
My nickname used to be Spider-Man before.

526

Are you here alone?

No, with my friends.

Well, no. That's a bit of a stretch.
