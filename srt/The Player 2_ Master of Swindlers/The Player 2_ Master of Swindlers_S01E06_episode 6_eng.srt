8
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:58,590
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say right now.

9
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,090
Everything that is happening here is entirely true and

10
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,200
there's not a single lie in what I'm about to tell you.

11
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,530
If you don't bring

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,690
50 billion won by tonight, as we promised, we're all going to die.

13
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,270
All of us.

14
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,350
   

15
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,560
 It better be a good story. 

16
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,980
 Before I met you two, I lost a precious friend to Jeffrey Jeong. 

17
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,010
   

18
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,710
 Since then, there's a thought I can't seem to shake from my head. 

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,840
 How long has he been watching us? 

20
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,010
  
   

21
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,280
 I said I don't know anythingâ€” 

22
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,780
   

23
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,410
 Do you think you're being watched right now, too? 

24
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,800
 I'm just not sure if it's Jeffrey Jeong or someone else. 
    

25
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,910
 So? 

26
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,750
 What was the reason you dragged us out here? 

27
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,080
 Jeffrey Jeong is behind Mr. Myeong, who's our current target. 

28
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,210
 Before we work on Mr. Myeong, we first need to cover Jeffrey Jeong's eyes. 

29
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,830
 And his ears as well. 

30
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:04,420
 You're saying our plan can be leaked in advance. 

31
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,540
 Yes. 

32
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,540
 And you're telling us this right now becauseâ€” 

33
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,740
 It means Jeffrey Jeong isn't watching us yet. 

34
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,650
 I can't be too sure about it, but not anyone can have the President back them. 

35
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,960
 You want us to help without anyone knowing. 

36
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,570
 Yes. 

37
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,120
   

38
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,370
How may I help you?

39
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,710
- My daughter lives in Pyeongil Villa, right across the street. 
 - Okay.

40
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,940
I waited in front of her house because I couldn't reach her, for a few days now.

41
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,220
But there's no response.

42
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,760
I'm pretty sure she's inside, though.

43
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,460
Since when have you been unable to reach your daughter?

44
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,740
It's already been two days now.

45
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,880
- We'll come with you for now, then. 
 - Yes, thank you.

46
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,880
Her work called me, saying she didn't come to work.

47
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,380
She has never been like this before.

48
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,100
Her phone's been off the entire time, too.

49
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,470
Is her landlord also unreachable?

50
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,210
Yes, I can't reach them.

51
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,470
Is anyone there?

52
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,890
You're sure she's inside, right?

53
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,510
It's my daughter's first time living in Seoul.

54
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,650
She moved to Seoul for her job, so she doesn't really have any friends here.

55
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,890
And she'd never go somewhere without even telling me.

56
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,150
- Let's open the door. 
 - Yes.

57
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,250
   

58
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,640
   

59
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,100
- It's open now.
 - Thank you.

60
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,100
Min Jeong!

61
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,350
Min Jeong!

62
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,820
Excuse me!

63
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,800
You said you'll pay the overdue rent today!

64
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,860
Gosh, how many months has it been now?

65
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,370
Excuse me!

66
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,110
Min Jeong!

67
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,040
Min Jeong? Min Jeong!

68
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,450
What's his problem?

69
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,180
Aigoo, there's something wrong with this guy.

70
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,380
He should've let me know if he's going out, seriously.

71
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,060
Min Jeong! Min Jeong, wake up. Wake upâ€”

72
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,430
Help! Please help!

73
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,180
Min Jeong. Min Jeong!

74
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,410
What do I do?

75
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:13,720
 Mr. Han, known as Villa King for owning hundreds of villas, was found dead. 

76
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,210
 Though he owned hundreds of villas, 

77
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,610
 Mr. Han was residing at an old inn and 

78
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,550
 he seemed to have been seriously struggling financially. 

79
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,500
 It was confirmed Villa King owned more than 200 villas in Hyeongoong-dong alone. 

80
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,470
  He passed away, leaving behind only his
   

81
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,990
 welfare card confirming his fourth-degree intellectual disability. 

82
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,830
 Hyeongoong-dong's Villa King doesn't have any family members who can confirm his identity. 

83
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,020
 It was also found that he has no personal assets at all, 

84
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,760
 raising even more questions. 

85
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,570
   

86
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,780
Whoa.

87
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,600
   

88
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,300
- Eat up.
 - Enjoy your food.

89
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,430
I'm going to eat the noodles first.

90
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,460
   

91
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,270
I-It's Ha Ri.

92
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,520
I didn't even say a word.

93
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,650
Am I crazy? Why would I?

94
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,350
All right, then.

95
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,950
Ha Ri is calling right now when he has no idea we go around popular restaurants

96
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,620
every Friday without him out of pure coincidence?

97
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,880
Hey, just pick up your phone. Hurry.

98
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,140
If you're late, he'll get suspicious. Hurry up and answer.

99
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,020
- Hey, Ha Ri. 
 - I'm sorry to interrupt your Friday Popular Restaurant Visit,

100
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,090
but I think you have to come back quickly.

101
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,060
He found out.

102
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,770
- What? He found out? 
- Hey, Ha Ri. We didn't leave you out on purpose.

103
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,540
We were really going to tell you. I swearâ€”

104
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,190
 You said you don't want to bring me to restaurants because I'm picky. 

105
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,550
Aigoo, seriously. Who said such a thing?

106
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,880
- It's you.
 - It's you, right?
 -  It's fine. So forget it and come back quickly. 

107
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,170
-  We got a case.  
- Okay, a caseâ€”

108
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,380
My goodness.

109
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,680
I think he knows we left him out because he's a picky eater.

110
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,350
Hey, it's true, though.

111
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,780
He said blood sausages smell and chicken feet are gross.

112
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,570
And he said sweet and sour pork is too heavy!

113
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,370
There's a traitor among us for sure.

114
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,160
What the hell are you saying?

115
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,360
What? Did he tell us to come right now?

116
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,300
Yes, he said we got a case.

117
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,270
Is this our Last Supper or something?

118
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,050
Do I have to just go after only looking at it?

119
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,390
What's the case about?

120
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,950
I don't know, but he said it's a case that's on the news these days.

121
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,470
Forget it. Just eat. Let's finish eating and go.

122
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,530
Case. Are we the police? Why would we solve cases?

123
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,830
- Hurry up and eat.
 - We just need to eat quickly.

124
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,090
He hates the police so much, but why'd he talk about cases?

125
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,270
 She was told to come looking for him. 

126
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,200
 As a young adult who has only recently started working, 

127
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,740
 Oh Min Jeong didn't have any savings and 

128
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,140
 she couldn't reach out to her family for help. 

129
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,870
 In the end, her only option left was to 
  

130
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,840
 take her own life, so her family wouldn't be in trouble. 

131
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,920
- H-Hey, eat and go.
 - Huh? Where's he going?

132
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,670
- I want to eat, though. Eat up. 
-  Apologizing to her mother, 

133
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,750
 she told her mother to give up her inheritance in her letter. 

134
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,630
- We need to get going. 
-  Fortunately, Oh Min Jeong survived, 

135
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,600
- Boss, we'll take it to go!
  - thanks to her mother 

136
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,430
 who reported to the police she couldn't reach her daughter. 

137
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,570
 However, her mother is spending another anxious day next to 

138
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,890
 her unconcious daughter. 

139
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,910
 There's something I want to tell my daughter once she wakes up. 

140
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,010
 That it's not her fault. 

141
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,040
 That she didn't do anything wrong. 

142
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,050
 It's unfair. 

143
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,270
It's so unfair.

144
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,300
Why did my daughter have to resort to taking her own life?

145
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,600
Why is my daughter the only one suffering, not them?

146
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,720
 It's so unfair. 

147
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,880
The prosecution is watching in closely,

148
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,530
but we don't know how long it'll take to take care of this matter completely.

149
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,710
Yes, I'll contact Kang Ha Ri right now.

150
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,560
Tell him this.

151
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,390
Research every means and method that can be used quickly, without holding back.

152
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,640
Gosh, Prosecutor.

153
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,320
You know I only do what my clients ask for.

154
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,970
She asked me to tell her about a villa that's clean and safe.

155
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,180
So I only showed her the place, Prosecutor.

156
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,680
 - The room's so spacious. 
- Aigoo. 

157
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,190
 This would be one of the most spacious ones. 

158
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,720
 It sure is nice. 

159
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,170
 All right. The price for a new villa that's as spacious as this one... 

160
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,400
 I've never seen such a price. I swear. 

161
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,520
 On top of that, the bus stop is right across the street. 

162
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,680
 Right! The police station is right here, too. 

163
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,890
 This place was honestly built for women who live alone. 

164
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,110
 It's still a lot more expensive than I thought. 

165
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,530
 Come on now. No one does annual rent with their own money these days. 

166
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,630
 They all take out loans. 

167
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,800
This is nuts.

168
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,830
Did I put a knife to their throats?

169
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,660
They asked if I happened to know anyone,

170
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,980
so I introduced them out of the kindness of my heart.

171
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,300
Come one, Prosecutor.

172
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,410
Would I have given them the loans when the clients weren't eligible?

173
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,690
 Please put the amount written in numerals and in Korean. 
  

174
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,280
 Wow, you sure found a nice house under good terms. 

175
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,540
 Yes. 

176
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,150
 Lastly, please put your name down and your signature. 

177
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,030
 Congratulations! 

178
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,330
She was eligible.

179
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:47,260
All I did was give her the loan based on her eligibility.

180
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,630
I have no idea what I did wrong here.

181
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:02,370
Since there are people who have been hurt by this, it does upset me as well.

182
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:07,350
As soon as the victims signed the contract, you turned that building over to someone else, didn't you?

183
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,440
I'm into numerous businesses.

184
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,800
I often need cash urgently.

185
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,810
All of these are

186
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,960
properties you put on the market on the day of the contract signing.

187
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,890
Are you still going to tell me that it wasn't intentional?

188
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,050
I'm glad you brought this in.

189
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,690
Look at this, Prosecutor. This is how rough my life is.

190
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:43,440
Small business owners like me face crises at every moment of the day during the economic downturn.

191
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,980
If I don't survive this crisis, we all go down.

192
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:54,140
Prosecutor, all of these decisions were for business.

193
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,180
What part of any of this is illegal? Huh?

194
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,260
 The amount that's been reported at the Lease Fraud Support Center in Dokjin-dong 

195
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,760
 is close to several billion won. 

196
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,410
 - Since August of 2021 to March of 2022...  
 - Yes, Prosecutor.

197
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:37,950
  They've purchased 821 residences, resulting in 193 victims. 

198
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,420
 After the lease fraud incident from a month ago, this time it happened in Manhae-dong. 

199
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,550
 Lee in his 70s, so-called the Villa King of Manhae-dong, 

200
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:49,850
 was found dead by hanging on the mountain near his residence. 

201
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,190
 Mysterious deaths of Villa Kings in different areas have occurred. 

202
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:59,830
 It is predicted it will be more difficult for the lessees to get their deposits back. 

203
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,980
 However, as luck would have it,  

204
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,510
 - those who purchased villas with Lee's help...  
 - Hello?

205
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,080
 Madam, we're in big trouble! 

206
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,010
- What'sâ€”
  - Those bastards have been released again! 

207
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,880
Is that the car?

208
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,400
Stop! It's this car!

209
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,800
How could this happen?

210
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,780
How could you let those bastards go?

211
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,790
- Does this make sense?
 - Why did you do that?

212
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,300
Once I obtain additional evidence, I'll summon them back and press charges.

213
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,230
Prosecutor.

214
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,360
"I'm sorry, Mom."

215
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,500
"I'm so sorry."

216
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,800
"You used to show me off to others saying what a smart daughter I am."

217
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,020
   

218
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,610
"Mom...

219
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,900
If the immediate family members give up on the inheritance..."

220
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,880
Where are you going?

221
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,650
Prosecutor! Prosecutor!

222
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,680
Where do you think you're going?

223
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,340
There's a culprit for this recent Lease Fraud.

224
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,310
So called "Mr. Myeong."

225
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,850
 He's hiding deep underwater and is moving his minions. 

226
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,640
 So, it's not easy to find him. 

227
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,660
 We'll have to stir the water to bring him up to the surface. 

228
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,020
How did it go?

229
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,470
Mr. Choi is on the move, Prosecutor.

230
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,000
 Okay. 

231
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,800
Where is Team Leader Seon right now?

232
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,360
In a hotel near her lover's home.

233
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,970
 And the middleman? 

234
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,680
 He'll arrive at his office soon. 

235
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,450
Is Mr. Choi the only one who changed his route?

236
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,760
Yes, it's his first time going to Bujak-dong.

237
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,690
   

238
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,130
Mr. Myeong...

239
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,330
Perhaps I might get to see him today.

240
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,230
   

241
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,750
 I'm in. 

242
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,940
Now, now, now.

243
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,150
Aigoo, hello.

244
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,750
Detective Kim, how is it going?

245
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,960
Mr. Choi is inside the fishing hole.

246
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,840
Detective Kim?

247
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,390
Detective Kim.

248
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,970
Detective Kim!

249
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,930
Even I have a hard time meeting him in person.

250
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:28,070
Well, as you know... Mr. Myeong doesn't officially exist.

251
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:42,530
I mean, what is all this when we're supposed to be in business together?

252
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,030
Geez, I'd rather win over more contracts instead of doing this.

253
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,160
It's a lot of money. This is not kids' play.

254
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,940
I'm here to talk to Mr. Myeong. Do you get that?

255
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,480
There are lots of big fish here. Enjoy.

256
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,990
Geez, come on, Mr. Kim!

257
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,170
Prosecutor!

258
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,660
Congrats on winning the bathroom cleaning for three months!

259
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,540
That ahjeossi is unexpectedly bold.

260
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,670
He pops out and doesn't even look back.

261
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,650
- If it's unfair, we can play one more time. 
 - Come on. For what?

262
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,940
Four months of separating trash. How about it?

263
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,470
- And the game?
 - The first thing he says.

264
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,010
I'm sure he'd blow the fuse first.

265
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,740
"Where's my detective?" He'll ask that first.

266
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,860
 Him? He'd never ask about someone else. 

267
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,760
Where's my detective?

268
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,710
I'm sure he's taking a nap right now.

269
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,290
 He must be too exhausted to carry out his mission. 

270
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,670
 Just let him rest. 

271
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,910
Why is he sleeping with his eyes open?

272
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,880
It's okay.

273
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,560
Four months of separating trash. You won!

274
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:26,000
Wow, how did he not miss a beat and say, "Where's my detective?"

275
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,660
Prosecutor, did you plan it with her by chance?

276
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,640
I guess not.

277
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,190
Do you know why I left you alone to do whatever you wanted?

278
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,520
Because you know what we're doing is right.

279
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,880
No. Because you didn't cross the boundary into my arena.

280
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,400
You put up your own show in your front yard. But...

281
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,640
how dare you mess with a detective?

282
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,310
You guys...

283
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,000
totally crossed the line.

284
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,560
 Wow, I think our plan will get messed up. 

285
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,310
Hey, what do I do? The cops are coming in.

286
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,190
Let's talk about the details when we get back.

287
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,500
You should probably call your lawyer.

288
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,710
A good one at that.

289
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:21,340
Prosecutor. The real reason you're here...

290
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,820
is Mr. Myeong, right?

291
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,340
 Mr. Myeong isn't here right now. 

292
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,850
But Kang Ha Ri will find out soon enough.

293
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,460
Please answer it.
    

294
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,010
We're running out of time.

295
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,220
Don't you want to catch Mr. Myeong?

296
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,700
Prosecutor, I don't have time, so I'll say this once.

297
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,310
Withdraw the cops.

298
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,480
 You'd better take it easy, Kang Ha Ri. 

299
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,240
Even if you get us, you'd only fine us for obstruction of justice.

300
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,220
Yes. Yes, got it, sir.

301
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,140
Don't beg. Never.

302
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,670
The ones who want it more will have to suffer the loss.

303
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,120
Be sure to check thoroughly.

304
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,610
Do it yourself with your own eyes.

305
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,560
   

306
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,850
We have to catch a big fish if we've come this far, don't you think?

307
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,990
I'll put Mr. Myeong in your fish net today.

308
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,850
Prosecutor, don't you want to see him with your own eyes?

309
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,550
Today? If you're one minute too lateâ€”

310
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:56,820
It's on me. Do whatever you want to do to me.

311
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,120
You've seen what we're capable of.

312
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,300
We don't have time. Decide now.

313
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,720
Okay. Just today.

314
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,190
If you fail, you'd better be ready.

315
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,180
Okay.

316
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,060
 Stand down for now. Everyone, on stand-by. 

317
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,710
As expected of you, Prosecutor Kwak.

318
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,320
You're after Mr. Myeong, the one behind all this.

319
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,040
Geez, the Prosecutor has tons of informants.

320
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,450
I heard a lot of them are trashy news.

321
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:54,910
So, I heard the leader of the girl group Pleaz and some Kim guy are hot and heavy.

322
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,420
Nah. It's Song something.

323
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,660
Song something?

324
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,330
I say Kim something.

325
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,050
- Which is correct? 
- It's Song something, right?

326
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,300
- T-They're not together. 
- Isn't it Song something?

327
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,320
Ha Ri took off. We should go, too.

328
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,780
Welcome.

329
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,990
- Give me some cold medicine, please. 
 - Okay.

330
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:26,000
Looks like you have a bad cold. Give me a moment.

331
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,880
Excuse me.

332
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,170
Yes?

333
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,170
Please give me something strong.

334
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,690
Okay.

335
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,460
- Is he asleep? 
- He could still hear you.

336
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,380
In cold medicine, there's an ingredient called Diphenhydramine.

337
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,800
Diphenhydramine is also in the sleep aid you took.

338
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,690
If they run the test in three to four days after they find you,

339
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:44,340
they'll only find this Diphenhydramine.

340
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:49,110
People will have varying opinions on what you had eaten.

341
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,700
You've been suffering from heart disease

342
00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:01,840
and you fell asleep after taking this cold medicine and went to heaven comfortably.

343
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:10,160
And people will call you the Villa King of Mihang-dong.

344
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,100
I usually let guys take care of other things.

345
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,000
But I'm curious about the moment of death.

346
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:43,960
Please go to heaven.

347
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,830
I don't want to run into you in hell.

348
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,940
 Two years ago, there was a huge real estate fraud in the city of Gangha. 

349
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,610
 Over 50 billion won in damages and several hundred victims. 

350
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,200
 It was a massive fraud. 

351
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,940
They sold worthless land from the Green Belt for more than 10 times the market value.

352
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:15,690
They opened a professional real estate office, hired people and made those people buy the land.

353
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,850
Then they brought in family and relatives to sell the land, huh?

354
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:21,210
It's a typical pyramid scheme.

355
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,100
We were going to interrogate the real estate company CEO, but...

356
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,960
- He committed suicide? 
 - Similar method.

357
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,480
Right before the CEO killed himself, he sent exactly one text message.

358
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,150
 Mr. Myeong? 

359
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,400
   

360
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,690
You must've seen that name before elsewhere.

361
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,090
During the airport land designation in Haedok-do four years ago,

362
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:48,590
that name popped up as one of the companies to benefit from bad intel.

363
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,500
 Mr. Myeong. 
  

364
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,730
 His name appeared in the redevelopment fraud case in Seogui-dong from six years go.
  

365
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,280
 Under the name, "Jongno Mr. Myeong." 

366
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,000
It doesn't mean anything if you look at the cases separately.

367
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,110
But if you draw the picture using one line, you see Mr. Myeong, who's the architect of all this, right?

368
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,840
And this time, too.

369
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,570
 Prosecutor, we found this at the scene. 

370
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,170
   

371
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,950
   

372
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:47,080
Of course, it was a burner phone and it was impossible to trace him, right?

373
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,620
But...

374
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,280
how did you guys find out about this?

375
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,840
Who found out all this?

376
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,140
 Mr. Myeong. 

377
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,010
 Have you heard of him? 

378
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,430
 A hidden hand in the real estate market. 

379
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,060
 Why? 

380
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,860
 He's so filthy that he's pitch black. So, you can't see him. 

381
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,750
Ha Ri was already planning to approach Mr. Myeong.

382
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,560
So, what's Mr. Myeong's real name?

383
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,630
- Myeong Ji Hwan. 
 - Myeong Ji Hwan?

384
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,800
Myeong Ji Hwan?

385
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,310
Myeong Jeong Oh.

386
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,260
I said it's Myeong Jin Wu.

387
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,170
Myeong Won Seok.

388
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,020
What are you guys doing right now?

389
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,610
There are four more names Mr. Myeong uses.

390
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:33,400
So, no one knows his real name, huh?

391
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,720
 Are you saying you want to see us do a job? 

392
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,290
He said I should make sure and see it for myself.

393
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,430
I see.

394
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,410
Sure. Let's go then.

395
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,500
 Where is this place? 

396
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,750
Oh, this is Dojak-dong...

397
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,930
Sir.

398
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,800
This is also Mr. Myeong's next target area.

399
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,540
We've already laid the ground in this area to stay one step ahead of Mr. Myeong.

400
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:19,420
- "Laid the ground"?
  - We already committed fraud in this area. 

401
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:23,260
But you know, there's one strange thing.

402
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,550
This area, Dojak-dong. It's just too quiet.

403
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:30,100
I mean, if they pulled lease gigs around here as you say,

404
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,270
there should be reporters, prosecution by now.

405
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,930
I'm sure they would've jumped all over it after getting a whiff of it.

406
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:43,330
I've heard it all, but I've never been picked on for being a skilled conman.

407
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,650
Forget it. Let's end it here. Gosh, seriously.

408
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:51,240
Come on. That's why I want to see your skills, Mr. Kim.

409
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,300
 All righty, all righty. Then under the condition of meeting your boss, Mr. Myeong, in person. 

410
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,770
I'll show you one job. That works with you, right?

411
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,350
- Okay.
 - Suddenly?

412
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,290
- How could he do this so suddenly? 
 - Please get ready, Prosecutor.

413
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,230
 Please tell me if you need time to prep. 

414
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,300
No, no, what prep would I need for something I do every day?

415
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,380
I'll show you right away. Let's go.

416
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,730
Ta-da!

417
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:21,950
Today's concept is a building owner who hit the jackpot with coins.

418
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,450
You look like a thug from Arizona.

419
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,860
- An ahjeossi who cosplays a building owner? 
- You!

420
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,990
 Anyway, we have a newbie on our team. I wonder if he'd be any good. 

421
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,610
A newbie? 
   

422
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:38,200
I'll go inside this villa and show him the property.

423
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,630
Oh, my gosh! You made it!

424
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,110
You found this place okay, right?

425
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:50,370
Yes. It was straight away from the subway station.

426
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,520
That's right! They only call it the "subway station district" these days.

427
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,040
You still have to take a shuttle for 10 minutes to get to the subway station.

428
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,660
But this place is literally a "subway station district" for real.

429
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,550
That's why I asked you to find your way here instead of coming together.

430
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,610
Oh, I see.

431
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:09,720
Gosh, this is so funny!

432
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,470
I think your acting is a bit awkward.

433
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,650
You have to be more natural later.

434
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,730
This is a rehearsal, right?

435
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,390
I'm actually better at the real thing.

436
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,320
Newbie, go over there.

437
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,920
You can wait over there. Hurry up and go.

438
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,770
- Go right over there. 
 - Fighting!

439
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,680
Let's go.

440
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,110
It's open.

441
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,840
- Is anyone in here? 
 - Aigoo, CEO Im.

442
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,670
My gosh, Mr. Kim! Hello, Mr. Kim.

443
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,640
Aigoo, you're looking good.

444
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,990
You look the same, Mr. Kim.

445
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,740
Please share with me if anything good comes up.

446
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,120
Please look around.

447
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,400
- Okay.
 - Sure.

448
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,580
By chance, are you here to look at the property?

449
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,860
I know the owner here.

450
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:01,680
But still! You should consider owner-operated businesses like me who live off of the commissions.

451
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,470
If someone like you gets into local businessesâ€”

452
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:08,920
CEO Im, you know the building at the intersection is on the market, right?

453
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,650
Yes, that hospital building?

454
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,950
I'll tell them to call you.

455
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,690
My gosh! Okay.

456
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,990
Excuse me, CEO Im, are they providing the fridge?

457
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:19,790
- It's a full option. 
 - Aigoo, full option.

458
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:26,640
Okay. Please don't mind me and do what you need to do.

459
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,750
What do you think?

460
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,100
 It goes down nicely. 

461
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,550
 - Gosh, look at this... 
 - Looks like he'll sign right away, right?

462
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:39,790
 - But the tub in the bathroom...  
- Let's go to the bank.

463
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:43,010
 But you should look at the walk-in closet in there. 

464
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,100
   

465
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:50,320
I don't believe this place gives out personal loans.

466
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,330
You're right. It didn't before until we got here.

467
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:57,790
Whoa, did you do some magic or something?

468
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,130
- How did you know? 
- Pardon?

469
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:04,020
All the delinquent borrowers who were rejected by banks nationwide could get a loan here.

470
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,300
This is that bewitched Hogwarts.

471
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,630
Welcome, CEO.

472
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,260
Are you sure you've just entered the working world?

473
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,590
I'm a middle-aged career man.

474
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,350
- Shall we go? 
 - Let's go.

475
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,290
Middle-aged career man, fighting.

476
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,410
Doesn't the bank do it?

477
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,910
Gosh, I wanted to take care of this for you in private.

478
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,690
CEO Im.

479
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,640
Oh, my! Mr. Kim!

480
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,780
It's that same guy from earlier.

481
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,390
- Mr. Kim!
 - I run into you often.

482
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:52,740
Gosh, we must have a connection or something.

483
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,720
Didn't you follow me, CEO Im?

484
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,590
It must say so on my face.

485
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:01,080
That I like you. My gosh, whatever!

486
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,370
Get back to work.

487
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,270
- Please sit over here.
 - Okay.

488
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,340
Oh, you're buying a house.

489
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,960
Yes.

490
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:23,560
- Se Hui, take good care of him. 
 - Okay.

491
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,190
Everyone, stop!

492
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,170
Enough.

493
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:38,410
Oh, my! Sir, I was going to call you anyway.

494
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,870
 Aigoo, so scary. 

495
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,560
 Why are you walking so seriously? 

496
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,960
 - Looking cute.
 - Yup, respect. 

497
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,590
 Looks like you prepared a lot, but sorry. 

498
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,500
 I have to goâ€” 

499
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,140
They got us.

500
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,000
 Please put it over there. 

501
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,690
 Oppa. 

502
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:16,710
You've heard of the story of "The Emperor's New Clothes," right?

503
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:22,100
He's the only one who doesn't know he's naked and is humiliated in front of others.

504
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,240
An idiot.

505
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:29,250
It embarrassed me to watch you do that.

506
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:33,420
I had to hold myself back, so I could make sure of your group.

507
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:38,150
Well, this looks a little strange, huh?

508
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,740
I know.

509
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,810
Give me a chance to explain myself. Have a seat.

510
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:45,860
Come on now. There's no explanation needed amoungst players.

511
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:49,980
If you got caught, just shut it and leave the game.

512
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:56,020
No matter how amazing you guys are, Mr. Myeong is in control.

513
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:00,140
Mr. Myeong said to let you all go in one piece,

514
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:06,440
so be grateful, and don't ever show up around here. Got it?

515
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,630
 Move! Police. Move! 

516
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,940
Move, move. We're police. Step aside.

517
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,450
Gosh, why are there so many people in here?

518
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,310
You're under arrest for lease fraud.

519
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:25,190
- You have the right to remain silent... 
  - We have a newbie on our team. I wonder if he'll be any good. 

520
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,040
 You guys were all scammers? I just ought to! 

521
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,710
 Sit down. 

522
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:37,400
 Mr. Newbie, it's time to play your role. 

523
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,940
 - Come up and arrest us.  
- What do they take me for?

524
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:46,190
- Did you bring me a warrant? 
 - I don't need a warrant for an arrest at the scene.

525
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,430
I'll write you one on the way. Arrest him.

526
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,550
 Yes, sir. 

527
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,260
I'm a victim here.

528
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:59,240
All these guys are scammers. I had no idea.

529
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,450
 Yeah. Prosecutor Kwak will go in. 

530
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,550
 Okay. Prosecutor Kwak is in place. 

531
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,300
 Please reconsider. 

532
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,050
 It's too dangerous to bring Prosecutor Kwak into this. 

533
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:12,690
 I feel uneasy about having Mr. Choi take pictures of us, too. 

534
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:16,500
 The trust hinges on suspicion. He could trust us as much as his suspicion. 

535
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,310
 Kang Ha Ri's favorite motto! Okay! 

536
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:25,720
 Ha Ri, you know Prosecutors Jang and Kwak are different breeds. 

537
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,520
 This guy is a prosecutor down to his bones. 

538
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,790
 To catch Mr. Myeong, Prosecutor Kwak would make a deal with the devil in hell. 

539
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,130
 Really? 

540
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:38,210
 So, you admit you're a devil now. 

541
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,840
 It's too risky. 

542
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,150
 If Prosecutor Kwak doesn't follow our planâ€” 

543
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,550
 Should we make a bet? 

544
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:46,710
 Prosecutor Kwak will follow our plan. Yes or no. 

545
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:51,200
 Forget it. I'm not stupid enough to make a bet with a player. 

546
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,050
 Okay. 

547
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,290
Aren't you glad you didn't make a bet then?

548
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:00,620
I told you. I don't gamble against a player.

549
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,800
Geez, it's not gamble. It was just for fun.

550
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,120
Do you know what young people call it these days?

551
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,130
"We've kissed but are not in a relationship."

552
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:13,570
Wait... how c-could that be?

553
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,100
Yes, hello.

554
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,150
They were all arrested?

555
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,350
Interesting.

556
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:53,430
Even a prosecutor showed up to arrest them?

557
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:58,120
Seems like I've found a worthy opponent.

558
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:30,480
We have no more audience. Why don't we quit it?

559
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,440
I didn't even see a hair on Mr. Myeong's head today.

560
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,110
You should be accountable for that, Kang Ha Ri.

561
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,750
Think about why you've always been falling behind us.

562
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,580
- What?
 - Can't you be a little flexible?

563
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:47,910
You could only see what you couldn't see once you break out of the mold.

564
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,890
Break out of the mold?

565
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,260
Stop spewing nonsense.

566
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:57,150
What you've done wasn't "breaking the mold." It was breaking the law.

567
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,900
Excuse me, I'll set up another time for you.

568
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:04,100
Why don't you catch up then? Don't do this here.

569
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:10,100
Mr. Choi was staring at us as we were being arrested.

570
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,040
Thanks to you, Prosecutor, he'll think we're trustworthy.

571
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,170
I'm sure he'll contact us again.

572
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:18,900
What do you think? Can't you tell now that you've been working with us?

573
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,850
What we need to do is catch Mr. Myeong.

574
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:25,550
You had the victim's support, but you couldn't arrest Mr. Choi.

575
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,430
You let them go, so you could catch Mr. Myeong?

576
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:31,190
No. You had no choice but to release them. Why?

577
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:34,740
Because you had no evidence to prove the fraud.

578
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,370
So? I should break out of the mold like you?

579
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:45,310
By cooperating with criminals?

580
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,200
Geez. You know how you ask a question when you already know?

581
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,480
Is that inherent to prosecutors?

582
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:58,060
This isn't fun at all.

583
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,400
Oppa, why don't we stop?

584
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,810
Hey, Ha Ri. That guyâ€”

585
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:06,530
He's a prosecutor.

586
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:09,480
Prosecutor, Ha Ri, that jerk hasn't said one thing.

587
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,380
That asshole doesn't even pay us for gas. No monetary support for fuel.

588
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,610
   

589
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:25,790
What are you doing? Rather than just leaving like this,

590
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:29,150
wouldn't it look better if you came in briefly?

591
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:33,760
Oh! You've adjusted to this already.

592
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,360
Let us go.

593
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,610
- Do you feed us? 
 - He's going to feed us.

594
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,160
What?

595
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,380
   

596
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,480
Hello.

597
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,320
Hello, CEO.

598
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,970
You're looking good as usual.

599
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:03,470
Thank you. But you said you couldn't come in today.

600
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:08,130
Oh, I went hiking in the mountains and remembered something.

601
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:09,910
Get back to work.

602
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,250
   

603
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:31,400
   

604
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:41,700
 Kang Ha Ri is making his move again. 

605
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:31,470
Hello.

606
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:34,440
 We got the location, sir. 

607
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,870
Good job.

608
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:39,440
 I'll be in touch. 

609
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:56,910
   

610
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:59,230
Kim Su Chan... 
    

611
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:15,750
Mr. Choi, set up a meeting with Mr. Kim again.

612
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:18,890
Did we just have jjajangmyeon (black bean noodles) for dinner?

613
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:20,900
They won't order jjamppong (spicy Korean seafood noodle soup) because it costs 500 won more.

614
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,390
Is that their budget?

615
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:25,870
The newbie is playing a trick on us. It's a violation of human rights!

616
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:27,830
I didn't think Prosecutor would be like that.

617
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:31,050
Gosh, he knows how to hold a grudge.

618
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:32,960
Ha Ri.

619
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,100
   

620
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:48,970
Mr. Choi, does Mr. Myeong want to see me now?

621
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,200
They just left the police station.

622
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,460
Okay, got it.

623
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:03,850
 There's a reason why they picked the fishing hole as the meeting spot. 

624
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:07,770
 There are no CCTVs functioning properly in the 1km vicinity of the location. 

625
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:12,350
 The construction company went belly up during the redevelopment and has been neglected for years. 

626
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:36,040
We'll get to see Mr. Myeong tonight, won't we?

627
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,120
But that Prosecutor Kwak.

628
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,700
Will he continue to work with us?

629
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,770
I don't like it.

630
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:48,420
You know that guy? As a prosecutor...

631
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,430
I mean, why does he...

632
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:53,860
It's not like I'm his minionâ€”

633
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:57,780
 Prosecutor Kwak arrived. 

634
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,610
- You should say hi. 
 - Pardon?

635
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,830
Hello.

636
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,210
No one's here.

637
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:16,310
Yes, well... We all have our own role.

638
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:20,710
Then, I'll have to do my part.

639
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,500
Here.

640
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,430
Mr. Myeong?

641
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,510
Mr. Myeong?

642
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,140
What, Kang Ha Ri?

643
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,110
Geez.

644
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,600
Mr. Choi.

645
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,020
 You're playing around all day. What are you trying to pull? 

646
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:10,890
Tell Mr. Myeong to live a long healthy life.

647
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:13,290
Geez, damn it.

648
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:15,870
Wait a minute, Mr. Kim.

649
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:23,130
I want to tell you an interesting story.

650
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:29,890
It's a story of some prey who thought he was the hunter.

651
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,850
Do you remember Kim Su Chan?

652
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:39,930
Well, you know.
    

653
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,650
He's a new tenant who signed a contract with you.

654
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:47,040
Well, you know. He's a new tenant who signed a contract with you.

655
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,370
I didn't have him sign the contract with him like Mr. Myeong did.

656
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:54,420
Then, I'll tell you.

657
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:58,050
He signed a lease contract with you.

658
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,760
Two hundred fifty million won with a loan.

659
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:06,040
But on the day he signed the contract, you sold the place.

660
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,220
And?

661
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:10,190
Some people call this a fraud.

662
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:13,080
But actually, it's just business.

663
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,810
Right.

664
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,940
This isn't all that interesting.

665
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:22,180
Just go ahead and say what you really want to say.

666
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:28,220
Now is the moment I have to make a business decision.

667
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:31,120
Whether I will go along

668
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:35,140
with your game or not.

669
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:36,880
A decision?

670
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,770
What kind?

671
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:44,400
I'll soon ask Kim Su Chan.

672
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,820
Does he hate you enough to kill you for taking his money?

673
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:54,840
Or... perhaps you lied to approach me.

674
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:58,490
Who's Kim Su Chan? One of your actors?

675
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:00,110
Well...

676
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,190
- I don't know, either.
 - What?

677
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:05,770
 - Hey.
 - What is it? 

678
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:08,980
 I could make something like this myself. 

679
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:11,850
 I just put one together because I was bored. 

680
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:13,430
   

681
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:15,300
 Kim Su Chan. 

682
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,370
 Who's Kim Su Chan? 

683
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:21,060
 Well, the paperwork looks perfect. 

684
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:26,210
 Is there anything not perfect about me? 

685
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:31,300
 I'm just saying you could get by. So annoying. 

686
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:35,120
 I have a more perfect face than you. 

687
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,920
 I know. 

688
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,500
 Thank you. 

689
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:42,580
 I'm glad you know. 

690
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:46,420
- A fake?
 - One hundred percent.

691
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,210
   

692
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:57,710
- Yes, Prosecutor.
- I'll send you a lease contract.

693
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:59,620
Find out who the signee is immediately.

694
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,830
Yes, got it.

695
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:03,720
   

696
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,380
   

697
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,340
   

698
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:16,090
The fact that Mr. Myeong is suspicious of Kim Su Chan

699
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:19,040
means our plan has been exposed.

700
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:30,130
 Mr. Jang and mysterious men are approaching the fishing hole. 

701
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,760
Something's going down.

702
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,110
You must've found Mr. Kim Su Chan.

703
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:54,070
Yes, hello.

704
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,250
 How much longer? 

705
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:59,410
I'm right there.

706
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,360
Kim Su Chan will arrive soon.

707
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,580
I'll give you one last chance.

708
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:10,020
Why did you approach me?

709
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,080
Are you threatening me?

710
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:15,840
Business people meet to make money. What else would it be?

711
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,590
 Kang Ha Ri, abort operation. Leave now. 

712
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:18,890
I'm coming in.

713
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:21,230
Ha Ri didn't say to stop.

714
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:24,350
That means the game isn't over yet.

715
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:27,500
- What?
 - So...

716
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:32,000
Ha Ri wouldn't let it get out of hand this way.

717
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,340
I get that you guys trust Kang Ha Ri,

718
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:37,150
but he's not some god.

719
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:39,770
Well, we do trust Ha Ri, but...

720
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:44,240
we wouldn't let him go down like that.

721
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,040
 Prosecutor, are we going in? 

722
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:00,120
Mr. Jang, here you are.

723
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:07,360
Will you put me to sleep with that thing and fake a suicide again?

724
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,920
You have no creativity.

725
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,820
Geez, he has no fear.

726
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,650
Are you alone?

727
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:16,320
Of course, I'm alone. Would there be two of us?

728
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,310
All right.

729
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:25,050
We don't have much time left.

730
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:32,340
Mr. Myeong, you should say hi.

731
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,620
Glad to meet you.

732
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:52,140
   

733
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:59,610
 Recent polls show a vast gap between 

734
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:01,510
 candidate Choi Sang Ho and the runner-up. 

735
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:04,560
 Public opinions seems to settle on candidate Choi Sang Ho.
  

736
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:09,720
 Currently, whether candidate Choi Sang Ho would garner the majority of the votes or notâ€” 
  

737
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:11,970
 Hello? 

738
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:13,300
 Where are you? 

739
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:16,510
Hi, Babe. I'm almost there. Sorry.

740
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:18,880
We haven't been on a date in forever. How can you be late?

741
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,460
You'll be in big trouble.

742
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:26,140
Gosh, I'm looking forward to it since Jung Su Min is going to scold me.

743
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,040
Hurry up. I'm starving.

744
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,800
All right. I'll be right there.

745
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:33,260
Okay.

746
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,500
Why isn't he here yet?

747
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:59,290
   

748
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,000
S-Su Min...

749
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,800
Su Min...

750
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:19,730
   

751
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:23,900
   

752
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:29,500
â™«  Almost frantically. Going mad, shocked me again  â™«

753
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:36,600
â™«  I stagger, I can kind of see it now. I tricked you, fell in again  â™«

754
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:45,780
â™«  Respected like a giant. Blood is flowing fast  â™«

755
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:50,700
â™«  When you find the perfect next move  â™«

756
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,960
 I'll speak to Mr. Myeong directly now. 

757
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,250
 This time, you'll need to come with me. 

758
01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:00,420
 A combined worth of about 50 billion won. 

759
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:04,700
 Kang Ha Ri took money from the victims for real! 

760
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,800
 You're under arrest for lease fraud. 

761
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,110
 The real hell begins. You know that? 

762
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:11,070
 I gave Kim Su Chan a gun. 

763
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:12,610
 A gun! 

764
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:14,450
 It's him. 

765
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:17,680
 If you don't keep your promise, we're all going to die. 

766
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,790
â™«  I stagger, I can kind of see it now. I tricked you, fell in again  â™«

767
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:25,080
â™«  I can't help but be surprised  â™«
