1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,380
   

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,780
   

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,580
   

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,780
   

5
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,880
   

6
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,060
   

7
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,550
CEO Kang Do Yeong!

8
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,400
- Who are you? 
- I would like to have a word with you.

9
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,500
Please. Let's hear it.

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,260
I would like to talk to you alone if I can.

11
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,820
Well, I can't help it if you're scared.

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,090
Oh, how exciting.

13
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:19,340


14
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,880
How great of a confession are you trying to make? 
    

15
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,530
It's not a confession.

16
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,210
I didn't want to embarrass you in front of your subordinates.

17
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,140
You see, I'm quite considerate.

18
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,190
Oh, so who's this icon of consideration we've got here?

19
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,800
Trespassing into my place of business so inconsiderately.

20
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,280
I came to rip you off.

21
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,210
Whoa, I'm usually the one to rip off others, not get ripped off.

22
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,010
You should still be grateful since I won't rip you off for free.

23
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,920
What did you bring to be this confident?

24
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,600
It's information. The information given to you to deceive you.

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,370
 Oh, I'll be deceived? By whom? 

26
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,260
 The fellas you're about to meet, CEO Kang. 

27
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,960
Aigoo, my hoobaenim.

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,980
 Those guys are the lowest of the low. 

29
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,990
But CEO. I'm thinking about wrapping up such minor jobs...

30
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,690
 They'll probably leak information about the scheme they're plotting. 

31
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,170
...and running a major NFT business like you, CEO Kang.

32
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,310
Oh, really?

33
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,550
 And the moment you show interest, they'll lunge! 

34
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,430
How about we show the CEO?

35
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,300
Okay, I sent it to you.

36
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,180
 They'll get you to come in on a scam, but you'll be the one getting scammed. 

37
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,820
- Whoa, this is nice. 
-  Those punks are famous for backstabbing their business partners. 

38
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,790
Oh, by the way,

39
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:48,210
how am I supposed to trust your words, and how are you aware of these things?

40
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,250
Those guys tried to scam me at first.

41
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,540
But as you can see, I'm not an easy prey.

42
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,450
So, they went to find easy prey.

43
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,390
And this is proof they approached me first.

44
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,470
  
   

45
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,600
Can I hold you to what you just said?

46
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,430
Of course.

47
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,450
I'll even bet my life.

48
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,870
   

49
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,450
How disappointing.

50
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,000
I thought I'd be more valuable to you than this.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,410
Was I just bait to you?

52
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,290
Don't be too disappointed.

53
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,550
I'll sell you off for a really high price.

54
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,730
CEO Kang, you heard him, right? Be generous with the price.

55
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,500
Of course. I'm a businessman.

56
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,370
I'm against calling ridiculous prices.

57
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,370
How nice. I didn't know you were an actual businessman.

58
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,050
Wait, CEO— I mean, Seonbaenim.

59
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,900
Don't be fooled by this woman.

60
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,050
You can't trust this woman!

61
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,350
Thanks for the advice. I'll heed your advice after you pass on.

62
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,400
I'll consider it my hoobaenim's dying wish.

63
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,370
- S-Seonbaenim.
 - Jeong Gyu.

64
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,950
- When are they coming? 
 - It's about time.

65
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,670
Where the hell are they?

66
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,420
How the hell do I know?

67
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,080
   

68
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,010
I'll be going now. I'll see you after we figure out a price.

69
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,500
Hold on, now!

70
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,820
Where are you going?

71
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,670
You need to finish the job yourself.

72
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,380
Hurry up.

73
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,450
You were full of spirit up until now.

74
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,820
You need to see the end.

75
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,170
W-W-Wait...

76
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,650
Wait. E-Excuse me, Ma'am.

77
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,810
Excuse me. Wait, Ma'am—

78
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:33,280
Come on! We're all busy people!

79
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,400
Gosh, the more you hesitate, the less I trust you.

80
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,430
Do it now!

81
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,870
Whoa, you're just as cool as I thought you were!

82
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,290
You've got the vibe!

83
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,210
Shit!

84
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,500
Hey, what took you so long? Shit.

85
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,360
Sorry. I had to get rid of this guy.

86
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,280
Seriously.

87
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,910
 Hey. 

88
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,340
 Can we talk? 

89
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,890
Gosh, hey! Hurry—

90
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,370
Ha Ri, you're not dead, you idiot!

91
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,820
You weren't trying to kill me for real, right?

92
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,170
Take care.

93
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,620
Hey, Ahjumma! Untie me, Ahjumma.

94
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,650
Hey, Ha Ri! Hurry up and untie me, Ha Ri.

95
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,770
- You do it now.
 - Hey, you bastard!

96
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,970
Gosh, they're such a waste of money. Take them down.

97
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,470
Hey, Jin Woong!

98
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,410
C-Come here and untie me. My hands are...

99
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,530
Who are you?

100
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,300
Who are you?

101
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,440
Why the fuck are you taking it out on me?

102
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,940
As I thought, bastards like you don't even think about what you did.

103
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,510
I scammed you, didn't I?

104
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,080
Hey, did I threaten you to give me your money?

105
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,480
It was because you were blinded by money, you moron!

106
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,110
Go on now. Say one more word!

107
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,580
- Stop it!
 - Stay there before I kill you, too.

108
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,100
If you kill him like this, what will you have left?

109
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,050
If you shoot him now, that's it.

110
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,560
He'll be getting an easy death. Do you get it?

111
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,370
If there's God, at least he'll go to hell after death.

112
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,440
I would love too kill him too.

113
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,540
But there's no need to get blood on your hands.

114
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,810
Sin Wu Yeong, just think about your child. Okay?

115
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,370
Sin Wu Yeong. No, stop it.

116
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,220
Sin Wu Yeong!

117
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,680
- Hurry up!
 - Wait.

118
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,360
- H-Hey, it's the police.
 - I said I'm on it.

119
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,380
- Hurry up and untie it—
 - It got more tangled.

120
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,450
H-Help. H-Help me.

121
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,540
- Put the gun down. 
 - Gun down!

122
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,120
Take him out.

123
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,580
Okay.

124
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,120
Come on.

125
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,310
Hi, go home.

126
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,120
Go home, go home.

127
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,100
- Thanks. 
- Okay.

128
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,380
Thanks. Thanks for your hard work.

129
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,000
- Next round is on me. 
- Okay, take care.

130
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
Oh, friend.

131
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,340
Oh, yes.

132
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,850
Please rot in there for good.

133
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,710
I told them a few good things about you guys.

134
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,630
- Hey, hey!
 - Go, go. Calm down.

135
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,590
What are you going to do now?

136
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,930
I couldn't get my revenge and I ended up in this state!

137
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,260
So why would you come after us?

138
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,290
My goodness.

139
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,380
You called him over, right, Cha Jae Yi?

140
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,910
Jae Yi isn't here. Did the heat get to your head?

141
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,290
Is that so?

142
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,750
Hey, Jae Yi!

143
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,100
 Hey, it's fine. Get in. 

144
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,590
- Jae Yi!
 - Jae Yi, you little—

145
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,270
Man, Jae Yi is a rude brat, but she gets the job done right.

146
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,700
Here are the keys.

147
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,250
Hey, Jae Yi, how are you so good at these things?

148
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,080
Did you get trained as a kid or something?

149
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,890
You know, like Black Widow and stuff.

150
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,360
Hey, nerd. Shut up.

151
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,020
Shut up? Shut up?

152
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,710
Hey, pull over right now. Pull over!

153
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:34,560
All right, turning left. Everyone, hold on tight.

154
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,170
   

155
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,180
It's too hot.

156
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,670
Hey, it was so close.

157
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,790
Where are you going?

158
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,190
Are you going to cause another scene with your gun?

159
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,030
That's my business.

160
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,780
Gosh, all right. Stop it now, okay? It's all done.

161
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,880
- What are you saying is done— 
- Enough. Is it still not done?

162
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,120
Hey, stop asking me. It's too damn hot.

163
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,620
I'll get it done if you just let me.

164
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,490
- Jin Woong!
 - Yes.

165
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,980
Shall we see?

166
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,340
Okay. Great.

167
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,720
   

168
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,980
It's his money. The money Kang Do Yeong got from scamming people.

169
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,750
The money he scammed?

170
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,480
 What's the plan? 

171
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,070
He scammed the money, so we scammed it from him.

172
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,160
The method is actually quite simple.

173
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,020
Install malware in his digital wallet to let us hack it.

174
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,150
In the cryptocurrency field, this is called crypto-jacking.

175
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,980
It's as common as the rug-pulling he's been doing.

176
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,770
But the problem is he's too skeptical to let such a simple method work on him.

177
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,790
 Look into who he is. 

178
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,490
 Yes, understood. 

179
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,450
There's no way, right?

180
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,780
That's why we decided to use his skepticism in reverse.

181
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,190
 Meet me. I have a request for you. 

182
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:25,940
 Make him doubt us until the moment he comes to see us. 

183
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,970
 I would like to have a word with you. 

184
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,310
 So his doubts can turn into convictions.   

185
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:42,370
I'm sure he doubted us as scammers who defraud our business partners all day.

186
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,470
Because we directed his doubts to think that.

187
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,500
 - He may have another level of discernment. 
 - Okay, I sent it to you. 

188
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,680
As a result, he was so concerned about a nonexistent scam

189
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,890
that he overlooked what happened in the process

190
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,550
Just like how you can't see the forest if you're too focused on a tree,

191
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,750
you'll easily miss a tree standing outside the forest

192
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,380
if you're too focused on the forest.

193
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,070
Gosh, would he have caught on by now?

194
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,450
His face would be quite the sight, right?

195
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,470
   
  

196
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,650
Where is it?

197
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,600
Why isn't it here? Why? 
   

198
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:27,060
 Then I'll connect directly to your e-wallet right now, CEO. 

199
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,090
It's those assholes.

200
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,190
Those sons of bitches.

201
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,970
You fucking sons of bitches!

202
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,720
   

203
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,980
Kang Do Yeong speaking.

204
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,130
Say something if you called!

205
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,710
 It's me. 

206
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,460
 Yes, CEO, I apologize. I was too worked up. 

207
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,260
There must've been a small misunderstanding.

208
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,340
I'll restore the money in no time.

209
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,870
 There's no need to get it back. 

210
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,960
 I'm done with you... 

211
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,150
 as of today. 

212
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,410
What do you mean?

213
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,880
 Yes, the job is done. 

214
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,400
What's your plan now?

215
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,580
Well, I'll have to think about it.

216
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,600
Sure. It's still dangerous here, so don't cause any more problems.

217
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,270
Be careful and gentle.

218
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,920
Understand?

219
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,370
There you go! It's nice to see you smile like that.

220
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,950
And I'll give you your money back, along with the mercenary service payment.

221
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,240
It's fine. I was never hired by you guys, either.

222
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,220
And I've got nothing to get back from you guys.

223
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,820
I don't want to get involved with you guys, either.

224
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,840
That's supposed to be my line. Seriously.

225
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,970
I'm going.

226
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,500
Okay.

227
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,840
Did he leave without a fight?

228
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,680
I'm really worried he might get into trouble again.

229
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,770
But right now, let's worry about ourselves first.

230
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,700
You're right. It's not the time to worry about someone else.

231
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,300
We need to worry about ourselves.

232
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,720
You're right. We're runaways here as well.

233
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,630
For now, go take a break at a remote place, so you don't get caught.

234
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,200
Jae Yi, I'll leave them in your hands. I'll call.

235
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,780
What about you? Where are you going?

236
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,570
- A date. 
- Hey!

237
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,390
You're going to meet that woman, right? Hey, who is that woman?

238
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,800
Who— Forget it, man.

239
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,240
- W-Woman?
 - Who is it?

240
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,850
Hey, start the car. Let's get going.

241
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,330
I'm jealous.

242
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,110
I just might start to like you, seeing you so often.

243
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,410
I don't even see my girlfriend this often.

244
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,720
You don't have one.

245
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,190
I never said I don't have one.

246
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,080
I know you don't, even if you didn't say so.

247
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,660
To be honest, I know quite well about you, Kang Ha Ri.

248
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,560
You said you've got no interest in me.

249
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,820
Gosh, excuse me. It's so hot.

250
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,790
You're close with Prosecutor Jang In Gyu, right?

251
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,120
 I'm Prosecutor Jang In Gyu, the special counsel at the Seowoon District Prosecutors' Office. 

252
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,870
 Your job is to put away those heinous criminals. 

253
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:23,530
I'd like you to do what you did with him with me as well.

254
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,410
Even if I feign ignorance here, it seems you know everything already.

255
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,160
There would be no use in acting.

256
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,790
I'll just give you the simple answer.

257
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,550
I refuse.

258
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,430
I'm sure my offer wouldn't sound so bad.

259
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,680
   

260
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,740
- Hey.
 - Oh, daebak.

261
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,270
Hey, Ha Ri. What's going on right now?

262
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,010
All of our criminal history and wanted records were erased.

263
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,730
Is that so? Are you sure?

264
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,270
 It's true! 

265
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,300
All right. Let's save the details for later.

266
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,110
I had them removed temporarily.

267
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:11,370
See? I told you it wouldn't be too bad.

268
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,640
I finally understand.

269
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,330
I was wondering what you wanted from us.

270
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,640
You wanted us as a whole?

271
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,330
Just one year.

272
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,480
If you'll work with me for one year,

273
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,710
I'll have your records erased permanently.

274
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:37,530
Of course, the money gained from taking care of the trash is yours, too.

275
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:42,570
How about it? I'm pretty sure the conditions are way better than before.

276
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,460
 I love Korea so much now! I'm never leaving again. 

277
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,580
By the way, Ha Ri, is it really okay to work with that woman?

278
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,250
You're sure we were cleared, right?

279
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,180
Aigoo, don't worry. Have faith in me. Okay?

280
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,320
Over here! Look over here.

281
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,680
Right here! N-No, it's over here!

282
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,210
Hey, it's Jeong Su Min!

283
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,030
J-Jeong Su Min sent me here.

284
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,800
Yes.

285
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,600
Aigoo, nice to meet you.

286
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,440
Aigoo, look at your luggage. They must be heavy.

287
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,020
What's with this?

288
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,300
Aigoo, it must be heavy. Let me carry it for you.

289
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,160
My back isn't so good. All right, let's go.

290
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,810
This way. Come with me.

291
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,600
What are you doing? Hurry up and come.

292
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,680
- H-Hey, hey. 
 - What?

293
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,100
Man, he's got the face of a scammer.

294
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,560
- Stack them up nice and neat. 
- Yes.

295
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,010
Aigoo, great job. You're a great worker.

296
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,210
Hey. Give me the key.

297
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,450
I'm also a great driver.

298
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,500
I got it, so give it to me.

299
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,140
You sure love to drive.

300
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,600
I typed in the address, so please follow the GPS.

301
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,350
I get very carsick on unpaved roads.

302
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,000
Oh, right.

303
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,890
Be gentle.

304
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,880
   

305
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:39,240
Hey, what's this place for?

306
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,940
It looks like a restaurant.

307
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,750
It's a hideout. It's where you'll be staying from now on. Come.

308
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,280
All right.

309
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,000
I've met you before.

310
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,550
I've met you before, but you look different.

311
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,060
And you're pretty.

312
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,300
- You look prettier in person— 
- Is she calling me pretty?

313
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,150
We meet again. We might start liking each other.

314
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:21,570
Well, I think I already do. Dislike also has the word "like" in it.

315
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,440
What's there to dislike? I even got you a pretty house like this.

316
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,230
All right, now. Please come with me.

317
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,040
All right. Please come.

318
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,910
Why are you carrying them when there are wheels?

319
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,280
Oh, right, wheels.

320
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,080
Hey, did she say I looked pretty earlier?

321
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,800
Wow. Shit.

322
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,450
Whoa, 4090T! Daebak!

323
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,860
I'll need to do some mining.

324
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,370
Whoa, I love this.

325
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,670
Hey, this is delicious!

326
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,460
Bring me a glass of something cold, please.

327
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,710
- Director Hwang?
 - Yes.

328
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,450
- Iced, please.
 - Yes.

329
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,070
Here you go.

330
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:41,910
You're fast. Thank you.

331
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,270
Whoa, is a place like this rented monthly or annually?

332
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,470
Hey, they obviously own the place.

333
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,180
It's semi-annual.

334
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,670
Semi-annual? Man, that's nice.

335
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,470
I'm glad you like it.

336
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,390
If you have any issues here, you can tell Director Hwang here.

337
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,310
Sorry? I never heard about this.

338
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,690
Oh, I think I did.

339
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,940
Yes, you can tell me.

340
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,700
What's the job? What's the first job we're to take while we're here?

341
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,010
I like how enthusiastic you are,

342
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,980
but you can take the day off today.

343
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,550
You're all tired, right?

344
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,260
Rest and start work tomorrow.

345
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,780
Do we get free meals?

346
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,730
Hey, Oppa!

347
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:59,030
How is it? Do you think it's all right?

348
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,800
Yes, I like the place.

349
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,030
Get some rest. You must be tired.

350
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,560
Yes. You, too.

351
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,420
Aigoo, you've got so much time, huh?

352
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,170
Hurry up and get out. What are you doing?

353
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:35,340
Just hurry up and get out. There's no time.

354
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,880
You get out, too, Mi Wu. Thanks for coming.

355
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,690
Hey, Director, I think I'll just go home.

356
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,790
What are you saying after coming all the way here?

357
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,020
This is just...

358
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:51,030
Hey, I heard the CEO say he'll get your contract wrapped up.

359
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:55,300
He said he'll get the contract canceled even though he invested in you, right?

360
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,500
The company is being so considerate toward you.

361
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,130
Shouldn't you also do your part for the company?

362
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,490
You'll really get the contract canceled, right?

363
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:07,980
Of course!

364
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,090
Hurry up.

365
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,110
Let's go.

366
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,670
Let's go.

367
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,940
Aigoo, I got it. Okay.

368
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,970
Aigoo, Chairman, thank you for waiting!

369
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,490
- I'm so sorry.
 - What took you so long?

370
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,700
It took me some time to prepare the best for you.

371
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,420
These are the girls who will debut soon, as I mentioned.

372
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,410
Hey, I can just tell you're Chairman's type. Go sit next to him.

373
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:46,050
This one's our ace, Hyeongnim!

374
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,560
- I haven't seen you in a long time.
 - Long time no see, Hyeongnim.

375
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,420
It was really hard to get the chairman to come—

376
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,460
- One moment.
 - Yes.

377
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:58,300
I'll take care of you separately, so don't worry.

378
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,800
Chairman!

379
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,560
The night is long, and we've got more than enough time.

380
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,390
Now, please have fun. I'll provide whatever you need.

381
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,790
- Sure.
 - Sit down.

382
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,600
Chairman, please let me pour you a shot.

383
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,170
I'll pour you a strong one.

384
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,860
The girls are quite pretty today.

385
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,670
Yes, I worked hard to get them ready.

386
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:44,670
Hey, Mi Wu! That's right. It's bottoms up!

387
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,510
Yes, yes.

388
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,200
Of course.

389
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,240
No need to worry.

390
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,180
They're having a blast.

391
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,140
He'll probably sign the contract if we give it to him now.

392
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,980
Great.
    

393
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,140
Wrap things up properly. 
   

394
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,970
- You can do it, right?
  - Of course, CEO Kim. Don't worry.  
    

395
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,830
Okay, take care.

396
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,180
 Oh, right, CEO Kim. 

397
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,280
I was wondering if I could take Mi Wu separately today?

398
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,450
 You figure it out. 

399
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:21,760
I got it. Please take care!

400
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,910
Okay, you were so full of fighting spirit today!

401
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:35,660
Take care of the Chairman. Hey, get the driver waiting at the lobby first!

402
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,630
Hey, here. This is your tip. Don't forget it.

403
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,590
Chairman, please get home safely!

404
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,010
Chairman, it's a passionate night!

405
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:46,320
Hey, take care of him properly to the end, you punk. You got that?

406
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,230
You're quite drunk, too, Mi Wu.

407
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,120
- I'll get going first. 
- Mi Wu!

408
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,440
Let's just have one glass. Okay?

409
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,840
And let's relax and talk, too.

410
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,260
Yes.

411
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,160
You'll be leaving our company now.

412
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,700
You can call me "Oppa" and take it easy.

413
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:19,100
Don't you have a lot of worries these days?

414
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,760
Okay. Have a drink with this oppa.

415
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,260
You also need to talk about the contract cancelation with me.

416
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,830
Drink up! I won't bite.

417
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,990
Come on!

418
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,690
   

419
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,820
According to our intel, all kinds of hallucinogens 
   

420
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:55,010
and drugs are being distributed with Club Libido at the center of it all.

421
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:59,970
And Lee Jin Su, the club's operator and the director of KU Entertainment,

422
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,680
is at the center.

423
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:07,150
KU... KU? Wait, isn't KU Entertainment the major entertainment agency that has NTry?

424
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:11,690
How can such a big company fail to manage its employees?

425
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:14,500
Are they failing, or are they not doing it?

426
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,950
They probably aren't doing it.

427
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,100
That's what I also think, based on the circumstances.

428
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,130
However, we can't act solely based on the circumstances.

429
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,870
 KU Entertainment is famous for having an insider, 

430
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:32,270
 even in the police, at the top of the political and the business sectors. 

431
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,220
Your friends who were there with you just spoke up

432
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,530
- that you're mistaken, young lady. 
 - Sorry?

433
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:41,870
From what I heard, you even have depression, right?

434
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:45,990
If you take a lot of medicine regularly, you can get confused and stuff.

435
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:49,520
Still, your company was so worried about you.

436
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,740
Go and talk it over with them.

437
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,870
So, if we move without caution, they'll just cut off their tail.

438
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:02,180
- So what?
 - We'll catch their tail before they cut it off.

439
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:07,000
So, the real body of this case can't escape.

440
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,520
Mi Wu, you had me worried.

441
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,970
How can you just act as you please?

442
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:29,030
CEO Kim. Director Lee has a weird drug or something.

443
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,180
H-He used that drug that day, too.

444
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,560
I see.

445
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,560
Hey.

446
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,730
Do you think that drug

447
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,440
belongs to him?

448
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,550
You should be a national athlete. How did you end up here?

449
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:29,160
Oh, yes. Well, I'm tired of working out now.

450
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,780
Oh, and I love dancing, too. Do you want to see?

451
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,170
Aigoo, but guards aren't allowed to dance!

452
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,510
I apologize.

453
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,680
Don't close your jacket. Your physique is...

454
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,210
- This is muscle, too? 
- I-It's muscle.

455
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:51,890
- My, your physique is really out of this world. 
- Y-Yes.

456
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,320
Yes, thank you.

457
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,900
All right. Are you good at keeping secrets?

458
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,970
- Oh, my hobby is attending silent retreats at the temple.
 - Yes.

459
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:03,050
- Really?
 - Oh, yes. Of course.

460
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,390
Are you going to start working with me today?

461
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,000
- Well, of course. Yes. 
- Huh?

462
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,820
- Today's our day one? 
- Y-Yes. 
 (Couples note their day 1 of dating) 

463
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,660
Okay?

464
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,140
- Okay! Yes.
 - Okay?

465
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,490
- Promise?
 - Yes.

466
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,590
- It's a promise.
 - I promise.

467
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,920
Your TPOs are perfect today.
  (Time, Place, Occasion) 

468
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,950
This is basic.

469
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,740
Gosh, I'm perfect again today.

470
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,390
Let's switch roles, then.

471
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,390
There was no intel saying he likes men.

472
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,440
You never know since you're too perfect.

473
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,930
Oh, I would like to decline respectfully.

474
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:59,270
All right. Don't get nervous, and stay calm now. Fighting.

475
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,380
No need to worry about me.

476
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,380
Hey, Newbie. The manager wants to see you.

477
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,980
Oh, I got it.

478
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,710
You, too, Gi Hwan.

479
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,520
Oppa, did you come alone?

480
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,410
Well, no. I came with a group.

481
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:19,550
Where are your friends? Where are they?

482
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,910
Well, I'm sure they're having fun here and there.

483
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,790
Then, bring all of them over, and let's party together.

484
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,170
Together?

485
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,890
Shall we? Really?

486
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,650
Let's meet at the bar on the second floor in exactly one hour. Okay?

487
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,000
Bye.

488
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,810
Have fun. Bye.

489
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:48,480
All right. Let's get this over with. I've got a lot to do today.

490
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:56,570
Okay. Confirmed location. The bar on the second floor.

491
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,650
Come on in, Hon. Move these with them.

492
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:31,780
Oh, yes. O-One second, please.

493
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,520
What is it?

494
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,790
What the fuck is he doing?

495
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:45,080
What's this? Are you rebelling right now, Honey?

496
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,570
Yes, Hon. I'm rebelling right now.

497
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,330
Shall we practice as well?

498
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,830
- Shall we?
 - Y-Yes.

499
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,300
- Me?
 - Yes.

500
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,790
Yes.

501
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,710
Well, then. H-Here you go.

502
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,620
No, no. Your body.

503
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,340
- My body?
 - Your body.

504
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,340
- My body... Like this, then? 
- Oh, yes.

505
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,540
All right. Hold onto this part.

506
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,980
Oh, okay.

507
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,490
All right.

508
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,730
Aigoo, it's been too long. It's not working too well.

509
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:30,130
You're a bit too close. My goodness.

510
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:32,780
Wait, have you done this before?

511
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,330
Yes, a few times in the past.

512
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,110
A few times.

513
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,810
All right. There you go. Now, your legs.

514
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:43,340
- My legs? H-How should I...
 - Yes, your legs.

515
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,070
- Like this? 
- No, cross them.

516
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:48,440
- Cross them? Like this? 
- Yes.

517
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,510
Y-You're doing it well.

518
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,050
What did you do before this, Director?

519
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,080
It's a secret.

520
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,360
- There.
 - Aigoo, I can't move an inch.

521
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,010
My nickname used to be Spider-Man before.

522
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,600
Man, I loved watching that.

523
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:15,830
Well, are you good at keeping secrets?

524
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,760
Honey, stop fucking whimpering! I can't stand it.

525
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:31,630
- Are you here alone? 
 - No, I'm with my friends.

526
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,970
I've been watching you.

527
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:38,930
- Me? 
 - Yes.

528
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,470
Why? Because I'm pretty?

529
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,360
I guess people say that to you often.

530
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,910
Of course. I've heard it about 10 times here already.

531
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,300
Did you find any of them interesting?

532
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,950
Nope. They're all boring.

533
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:01,370
Then, have fun with me. I'll cure your boredom.

534
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:05,550
And stop drinking cheap alcohol like this one.

535
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:18,140
All right. Here we go.

536
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:22,480
All right. You can wreak havoc starting now.

537
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,840
W-We need to press that button.

538
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,280
What? Which one? What did you say?

539
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,570
You tied me like this. I can't even untie it.

540
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:28,980
- I'm sorry.
 - No, the one next to it.

541
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,100
- Th-This one?
 - No, L.

542
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,140
- N? 
- No, no. The one next to Enter...

543
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,010
- Enter? Enter.
 - N-No, you can just press that.

544
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:36,010
- No, the one next to Enter. The one next to—
- This one.

545
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,750
You need to press that to turn off all CCTVs.

546
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,320
- This one. Control?
 - No, press Control

547
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,660
- together with Z.
 - Z.

548
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,020
Yes, that's it. My goodness.

549
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,740
All right. You won't be recorded now!

550
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,470
It's done.

551
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,540
Hey, this is Oppa's room.

552
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,600
How is it?

553
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,340
- Oppa.
 - Yes.

554
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,700
This is it?

555
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,870
- Huh?
 - I'm asking if this is it.

556
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,490
Gosh, how lame.

557
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:18,150
I thought you had something crazy going on.

558
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:26,150
I love how direct you are.

559
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,290
Have you done it a lot?

560
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:31,160
Shut it and take it out if you have it.

561
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,950
And if I do?

562
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:36,440
What will you do for me if I give it to you?

563
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,600
Everything.

564
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:52,730
Wow! I seriously hit it big today, huh?

565
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,550
Hey.

566
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,420
This is top grade.

567
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,700
You can't get this anywhere else.

568
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,130
Oppa, I thought you were a fucking moron,

569
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,940
but you're a son of a bitch, huh?

570
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,230
- Hey.
 - I secured the evidence.

571
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,780
Hey, who are you?

572
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,740
Who do you think?

573
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,820
Why you little—

574
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:29,420
Let's stop it here. Okay?

575
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,720
Hey! This crazy bitch.

576
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,610
Do you want to die?

577
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,930
 Su Min. 

578
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,670
Are you okay, Su Min?

579
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,320
Su Min!

580
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,620
Hey! Why you little—

581
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,910
That fucking hurts!

582
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,790
Why is everyone doing this to me seriously?

583
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:03,610
Hey, do you want to die?

584
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,820
A-Aigoo, this wasn't the bathroom. I'm sorry.

585
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,140
- What's this now? 
- Hold on.

586
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,730
Hey, what are you doing here right now?

587
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:17,130
Gosh, this clubgoer. She's always hooking up whenever she gets a chance.

588
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:19,900
- I'm so sorry. You come here right now. 
 - Who are you people?

589
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,490
Wait, please calm down. There's no need to use a knife for this.

590
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:25,940
You can use your knife for your fruits. I'll quietly take my girlfriend and leave. Okay?

591
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,330
-  Come here. 
 - You guys are working together, right?

592
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,990
I can tell you're all in this together.

593
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,780
Well, no. That's a bit of a stretch.

594
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,000
Seeing a knife is making me hot. Aigoo, it's hot.

595
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,540
- Hey, why are you undressing? 
 - No, no. It's because I'm hot. I swear.

596
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,300
- Wear it. I told you to wear it.  
- You know how hot leather jackets are. I said it's hot.

597
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,000
- Hey, wear it!
 - No, take a look. It's really hot.

598
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,890
You punk!

599
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,760
Wow.

600
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:00,330
Why isn't this working?

601
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:02,770
Help! Please help me!

602
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,750
Gosh, I tied it too tight.

603
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,360
What the fuck!

604
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,880
Hey, who are you guys?

605
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,510
Hey, do you think you'll be safe after doing this?

606
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:19,070
- Whoa, he really can't read the air.
 - Shit.

607
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,860
Untie me right now. Untie me.

608
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:25,280
Excuse me. I think you're the one who won't be safe.

609
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,220
- Who are you now?
 - Aigoo, aigoo.

610
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:30,020
If you keep moving like that, it'll get tighter. Okay?

611
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,870
I thought I was going to die earlier. He's a total expert.

612
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:38,140
I still have more skills to showcase. Would you like to experience them?

613
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:43,210
You'd better not spit some half-assed lies.

614
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:46,710
This drug isn't for personal use, is it?

615
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,080
Who knows?

616
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,350
These are what I additionally found at your club.

617
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,840
It's not like you're a drug lord or something.

618
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,650
Don't you also think it's too much for one man's supply?

619
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:06,100
Which is why I think your company is deeply involved in this operation.

620
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,740
Lee Jin Su, what's your opinion?

621
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:12,380
I said I don't know.

622
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,830
Hey, that's enough. Forget it.

623
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:17,680
You said overdosing on this kills you, right? Let's see if it's true.

624
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,030
Wait, what are you trying to do?

625
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,920
Hey, guys like him never confess anyway, either.

626
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,850
He doesn't know anything since he's a stooge. Right?

627
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:24,030
Open your mouth. Say ah.

628
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,830
- Wh-What do you want to know?
 - It's fine.

629
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,020
- Jin Woong, come and open up his mouth. 
- Why? He won't open it?

630
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,650
Hey, don't do it. Don't do it— H-Hey!

631
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:34,890
All right. Sorry, okay? We should've gotten the one above you.

632
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,840
It looks like we made a mistake. Sorry.

633
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,700
There. Swallow.

634
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,010
Fuck! I said I'll talk! I will!

635
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:47,960
I'm going to die if I eat this!

636
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:56,200
All right. Shall we start by talking about CEO Kim Yun Gi, then?

637
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:01,520
CEO Kim Yun Gi of KU Entertainment. 
    

638
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,630
He's been rumored to extort the artists of his company.

639
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:08,000
Slave contracts and forcing the trainees to be escorts.

640
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,900
But to think he was distributing drugs and even using that to supply the funds...

641
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,460
Anyhow, we've got a clear target now.

642
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,750
We should start working on CEO Kim Yun Gi.

643
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,980
Hey, Ha Ri. I finished the delivery.

644
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,470
Okay. Thank you.

645
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,760
Is that prosecutor trustworthy, by the way?

646
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,320
 Kwak Do Su. He's a gifted individual who was top of the class 

647
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,480
 since the collegiate bar exam to the Judicial Training Institute. 

648
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,780
 He's obviously smart and he aims to be efficient and practical. 

649
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,520
 I don't know if we can trust him or not. 

650
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,030
 But he gets his job done for sure. 

651
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,310
 That's fine, then. 

652
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:50,060
 It'll be a great gift for him tomorrow morning. 

653
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:53,020
 It's a total surprise gift. 

654
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,420
   

655
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:59,770
 Please help me! 

656
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,750
 Help! This is so scary! 

657
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:06,470
 Please help me! I'm scared. 

658
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:09,390
 Please help me! 

659
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:12,990
 Please help me. 

660
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:16,490
Please help me! It's so scary in here. 
   

661
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:21,680
 Since we sent him a complete set of witnesses, testimony, and evidence. 

662
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:25,850
 I'm sure he's overjoyed by now. 

663
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:29,350
Investigator, I guess I'm a really good kid.

664
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:32,450
Santa visited me last night when it's off-season.

665
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:35,540
Gosh, this is why you can't be crying and stuff.

666
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,890
Sorry? Wait, Prosecutor, what are you saying—

667
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:42,760
 Please come down to the parking lot in about 20 minutes. The gift is... 

668
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,120
Gosh, it's big.

669
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,210
I don't think I can carry it alone.

670
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,560
Oh, really?

671
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,400
Jin Su did that?

672
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,910
The warehouse was robbed, too?

673
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,150
I got it.

674
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,670
Jin Su.

675
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:19,460
Jin Su will...

676
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:22,760
have to go.

677
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,920
Aigoo, you're totally a good luck charm, huh?

678
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,950
Prosecutor, I'm really innocent.

679
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:33,480
Yes, I reviewed the information you had. It was interesting.

680
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,170
The time flew so fast.

681
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:39,200
- I really don't know anything. 
- Oh, okay.

682
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,780
You don't need to since I know everything now.

683
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,850
I don't even have questions for you.

684
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:47,240
Hey, it's even awkward to be in the interrogation room. Shall we go outside?

685
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,840
Aigoo, yes. Let's go outside. Come on.

686
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,760
Prosecutor!

687
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,680
I only confessed to everything they told me to.

688
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,240
"They"?

689
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:04,720
All right. I'm also a bit curious about who they are.

690
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,170
Who are they?

691
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,490
   

692
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,710
   

693
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:45,740
Aren't you going to move on to the next step?

694
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,270
Where did everyone go?

695
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:50,740
They're probably doing what they need to do.

696
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,690
What about you, Ha Ri?

697
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,920
I'm looking at the arrangement.

698
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,670
- The arrangement? 
 - Yes.

699
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,260
The arrangement.

700
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:06,800
My goodness. Is his neck skewed?

701
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,400
Hey, Jin Woong. I just need two shots.

702
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,220
Don't be nervous and act natural. You know, right?

703
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:17,220
All right. I'm ready to go.

704
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,360
   

705
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:22,620
 There's someone looking after CEO Kim. 

706
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,830
 We need evidence that he's been bribed to get out of it. 

707
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:38,850
Thank you for taking care of the recent incident.

708
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:43,940
Aigoo. Of course, I should help out when you ask, CEO Kim.

709
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,530
This isn't much.

710
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:52,100
Aigoo, you don't have to, every time—

711
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:57,440
Your order is ready to be served. I apologize for the delay.

712
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,540
We already got our order.

713
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,320
I'm sorry.

714
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,010
Why do you keep coming into our room?

715
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:18,740
Wait, I'm pretty sure this is for your room.

716
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:21,340
We didn't order anything else.

717
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,950
- Get out.
 - One second.

718
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:27,330
That can't be. Please excuse me.

719
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:29,920
I'm pretty sure it's here, but the food is...

720
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,900
I said it's not.

721
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:43,260
Then, as for this... It will be on the house. On the house.

722
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:46,710
This is on the house. Please enjoy.

723
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:49,670
Hold on.

724
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:52,850
What's this?

725
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,330
Don't come in.

726
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,080
Thank you.

727
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,820
I'm sorry.

728
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:29,500
Hey, Im Byeong Min, did you see that? Can you see?

729
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,210
It was totally natural.

730
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:36,460
Whoa, hold on.

731
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,460
Look over there. Whoa!

732
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,690
What the heck?

733
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,730
Aigoo, how boring.

734
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:46,570
Well, I've got a friend to meet now.

735
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:49,340
You have a friend?

736
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,630
Why wouldn't I have friends?

737
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:56,330
I just feel like you don't have any.

738
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,040
What kind of feeling is that?

739
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,390
What kind of a human being do you think I am?

740
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,390
Gosh, I'm sure it's right.

741
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:08,610
- What's right?
 - Is it not?

742
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:11,030
- What's not?
 - Gosh.

743
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,040
Just cut to the chase.

744
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,690
The guys he just mentioned.

745
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,390
I think they're the guys from before.

746
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:21,570
Who? Do you know them?

747
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:23,410
No, I don't know them.

748
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:26,880
There was this prosecutor named Jang In Gyu in the past.

749
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,600
   

750
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,570
There was a rumor he unofficially assigned a job to someone.

751
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,740
   

752
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:41,150
   

753
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,780
Prosecutor Kwak, I brought the relevant document.

754
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,620
Thank you.

755
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:51,930
   
  

756
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:54,300
   
  

757
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:00,780
My goodness!

758
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:05,020
Is he the one?

759
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:08,350
Prosecutor, I was scared out of my wits back then.

760
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:10,100
   

761
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:17,700
Th-This man! H-He is the one!

762
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,330
Whoa! His eyebrows are just the same!

763
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:24,610
It's him. I remember his eyebrows clearly.

764
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,830
- Yes.
 -  Hey, Ha Ri. 

765
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:32,780
Man, CEO Kim mastered the art of cutting off the tail.

766
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,360
Hey, where are you, by the way?

767
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,790
-  I'm at Gangneung.  
- Gangneung?

768
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:38,890
Why are you at Gangneung all of a sudden?

769
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:42,390
He went all the way to Gangneung, not Gangnam, to meet a friend?

770
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:44,850
H-Hey, you don't have any friends, though.

771
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:46,350
 I do have a friend. 

772
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:48,280
A girlfriend?

773
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,430
-  It's a guy.   
- A guy? Is that her name?

774
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:55,250
- Huh? Is it Kim Guy or Hwang Guy?
 - He has a girlfriend?

775
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,750
Anyhow, you're something else.

776
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,320
- It's mine. 
- When did you seduce a woman in Gangwon-do?

777
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,020
 , I said it's a guy! 

778
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:05,270
I came here to seduce a guy on this sunny day.

779
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:07,380
Anyway, I'll talk to you later.

780
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,050
- Wait, a girlfriend?
 - Wh-What? He hung up. What do you want?

781
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,740
- A-Ask about his girlfriend.
 - He got a girlfriend?

782
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:15,860
- No, he said her name is Guy.
 - Wait, so is she a woman?

783
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,520
Wait, are you really going there?

784
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,970
Investigator, have you ever seen me wearing a grey suit?

785
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,620
I'm sure you haven't.

786
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:28,810
Because grey doesn't exist in my life.

787
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:38,770
You see, I hate it so much when black and white are mixed together.

788
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:43,570
Jang In Gyu...

789
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:45,460
Kang Ha Ri.

790
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,960
   

791
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:01,390
Holy! You gave me a heart attack.

792
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:05,750
Well, your heart is still working as hard as you, huh?

793
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:10,640
It's not like the Prosecutors' Office is your bedroom. You come in as you please.

794
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,160
You know me. It's my job to enter anywhere I please.

795
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,180
   

796
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:19,210
Aigoo, where did you get a fake one?

797
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:26,510
All right. I did hear about you guys from time to time.

798
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:29,240
You didn't forget about us.

799
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:33,680
Aigoo. You guys caused so much chaos, there's no way I could forget.

800
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:38,110
Hey, you guys are getting older now. Can't you live quietly?

801
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:41,610
I'm sure you've made enough money by now.

802
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,660
Well, probably more than you, Prosecutor.

803
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:47,300
Huh? My goodness.

804
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:53,750
Hey, I don't know if I should be saying this as a prosecutor,

805
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:58,310
but you guys should stop causing trouble and live quietly abroad or something.

806
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:01,280
Like a place that is warm all four seasons without any yellow dust.

807
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,000
I'm sure you can find many places like that.

808
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:13,940
There's always a reason why some people can never leave.

809
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,530
For example...

810
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:18,710
like having regrets.

811
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:25,880
Are you doing this because of what happened to Ah Ryeong?

812
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:36,420
Wow, I guess you really cared about us a lot, Prosecutor Jang.

813
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,430
Aigoo, did you miss me that much?

814
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:40,750
Quit it! I'm getting goosebumps.

815
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:43,850
Hey, Prosecutor Jang, I really...

816
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:46,620
I really have a simple request for you.

817
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:50,720
Shit! None of your requests are ever simple!

818
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,460
Gosh, you'll grant it anyway. Right?

819
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:57,820
Gosh! Gosh, this is why I can't quit smoking.

820
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,680
Aigoo, look how stiff you are.

821
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,020
Thank you for your work.

822
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,630
You can enter.

823
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,820
 Kang Ha Ri. 

824
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:29,540
 He went into hiding and has reappeared. 

825
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,540
 But why did he come to me? 

826
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:52,260
   

827
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,900
Kang Ha Ri?

828
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:13,290
Shit!

829
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,980
Man, you're so damn fast.

830
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:27,760
I got you, Kang Ha Ri.

831
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:44,090


832
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:46,340
♫  You shocked me, oh!  ♫

833
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:53,680
♫  That's exactly the timing. Almost frantically. Going mad, shocked me again  ♫

834
00:59:53,680 --> 01:00:01,010
♫  I stagger, I can kind of see it now. I tricked you, fell in again  ♫

835
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:10,120
♫  Respected like a giant. Blood is flowing fast  ♫

836
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:12,430
♫  When you find the perfect next move  ♫

837
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:17,460
   

838
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:21,370
 What is your identity? 

839
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:24,740
 You'll draw CEO Kim's attention by acting like a drug dealer? 

840
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:26,980
 What kind of rude behavior is this right now? 

841
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:30,690
 We'll receive new goods soon. You can do it, right? 

842
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:32,370
 I should separate my trash from the recycling. 

843
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:34,550
 That's exactly what I want from you. 

844
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:36,350
 Hurry up! 

845
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:42,720
 And that trash. You can get all of them at once. 

846
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,930
 How could you, even after everything that happened... 

847
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:46,580
 You should just go to hell. 

848
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:51,220
♫  I can't help but be surprised  ♫

849
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:54,090
♫  You're gonna crash 'till the pain  ♫
