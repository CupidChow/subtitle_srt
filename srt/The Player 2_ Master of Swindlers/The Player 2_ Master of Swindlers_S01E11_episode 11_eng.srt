1
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,330
   

2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,810
   

3
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,600
   

4
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,620
   

5
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,880
   

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,930
   

7
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:53,300


8
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,080
   

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,290
So, how's Prosecutor Jang?

10
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,290
The surgery was successful, but we'll have to keep watch.

11
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,810
Who did this to him?

12
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,490
I couldn't get a clear look, either.

13
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,330
- But I have an idea. 
 - It must've been them.

14
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:36,000
Prosecutor Jang was helping us with our job, right?

15
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,010
Really? Did those bastards do that to Prosecutor Jang?

16
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,950
- But wait... 
- Say something, Kang Ha Ri!

17
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,270
Most likely...

18
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,270
N-No, guys, but the thing is...

19
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,200
Ha Ri, I can't do this. I'll have to go at them.

20
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,790
If they get to us without Prosecutor Jang...

21
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,990
Oppa, don't get worked up.

22
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,200
W-Wait. H-Hey!

23
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,040
Don't you hear something?

24
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,820
Hear what?

25
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,000
It's from outside.

26
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,930
Yes, it's a thunderstorm.

27
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,450
If you're drunk, just go inside and sleep, asshole.

28
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,290
No, that's not it! I heard it.

29
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,910
Hey, wait a second. See what I'm saying?

30
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,810
Right now. You can hear it now.

31
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,510
What are you talking about?

32
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,540
See? What did I say─

33
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,460
Who are you guys?

34
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,710
Long time no see.

35
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,870
You little.

36
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,400
I guess you were having a party?

37
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,970
How did you know you'd all die today?

38
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,070
 Everyone just ignored it, but Hyeong Min did talk about it. 

39
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,760
 It seems Assemblyman Choi Sang Ho's campaign finances contained funds from Jeffrey. 

40
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,000
 Su Min,
   

41
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,970
 how much do you trust him? 

42
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,680
 Well, I don't mean much by it. 

43
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,580
 I was just curious. 

44
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,900
Jin Woong, take the guys and get out!

45
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,240
Oppa!

46
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,220
I-I'm bleeding!

47
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,250
- I'm bleeding—
 - Oppa!

48
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,420
I think I'm going to die! M-My laptop—

49
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,670
Get his laptop!

50
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,440
Jae Yi!

51
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,810
Am I going to die?

52
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,520
Jae Yi! Take Byeong Min.

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,560
Has this bastard gone mad?

54
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,380
You think this is funny right now, huh?

55
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,090
- What about Ha Ri?
 - Don't worry. He'll be here soon.

56
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,030
Oppa!

57
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,550
Oppa, we have to go.

58
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,250
Hurry up!

59
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,890
I won't let you go, bastard.

60
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,790
Hang in there.

61
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,160
G-Gently! Be gentle.

62
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,790
Sawadikap. 
  (formal Thai greeting) 

63
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,400
 Sawadikap. 

64
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,470
Khop khun kap. 
  (Thai for thank you) 

65
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,070
Find Kang Ha Ri!

66
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,940
What are you doing? Hurry up and get moving!

67
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,950
C-CEO.

68
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,780
Wh-What brings you all the way here?

69
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,160
I thought I would finally get to see something fun.

70
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,340
- But...
 - He couldn't have gotten far.

71
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,520
I'll round them up right away—

72
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,300
This is your third out.

73
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,170
No. No. No!

74
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:01,380
   

75
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,570
 Today's top news. 
  

76
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,250
 K-Water and Korail, which raised great controversy regarding privatization, 

77
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,650
 confirmed privatization after three years. 

78
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,800
 In this project that's gathering a lot of attention, 

79
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,340
 a private company, NQ Infracapital, won the bid, 

80
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,410
 and for its Korean branch's Jeffrey Jeong was newly appointed as CEO. 

81
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,810
 That day, CEO Jeffrey Jeong had... 

82
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,250
Can you believe the subway fare?

83
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,320
How could they raise it by 20% at once?

84
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,670
I heard they're going to raise it again in two months.

85
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,830
- They raise everything except our wages. 
- Tell me about it.

86
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,750
The incompetent government should come to its senses!
    

87
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,590
 Come to its senses! Come to its senses! 
  

88
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,500
Stop privatizing the railways!

89
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,400
 Stop it! Stop it! 

90
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,370
Down with NQ Infracapital!

91
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,100
 Down with them! Down with them! 

92
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,140
Give back the public good!

93
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,900
 Give it back! Give it back! 

94
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,590
- The incompetent government should come to its senses! 
- Hello?

95
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,010
- Mr. Kim! Sign here before you go.
  - Come to its senses! Come to its senses! 

96
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,830
- Stop privatizing the railways!
  - Stop it! Stop it! 

97
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:56,680
I've got my wife and kids at home.

98
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,710
I don't think I can join your business.

99
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,600
   

100
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,600
 - Wait, why do I have to be laid off? 
- What? 

101
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,870
 Why would they kick me out? What did I do wrong? 

102
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,320
Gosh, isn't this ridiculous?

103
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,810
What do I do? Am I getting laid off?

104
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,950
What? Layoff?

105
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,570
That's absurd.

106
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,050
Why's my name in there? 
   

107
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,930
Why do I have to be fired? 
   

108
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,150
I joined this team not long ago.

109
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,580
Why should I get laid off?

110
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,800
- Stop privatizing the railways! 
  - Stop it! Stop it! 

111
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,110
 Sir, did you expect the project would do so well? 

112
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,030
Never have doubted.

113
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:44,760
You see, people are nonchalant about things that could kill them

114
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,840
 until they actually get swords thrusted in their throats.
   

115
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:55,200
 Only after the first cut, do they try to stop it. 

116
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,700
 But they can never stop it 

117
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:04,810
because I did my best to sharpen my sword even while they looked the other way.

118
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:10,390
Hence, my success was due to the lack of interest of all of them.

119
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,240
I heard the news. Your youngest son has...

120
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,440
I heard it, too. He's going to work at K-Water and Korail.

121
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,620
Watch it now. It's not K-Water and Korail.

122
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:29,290
It's NQ Train now.

123
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,460
It's only the beginning, and you're all already rejoicing.

124
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,950
- You're here!
 - Please take a seat.

125
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:44,200
Starting with this project, there will be a more aggressive acquisition of public sectors.

126
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,580
How are things going on your end?

127
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,480
Yes. We've finished taking the initiative.

128
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,310
The board review will also be done without a problem.

129
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:59,710
 Choi Sang Ho is more cooperative than we expected as well. 

130
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,530
   

131
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:14,600
As expected, your wise decision back then was right, CEO.

132
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,030
Excuse me, CEO. Please forgive me for asking this.

133
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,650
But aren't you making this larger in scale than it has to be?

134
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,790
We can somehow get away with it once. But if we continue doing this...

135
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,820
If we continue,

136
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,360
will there be a problem or something?

137
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,080
I mean, well—

138
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,120
Of course, if things are...

139
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:46,870
I guess you don't know why you're sitting there right now, Minister.

140
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,140
You're greedy, but you don't want to take responsibility?

141
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,150
That's what I hate the most.

142
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,970
It's a beggar's spirit.

143
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,340
No, th-that's not what I meant.

144
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,510
I was just worried about it.

145
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:13,540
I-I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

146
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,090
Not at all. I understand.

147
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:29,240
I'll be more cautious so your worries won't come true.

148
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,950
Please help yourselves.

149
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,920
Make sure the Minister gets a VIP seat at the next event.

150
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,770
Hey, Prosecutor Kwak.

151
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,280
You seem very busy these days.

152
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,440
Me? I think you are, too.

153
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,440
No, you seem to be sticking your nose here and there.

154
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,320
Sticking my nose? I'm just doing what I've been doing.

155
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,850
Don't do it.

156
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,450
Sorry?

157
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,450
I said...

158
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,860
don't do it.

159
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,130
What are you telling me not to do?

160
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,750
Stop digging into the higher-ups.

161
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:48,380
Once that busy matter gets done, I'll treat you properly.

162
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,640
There's a great place. Okay?

163
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,560
Let's not be so uptight. Okay?

164
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,870
Your prediction was right.

165
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,860
Thank you.

166
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,450
I leaked word that I'm investigating the people you told me about.

167
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:32,070
Man, my seonbae, who hadn't even returned my greeting before, approached me first.

168
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,880
Is there any place where his hands haven't reached?

169
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,130
You can say there isn't.

170
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,290
The entire world is Jeffrey.

171
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,150
I wonder if he's here, too.

172
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,250
Gosh, my heart's going to stop.

173
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,820
How am I going to live with this anxiety?

174
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,070
Here's the data you asked for.

175
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,840
   

176
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,850
Thanks.

177
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:08,550
I'm sure you know. But the Prosecution's database probably doesn't have the evidence you want.

178
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:14,160
If they left a record and stored it in the database, would that be corruption?

179
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,240
Su Min.

180
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,990
What?

181
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,810
Are you okay?

182
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,710
I'll get going. Don't skip your meals.

183
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,990
And stop drinking on an empty stomach.

184
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,600
   

185
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,350
Thanks.

186
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,470
 But what brought you here to this faraway country? 

187
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,940
Kang Ha Ri?

188
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,890
Are you alright?

189
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,020
Yes, Director Hwang.

190
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,030
I got it.

191
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,210
   

192
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,660
 The call is not going through. After the beep... 

193
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,800
What are you doing in someone's house without permission?

194
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,820
Is it over if you just disappear like that?

195
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,470
Do you know what happened to us in the meantime?

196
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,960
Do I need to know that?

197
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,780
What's the medicine for?

198
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,850
I won't die.

199
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,950
Not that I care if I do.

200
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,710
Our hideout... has been attacked.

201
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,440
And Prosecutor Jang, too.

202
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,890
He's in a critical condition right now.

203
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,800
I know the reason why you're

204
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,770
doing this, Su Min.

205
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,250
 Yes, Director Hwang. 

206
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,790
 Su Min is looking into the President? 

207
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,070
 Yes, I got it. 

208
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,770
I know. But you should stop there.

209
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,100
Since when did you know?

210
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,430
About that bastard and Ajeossi's relationship.

211
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,290
I knew they had something from the beginning,

212
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:11,990
but found out recently that it was election corruption.

213
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,000
Even knowing all that, why are you still protecting Ajeossi?

214
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,740
Because I confirmed it.

215
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,780
 Regardless of what dealing they had in the past, 

216
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,420
 it's true the President is trying to bring that bastard down right now. 

217
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:38,060
How are you telling me to believe that?

218
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:47,650
You'd know the answer to that trust.

219
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,530
   

220
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,730
 Get me some sleeping pills on the way. 

221
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,220
What?

222
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,970
Why are there so many insomniacs today?

223
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,200
No, it's not for me.

224
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,550
To put those folks to sleep.

225
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,260
Stop eating, asshole!

226
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,490
I asked if you were going to eat earlier, right?

227
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,730
But I really didn't want to eat earlier.

228
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,730
You said you'll only take a bite.

229
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,190
I only took one bite.

230
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,320
That's how big my one bite has always been.

231
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,880
So why the hell would you make ramen in front of a sick person?

232
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,300
Huh? I wasn't even feeling it and you...

233
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,920
Should I starve, then? Huh?

234
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,950
- Did I tell you to starve? 
- How many times did I say I hate starving?

235
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,000
- You just need to make one more ramen! 
- If you can't get sleeping pills,

236
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,530
- what's that thing you used to make me pass out last time? 
 - It's a taser gun.

237
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,800
A-A taser gun?

238
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,240
It's better than knocking them out with my fist.

239
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,580
Stop making a mess!

240
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,330
I use this place when I'm on a mission.

241
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,130
Gosh, okay.

242
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,000
We got it.

243
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,620
According to the assemblymen,

244
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,670
it seems the standing committee and the plenary session won't be a problem.

245
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,790
That only leaves the president's approval.

246
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,420
Don't worry about that.

247
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,880
If you'll just keep up the good work...

248
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,500
If that bill gets passed as well,

249
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,510
you won't need to worry about money until you die—

250
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:50,240
Rather, you won't need to worry about money even after death.

251
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,630
I don't have the desire for such things.

252
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,420
You're really as clean as ever.

253
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,380
Not anymore.

254
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,870
You'll be thankful you're not.

255
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,150
Justice that's way too clean

256
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,700
always gets killed by a speck of dust in the end.

257
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,220
Oh, by the way,

258
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,940
I'm worried about public opinion.

259
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,280
They have already started protesting

260
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,750
over the recent matter.

261
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,440
You don't need to worry about that.

262
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,740
 Because I already got it resolved. 

263
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,200
 The protesters are only an interest group, too. 

264
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,640
 If they become a criminal group, 

265
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,220
 the public opinion will blame them instead. 

266
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,730
 Then, the public will have no choice but to criticize the protesters. 

267
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,680
 This is 112. 
(Korea's speed-dial for police and emergency reports) 

268
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,440
   

269
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,830
 This morning, an officer of the protesters against the privatization 

270
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:27,000
 of K-Water and Korail has attempted to commit a bombing. 

271
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,300
 It ended as an attempt by the police and EOD, who got to the scene right away. 

272
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,210
 Reporter Choi Hyeon Su is on the scene with more details. 
  

273
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:40,090
Around 4:00am, the 112 Report Center received a call.

274
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,580
 This is 112. 

275
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,750
 Cease privatization of K-Water and Korail by 6:00pm today. 

276
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,000
 Sir, this is 112 Report Center. 

277
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,210
 If you don't cease, I'll cause a bombing against the public. 

278
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:55,160
 The police and EOD got to the scene following the terrorist's call. 

279
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,270
 They found the bomb inside a trash can near Bangeun Station and defused it. 

280
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:03,610
 The officers of protesters who are possible suspects were arrested at the scene 

281
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,430
 and the police are looking for other accomplices— 

282
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,720
 You don't need to worry about that. 

283
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,480
 Because I already got it resolved. 

284
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,090
 Everything went as planned. 

285
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:17,890
The situation is unfolding exactly as you predicted.

286
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,250
See?

287
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,570
It's easy, isn't it?

288
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,640
 Gosh, my Mantha! 

289
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,770
Wh-Why? What's wrong?

290
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,640
You even named your computer?

291
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,010
Don't be so rude!

292
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,790
This isn't just a computer.

293
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:47,210
This is my comrade!

294
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,980
We had one more comrade, huh?

295
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,420
Aigoo, Mantha.

296
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,740
Please rest in peace.

297
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,780
What's this guy's name?

298
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,530
Why would it have a name? It's just a keyboard.

299
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,130
What kind of nonsense is that.

300
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:08,300
Fucking nerd.

301
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,490
Thank you for hanging in there, guys.

302
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,930
Damn assholes. They destroyed our home completely.

303
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,170
Hello, all.

304
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,290
Eonni!

305
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,360
Su Min!

306
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,280
Where have you been?

307
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,880
Where have you— I thought you were dead.

308
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,620
- You were worried? I'm sorry. 
- Su Min, I was so worried—

309
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,410
What's that smell? Hold on.

310
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,060
Aigoo, everyone gathered.

311
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,980
D-Director—

312
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,110
Did you get the shipment I sent?

313
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:57,380
- I salvaged what I could— 
 - Aigoo, Director!

314
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,300
This man is this incident's suspect.

315
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,100
Ah, the one they said is a protester.

316
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,210
He's not a protester.

317
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,640
Can't you tell who it is?

318
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,880
- This bastard!
 - Huh?

319
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,380
This guy is that bastard! In Thailand, he was next to J-Jang...

320
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,010
I mean, next to Kang Do Yeong!

321
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,530
- Oh, that...
 - Yes!

322
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,560
- Fucking bastard. 
- You're right. He's the one next to Kang Do Yeong.

323
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,240
He's one of Jeffrey's men.

324
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,530
What? So all that ruckus today was—

325
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,950
It's a self-made play by Jeffrey.

326
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,190
Wh-Why would he bother with a self-made play?

327
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,420
If he turns the protesters into a crazy terrorist group,

328
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:40,360
he can dismiss the protesters and win back the public opinion he lost for raising the fares.

329
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,570
He's right. For the privatization project Jeffrey is leading right now,

330
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:47,110
the biggest problem for him is the public opinion.

331
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:50,680
Jeffrey knows the public will oppose him more and more.

332
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:55,370
Do you know why? Because he knows better than anyone

333
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,420
his project's goal is to exploit the public, in fact.

334
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:03,050
That's why he pulled something like what happened today. To imprint a frame on the public.

335
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:06,010
"Those who oppose me are all terrorists."

336
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,040
The most efficient way to manipulate the public is to

337
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,790
attack with a messenger, not refute the message.

338
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:17,260
You two got so much closer since the last time we saw you.

339
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,320
I'm starting to feel lonely today.

340
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,750
- No time to feel lonely.
 - What?

341
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,870
Because what really matters is from here on.

342
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,510
Here's a question.

343
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,600
Is this incident really just a show?

344
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,540
If it's not a show, then...

345
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,630
All right! Let's eat before we continue!

346
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,280
- Eat?
 - Eat!

347
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,100
- What's on the menu? 
- Some frog dishes.

348
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,790
- Move aside!
 - Hurry up now. It'll get cold.

349
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,740
Where did you get a frog? Is it a meal kit?

350
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,310
- Su Min?
 - Oh, I'm on a diet.

351
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:49,530
- Oh, a diet. 
- Don't leave me behind. Wait up.

352
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,330
Come on!

353
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,770
If you kill one person, it's murder.

354
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,810
And if you kill 10 people, it's serial murder.

355
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:05,210
But if that number goes up to a hundred or a thousand, it becomes a revolution.

356
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:12,130
And all of you who gathered here today must become the leaders of the said revolution.

357
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,150
People don't remember trivial sacrifices.

358
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:21,990
On that day, we'll imprint fear that

359
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:25,470
people will remember for a long time.

360
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,620
I'm glad everyone is livelier than I expected.

361
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,960
That's the charm of those guys.

362
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,990
But how did you know?

363
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:54,000
That real terrorism will happen, not just a show.

364
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,810
 Aigoo, CEO Seo! 

365
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:05,250
 I'm Senior Manager Park. Have you been well? 

366
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,000
 You're not CEO Seo Jae Hyeon. 

367
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,250
 I'm sorry. I mistook you for someone else. I'm sorry. 

368
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,560
 What a nutcase. 

369
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,330
 Yeah. It looks like he's going to do a really big show. 

370
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,140
 He'll invite some singers, too. 

371
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,700
 This is more or less a festival. 

372
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,370
 But, you see, 

373
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:36,310
 I'm the only one Jeffrey invited to this show. 

374
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:40,320
It seems he trusts me a lot for sure.

375
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,610
 I mean, I do say what I need to say even next to Jeffrey. 

376
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,920
Jeffrey is suddenly hosting a show?

377
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,820
I knew something was off.

378
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,250
Because he'd never do something that wouldn't benefit him.

379
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:58,210
And when something happened like it did today, the puzzle came together.

380
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:03,240
Today's happening was a teaser and the main event is coming soon.

381
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,070
What about you?

382
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:13,170
Have you found the answer since that day?

383
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,290
I started this work for my revenge,

384
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:26,370
but I thought Ajeossi was doing this for the greater good.

385
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,580
 Because that's the kind of person I thought he was since I was young. 

386
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,710
 Like the absolute good. 

387
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:41,220
So, I guess I couldn't accept that Ajeossi had committed corruption back then.

388
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,140
What about now?

389
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,640
Have you accepted it a bit?

390
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,400
It's more accurate to say I'm doing my best to look the other way.

391
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:01,220
Regardless of the motivation, we share the same goal according to you, Ha Ri.

392
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,020
 I don't think absolute good or evil exists in the first place.
  

393
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:13,170
 Every moment just comes with the best and the worst. 

394
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,370
 But Choi Sang Ho, as I found out about him, 

395
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,040
 is doing his best with the moment he's given. 

396
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:32,500
If you really can't trust him, just trust me for now.

397
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,410
I'll be truthful.

398
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,590
A conman being truthful?

399
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,580
Let's go inside.

400
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,300
This is the sword Blacksmith Umitsuka from the late 10th century

401
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,310
offered to his lord after soaking it with his blood.

402
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:23,300
I hope you'll take it as a symbol of the creation of our brotherhood, Jeong Gyu.

403
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:32,430
I'll make sure to meet your expectations.

404
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:38,750
Please become the revolutionist who changes the world this time, Jeong Gyu.

405
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,620
   

406
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:00,060
 From field studies for students to family tours, 

407
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,840
 Jeffrey invited countless people to NQ Train's opening ceremony. 

408
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,030
 Jeffrey will commit yet another terrorist act, pretending it's by the protesters. 

409
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:11,300
 Once the bomb goes off, innocent citizens will get hurt 

410
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,380
 and the public will criticize the protesters. Right? 

411
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,840
 So we must find the bomb before people get hurt. 

412
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,840
 Because he'll aim for the most crowded hour for sure. 

413
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,150
 Make sure to look everywhere. 

414
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,790
All right, here we go.

415
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:47,030
Big smiles, please. One, two, three.

416
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:49,380
I've been checking since the event venue's setup time,

417
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,050
but I don't think there were any bombs installed in advance.

418
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,910
- Here is the brochure for the event. 
- Oh, thank you.

419
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,780
I guess he'll show up at the event with it in person.

420
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:03,110
Yes, if it's the bomb they used for the self-made play,

421
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:07,350
it's probably the type that uses a digital timer.

422
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:11,130
- Press it?
 - Yes, p-please press the one over there.

423
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,660
What the— It logged out. 
   

424
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,850
Gosh, I told you to open it, but you closed...

425
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:23,710
It won't be easy to find it because there are so many people.

426
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,930
But there are too many young students.

427
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:40,020
We'll have to prevent people here from getting hurt.

428
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,230
Let's hurry.

429
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,890
Yes, I'll go look this way.

430
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,750
Excuse me!

431
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,960
One second, please.

432
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,720
I'm sorry, but could I look inside your bag, please?

433
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,330
Why? What's the matter?

434
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,180
Oh, it'll only take a moment.

435
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,210
Wh-Who are you?

436
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,570
Oh, I'm...

437
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,610
Don't talk back when an adult tells you to do something.

438
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,420
Come over here.

439
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,110
- Give it back!
 - Hey!

440
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,800
Stay put.

441
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,790
Mom did tell me to watch out in Seoul.

442
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,210
I'm sorry.

443
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,690
I found Kang Ha Ri at the scene.

444
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,620
Good.

445
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,420
We can take them all out together.

446
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,680
Found a suspicious man at nine o'clock from the third booth.

447
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,660
Confirmed. I'm heading there.

448
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,490
Gosh, I need to pee.

449
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,800
   

450
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,910
Sir, could I check your bag, please?

451
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,860
Sir, could I check your bag, please—

452
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,050
Parking lot.

453
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,270
Nice to see you.

454
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,760
I think it's him. A black cap and a black bag.

455
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,190
This is the Children's Exhibition.

456
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,450
Looks like he showed up.

457
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,980
Wait a minute, then. The escape alarm first?

458
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,470
Yes.

459
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,230
Aigoo, what's going on?
    

460
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,600
Wh-What's this? What's wrong with this?

461
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,070
Gosh, what the heck is this, seriously?

462
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,550
What do I do?

463
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,810
I lost him in the crowd.

464
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:58,090
I'll start searching for him to my right.

465
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,700
 Thank you to all the citizens who came to the festival 

466
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,940
 with hope for the future. 

467
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:26,190
 There will be a special celebratory performance soon. 

468
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:30,460
 Ladies and Gentlemen, please make your way to our special stage. 

469
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:34,140
Please welcome N-Try with a round of applause!

470
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,280
Hello, we're N-Try.

471
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,790
Excuse me! Excuse me.

472
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,690
 Celebrating NQ Train Corp.'s new beginning, 

473
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:58,270
 we hope you enjoy today's performance. 

474
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,370
   

475
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:10,270
- Director Hwang... 
- Plan B!

476
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,060
Hey. Show me your bag.

477
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,730
- Hey, look at them.
 - The white shirt?

478
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:52,880
- No, no. The black shirt.
 - No, no—

479
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:56,110
The white shirt will win.

480
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,850
Hold on.

481
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,950
Ha Ri! What about the bomb?

482
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,270
It's not here.

483
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,310
- What are you doing?
 - There has to be a clue.

484
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,280
It's 10 minutes, Sir. We should be on our way.

485
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:05,360
Everyone at the venue. Evacuate immediately.

486
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,420
Where do you think you're going—

487
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,020
Got it.

488
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:22,330
Judging by this bastard's GPS, he moved from Booth 3 to the front of the stage.

489
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:26,040
Then I'll head to the stage. You head over to Booth 3, Su Min.

490
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,690
- Okay!
 - Everyone, listen up!

491
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,510
The bomb can be anywhere between Booth 3 and the stage.

492
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:32,450
Okay. I'm on my way.

493
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,010
Are you okay?

494
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,840
Yeah, I'm good.

495
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,950
Let's hurry up.

496
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:54,630
Sir, there's a bomb here!

497
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,510
There's a bomb here! Ajeossi, a bomb!

498
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:59,350
I'm serious. There's a bomb here! It's going to explode.

499
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:00,670
Get out of...

500
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:02,680
There's a bomb... Damn it.

501
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,410
A bomb...

502
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:14,880
There's a bomb here! Get out of here!

503
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,640
There's a bomb─ Wait, hold on!

504
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,640
I'm serious! There's a bomb!

505
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,360
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

506
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,200
Please don't run. It's okay.

507
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,120
 He passed booths 4, 5, and 6. 

508
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,000
 Search each one. I'm on my way to the stage. 

509
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,690
- Come on!
 - Please remain calm!

510
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:22,350
Don't run! Please don't run.

511
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:24,830
Please exit carefully.

512
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:28,820
Hey, get out of there! You should come out before the bomb explodes.

513
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,260
I think I found it.

514
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,080
You found it?

515
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,640
Director Hwang, please take my place.

516
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,840
Slowly! Slowly!

517
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,500
How much time do we have?

518
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:06,620
1 minute 30 seconds.

519
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,530
What? Forget it. It's going to explode. Get out of there!

520
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:12,800
Hold on! Hold on!

521
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,300
I'm going to defuse it here. I'm starting.

522
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,300
You think you got it? Do as you practiced. Don't be nervous, okay?

523
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,190
- Okay.
  - You just have to cut the inner wire. 

524
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,480
You see the red one? Just cut that!

525
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:29,060
Byeong Min. There are two red wires.

526
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,450
 Two? What shade of red? 

527
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:35,540
It's like a... Fire-engine red and pillar-box red.

528
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,180
What? F-f... Say it in Korean.

529
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:40,690
So, it's like... It's...

530
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:44,210
The color of a firetruck and... What do you call it...

531
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:46,290
A mailbox! The color of a mailbox.

532
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:50,160
Okay, got it! A mailbox and a firetruck?

533
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,900
Mailbox! Cut the mailbox red!

534
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,410
Mailbox red? Okay!

535
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,810
Wait.

536
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:04,800
Im Byeong Min, are you taking a shot in the dark since it's not your life on the line?

537
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,050
Just shut up and cut the mailbox red!

538
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,840
Okay.

539
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:13,920
 Wait a minute. 

540
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,950
 No, wait. No... 

541
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:19,460
 No, no, no, no! 

542
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,470
 No! It's the firetruck red! 

543
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:23,920
 Cut the firetruck red! 

544
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:50,820
Defused.

545
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:15,430
I should be dead for trusting you, Im Byeong Min!

546
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:16,920
I'll see you when I get back.

547
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,730
Kang Ha Ri?

548
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:24,080
Oh, I think you got the wrong person.

549
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,830
Kang Ha Ri!

550
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,590
You're under emergency arrest for attempted use of an explosive and attempted murder.

551
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:38,570
What?

552
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:42,090
- Wait, under arrest? 
 - Yes. You can refuse to give unfavorable testimony.

553
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:44,070
You have the right to an attorney.

554
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:46,280
You can also request a trial for improper arrest.

555
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,940
- Arrest him.
 - Yes.

556
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,080
Gosh, this is nuts.

557
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:54,060
- W-Wait a minute. L-Look here. 
- Why?

558
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,730
Over here!

559
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:02,100
- When is he coming out? 
 - Did you ask?

560
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,850
How long do we have to wait?

561
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,490
Please make sure you can get the whole view.

562
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:10,940
I'm not the one who did it. I'm the one who stopped it! Do you understand?

563
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,260
Prosecutor.

564
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:18,060
Prosecutor! You're listening to me right now, right?

565
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:34,590
If a delinquent who usually acts out finds the wallet that disappeared inside a classroom,

566
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:38,040
do you know what the teacher and the other students think?

567
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,680
"Isn't he the one who stole it?"

568
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,870
"Gosh, is all the money there?"

569
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:46,270
"That asshole's putting on a show after stealing it."

570
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,260
That's how the world is.

571
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:56,280
It doesn't matter what you did in this case.

572
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,030
It matters what kind of an asshole you've been so far.

573
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:01,610
My gosh.

574
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:05,830
I really lived quite a diligent life. I paid all my taxes.

575
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:09,810
Anyway! I really didn't do it this time!

576
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:11,780
Really?

577
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:14,270
What a shame, though.

578
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:17,870
People don't believe in a branded evil person's good deed.

579
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:21,180
Man, this is crazy. I'm going to lose it.

580
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,070
Kang Ha Ri.

581
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:26,310
Let's do this.

582
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:33,740
These guys are the protesters we arrested recently.

583
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,470
Let's have those punks be the culprits.

584
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:44,150
You didn't really know much and just helped out a little.

585
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:45,690
How is it?

586
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,050
   

587
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:53,750
Yes.

588
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,050
Of course.

589
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:00,970
 If he takes the fall, he'll rot in prison for life. So he has to say okay. 

590
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:03,240
I knew he would do that.

591
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,250
Great job, Prosecutor Han.

592
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,650
I'll see you in person after the job is done.

593
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,600
Yes, I understand.

594
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:29,100
We'll say the protesters who failed the bombing took their own lives here.

595
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:33,210
Leave evidence of joining the protest after holding a grudge over the layoff.

596
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:35,870
Yes, I got it.

597
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:42,200
It's really hard to become the revolutionist who changed the world.

598
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,750
Since you failed the revolution,

599
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:50,470
you'll have to find its main culprit and make them pay the consequences.

600
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:59,950
That will be the last opportunity left for you.

601
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:08,550
I believe you know well I'm not as generous as you expect me to be.

602
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:12,700
I'll keep it in mind.

603
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:20,040
Sir, you should see this.

604
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,180
Choi Sang Ho?

605
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,710
What the hell is he up to?

606
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:30,930
Because of this, Choi Sang Ho is already planning the press conference.

607
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:35,570
He was the one who was acting so innocent.

608
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,620
All the reporters have gathered.

609
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:31,880
   

610
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:46,350
   

611
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:01,250
Hello.

612
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:03,720
I'm Choi Sang Ho, the president.

613
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,110
I'll start the interview.

614
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,530
- Kang Ha Ri!
 - Kang Ha Ri!

615
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:21,150
Kang Ha Ri, do you admit to having attempted a terrorist act?

616
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,750
Yes.

617
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:30,070
Are you admitting to the claim from the video?

618
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:34,040
Yes, that's correct.

619
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:41,090
Find the original copy of that video.

620
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:44,280
The one with the guy that gives the money.

621
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,910
Yes, sir.

622
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:53,730
CEO, we have a problem.

623
00:56:55,710 --> 00:57:00,570
According to the prosecution's investigation, you even confessed who was behind you. Is that correct?

624
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,050
That's correct.

625
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:08,970
From when I was an assemblyman before the election,

626
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:14,410
it's true I've been receiving slush funds regularly under the name of campaign funds.

627
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:19,710
As you saw in the video, I mostly received payments in cash,

628
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:24,190
delivered by a person from NQ.

629
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:28,410
 President Choi Sang Ho admitted to obtaining illegal slush funds. 

630
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:33,350
 From Branch Manager Jeffrey Jeong of NQ Infracapital's Korean branch, 

631
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:37,160
 ever since the President was an assemblyman, from the time of election until now. 

632
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:41,490
The one behind me is the one who has been with me for a long time,

633
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:44,670
a Branch Manager of NQ Infracapital.

634
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,980
- Jeffrey... 
- Jeong.

635
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:57,930


636
00:57:57,930 --> 00:58:00,940
   

637
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,070
Thank you for back then.

638
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:08,710
That day...

639
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:10,390
 Excuse me! 

640
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,970
 Can we talk? 

641
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:16,350
Because you held me back,

642
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:23,030
- I beat up that bastard
 -  What's this? What's this, I said! 

643
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:25,940
and got to relieve some of my anger.

644
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:30,110
If I hadn't even been able to do that, I would've been really

645
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:33,500
frustrated, I think.

646
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,490
I'm glad.

647
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:38,030
But that's the end.

648
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:42,030
I think I did well in stopping myself from crossing the line more.

649
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:48,100
Are you saying that was enough for your revenge?

650
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:52,140
Of course, it's not enough. Nor can it ever be enough.

651
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:55,680
There's no such thing as a fulfilling revenge.

652
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:02,550
It's agonizing to cling to something that won't ever be fulfilled in your life.

653
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:05,480
I didn't finish my revenge.

654
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,100
I only let go of my suffering.

655
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:11,490
You're going?

656
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:15,650
Yes. I need to go see my baby.

657
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:19,200
You should also take care of your babies.

658
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,500
They're such troublemakers.

659
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,910
 Hey, give me a hand here. 

660
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:27,260
 - Gosh, you're such a handful. 
- I hurt my hand. 

661
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:30,450
 Is it delicious? Huh? Gosh, you're so gross. 

662
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:32,070
Gosh, you eat so damn much!

663
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:33,850
It's delicious.

664
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:36,260
Eat more. Eat up. Eat some kimchi, too.

665
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:39,080
Here. Gosh, what a filthy asshole.

666
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:42,610
Eat it all, okay? Must be nice to be full.

667
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:47,290
   

668
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:49,330
♫  One, two, three and four  ♫

669
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:53,210
♫  Run until you run out of breath. I got the feeling  ♫

670
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,560
♫  So you lose everything  ♫

671
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:59,450
♫  Check, one, two, three, and go. I always have a poker face  ♫

672
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:02,330
♫  I'm the player. I'm the Player  ♫

673
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:04,570
♫  We are the player  ♫

674
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:08,470
♫  I'm the player. I'm the player. I'm the player  ♫

675
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:12,160

676
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,930
♫  Got the magical feeling  ♫

677
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:15,530
 You have to be crazy sometimes... 

678
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:17,300
 I think I need to use the restroom. 

679
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:20,790
 ...to deal with the crazy bastards. 

680
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:26,920
 Let's make sure to catch Jeffrey Jeong. 

681
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,420
 They'll find a way to worm their way out again. 

682
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:31,160
 Let's end it! 

683
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:38,890
 Jeffrey, I'll kill you. 

684
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:42,030
 There's a bomb inside, but the door is locked. 

685
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:43,950
 - A bomb? 
 - A bomb? 

686
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:49,170
♫  One, two, three and four, try running until you can't  ♫

687
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:52,590
♫  I got the feeling  ♫
