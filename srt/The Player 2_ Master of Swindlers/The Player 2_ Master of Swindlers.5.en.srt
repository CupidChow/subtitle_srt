1
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:47,054
You don't buy directly from a dealer, right?

2
00:00:47,055 --> 00:00:48,625
Do you think you can get away with this?

3
00:00:48,626 --> 00:00:50,955
Gosh. That jerk can't read the room, can he?

4
00:00:50,956 --> 00:00:52,896
Hey. Darn it. I'll talk!

5
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:56,195
All right. Why don't we start with the CEO, Kim Yun Gi? Yes?

6
00:00:56,465 --> 00:00:59,494
We'll get CEO Kim's attention with a drug broker?

7
00:00:59,495 --> 00:01:01,195
- Eddy Jung? - Assemblywoman.

8
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:02,436
This is Eddy Jung.

9
00:01:02,936 --> 00:01:03,964
I'm Eddy Jung.

10
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:05,775
That's his main job.

11
00:01:05,776 --> 00:01:07,605
How much can you bring in this time?

12
00:01:08,175 --> 00:01:10,205
I'm hoping to check it myself.

13
00:01:10,206 --> 00:01:12,575
Once CEO Kim has his new market,

14
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:14,876
he'll bring in the goods from his supplier.

15
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,346
What did you just say?

16
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:18,386
I can bust the deal?

17
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:19,556
The drug deal?

18
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:22,086
Money, drugs, and those dirtbags.

19
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:25,026
It's a chance to gobble up all of them in one go.

20
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:26,696
You're awake.

21
00:01:27,096 --> 00:01:28,196
What are you doing, you bastard?

22
00:01:28,726 --> 00:01:29,766
No!

23
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:31,995
Once again, you didn't come here to make money.

24
00:01:32,435 --> 00:01:34,096
You came here to be killed by me. Isn't that right?

25
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:36,166
Hi. Everyone, stop.

26
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:38,636
Gosh. What took you so long?

27
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:40,276
Get them all!

28
00:01:44,676 --> 00:01:45,676
Good shot.

29
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:48,745
Don't shoot.

30
00:01:49,116 --> 00:01:51,214
You don't seem to understand.

31
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:53,255
You won't be able to arrest me for something like this.

32
00:01:53,256 --> 00:01:54,955
Prosecutor Kwak. Kim Yun Gi...

33
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:57,926
Kim Yun Gi was found dead in the lockup.

34
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,695
The day Kim Yun Gi was apprehended,

35
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:02,065
the drug smuggler got away.

36
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:03,396
Protect your life.

37
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:05,965
His men came to the rescue.

38
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:07,995
This sucks.

39
00:02:08,605 --> 00:02:09,635
What are you doing?

40
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:11,165
Since we're done with the last project,

41
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,675
we should move on to the next project right away.

42
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:13,705
Dad.

43
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,646
Dad, I think I just caused trouble.

44
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:17,245
What do I do?

45
00:02:17,476 --> 00:02:18,615
He got off on probation?

46
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:19,976
- It's exactly that. - What?

47
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,676
He had someone watching his back.

48
00:02:21,816 --> 00:02:23,744
Min Won Jun, to probation.

49
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:25,416
Yes, that's right. He was a third-generation conglomerate.

50
00:02:25,715 --> 00:02:29,125
There's someone who blurs out the blatant truth.

51
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:32,325
A fixer for the VVIPs of Korea.

52
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:34,154
That's Director Baek.

53
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:37,225
Gosh. This case will give us a headache.

54
00:02:37,226 --> 00:02:39,566
Kang Ha Ri seems to have caught on.

55
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:41,265
Call him right now.

56
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:44,105
I'll need you to come somewhere with me.

57
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,405
Where would we go at this late hour?

58
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:46,775
You'll see.

59
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:48,305
Follow me.

60
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:50,105
He's here.

61
00:02:56,346 --> 00:02:57,515
It's a pleasure to meet you,

62
00:02:58,246 --> 00:02:59,286
Mr. Kang Ha Ri.

63
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:15,265
I had a hunch someone important was here.

64
00:03:16,105 --> 00:03:17,765
But little did I know it'd be you, President.

65
00:03:19,105 --> 00:03:20,906
It was not my intention to shock you.

66
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:25,145
My apologies. However, I needed confirmation.

67
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:29,216
What confirmation?

68
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:32,756
Confirmation whether...

69
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:35,054
you are someone who can see...

70
00:03:35,055 --> 00:03:36,955
the same goal as mine through to the end.

71
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:39,256
"Same goal?"

72
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,466
Didn't you already take a hint of it?

73
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:47,865
That we three have the same enemy.

74
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:54,705
It might become a long, boring battle.

75
00:03:55,136 --> 00:03:58,605
And during a long battle, one will stab others in the back.

76
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,745
For such a reason,

77
00:04:01,746 --> 00:04:04,316
I don't want to keep such a person near me.

78
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,985
A person who will complete the task,

79
00:04:08,256 --> 00:04:09,286
no matter...

80
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:12,025
what happens.

81
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:15,096
I needed someone like that.

82
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:19,166
Just like you, Mr. Kang,

83
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,436
and Secretary Jung.

84
00:04:36,746 --> 00:04:37,746
I see.

85
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:39,785
I understand what you're going on about.

86
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:42,855
However, I still have my doubts.

87
00:04:44,256 --> 00:04:46,455
Why would you need someone like me?

88
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:51,265
To defeat evil, you must use evil.

89
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:53,736
When your opponent comes at you with guns and knives,

90
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:56,436
you can't be civil and rely on words to reason with them.

91
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:02,205
But given your position,

92
00:05:02,506 --> 00:05:04,975
I'm certain you can fight against anyone with strong power.

93
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:08,676
The nature of my position isn't to fight against people.

94
00:05:09,015 --> 00:05:11,215
It's to reach an agreement and embrace people.

95
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:14,215
If I wanted to fight anyone,

96
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:16,955
I shouldn't have run for president.

97
00:05:18,455 --> 00:05:21,895
My words and actions...

98
00:05:22,825 --> 00:05:24,796
come with great responsibility.

99
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:27,465
I can't be free from that.

100
00:05:27,636 --> 00:05:30,035
Naturally, I shouldn't be.

101
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:37,775
That's why I'm asking you...

102
00:05:38,845 --> 00:05:41,676
to replace me and become a player...

103
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,285
on my behalf.

104
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:50,686
(The Player 2: Master of Swindlers)

105
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:52,626
- Cheers. - Cheers.

106
00:05:53,825 --> 00:05:56,025
Let's replace any sad thoughts with work.

107
00:05:56,325 --> 00:05:57,525
What was your name again?

108
00:05:57,765 --> 00:05:59,034
- What? I'm Hyun Seo. - Hyun Seo?

109
00:05:59,035 --> 00:06:00,334
- Hyun Seo. - What's up with the ring?

110
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:02,335
- My ring? - What are you wearing?

111
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:03,866
Where's the Grim Reaper?

112
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:05,366
Why didn't he take that jerk?

113
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,575
How could he get away with this in court? I really don't get it.

114
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:15,015
I'm going to kill that jerk tonight. Mark my words.

115
00:06:16,345 --> 00:06:18,515
Gosh. Seriously.

116
00:06:19,415 --> 00:06:21,316
I told you I didn't want to play cards toward the end.

117
00:06:21,655 --> 00:06:24,386
Well, let's just pretend we made a donation to a charity.

118
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:26,356
What nonsense is that?

119
00:06:26,796 --> 00:06:29,025
Poor people will stay poor. Seriously.

120
00:06:29,395 --> 00:06:30,566
Unbelievable.

121
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,395
Darn it.

122
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,945
Who put this darn motorcycle here? This is bad luck.

123
00:06:42,946 --> 00:06:45,045
Hey, what are you doing?

124
00:06:45,046 --> 00:06:46,116
Come on!

125
00:06:47,345 --> 00:06:49,615
Think about all the trouble I had to go through because of that.

126
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:50,886
Why did you park it here?

127
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:54,185
Those stupid delivery guys ought to take a different road.

128
00:06:54,186 --> 00:06:55,556
So I don't see them. Those poor...

129
00:06:56,856 --> 00:06:57,856
Hey.

130
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:01,725
Darn it. What's your problem?

131
00:07:04,395 --> 00:07:06,265
It's been so long. How long has it been?

132
00:07:07,835 --> 00:07:09,806
Gosh. Who are you?

133
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:12,535
Come on, man. Stop joking.

134
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:14,834
Hey.

135
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,904
How come you haven't changed one bit?

136
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:19,774
Because you haven't changed at all, I'm quite flustered.

137
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:21,515
Let go of me.

138
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:23,816
What? Do you have something to say to me?

139
00:07:24,116 --> 00:07:25,145
No.

140
00:07:25,515 --> 00:07:26,584
Have a nice time with your friend.

141
00:07:26,585 --> 00:07:28,355
- Hey. - Bye.

142
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:30,755
- Gosh. Hey, buddy. - Who are you?

143
00:07:30,756 --> 00:07:33,824
Gosh. Will you keep playing dumb with me?

144
00:07:33,825 --> 00:07:35,795
Hey, mister!

145
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:37,764
- Just talk it out. Come on. - He's my buddy. We're just playing.

146
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:38,824
What buddy? I don't think...

147
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,095
- you guys are friends. - No!

148
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:41,566
Come on, mister. We're good friends.

149
00:07:41,636 --> 00:07:43,205
- Are you sure? - Yes, he's my friend.

150
00:07:43,606 --> 00:07:45,676
- Have fun then. Bye. - Gosh, thanks.

151
00:07:47,905 --> 00:07:48,946
Hey.

152
00:07:50,376 --> 00:07:51,876
You're hurting my feelings.

153
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:55,315
We served together in Nonsan. Come on, man.

154
00:07:55,316 --> 00:07:57,414
Seriously. Stop acting so clueless.

155
00:07:57,415 --> 00:07:58,446
The boot camp?

156
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:00,715
I got exempted from the military duty!

157
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:07,196
Wait.

158
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:13,196
You're not him. I'm sorry.

159
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:15,535
I must have had one too many. Goodness.

160
00:08:16,306 --> 00:08:17,405
I'm sorry.

161
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:20,034
You crazy jerk.

162
00:08:20,035 --> 00:08:22,005
Come on. "Crazy jerk?"

163
00:08:22,006 --> 00:08:23,204
Don't use such foul language.

164
00:08:23,205 --> 00:08:24,806
- Be nice. You're scaring me. - Gosh.

165
00:08:25,676 --> 00:08:27,515
- You're just a lunatic. - Gosh.

166
00:08:27,746 --> 00:08:29,784
How could you call me a lunatic now?

167
00:08:29,785 --> 00:08:31,886
That's why I'm apologizing to you...

168
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:36,486
when there are people who don't even apologize after killing a man.

169
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:40,395
Let's not make a big deal out of this.

170
00:08:42,996 --> 00:08:44,325
I'll take that as an agreement.

171
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:56,006
You didn't kill him, though.

172
00:08:56,506 --> 00:08:58,844
I did feel good watching him getting smacked.

173
00:08:58,845 --> 00:09:00,344
Aren't you glad you came out for some fresh air?

174
00:09:00,345 --> 00:09:01,514
As if.

175
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:03,715
I was so close to killing him, but I controlled myself.

176
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:06,515
- So did you get it done? - Of course.

177
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,086
- Stage One is complete. - You're so fast as expected.

178
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:18,966
(Stage 1: Collect evidence. Complete!)

179
00:09:23,136 --> 00:09:24,335
Why on earth?

180
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:25,506
(Prosecutor Kwak Do Soo)

181
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:27,435
Prosecutor Kwak. Is there a problem?

182
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:30,545
Can you find a phone number for me?

183
00:09:31,006 --> 00:09:32,076
A phone number?

184
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:51,596
It's been a while.

185
00:09:52,065 --> 00:09:53,164
Yes, it has.

186
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:54,866
It's our first time meeting after graduating from law school.

187
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:58,035
Surprising people must be your hobby.

188
00:09:58,535 --> 00:09:59,735
Since you graduated at the top of our class,

189
00:09:59,736 --> 00:10:00,934
I thought you would be the first one...

190
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:03,045
to join the prosecution or to take the bench.

191
00:10:03,476 --> 00:10:05,045
How did you end up on my radar?

192
00:10:05,476 --> 00:10:08,376
Unexpectedly, the sword or the scale didn't suit my style.

193
00:10:09,545 --> 00:10:12,456
But running around with criminals suits your style?

194
00:10:17,126 --> 00:10:19,295
What is it? What's the deal with you?

195
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:21,155
Well,

196
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:24,695
if I have to answer that, I would say I'm being myself.

197
00:10:25,195 --> 00:10:27,765
You can't use your silver tongue to weasel your way out of this.

198
00:10:29,866 --> 00:10:31,665
I don't know what you're up to,

199
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,804
but Kang Ha Ri and his gang are clearly criminals.

200
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:37,476
And it seems to me that you, a law school graduate,

201
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:40,376
are on the same side with those criminals.

202
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:42,045
Am I wrong?

203
00:10:43,045 --> 00:10:44,685
Then you can indict me.

204
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:49,055
Of course, you must do that after getting some hard evidence on me.

205
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:53,326
- Ta-da. - What's that?

206
00:10:54,226 --> 00:10:55,726
I'll turn this into a masterpiece.

207
00:10:56,765 --> 00:10:57,996
What next?

208
00:10:58,665 --> 00:11:00,736
I'll use this to infiltrate our enemy's camp.

209
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:03,106
Gosh. Just like the Trojan horse.

210
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:04,736
Bingo.

211
00:11:04,905 --> 00:11:10,905
(Stage 2: Get the Trojan horse manufactured.)

212
00:11:14,545 --> 00:11:15,616
Excuse me.

213
00:11:29,765 --> 00:11:30,895
Sir.

214
00:11:33,395 --> 00:11:34,395
Sir?

215
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,876
Mr. Jun Jung Ho!

216
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:54,154
(Jun Jung Ho: A sculpture artist)

217
00:11:54,155 --> 00:11:55,284
(Used to be popular in the underground art scene, )

218
00:11:55,285 --> 00:11:56,456
(but has been keeping a low profile without releasing any artwork)

219
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:58,956
Hello.

220
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:01,055
Who are you?

221
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,525
You're Mr. Jun Jung Ho, right?

222
00:12:05,295 --> 00:12:08,295
Professor Seo of Seoam University told me about you.

223
00:12:08,435 --> 00:12:11,206
You see, ateliers are like rooms of soul...

224
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:12,905
for artists.

225
00:12:13,706 --> 00:12:16,905
If a stranger were to barge into your room of soul,

226
00:12:17,175 --> 00:12:18,675
would you be happy about that?

227
00:12:19,045 --> 00:12:20,076
Gosh.

228
00:12:20,576 --> 00:12:23,415
I'm not sure. I never had a room like that.

229
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,115
Right. Enough about that.

230
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:27,956
I'd like to ask you to create a piece for me.

231
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:30,226
I want to make something like this.

232
00:12:30,685 --> 00:12:32,895
- The size... - You know what?

233
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:35,255
I don't want to talk about art...

234
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:38,025
with someone who knows nothing about art.

235
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:39,736
Please leave.

236
00:12:40,596 --> 00:12:41,636
Mr. Jun.

237
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,815
How big do you want it?

238
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:56,315
About this big?

239
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,415
Okay.

240
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:03,856
Gosh. You're here, Eun Na.

241

243

(the 1st blogger to have over 800,000 subscribers)

244
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:16,905
Please spread the good word about my gallery.

245
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:22,775
Your gallery is so unique.

246
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,045
I'm counting on you.

247
00:13:30,246 --> 00:13:31,285
Stand there.

248
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:35,055
I'll take it now.

249
00:13:41,856 --> 00:13:45,065
(New post, gallery)

250
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:46,795
Yes. Let's go with that.

251
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:48,765
That makes me look a bit more intelligent.

252
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:52,565
Then what's the title? "Meeting a new side of me."

253
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:54,805
"A cool spot for culture, Baek Gallery."

254

"Hashtag no sponsorships and no ads."

255

Yes.

256
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:03,145
It's her. Let's go.

257
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,216
"Hello, Eun Na."

258
00:14:06,716 --> 00:14:08,615
"I am your..."

259

- Are you going on a blind date? - I'm working here. Come on.

260

I'm trying to get into my character. Don't get in my way.

261
00:14:15,425 --> 00:14:17,726
Gosh. Why is my front hair parting like this?

262
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,136
- Let's go already. - My back hair is messy, right?

263
00:14:21,165 --> 00:14:22,636
Let's go before I mess you up.

264
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,706
Okay. Here I go.

265
00:14:26,836 --> 00:14:27,836
Gosh, I'm nervous.

266
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:36,314
- Eun Na. - Gosh, you startled me.

267
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:38,284
- It's Eun Na, right? - Yes. She is.

268
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:41,485
Gosh. She looks 1,000 times better in person. Seriously.

269
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:43,825
Gosh. Nice to meet you. You know...

270
00:14:43,826 --> 00:14:45,625
Wait. Let go of me. I'm a huge fan of hers.

271
00:14:45,626 --> 00:14:48,625
Seriously. I'm following you on Instagram and YouTube.

272
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:49,925
I have notifications on and everything.

273
00:14:50,596 --> 00:14:52,935
She's really the best.

274
00:14:53,165 --> 00:14:55,934
All right. Thank you for being such a fan.

275
00:14:55,935 --> 00:14:58,735
Hold on. I just want to show her one thing.

276
00:14:58,736 --> 00:15:00,206
Look at this. This is...

277
00:15:00,506 --> 00:15:02,976
This is the list of graduates from London Art School.

278
00:15:03,376 --> 00:15:06,315
These crazy bastards forgot to put you on the list.

279
00:15:06,476 --> 00:15:07,476
Can you believe it?

280
00:15:07,477 --> 00:15:09,314
I'm going to sue these bastards.

281
00:15:09,315 --> 00:15:11,246
And look at this. What is this?

282
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:14,785
Undisclosed advertising contract?

283
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:17,386
This isn't true, right? You didn't do such a thing, right?

284
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:19,496
This isn't all. There's more. Look.

285
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:22,525
Tax evasion! That's not true, right?

286
00:15:22,695 --> 00:15:24,295
You didn't evade taxes, right? This isn't true, right?

287
00:15:24,496 --> 00:15:25,496
And there's more.

288
00:15:26,295 --> 00:15:28,535
- Criminal record for scamming? - Criminal record for scamming?

289
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,534
This really can't be true. I cannot believe that.

290
00:15:31,535 --> 00:15:33,174
- Right? - Of course, it's not.

291
00:15:33,175 --> 00:15:34,636
- What is this... - Who are you?

292
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:37,246
Are you threatening me?

293
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:38,945
Pardon?

294
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,644
I'm not threatening you. I'm such a big fan.

295
00:15:41,645 --> 00:15:43,086
I'm so upset.

296
00:15:44,015 --> 00:15:45,015
But...

297
00:15:46,086 --> 00:15:48,185
I do have a favour to ask.

298
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:52,225
(Stage 3)

00:15:58,065 --> 00:15:59,865
(Stage 4)

(Find a piece of art!)

00:16:09,645 --> 00:16:11,876
(Art Museum)

303
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,246
We don't have time to leisurely look around like this.

304
00:16:19,116 --> 00:16:21,716
Look. There isn't much time until the auction.

305
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:23,756
We barely have enough time to find a piece of art.

306
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,295
- Let's go. - Pick one. I'll buy it for you.

307
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:41,006
Here. Happy? Let's go.

308
00:16:43,576 --> 00:16:44,976
You have a good eye.

309
00:16:48,045 --> 00:16:49,076
That's nice.

310
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:52,956
The slammer. No. Prison.

311
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:56,925
Okay. The name of this piece, "Prison of Flower."

312
00:16:57,456 --> 00:16:59,625
This may look like a normal vase to people,

313
00:16:59,626 --> 00:17:01,626
but from the flowers' perspective,

314
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,966
this is nothing but a prison, don't you think?

315
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:07,136
Can't you hear the flowers' desperate cries?

316
00:17:07,596 --> 00:17:09,805
"I want to get out. Help us. I'm suffocating. Let us go!"

317
00:17:10,206 --> 00:17:11,206
What?

318
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:14,435
Sorry.

319
00:17:14,905 --> 00:17:15,905
Okay.

320
00:17:15,906 --> 00:17:17,275
It should be about 300,000 dollars.

321
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:20,246
Are you saying...

322
00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:23,185
The world-renowned artist Paik Nam June said this.

323
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:25,015
"Art is a scam."

324
00:17:26,886 --> 00:17:29,885
I don't think he was talking about this kind of situation.

325
00:17:29,886 --> 00:17:31,525
We have the piece of art.

326
00:17:32,856 --> 00:17:34,626
We just need one more thing. Follow me.

327
00:17:35,395 --> 00:17:36,595
What else is left?

328
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:38,424
Hey. You need to pay for that!

329
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:39,665
Oh, right.

330
00:17:40,395 --> 00:17:42,234
- I'm so sorry. - That'll be 30 dollars.

331
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:44,366
It's 30 dollars? Could I get 10 dollars off?

332
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:46,336
It's already a good price.

333
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:50,944
(Here is an update on the target.)

334
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,975
What scheme are you cooking up now?

335
00:17:57,148 --> 00:18:00,489
(Hanyang Studio)

336
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:14,968
Hey!

337
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,397
- Go ahead. - Go ahead, Je Yi.

338
00:18:17,398 --> 00:18:19,199
- I got it. - Hey.

339
00:18:19,838 --> 00:18:21,408
- Come on. - Darn it.

340
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:28,078
(Gaehang Chicken)

341
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,549
(Gaehang Chicken)

342
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:34,049
Come on.

343
00:18:34,418 --> 00:18:36,259
Good job.

344
00:18:37,318 --> 00:18:39,358
I told you to hurry up!

345
00:18:39,588 --> 00:18:42,388
That's the fastest I've run in the past ten years.

346
00:18:42,658 --> 00:18:45,199
Hey. There must be enough for us, right?

347
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,769
I hope so.

348
00:18:47,328 --> 00:18:48,898
If we don't get to eat it, you're going to have to pay.

349
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,739
I'll cook eggs for you or something.

350
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:52,709
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

351
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:54,868
Shall we eat?

352
00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:57,209
It's so good.

353
00:18:57,709 --> 00:18:59,749
You haven't even put it in your mouth yet.

354
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:01,348
I can just tell.

355
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:04,378
- Gosh. - Why? Is it not that good?

356
00:19:05,418 --> 00:19:06,449
It's so good.

357
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:08,689
I'm so upset that I'm just now discovering this.

358
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:13,858
That Maillard reaction is really hitting my tongue.

359
00:19:14,128 --> 00:19:18,828
It feels as if I'm watching a philharmonic perform.

360
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:20,969
- How lame. - By the way,

361
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:24,067
why did Ha Ri say no to eating something so delicious?

362
00:19:24,068 --> 00:19:26,068
Is he too full from getting cursed at too much?

363
00:19:35,378 --> 00:19:37,978
I thought we were going to do something very important.

364
00:19:37,979 --> 00:19:40,088
This is important. We all work hard to eat and live.

365
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:42,118
That's surprising.

366
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:45,019
You always act as if you only live for today.

367
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:46,789
You misunderstood me.

368
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:49,259
I'm going to live happily for a long time.

369
00:19:50,428 --> 00:19:51,559
Try some. This place is good.

370
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:53,428
I know.

371
00:19:54,128 --> 00:19:55,299
You haven't even tried.

372
00:19:55,898 --> 00:19:56,969
I've been here before.

373
00:19:57,969 --> 00:19:59,039
With who?

374
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,068
With someone I loved.

375
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,739
You even have time for love. How romantic.

376
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:08,908
I used to be.

377
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:15,519
Should we talk about something else?

378
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:18,059
I talked to Byung Min earlier.

379
00:20:18,658 --> 00:20:20,928
Really? Are they doing well?

380
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:24,299
Of course. Mr. Damien Lee.

381
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:32,598
Okay. Done.

386

00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,158
Look over here.

388
00:20:58,358 --> 00:20:59,628
Very nice.

389
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:02,939
How handsome. Hold the vase as if it's your girlfriend.

390
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:06,208
You could be a professional model. Amazing.

391
00:21:06,209 --> 00:21:07,838
Tilt your head a bit. Great.

392
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:10,039
So cool.

393
00:21:10,178 --> 00:21:11,338
I've never done anything like this before.

394
00:21:13,348 --> 00:21:15,377
Very nice!

395

Let's keep going. Great.

396
00:21:17,178 --> 00:21:18,479
Very nice.

397

Take a look, Damien.

398
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:24,088
- Oh, my. - They turned out nicely.

399
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:26,759
Good. Nice. Okay.

400

Listen. I think I'm so cut out to bet on stuff.

445
00:23:54,838 --> 00:23:56,137
What a shame.

446
00:23:56,138 --> 00:23:58,208
I could've watched you...

pay 320,000 dollars for a vase.

448

Hi.

459
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:34,578
What are you doing over here?

460
00:24:37,449 --> 00:24:39,178
I'm trash.

461
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:42,189
- Darn it. - Did it not work?

462
00:24:43,158 --> 00:24:45,858
I just can't finish it.

463
00:24:46,189 --> 00:24:48,989
Let's have a look at what you made so far.

464
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:50,529
Come on.

465
00:25:05,578 --> 00:25:07,949
What's the problem? It's done.

466
00:25:08,178 --> 00:25:09,249
No.

467
00:25:09,878 --> 00:25:13,588
I need to put the finishing touch on the eyes.

468
00:25:14,588 --> 00:25:15,588
The eyes.

469
00:25:17,118 --> 00:25:18,158
I can't do it.

470
00:25:18,418 --> 00:25:20,588
What's the problem with the eyes?

471
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,259
You're so terrible!

472
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:26,199
This is why I should never talk to people who don't know art.

473
00:25:26,398 --> 00:25:28,198
The finishing touch is in the eyes.

474
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:30,298
When the artist dotted the eyes of his dragon,

475
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:32,367
it came alive and flew away.

476
00:25:32,368 --> 00:25:35,438
This horse needs its eyes dotted...

477
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:38,509
if it's to gain life and become a masterpiece!

478
00:25:39,378 --> 00:25:40,408
Gosh.

479
00:25:46,148 --> 00:25:47,588
- What? - Hey.

480
00:25:48,219 --> 00:25:50,258

481
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:51,959
you could lose your life...

482
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:56,029
while trying to give life to a horse you made?

483
00:26:00,428 --> 00:26:01,898
I contacted the school.

484
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:03,898
He is a graduate.

485
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:06,568
Such a genius stayed quiet for so long?

486
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:09,809
Then he suddenly appeared?

487
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,178
Are the party preparations going well?

488
00:26:14,408 --> 00:26:15,408
Yes.

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,568
I'm honoured you could make it.

494
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:44,239
I was impressed by the work you auctioned.

495
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,539
You flatter me.

496
00:26:46,378 --> 00:26:47,378
By the way,

497
00:26:47,878 --> 00:26:50,418
I heard you studied at the British National Academy.

498
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:52,979
Yes. I graduated about...

499
00:26:53,489 --> 00:26:55,019
five years ago.

500
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,088
I visited a few times to attend some exhibitions.

501
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:01,558
I used to drop by...

502
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,199
the annex lounge for a coffee.

503
00:27:04,928 --> 00:27:06,029
I see.

504
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:08,299
You know the place.

505
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:11,397
The window seat facing the garden was practically mine.

506
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:14,439
The view from there when the sun sets...

507
00:27:14,838 --> 00:27:16,309
It's unforgettable.

508
00:27:16,578 --> 00:27:17,638
Is it?

509
00:27:18,378 --> 00:27:19,408
How strange.

510
00:27:19,949 --> 00:27:22,749
The annex lounge opened three years ago.

511
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:25,279
It used to be an exhibition hall.

512
00:27:27,118 --> 00:27:28,519
Oh, did it?

513
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,689
I must have mixed it up...

514
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:33,229
with the lounge in the third hall.

515
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:35,559
I guess that's possible.

516
00:27:36,699 --> 00:27:38,559
How about a drink?

517
00:27:40,828 --> 00:27:42,068
Your guest is here.

518
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:44,239
Hey, Jonathan.

519
00:27:57,118 --> 00:27:59,147
Out of the Koreans who studied there,

520
00:27:59,148 --> 00:28:00,847
these three are active professionals.

521
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:03,357
These two live abroad right now,

522
00:28:03,358 --> 00:28:04,958
and only one lives here.

523
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:06,789
It's this one guy.

524
00:28:06,928 --> 00:28:08,559
Jonathan Joe.

525
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:13,098
Thanks for coming.

526
00:28:13,499 --> 00:28:15,568
You two studied at the same place.

527
00:28:16,739 --> 00:28:19,668
Not many Koreans went to the British National Academy.

528
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:21,439
You must know each other well.

529
00:28:22,338 --> 00:28:23,378
Well...

530
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:26,749
I didn't exactly stay in touch with my fellow graduates.

531
00:28:27,209 --> 00:28:29,918
Long time no see, Damien Lee.

532
00:28:34,118 --> 00:28:36,918
I was a quiet guy in school, so I didn't think you'd remember me.

533
00:28:37,088 --> 00:28:38,917
It's been a while. Jonathan, right?

534
00:28:38,918 --> 00:28:40,558
That's right.

535
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,189
I'm doing well. How about you?

536
00:28:46,428 --> 00:28:48,029
Are you Joe Young Woong?

537
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:50,668
It's my Korean name.

538
00:28:52,138 --> 00:28:54,009
Oh, we're from...

539
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:56,468
Suseo Police Station's Violent Crimes Unit.

540
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:57,479
(Government Pass, Park Soo Hwan)

541
00:28:57,678 --> 00:28:58,779
Police?

542
00:28:59,078 --> 00:29:01,478
What would the police have to do with me?

543
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:03,817
We're investigating companies...

544
00:29:03,818 --> 00:29:05,719
that are using artwork...

545
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:07,049
to gather illegal slush funds.

546
00:29:07,348 --> 00:29:10,888
It looks like a few professionals are involved.

547
00:29:11,189 --> 00:29:13,328
I have nothing to do with that.

548
00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:15,529
Such problems in the art world...

549
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:19,029
I am really sick and tired of it.

550
00:29:21,368 --> 00:29:22,368
I know.

551
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:24,638
I know. But...

552
00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:30,338
We need your cooperation with the investigation.

553
00:29:32,078 --> 00:29:33,908
Cooperation... Investigation...

554
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:38,749
You must be pleased to reconnect.

555
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:41,087
- Yes. - I'll let you two chat.

556
00:29:41,088 --> 00:29:42,118
Thanks.

557
00:29:44,918 --> 00:29:46,258
How have you been?

558
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:47,928
It has been such a long time.

559
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:51,559
Good job.

560
00:29:52,128 --> 00:29:54,368
I was trembling so bad, you know.

561
00:29:55,229 --> 00:29:56,568
Look at my hands shaking.

562
00:29:58,469 --> 00:30:00,338
You did a great deed.

563
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,578
You don't have to go too far.

564
00:30:08,578 --> 00:30:11,279
(WQ Group chairman Min Byung Gyu's home)

565
00:30:11,878 --> 00:30:12,878
Hello.

566
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:15,549
You're late. You said you'd come by during the day.

567
00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:18,489
The chairman and his wife waited all day before going out.

568
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,988
Sorry. We found an issue with the product...

569
00:30:20,989 --> 00:30:23,289
and had to wait until we got a new one.

570
00:30:23,858 --> 00:30:24,898
Oh, no.

571
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:30,739
I'm sorry, but could I use the bathroom?

572
00:30:31,338 --> 00:30:33,338
- The bathroom? - Yes.

573
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:36,367
Use the one upstairs.

574
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:37,509
Okay, thanks.

575
00:30:37,578 --> 00:30:39,377
Hey, can you finish up for me?

576
00:30:39,378 --> 00:30:41,178
I really need to... Darn it.

577
00:30:42,848 --> 00:30:46,018
Hey. Be sure not to scratch anything.

578
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:47,049
Okay.

579
00:31:05,469 --> 00:31:07,039
What do you mean?

580
00:31:07,969 --> 00:31:09,238
You can't say that now.

581
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:11,279
The piece comes in tomorrow.

582
00:31:13,178 --> 00:31:15,009
That's not right, is it?

583
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:19,117
Let's just forget it.

584
00:31:19,118 --> 00:31:20,449
The deal's off.

585
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:24,219
Darn it.

586
00:31:24,358 --> 00:31:25,489
Here you are.

587
00:31:27,229 --> 00:31:29,029
I thought you'd left and was slightly upset.

588
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:30,699
Oh, right.

589
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:32,999
Sorry for the noise.

590
00:31:34,068 --> 00:31:36,798
I didn't mean to overhear,

591
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,368
but is there a problem?

592
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:41,439
It's nothing, really.

593
00:31:42,408 --> 00:31:44,578
Why don't you tell me about it?

594
00:31:45,078 --> 00:31:46,948
It seemed to involve your work.

595
00:31:46,949 --> 00:31:48,009
Well...

596
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:53,949
I'm expecting a delivery of a piece tomorrow from the US.

597
00:31:54,249 --> 00:31:56,648
I need a place to store it until it's revealed.

598
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,289
I have a problem with space.

599
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,458
- I see. - It's a huge thing,

600
00:32:01,459 --> 00:32:02,928
so it's quite an issue.

601
00:32:04,098 --> 00:32:05,759
I'm in such a bind.

602
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:10,939
That's good.

603
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:13,199
What?

604
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:16,408
I think I can help you with that.

605
00:32:16,908 --> 00:32:17,979
But...

606
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:21,478
It's a really big piece.

607
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:22,809
It won't be easy.

608
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:32,989
Baek Gallery.

609
00:32:34,459 --> 00:32:35,559
This was the target.

610
00:32:37,358 --> 00:32:39,098
Can you get me a phone number?

611
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,309
It'll be there in an hour.

612
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:54,178
Okay. We'll be ready too.

613
00:32:54,578 --> 00:32:55,779
See you later.

614
00:33:01,918 --> 00:33:02,949
Who are you?

615
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:08,828
(Artwork Transport)

616
00:33:11,928 --> 00:33:14,898
Is this how the Greek soldiers in the Trojan horse felt?

617
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:17,838
Greek? Weren't the Trojan men in the Trojan horse?

618
00:33:18,668 --> 00:33:20,838
The Greeks sent the horse to Troy.

619
00:33:21,108 --> 00:33:22,168
Where's Troy, then?

620
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:23,539
Troy?

621
00:33:24,908 --> 00:33:27,077
Is Troy modern day Turkey?

622
00:33:27,078 --> 00:33:28,448
No, is it just a myth?

623
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:30,009
No, it's not Turkey.

624
00:33:30,348 --> 00:33:31,519
I'll look it up.

625
00:33:32,418 --> 00:33:33,479
Let's see.

626
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:36,647
It's Turkiye.

627
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:38,018
Turkiye is Turkey, moron.

628
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:39,258
Famous for their ice cream.

629
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:41,327
Since we mentioned Turkey, how about kebab for dinner?

630
00:33:41,328 --> 00:33:42,958
Kebab sounds good.

631
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:45,458
And for Greece, we'll have Greek yogurt.

632
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:46,927
It might be nice as a dip.

633
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:49,027
Being hungry is helping your brain work.

634
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,868
- Right? - You really know something.

635
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:53,907
We unified the wars Before Christ with food.

636
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:56,439
- Okay, nice. - I'm in.

637
00:33:57,109 --> 00:33:58,508
I'd rather run away to Turkey than eat.

638
00:33:58,979 --> 00:34:00,448
Je Yi. How about some kebab?

639
00:34:00,879 --> 00:34:02,309
This way. That's it.

640
00:34:02,548 --> 00:34:03,718
Look out.

641
00:34:04,149 --> 00:34:05,448
Okay. Watch the sides.

642
00:34:08,948 --> 00:34:11,089
Working on it must've been hard.

643
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:14,388
Hard? No way. It's the fate of an artist.

644
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:17,459
I've emptied the space. Let's go.

645
00:34:17,828 --> 00:34:19,158
All right. Let's go.

646
00:34:28,309 --> 00:34:29,309
(Log in with simple PIN)

647
00:34:36,578 --> 00:34:37,819
- This way. - Okay.

648
00:34:43,689 --> 00:34:44,789
Here we go.

649
00:34:51,658 --> 00:34:52,658
It's all set.

650
00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:55,729
- We only need your signature here. - Okay.

651
00:34:57,339 --> 00:34:58,339
- Thank you. - No, thank you.

652
00:34:58,339 --> 00:34:59,339
- Bye. - Bye.

653
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:00,339
Bye.

654
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:07,278
The lighting, temperature, and humidity.

655
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:09,809
Everything is perfect.

656
00:35:10,778 --> 00:35:14,548
If you look over there, we use an automated system.

657
00:35:15,189 --> 00:35:16,689
It's a relief you like it.

658
00:35:19,258 --> 00:35:21,928
But compared to the space, there aren't many artworks.

659
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:26,999
Is there something behind it over there?

660
00:35:28,499 --> 00:35:31,169
You sure have a good hunch to pinpoint things.

661
00:35:39,879 --> 00:35:40,947
(20 million dollars, 25 million dollars)

662
00:35:40,948 --> 00:35:42,109
Oh, my gosh.

663
00:35:45,348 --> 00:35:46,448
It's amazing.

664
00:35:47,618 --> 00:35:49,789
Each of them is worth around 20 million dollars.

665
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:54,959
The artworks in books are actually here.

666
00:35:57,129 --> 00:35:58,499
Shall we head to the office now?

667
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:00,399
You need to sign the consignment agreement.

668
00:36:02,229 --> 00:36:03,229
Of course.

669
00:36:35,229 --> 00:36:36,269
My legs are numb.

670
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:48,649
I had my doubts, you know?

671
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,548
Are you telling me to ride this?

672
00:36:52,448 --> 00:36:54,117
Think of it as riding a ride.

673
00:36:54,118 --> 00:36:55,789
- Are you kidding me? - No.

674
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,019
You're riding it. The horse.

675
00:37:00,258 --> 00:37:04,059
What a bummer. Had it been a bit bigger, I would've ridden it.

676
00:37:04,928 --> 00:37:05,959
Is that so?

677
00:37:06,158 --> 00:37:08,628
Then I'll have the size changed to large.

678
00:37:08,629 --> 00:37:10,268
- No, don't. - Je Yi.

679
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,339
- What is it? - Here's what I think.

680
00:37:13,468 --> 00:37:15,508
This wooden horse is something you'd ride, right?

681
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:19,178
Now then, who is the best driver here?

682
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:21,979
- It's obviously Cha Je Yi. - It's obviously Cha Je Yi.

683
00:37:41,669 --> 00:37:42,968
I finally feel relieved.

684
00:37:43,669 --> 00:37:46,198
Finding a greater place than this must be impossible in Korea.

685
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:47,609
Of course.

686
00:37:47,968 --> 00:37:50,038
I paid great attention to everything...

687
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:52,008
from the interior conditions to security.

688
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,908
Your work will be kept in the perfect vacuum state.

689
00:37:56,178 --> 00:37:58,249
So don't worry, Mr. Damien Lee.

690
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:02,348
Director Baek.

691
00:38:05,988 --> 00:38:07,658
Did you say vacuum state?

692
00:38:08,229 --> 00:38:09,229
Yes.

693
00:38:09,729 --> 00:38:12,859
The system turns on the minute the storage door closes.

694
00:38:18,138 --> 00:38:19,138
"Vacuum?"

695
00:38:19,539 --> 00:38:21,539
All air will be released? Then what about Je Yi?

696
00:38:21,669 --> 00:38:23,008
"Air will be released?"

697
00:38:23,169 --> 00:38:25,439
Air will be... Why would the air be released?

698
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:28,348
- The power... - Hold on. Hush. Give me a second.

699
00:38:28,578 --> 00:38:31,178
- Why would they release the air? - I don't know.

700
00:38:34,948 --> 00:38:35,948
Director Baek.

701
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:37,919
I need to use the restroom.

702
00:38:39,218 --> 00:38:40,559
It's over there.

703
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:42,459
I'll be at the office first.

704
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:43,959
All right.

705
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:53,499
You heard her, right?

706
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,039
Byung Min. Get into the security system and open the storage door.

707
00:38:56,269 --> 00:38:57,808
- Hurry. - Wait.

708
00:38:57,809 --> 00:38:59,777
- I'll try it. Give me time. - Do it quickly.

709
00:38:59,778 --> 00:39:00,778
I haven't done this before.

710
00:39:00,778 --> 00:39:01,778
- Hold on. - Hurry.

711
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:03,508
How do I do it? Darn it.

712
00:39:05,178 --> 00:39:07,948
Je Yi. Leave that place as soon as possible. It's too dangerous.

713
00:39:08,789 --> 00:39:10,048
Can you hear me, Cha Je Yi?

714
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,589
I can, okay?

715
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:14,459
Don't overdo it, Je Yi. Leave that place. Listen to me.

716
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:17,298
We can abort the plan. Now move!

717
00:39:18,698 --> 00:39:19,698
Je Yi?

718
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:25,138
The vacuum system...

719
00:39:26,169 --> 00:39:27,238
must be real.

720
00:39:29,908 --> 00:39:31,738
I'll rush as much as possible.

721
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:38,978
- Je Yi. - Quickly do something.

722
00:39:38,979 --> 00:39:40,118
- Can you hear me, Je Yi? - Darn it.

723
00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:42,518
Answer me if you can hear me, Je Yi.

724
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:43,589
Cha Je Yi!

725
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:47,959
I can't...

726
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:49,928
breathe.

727
00:39:50,698 --> 00:39:51,828
How much longer, Byung Min?

728
00:39:51,899 --> 00:39:52,958
Hold on. I got it!

729
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:54,068
- The first step is complete. - Good.

730
00:39:54,069 --> 00:39:55,697
Hang in there a bit more, Je Yi.

731
00:39:55,698 --> 00:39:57,338
- Breathe deeply, Je Yi. - Abdominal breathing!

732
00:39:57,339 --> 00:39:59,269
- Breathe with your abdominal. - Hang in there, Je Yi!

733
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,967
Breathe slowly.

734
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:03,539
- Abdominal breathing. - Hold on. This is my first time.

735
00:40:03,709 --> 00:40:05,138
Hurry up, Byung Min! Come on!

736
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:07,578
Cha Je Yi!

737
00:40:11,379 --> 00:40:12,379
Je Yi.

738
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,348
Cha Je Yi.

739
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:20,988
This isn't going to work. Abort.

740
00:40:21,388 --> 00:40:22,758
Abort the plan.

741
00:40:25,598 --> 00:40:26,598
Director Baek.

742
00:40:29,028 --> 00:40:30,229
What's the rush?

743
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:33,039
Weren't you using the restroom? You took your sweet time.

744
00:40:33,738 --> 00:40:34,738
Actually...

745
00:40:38,008 --> 00:40:39,138
I suffer from constipation.

746
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:42,649
I do take probiotics in the morning.

747
00:40:45,379 --> 00:40:46,379
I see.

748
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,718
Taking probiotics every morning is indeed important.

749
00:40:49,189 --> 00:40:50,249
Right.

750
00:40:51,718 --> 00:40:53,019
We have an invited guest.

751
00:40:55,258 --> 00:40:56,289
Say hi to him.

752
00:41:02,729 --> 00:41:03,729
Hi.

753
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:05,899
My name is Jun Jung Ho.

754
00:41:06,669 --> 00:41:09,169
- And? - You have a storage, yes?

755
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:11,738
It's currently being raided.

756
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:14,078
- Excuse me? - Damien Lee.

757
00:41:14,578 --> 00:41:15,678
His real name is Kang Ha Ri.

758
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:19,149
Introducing him is unnecessary, right?

759
00:41:19,848 --> 00:41:22,189
After all, you two know each other.

760
00:41:26,218 --> 00:41:27,859
Director Baek.

761
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:30,358
Let me explain.

762
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:32,698
- Please listen to me first... - Be quiet. Just follow me.

763
00:41:43,609 --> 00:41:44,638
Are you looking for something?

764
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:46,839
- What? - You also look pale.

765
00:41:47,678 --> 00:41:49,778
- Are you feeling unwell? - No.

766
00:41:50,718 --> 00:41:53,519
Honestly, my stomach has been upset since morning.

767
00:41:57,959 --> 00:41:59,359
Oh, they have arrived just in time.

768
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:01,689
I invited some guests over.

769
00:42:03,629 --> 00:42:04,629
Prosecutor.

770
00:42:08,968 --> 00:42:09,968
Hello?

771
00:42:10,499 --> 00:42:11,499
Yes.

772
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:15,008
"The Prosecution Service?" Why?

773
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:19,439
"Kang Ha Ri?"

774
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:23,209
I'm happy to see you're doing well.

775
00:42:23,879 --> 00:42:25,248
Do you know how worried I was,

776
00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:27,749
thinking you might've ended up in a coffin when you should be in jail?

777
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:29,589
It's this one.

778
00:42:29,988 --> 00:42:31,319
Damien Lee, my foot.

779
00:42:33,158 --> 00:42:34,289
- Open the door. - Yes, sir.

780
00:42:34,459 --> 00:42:36,559
What are you doing to my artwork?

781
00:42:36,828 --> 00:42:38,628
Don't worry. It's not an artwork.

782
00:42:38,629 --> 00:42:40,527
Do you even know what art is?

783
00:42:40,528 --> 00:42:42,769
Of course, I do. I'm an artist myself.

784
00:42:43,069 --> 00:42:45,138
An artist in criminal psychology.

785
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:48,638
Run wild all you want. You're still in the palm of my hand.

786
00:42:50,908 --> 00:42:52,078
It's empty inside.

787
00:42:58,178 --> 00:42:59,578
I can't believe this.

788
00:43:00,118 --> 00:43:02,318
What on earth are you guys looking for?

789
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,388
Move it.

790
00:43:03,919 --> 00:43:05,019
I'm sorry, Troy.

791
00:43:10,189 --> 00:43:11,198
- What? - I'm sorry.

792

(Hona Industries Chairman Lee Doo Young's House)

793
00:43:17,129 --> 00:43:18,138
Ma'am?

794
00:43:19,399 --> 00:43:20,737
The villagers,

795
00:43:20,738 --> 00:43:21,867
who were diagnosed with cancer due to the waste water,

796
00:43:21,868 --> 00:43:22,968
- filed a class-action suit. - There it is.

797
00:43:23,638 --> 00:43:26,709
But Hona Industries won because of insufficient proof.

798
00:43:28,479 --> 00:43:31,278
Excuse me. Can you turn off the computers in the secretary's office?

799
00:43:33,249 --> 00:43:34,249
Thank you.

800
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,157

00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,229
against those who had their houses stolen.

805
00:43:50,499 --> 00:43:53,439
of his student's girlfriend, making the student take his own life,

806
00:43:53,638 --> 00:43:55,008
was also acquitted.

807
00:43:58,008 --> 00:43:59,278
Gosh.

808
00:44:01,809 --> 00:44:03,448
Unbelievable.

809
00:44:07,048 --> 00:44:09,519
What? Is something wrong?

810
00:44:16,758 --> 00:44:18,499
There must have been a mistake.

811
00:44:18,959 --> 00:44:21,698
I'm sorry, Prosecutor Kwak. I made you come here for nothing.

812
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,439
I'll make up for this sometime soon.

813
00:44:25,138 --> 00:44:27,539
Well, you don't have to make it up to me.

814
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:30,339
Come on. Now that we have become acquainted,

815
00:44:30,468 --> 00:44:32,078
it'd be nice to stay in touch.

You think so?

But...

819
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:41,948
I don't.

820

It would've been great if you ran a gym, not a gallery.

821

I recently used up all of my personal training sessions.

Anyway, I'm sorry about this.

828
00:45:11,749 --> 00:45:14,618
Gosh. What's that? What's happening?

829
00:45:14,888 --> 00:45:16,019
(Chairman Lee Doo Young of Hona Industries)

830
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:17,888
- Gosh. - Step back.

831
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:21,629
It's the ledger.

832
00:45:22,388 --> 00:45:23,629
The bribe ledger.

833
00:45:25,328 --> 00:45:28,229
Gosh. You said you would make it up to me later.

834
00:45:28,468 --> 00:45:29,698
But that was fast.

835
00:45:31,399 --> 00:45:33,598
All right. Collect all the evidence here.

836
00:45:34,638 --> 00:45:37,738
Please politely escort Director Baek.

837
00:45:37,908 --> 00:45:39,407
Prosecutor Kwak. I know nothing about this.

838
00:45:39,408 --> 00:45:42,178
Let go. Come on, let go of me. I don't know anything about this.

839
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:43,948
- Prosecutor Kwak! - Bye.

840
00:45:48,118 --> 00:45:50,089
Gosh. He's so not my style.

841
00:45:50,218 --> 00:45:51,859
I guess I have no choice but to get to know him.

842
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:55,229
Hey.

843
00:45:58,129 --> 00:45:59,999
- Me? - Yes, you.

844
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:01,728
- What? - You must come too.

845
00:46:01,729 --> 00:46:02,798
What?

846
00:46:03,028 --> 00:46:05,368
- Wait. Me too? - Yes.

847
00:46:05,468 --> 00:46:06,539
I see.

848
00:46:08,269 --> 00:46:09,439
Let me put some cuffs on you, though.

849
00:46:10,209 --> 00:46:12,209
Gosh. Fine.

850
00:46:12,939 --> 00:46:14,209
Give them to me. I'll do it.

851
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:17,109
Right. On what grounds?

852
00:46:17,178 --> 00:46:20,077
Kang Ha Ri. You're under arrest for fraud.

853
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:21,488
You have the right to remain...

854
00:46:21,819 --> 00:46:23,217
You know your rights, don't you? You're an expert.

855
00:46:23,218 --> 00:46:24,419
Gosh. Yes, I do.

856
00:46:24,859 --> 00:46:26,319
Okay. Yes.

857
00:46:31,828 --> 00:46:32,928
Excuse me.

858
00:46:34,729 --> 00:46:35,798
Here.

859
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:43,038
Keep going.

860
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:44,777
Don't you have artworks that are worth...

861
00:46:44,778 --> 00:46:46,939
tens of millions of dollars in the storage?

862
00:46:47,379 --> 00:46:49,278
He's a con artist, trying to steal those artworks.

863
00:46:49,508 --> 00:46:51,948
Damien Lee, Kang Ha Ri, or whatever his name is.

864
00:46:53,879 --> 00:46:57,419
Calm down. If you take action now, you'll end up losing all of them.

865
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:00,059
The evidence and the artworks too.

866
00:47:03,089 --> 00:47:04,798
What do you want from me then?

867
00:47:06,859 --> 00:47:08,569
What do I want?

868
00:47:10,028 --> 00:47:11,338
WQ Group?

869
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:13,368
You know the money from Chairman Min?

870
00:47:13,939 --> 00:47:15,138
I want half of that money.

871
00:47:15,439 --> 00:47:16,638
Give me one million dollars.

872
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:18,809
I never got any money from him.

873
00:47:19,578 --> 00:47:22,047
Gosh. Did you think I would come all this way...

874
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,908
without good intel?

875
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:26,278
Pay me one million dollars, so you can keep the rest.

876
00:47:26,919 --> 00:47:29,548
You can keep your secret and your artworks.

877
00:47:30,649 --> 00:47:32,758
I don't understand what you mean.

878
00:47:33,258 --> 00:47:35,289
If you keep playing innocent, there's nothing I can do.

879
00:47:35,328 --> 00:47:36,658
Let's pretend we never had this discussion.

880
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:38,598
How about 500,000 dollars?

881
00:47:40,698 --> 00:47:41,999
Let's settle on 500,000 dollars.

882
00:47:49,269 --> 00:47:50,569
No.

883
00:47:51,508 --> 00:47:52,539
I want one million dollars.

884
00:47:52,908 --> 00:47:56,149
Half of the money from Chairman Min was one million dollars.

885
00:47:56,578 --> 00:47:58,648
Chairman Min gave me one million dollars.

886
00:47:58,649 --> 00:48:00,448
Why are you asking me to give you all of it?

887
00:48:03,189 --> 00:48:04,289
Let's take a break.

888
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:06,618
You know, the ledger...

889
00:48:08,089 --> 00:48:09,428
That's fabricated.

890
00:48:09,658 --> 00:48:11,598
I've never kept that kind of ledger.

891
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:13,797
If I can prove that it was fabricated,

892
00:48:13,798 --> 00:48:16,028
you'll have proof that this was all set up.

893
00:48:16,968 --> 00:48:18,899
So you must get the ledger evaluated first.

894
00:48:19,868 --> 00:48:23,138
Gosh. I thought you were a lawyer for a second.

895
00:48:23,638 --> 00:48:24,979
I will verify the authenticity.

896
00:48:25,209 --> 00:48:26,638
But the fabricated ledger...

897
00:48:27,078 --> 00:48:29,678
and the recording of your confession are separate matters.

898
00:48:31,048 --> 00:48:32,048
By the way,

899
00:48:33,218 --> 00:48:36,649
you said you never kept the ledger. By that, do you mean...

900
00:48:37,348 --> 00:48:38,988
you did accept the bribes?

901
00:48:40,359 --> 00:48:42,189
Do you like confessing to your crimes?

902
00:48:43,459 --> 00:48:46,327
- Cheers! - Cheers!

903
00:48:46,328 --> 00:48:47,898
- Good job. - Well done.

904
00:48:47,899 --> 00:48:49,827
- Great job. - Nicely done.

905
00:48:49,828 --> 00:48:50,868
Good work.

906
00:48:54,269 --> 00:48:55,939
Well done, everyone.

907
00:48:56,008 --> 00:48:58,778
Especially, Je Yi. You did an amazing job today.

908
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:00,379
I only get a compliment?

909
00:49:00,738 --> 00:49:02,508
File an insurance claim for an industrial accident.

910
00:49:02,678 --> 00:49:04,348
I almost died in there.

911
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:07,648
Je Yi. Seriously. It was really scary this time.

912
00:49:07,649 --> 00:49:10,088
He didn't say a word. We were running out of time.

913
00:49:10,089 --> 00:49:13,158
And I was typing on my laptop. My hands were shaking like crazy.

914
00:49:13,189 --> 00:49:14,257
I was worried that you'd die.

915
00:49:14,258 --> 00:49:16,257
Oh, my. Poor Je Yi.

916
00:49:16,258 --> 00:49:17,858
Thank you for making it out alive.

917
00:49:17,859 --> 00:49:20,527
I'll be good to you from now on.

918
00:49:20,528 --> 00:49:22,198
Good girl. I'm so proud of you.

919
00:49:23,868 --> 00:49:25,238
This should be considered an industrial accident.

920
00:49:26,198 --> 00:49:28,069
This time, it'll be recognized as an industrial accident.

921
00:49:28,138 --> 00:49:29,669
Mr. Hwang. Did you hear that?

922
00:49:29,809 --> 00:49:31,309
No, I didn't.

923
00:49:31,638 --> 00:49:32,638
What?

924
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,478
My hearing is getting worse with old age.

925
00:49:34,479 --> 00:49:36,149
I only listen to what I want to hear.

926
00:49:37,479 --> 00:49:40,019
Gosh. Seriously. Are you guys for real?

927
00:49:41,249 --> 00:49:42,888
Whenever I think about what I had to go through,

928
00:49:43,948 --> 00:49:45,859
I still feel traumatized.

929
00:49:45,919 --> 00:49:47,189
If you can hear me, answer me.

930
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:48,628
Cha Je Yi!

931
00:49:48,629 --> 00:49:51,058
- I'll just go inside. - No, wait.

932
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:53,157
No! I got it. Go to the next stage.

933
00:49:53,158 --> 00:49:54,628
- Give me five seconds! - Je Yi.

934
00:49:54,629 --> 00:49:56,998
- Director Baek. - I'm almost done. I got it.

935
00:49:56,999 --> 00:49:59,168
- I got it. Je Yi! - Je Yi!

936
00:49:59,169 --> 00:50:00,569
I suffer from constipation.

937
00:50:07,109 --> 00:50:08,978
Director Baek. Let me explain.

938
00:50:08,979 --> 00:50:11,678
- Please listen to me first... - Be quiet. Just follow me.

939
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:14,919
Mission complete.

940
00:50:17,649 --> 00:50:18,689
Hey.

941
00:50:19,718 --> 00:50:20,988
Gosh. I won.

942
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:26,129
There's nothing in here.

943
00:50:34,169 --> 00:50:35,269
(Chairman Min Byung Gyu of WQ Group)

944
00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:36,569
(KCSI)

945
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:41,778
Hold on.

946
00:50:42,948 --> 00:50:44,879
Wait. Here.

947
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,618
How did you persuade Mr. Jun to help us?

948
00:50:48,789 --> 00:50:51,149
He wanted to help us, so any more artworks wouldn't be sold...

949
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:52,888
in the black market.

950
00:50:53,859 --> 00:50:56,229
I thought he was a weirdo. I guess he was a real artist.

951
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:00,629
But what about the ledger? Will it be admissible?

952
00:51:00,729 --> 00:51:02,398
We must rely on the cutting-edge technology.

953
00:51:02,399 --> 00:51:05,668
No. Cutting-edge technology isn't everything. You know?

954
00:51:05,669 --> 00:51:06,939
Let's say...

955
00:51:07,198 --> 00:51:10,967
there's a printer as big as this even when there's no ink inside.

956
00:51:10,968 --> 00:51:12,407
Without me,

957
00:51:12,408 --> 00:51:14,948
you couldn't have copied Director Baek's handwriting.

958
00:51:16,078 --> 00:51:17,078
You're right about that.

959
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:18,847
You know, it's all about my hands.

960
00:51:18,848 --> 00:51:21,488
I have the Hand of Almighty.

961
00:51:25,589 --> 00:51:27,617
It's not important if the ledger is authentic or not.

962
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:29,359
It's important that he found such evidence.

963
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:32,157
With that, he can compare the ledger to bank account statements.

964
00:51:32,158 --> 00:51:34,999
It worked as a trigger to launch a real investigation.

965
00:51:35,729 --> 00:51:38,398
All right. Let's make sure we wrap up this case well.

966
00:51:38,399 --> 00:51:40,237
But today, let's just enjoy our drinks.

967
00:51:40,238 --> 00:51:41,768
- Cheers. - Cheers.

968
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:42,939
Let's drink until we drop.

969
00:51:50,408 --> 00:51:52,819
But how come I'm the only one going down for this?

970
00:51:53,678 --> 00:51:56,749
Why aren't you arresting that con artist, Kang Ha Ri?

971
00:51:57,089 --> 00:51:58,257
He pretended to be an artist...

972
00:51:58,258 --> 00:52:00,589
and sold an artwork at an auction.

973
00:52:02,528 --> 00:52:03,629
He didn't.

974
00:52:04,928 --> 00:52:06,158
Hey, Seung Jun.

975
00:52:06,698 --> 00:52:08,899
Gosh. Damien.

976
00:52:08,928 --> 00:52:09,928
Hey.

977
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:13,539
- Yes. - I need to talk to you.

978
00:52:15,209 --> 00:52:16,668
- Let's talk then. - He returned the money.

979
00:52:16,669 --> 00:52:17,769
- Let's talk. - I...

980
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:19,178
All of it.

981
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,610
You know what? It all worked out for the better.

982
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:32,449
I was getting sick of my social life in Korea.

983
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:33,879
This turned out well. Darn it.

984
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,949
The chairman told you to lie low until the dust settled...

985
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:37,249
I'll do what I want.

986
00:52:37,419 --> 00:52:39,059
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

987
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,390
This is a big scandal in the media.

988
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:44,030
Gosh. Why are they fussing over something that happened in the past?

989
00:52:44,229 --> 00:52:46,228
- The oldest son of WQ Group, - Those poor people must be bored...

990
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:47,299
- Mr. Min, - and have nothing better to do.

991
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,169
was charged with drunk driving and a hit-and-run.

992
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:52,939
But it has been confirmed that he is currently on the run.

993
00:52:52,999 --> 00:52:56,570
The police have made a request for a warrant to arrest Mr. Min.

994
00:52:56,769 --> 00:52:58,039
Here is reporter Hong Seung Chan.

995
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,739
We have acquired video footage of Mr. Min...

996
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,110
causing a scene on the day of the incident.

997
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:05,148
- Wait. What... - He could not control his body...

998
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:06,720
and was even falling over,

999
00:53:06,919 --> 00:53:08,789
but he still got in the driver's seat.

1000
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,819
- Under the influence, - Let's not watch that.

1001
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,659
- he drove around 12am... - Let's go.

1002
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,289
- Is that him? - Mr. Min Won Jun.

1003
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:15,789
- Darn it. - One moment.

1004
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:17,389
Is it true that the incident was fabricated?

1005
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:19,759
You were just put on a travel ban. What do you have to say?

1006
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,860
- Mr. Min. - One moment.

1007
00:53:23,229 --> 00:53:24,398
You must be mistaken.

1008
00:53:24,399 --> 00:53:25,768
Wait.

1009
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,299
- I... Darn it. - Let's go.

1010
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,668
- Let's go. - Were you the culprit?

1011
00:53:28,669 --> 00:53:30,308
What do you have to say?

1012
00:53:30,309 --> 00:53:31,510
- Move out of the way. - One moment.

1013
00:53:42,849 --> 00:53:43,919
Okay.

1014
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:55,030
We're not open yet.

1015
00:53:56,570 --> 00:54:00,240
I see. Are you the parents of Lee Sang Wook?

1016
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:04,970
Who are you?

1017
00:54:05,379 --> 00:54:06,379
Well...

1018
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,610
I'm the director of Dream Star Scholarship Foundation.

1019
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:13,079
Why...

1020
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,890
But how did Sang Wook...

1021
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,360
Here.

1022

(Donation Certificate, Donor, Lee Sang Wook)

1024
00:54:28,769 --> 00:54:30,169
We received a donation...

1025
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:33,039
under Lee Sang Wook's name.

1026
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:35,870
What do you mean...

1027
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,708
Sang Wook...

1028
00:54:37,709 --> 00:54:38,840
Oh, yes.

1029
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,950
I already know what happened to your son.

1030
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,779
An anonymous donor...

1031
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:47,780
really wanted to make a donation under Lee Sang Wook's name.

1032
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,160
- Who was that... - They didn't tell us their name.

1033
00:54:52,519 --> 00:54:55,890
They just said they were someone who knew Sang Wook well.

1034
00:54:56,959 --> 00:54:59,260
They said Sang Wook would've been a great teacher...

1035
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:03,729
because he was such an earnest and honest person...

1036
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:07,269
and that he would've been generous like this...

1037
00:55:07,999 --> 00:55:11,769
to students once he had become a teacher.

1038
00:55:13,879 --> 00:55:15,039
They said...

1039
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:19,079
they just did what Sang Wook would've done.

1040
00:55:21,479 --> 00:55:24,189
Who could have done such a kind thing...

1041
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,660
Thank you so much.

1042
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,260
Thank you.

1043
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,999
Thank you.

1044
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,200
Honey.

1045
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,370
I just realized something.

1046
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,840
- What? - This is what it means to "flex."

1047
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,110
- Gosh. - That was a nice way to use money.

1048
00:55:52,249 --> 00:55:53,249
I feel...

1049
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,120
so proud.

1050
00:55:55,689 --> 00:55:58,219
You should donate all of the money you earn from now on.

1051
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,919
If I do that, I'll end up broke. I'll do it once in a while.

1052
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,329
Gosh.

1053
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,990
That's still great.

1054
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,300
I'm proud of you.

1055
00:56:10,669 --> 00:56:12,240
Hey, we need to take Mr. Hwang.

1056
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,538
He's going to have chicken.

(Fried Chicken)

1058
00:56:18,979 --> 00:56:20,479
Okay. Good work.

1059
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,280
Okay.

1060
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,879
Did the delivery go well?

1061
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,320
Yes.

1062
00:56:30,689 --> 00:56:31,890
Good work, Ha Ri.

1063
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:33,820
You too, Secretary Jung.

Soo Min.

1065
00:56:47,999 --> 00:56:50,039
How much do you trust him?

1066
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,709
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

1067
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,450
I don't mean much by it.

1068
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,749
I'm just curious.

1069
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,149
He is...

1070
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,059
basically like a father to me.

1071
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,729
He was my father's friend, who had passed away.

1072
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:16,899
After my father passed away,

1073
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:19,970
he became my guardian.

1074
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,539
Whenever I'm struggling,

1075
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,749
he always supports me.

1076
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:51,970
Mr. Choi.

1077
00:57:54,439 --> 00:57:55,740
What do I do?

1078
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,280
What do I do?

1079
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,110
I didn't know you two had that story.

1080
00:58:05,919 --> 00:58:06,950
Of course.

1081
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:09,249
You don't know anything about me.

1082

1083
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:26,039
Nothing.

1084
00:58:26,539 --> 00:58:29,209
It was just an accident.

1085
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,668

1086
00:58:31,669 --> 00:58:33,910
We're going to need more time.

1087
00:58:34,439 --> 00:58:35,479
How much more?

1088
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:38,680
I'm not sure. I have a few more things to check.

The reporter who was Jung Soo Min's boyfriend...

1090

was murdered a few years ago.

1091

The case was wrapped up quickly before they caught the culprit.

1092
00:58:47,959 --> 00:58:50,760
There is a rumour that the president was involved.

1093
00:58:51,629 --> 00:58:53,800
I'll look into whether there was someone behind it.
