(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:45,906
Hey, pass the ball!

5
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:48,075
(2 years ago)

6
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:49,075
Hey!

7
00:00:49,376 --> 00:00:50,546
- Pass. - Pass!

8
00:00:51,646 --> 00:00:52,715
No!

9
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:54,375
- No! - Amantius!

10
00:00:54,616 --> 00:00:56,616
- You have a visitor! - Pass the ball!

11
00:01:24,646 --> 00:01:25,676
I heard...

12
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,716
that you do volunteer work and make donations these days.

13
00:01:30,475 --> 00:01:31,774
Why are you doing that when it doesn't suit you?

14
00:01:34,475 --> 00:01:36,585
I'm trying to do stuff that doesn't suit me.

15
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:39,255
Why?

16
00:01:42,885 --> 00:01:44,254
I have sinned a lot.

17
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:46,855
At this rate, I'm headed straight to the fiery pit.

18
00:01:50,124 --> 00:01:51,594
Were you planning on going somewhere nice?

19
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,195
Well...

20
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:56,204
I didn't plan on going somewhere bad either.

21
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:58,665
So, are you protesting so that you get sent to paradise?

22
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:01,534
Or are you trying to earn points for extenuation?

23
00:02:02,374 --> 00:02:03,374
Gosh.

24
00:02:03,605 --> 00:02:05,445
Do you think you can earn points just because you try?

25
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:06,644
You impure punk.

26
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:09,185
I'm going to live a gentle life.

27
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:10,685
I've decided to do so.

28
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:14,185
All right. I understand what you mean.

29
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,784
And your wishes have been delivered to the other side too.

30
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:19,655
So, let's go and do our jobs.

31
00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:21,454
Hey, Kang Ha Ri, you crazy punk.

32
00:02:22,594 --> 00:02:23,924
Are you obsessed with money?

33
00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:25,165
You...

34
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:28,195
After going through all that, how can you...

35
00:02:42,114 --> 00:02:43,185
Forget it. Just leave.

36
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:45,714
It's because we went through that.

37
00:02:54,494 --> 00:02:57,325
It's because we've been through it that I want to do this.

38
00:03:01,494 --> 00:03:02,505
It's not about money.

39
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:04,734
It's about taking revenge.

40
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:09,975
Byung Min will be joining me.

41
00:03:15,984 --> 00:03:17,045
Jin Woong.

42
00:03:19,554 --> 00:03:20,815
Let's just face the wrath of the Almighty.

43
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:02,964
I'm Eddy Jung.

44
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,524
"Eddy Jung?"

45
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:09,265
Eddy Jung...

46
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:13,234
Nice to meet you.

47
00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:15,274
I'm Mr. Song.

48
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:16,475
Nice to meet you.

49
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:19,244
You look familiar.

50
00:04:20,015 --> 00:04:21,815
We must have met before, haven't we?

51
00:04:21,975 --> 00:04:23,015
What?

52
00:04:25,984 --> 00:04:26,984
I'm not sure.

53
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:34,255
I don't believe we've met.

54
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:36,924
How odd.

55
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:40,595
I'm sure we had a lot of fun the last time we met.

56
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:50,375
Stay still.

57
00:04:50,505 --> 00:04:51,774
Stop provoking me.

58
00:04:52,044 --> 00:04:53,075
I warned you.

59
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:54,274
Don't move.

60
00:05:05,154 --> 00:05:07,154
Hey, stop it. Enough.

61
00:05:08,954 --> 00:05:09,964
Stop it.

62
00:05:11,695 --> 00:05:14,865
What are you doing right now?

63
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:16,204
That's exactly what I wanted to ask.

64
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:19,904
Please help me understand...

65
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:24,445
what's going on here.

66
00:05:43,265 --> 00:05:44,794
Hey. We got the location.

67
00:05:46,865 --> 00:05:48,995
Prosecutor Kwak. Here's the address.

68
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:51,805
It's 91 Soenam-ro, Yeongmu-myeon,

69
00:05:51,805 --> 00:05:53,274
Bocheon, Yeongi Province.

70
00:05:53,274 --> 00:05:55,075
Gosh. These jerks.

71
00:05:55,635 --> 00:05:57,305
They must've gone on vacation to a resort.

72
00:05:57,305 --> 00:05:58,604
Goodness. They went pretty far.

73
00:06:02,414 --> 00:06:03,544
I'll be there in an hour.

74
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:05,985
Tell your people to hold on to them until I get there.

75
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:08,555
Yes, I'll do as you say.

76
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,464
If it goes wrong,

77
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:21,565
we'll get rid of the target right away.

78
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:24,065
Who's the main target?

79
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,544
What? Do you not have any reason that will help me understand this?

80
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,245
Hold on.

81
00:06:36,644 --> 00:06:37,644
Mr. Song.

82
00:06:38,844 --> 00:06:40,714
Is this absolutely necessary?

83
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:55,894
Fine. All right.

84
00:06:57,635 --> 00:06:59,274
You got me. I told him to do that.

85
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:01,675
I told him to mess up this deal.

86
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:04,445
I had been suspicious of this deal from the get-go.

87
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:07,844
- What? - Mr. Jung.

88
00:07:08,675 --> 00:07:10,185
What do you mean?

89
00:07:10,414 --> 00:07:12,685
Mr. Kim. Don't you really get it?

90
00:07:13,284 --> 00:07:14,714
You brought your money here.

91
00:07:14,714 --> 00:07:17,024
But we haven't caught a glimpse of this shipment from Mr. Song.

92
00:07:17,685 --> 00:07:20,224
If this goes wrong, we'll lose our money for nothing.

93
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,255
Mr. Kim. Don't tell me...

94
00:07:22,255 --> 00:07:24,224
you've been doing deals like this all this time.

95
00:07:24,265 --> 00:07:25,394
No.

96
00:07:26,865 --> 00:07:28,435
If there's no shipment,

97
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:31,235
- there can't be a deal. - Right.

98
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,375
Where's the shipment?

99
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,084
I see.

100
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:45,615
This is how you want to weasel your way out of this?

101
00:07:47,954 --> 00:07:48,985
Mr. Kim.

102
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:52,055
Of course, I brought the stuff.

103
00:07:53,454 --> 00:07:54,495
Right.

104
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,925
Hey!

105
00:08:00,735 --> 00:08:02,164
Bring that sugar.

106
00:08:17,885 --> 00:08:22,654
(The Player 2: Master of Swindlers)

107
00:08:23,724 --> 00:08:25,354
(Episode 4)

108
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:26,454
Good work.

109
00:08:39,534 --> 00:08:42,005
I'll step out for a moment. Make sure to eat.

110
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:47,274
Hey. Let's resume after we eat.

111
00:08:47,274 --> 00:08:50,344
- Let's eat and get back to work. - Let's go.

112
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:54,255
All right. Let's go.

113
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,174
Gosh.

114
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:19,674
Oh, my.

115
00:09:21,115 --> 00:09:22,574
What's all this?

116
00:09:25,644 --> 00:09:29,054
Technically speaking, Korea is an island. You know?

117
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:32,955
"Our wish is to be reunited."

118
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:34,625
That agenda has been around for decades and on.

119
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:37,465
But the land route is blocked even to this day.

120
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:40,595
It's very difficult to bring anything into this country.

121
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:42,235
But you didn't have any problems...

122
00:09:42,235 --> 00:09:44,904
bringing the stuff in via plane and ferry.

123
00:09:45,205 --> 00:09:47,574
All you care about is getting the stuff.

124
00:09:47,574 --> 00:09:49,304
So you only saw our success cases.

125
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:50,674
I see.

126
00:09:52,774 --> 00:09:55,544
You see, there's a lot of wiggle room with people here.

127
00:09:55,544 --> 00:09:57,314
But they do a fine job of training their dogs.

128
00:09:57,644 --> 00:09:59,345
These darn dogs...

129
00:10:00,385 --> 00:10:02,284
can detect the drugs with just one sniff.

130
00:10:03,225 --> 00:10:05,054
Right. I didn't mean any disrespect here.

131
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:06,694
Please don't get the wrong idea.

132
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,225
You know, these darn dogs...

133
00:10:09,865 --> 00:10:11,294
like retrievers.

134
00:10:12,365 --> 00:10:16,235
So is that why you're manufacturing it here?

135
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:23,674
Great news.

136
00:10:25,975 --> 00:10:27,475
Domestic products...

137
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:29,914
must be compatible.

138
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:31,485
All right.

139
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:33,684
Why don't you check it?

140
00:10:34,485 --> 00:10:37,585
You've been desperately asking to see this.

141
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:42,965
Sure.

142
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:54,274
I see.

143
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,174
Come on.

144
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:02,845
No.

145
00:11:04,814 --> 00:11:07,955
For a man who's serious about getting only the top-notch stuff,

146
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:09,585
you're not even checking it properly.

147
00:11:15,894 --> 00:11:17,664
You must check it properly.

148
00:11:21,465 --> 00:11:22,694
Mr. Song.

149
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:26,005
Don't you think you're teasing him too much, perhaps?

150
00:11:26,005 --> 00:11:27,005
No.

151
00:11:27,705 --> 00:11:29,235
I'm not the one teasing him.

152
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,205
He's teasing me.

153
00:11:32,944 --> 00:11:34,644
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Kang Ha Ri?

154
00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:39,444
Kang Ha Ri?

155
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:44,385
I'm just here to make money.

156
00:11:44,385 --> 00:11:45,824
Let's put the past behind us.

157
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:48,424
I would thank you if you could do exactly that.

158
00:11:49,765 --> 00:11:51,265
But I doubt you're capable of doing so.

159
00:11:54,735 --> 00:11:56,835
So prove it to me.

160
00:11:59,265 --> 00:12:00,705
That your soul is rotten to the point that...

161
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:02,174
you're willing to do a deal...

162
00:12:02,475 --> 00:12:04,774
with someone, responsible for your colleague's death.

163
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:14,255
Good grief.

164
00:12:23,794 --> 00:12:25,865
Je Yi.

165
00:12:27,694 --> 00:12:29,465
I can't get a hold of Je Yi all of a sudden.

166
00:12:30,404 --> 00:12:32,164
Prosecutor Kwak.

167
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:33,505
Prosecutor Kwak?

168
00:12:33,674 --> 00:12:35,475
Mr. Kwak... What's his name?

169
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:37,904
- "Kwak Do Soo." - Mr. Kwak Do Soo!

170
00:12:39,074 --> 00:12:41,074
I can't get a hold of him either.

171
00:13:14,414 --> 00:13:15,574
Sir.

172
00:13:16,274 --> 00:13:18,284
I'm so cold because my clothes are made of mesh.

173
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,455
Please bring me a padded jacket. I'm so cold.

174
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:24,784
Seeing that fool reminds me.

175
00:13:26,324 --> 00:13:28,054
Once again, you didn't come here to make money.

176
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:31,725
You came here to be killed by me. Isn't that right?

177
00:13:56,554 --> 00:13:57,784
- What? - What was that?

178
00:13:57,784 --> 00:13:58,784
Darn it!

179
00:14:02,225 --> 00:14:03,265
What is it?

180
00:14:06,465 --> 00:14:07,465
Hi.

181
00:14:07,735 --> 00:14:08,735
Everyone, stop.

182
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:11,904
Gosh. What took you so long?

183
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,475
What are you talking about?

184
00:14:14,005 --> 00:14:16,005
It was hard for me to get the timing right, you know?

185
00:14:17,574 --> 00:14:19,144
Get them all!

186
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,174
- Come on! - Come on!

187
00:14:23,184 --> 00:14:24,885
They really make drugs here?

188
00:14:27,215 --> 00:14:29,115
Here is the evidence.

189
00:14:30,725 --> 00:14:31,725
By the way...

190
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:34,194
Why did you walk up from behind? You scared me, old man.

191
00:14:34,194 --> 00:14:35,194
"Old man..."

192
00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:38,664
Should I come in saying, "Nice to see you?"

193
00:14:40,835 --> 00:14:41,835
Let's go.

194
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:45,765
- Don't move! - Don't move!

195
00:14:46,164 --> 00:14:47,335
- What? - Oh, my!

196
00:14:55,845 --> 00:14:57,644
Hey, where's the exit?

197
00:14:58,885 --> 00:15:00,414
That was so suffocating.

198
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:13,465
Darn it.

199
00:15:47,465 --> 00:15:48,495
Good shot.

200
00:15:49,904 --> 00:15:52,135
What? You were this weak?

201
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:01,814
What would you have done without guns?

202
00:16:21,995 --> 00:16:22,995
Don't shoot.

203
00:16:25,465 --> 00:16:26,465
Don't shoot.

204
00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:29,774
Please?

205
00:16:46,324 --> 00:16:47,324
No.

206
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,024
Stop it, you bastard!

207
00:16:58,235 --> 00:16:59,235
No!

208
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:19,125
I didn't do anything!

209
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:20,654
Come here.

210
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:22,255
Go.

211
00:17:23,365 --> 00:17:24,894
I'm going!

212
00:17:25,324 --> 00:17:27,095
Gosh! Darn it.

213
00:17:27,465 --> 00:17:28,794
You don't know who I am, do you?

214
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:32,404
Who is he telling everyone who he is? What is he proud of?

215
00:17:33,205 --> 00:17:36,875
That person there is CEO Kim Yun Gi of KU Entertainment.

216
00:17:37,144 --> 00:17:39,444
If he doesn't cooperate, please treat him roughly.

217
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,245
Do you like the present?

218
00:17:43,614 --> 00:17:45,485
Yes, I love it.

219
00:17:45,915 --> 00:17:47,814
Every day is Christmas for me these days.

220
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:50,084
You must be happy.

221
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:53,084
I'm not perfectly happy though.

222
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:56,895
Go and finish unboxing your gift.

223
00:17:57,324 --> 00:17:58,425
Santa has to go.

224
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:01,794
Hey, Kang Ha Ri.

225
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:06,534
You're not Santa. You're the last gift for me.

226
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:10,405
I'm most excited for the day that I get to unbox that gift.

227
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:17,445
Let's go, Prosecutor Kwak.

228
00:18:27,054 --> 00:18:28,455
Darn it!

229
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:32,364
You're always so loud.

230
00:18:37,564 --> 00:18:39,034
Protect your life.

231
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:41,675
You don't have many more chances.

232
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,584
My body isn't like what it used to be.

233
00:19:00,354 --> 00:19:01,455
I'm so tired.

234
00:19:05,324 --> 00:19:07,634
The guy we saw earlier. Is he the guy...

235
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:09,965
who killed your teammate?

236
00:19:13,975 --> 00:19:15,205
Yes, one of them.

237
00:19:17,304 --> 00:19:18,645
You're all fine.

238
00:19:20,245 --> 00:19:22,415
Of course. That was a piece of cake.

239
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:28,614
When I was sent to Europe back in the day,

240
00:19:29,054 --> 00:19:30,824
I learned something called Krav Maga.

241
00:19:31,124 --> 00:19:33,054
Krav Maga is the best for self-defense.

242
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:36,455
With 360 defense, you can block attacks coming from any angle.

243
00:19:36,765 --> 00:19:37,995
There is no space for the enemy to attack.

244
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,225
Some even went home after waiting so long...

245
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:40,534
for a chance to attack.

246
00:19:40,735 --> 00:19:42,265
Attack while blocking.

247
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:49,005
Gosh.

248
00:19:50,344 --> 00:19:51,405
I'm weak...

249
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:53,445
when it comes to beautiful women.

250
00:19:54,274 --> 00:19:55,274
Gosh.

251
00:20:01,314 --> 00:20:03,384
Why are you looking so down?

252
00:20:07,024 --> 00:20:08,054
What is it?

253
00:20:09,524 --> 00:20:10,564
Did you not get to hit them as much as you wanted?

254
00:20:13,564 --> 00:20:14,564
That's right.

255
00:20:14,995 --> 00:20:16,634
I should've beaten one to death,

256
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:20,034
but I let them all live.

257
00:20:23,374 --> 00:20:24,405
How disappointing, right?

258
00:20:55,774 --> 00:20:57,405
You were awesome, Je Yi.

259
00:20:58,074 --> 00:20:59,074
Hey.

260
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:02,645
Are you okay?

261
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:05,015
It feels nice to work my body for the first time in a while.

262
00:21:05,784 --> 00:21:07,015
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

263
00:21:07,554 --> 00:21:08,854
What should we eat?

264
00:21:08,854 --> 00:21:09,915
- Beef. - What is that?

265
00:21:12,824 --> 00:21:13,955
Watch out, Ha Ri!

266
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:24,265
Oh, no!

267
00:21:24,505 --> 00:21:25,534
Prosecutor Kwak.

268
00:21:27,304 --> 00:21:28,374
Kang Ha Ri...

269
00:21:51,617 --> 00:21:55,387
You don't seem to understand.

270
00:21:56,246 --> 00:21:58,486
You won't be able to arrest me for something like this.

271
00:21:58,686 --> 00:22:00,686
Oh, I see.

272
00:22:01,557 --> 00:22:04,327
Do you know how many connections I have in the Prosecutors' Office?

273
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:05,926
I don't.

274
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:11,166
You wouldn't be able to treat me like this if you knew.

275
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:13,537
So instead of wasting your energy,

276
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,166
let's try to...

277
00:22:16,107 --> 00:22:18,276
talk things out in a way that suits us both.

278
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,216
- With me? - Yes.

279
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:28,147
With you.

280
00:22:29,287 --> 00:22:31,357
Do you think this is some blind date?

281
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:35,057
Why should we find a way that suits us both?

282
00:22:35,657 --> 00:22:37,157
We're going our separate ways.

283
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,926
Come on.

284
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:45,367
Are you going to retire after prosecuting this case?

285
00:22:46,337 --> 00:22:48,766
You should look further ahead.

286
00:22:49,006 --> 00:22:51,936
My company makes 500 million dollars...

287
00:22:51,936 --> 00:22:53,137
each year from N-Try alone.

288
00:22:53,137 --> 00:22:54,476
Five hundred million dollars.

289
00:22:55,347 --> 00:22:57,776
I have both money and connections.

290
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,587
With those two, nothing's impossible in our country.

291
00:23:01,617 --> 00:23:05,087
Draw on your connections as best you can.

292
00:23:06,057 --> 00:23:07,127
And the money...

293
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,956
I don't think you'll make much more.

294
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:23,577
(N-Try Press Conference on Exclusive Contract Cancellation)

295
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,407
We five members of N-Try...

296
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:30,577
will cancel our exclusive contract with KU Entertainment...

297
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,416
as well as reveal the truth about our CEO Kim Yun Gi.

298
00:23:34,486 --> 00:23:35,817
Kim Yun Gi...

299
00:23:35,817 --> 00:23:38,256
used his title and authority as CEO...

300
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,357
to assault the agency staff...

301
00:23:40,357 --> 00:23:42,587
and artists verbally and physically.

302
00:23:43,387 --> 00:23:46,357
Trainees were continuously forced to entertain...

303
00:23:47,067 --> 00:23:48,367
influential people at parties.

304
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:52,236
In the process, not only was there sexual assault,

305
00:23:52,466 --> 00:23:55,337
but the victims were also forced to ingest...

306
00:23:57,137 --> 00:23:59,607
drugs that Kim Yun Gi was distributing.

307
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:01,407
- What? - Drugs?

308
00:24:02,547 --> 00:24:05,577
Is there proof you can show us today?

309
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:07,647
Yes.

310
00:24:10,857 --> 00:24:14,057
Hey. We've been through so much together.

311
00:24:14,057 --> 00:24:16,327
- Even the things... - No way.

312
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:18,726
- I don't believe it. - It's crazy.

313
00:24:18,726 --> 00:24:21,196
- This is the CEO? - I have recordings of them.

314
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:25,196
Just do it when I'm still being civil.

315
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:26,936
Look.

316
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:29,407
The rumor was true after all.

317
00:24:29,706 --> 00:24:31,337
- For real? - Yes.

318
00:24:31,607 --> 00:24:33,037
I hope this brings an end...

319
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:36,047
to any ideas one might have had of using...

320
00:24:36,047 --> 00:24:38,617
someone's dream to take them hostage and use them...

321
00:24:39,147 --> 00:24:40,147
to commit ugly crimes.

322
00:24:45,787 --> 00:24:47,827
So, that Mr. Song.

323
00:24:48,627 --> 00:24:50,127
We still don't have him?

324
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:53,397
No. He managed to flee the scene...

325
00:24:53,397 --> 00:24:55,266
and he hadn't been located since.

326
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:58,137
And that CEO Kim Yun Gi.

327
00:25:00,537 --> 00:25:02,706
The people high up are suggesting probation for him.

328
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:05,637
I think they want to wrap it up simply.

329
00:25:07,147 --> 00:25:09,907
How can we wrap it up simply when it's not a simple case?

330
00:25:11,847 --> 00:25:14,516
I guess he pulled the right string to one of his connections.

331
00:25:14,587 --> 00:25:16,387
Still, the media's all over it,

332
00:25:16,446 --> 00:25:18,157
and the public's interested too.

333
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:19,916
It won't go away that easily.

334
00:25:20,157 --> 00:25:21,986
Is the media a courthouse...

335
00:25:22,627 --> 00:25:23,956
and do the public sentence criminals?

336
00:25:24,797 --> 00:25:28,067
If that were the case, why would they need all of us?

337
00:25:30,026 --> 00:25:32,067
Prosecutor Kwak. Kim Yun Gi...

338
00:25:39,377 --> 00:25:41,206
(Jeon Byung Ok)

339
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:49,047
(Jeon Byung Ok)

340
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:52,756
- Check the CCTV footage. - Okay.

341
00:25:53,016 --> 00:25:54,226
Darn it.

342
00:25:55,026 --> 00:25:56,587
Did you see anyone suspicious?

343
00:25:57,127 --> 00:25:58,157
No.

344
00:25:58,726 --> 00:25:59,827
Shoot.

345
00:26:15,047 --> 00:26:17,047
There are people who must be feared more than the lawbreakers.

346
00:26:17,377 --> 00:26:18,976
It's the people who still walk among us freely...

347
00:26:18,976 --> 00:26:20,587
when they've violated the law.

348
00:26:21,287 --> 00:26:22,716
As long as there are people like them,

349
00:26:22,887 --> 00:26:25,117
the law won't be able to protect everyone.

350
00:26:27,526 --> 00:26:28,857
This sucks.

351
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,127
Sir.

352
00:26:31,597 --> 00:26:33,226
You forgot this.

353
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:35,327
Thank you.

354
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:37,397
You should quit.

355
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,466
Come on.

356
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:43,506
Let's quit together tomorrow.

357
00:26:45,077 --> 00:26:46,107
Sounds good.

358
00:26:46,807 --> 00:26:47,946
So, is he...

359
00:26:49,446 --> 00:26:50,476
Darn it.

360
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:55,047
Is he alive?

361
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:18,276
Are you here to nurse me or assassinate me?

362
00:27:19,776 --> 00:27:23,047
I might die of lack of sleep because of that racket!

363
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:26,246
- Darn you. - Sorry.

364
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:29,617
I was so sad.

365
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:31,716
Isn't this sad?

366
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:38,797
Will you cry this much at my funeral?

367
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:42,067
Would that be as sad as this?

368
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,397
Oh, my gosh.

369
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:50,436
Hey. You'll live to a ripe old age.

370
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:52,107
Your funeral will be a celebration.

371
00:27:52,107 --> 00:27:55,347
Look. Even the bullet just grazed your arm.

372
00:27:55,877 --> 00:27:57,416
The lead never gets shot.

373
00:27:57,946 --> 00:28:00,817
Oh, really? You are the lead, I guess.

374
00:28:03,216 --> 00:28:05,157
Live a long, blessed life.

375
00:28:05,157 --> 00:28:06,587
I wish you all the best.

376
00:28:06,587 --> 00:28:08,756
- Gosh. - Get out of here.

377
00:28:14,466 --> 00:28:17,236
Kim Yun Gi was found dead in the lockup.

378
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:18,666
Mr. Kim is dead?

379
00:28:24,107 --> 00:28:25,176
You expected it.

380
00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:32,016
The day Kim Yun Gi was apprehended,

381
00:28:32,016 --> 00:28:34,547
the drug smuggler got away.

382
00:28:35,287 --> 00:28:37,117
His men came to the rescue.

383
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,857
The punks who shot Ha Ri...

384
00:28:40,057 --> 00:28:42,327
and took out Kim Yun Gi and Kang Do Young...

385
00:28:43,087 --> 00:28:44,357
are all in the same gang.

386
00:28:53,337 --> 00:28:55,666
When did you figure it out?

387
00:28:56,807 --> 00:28:57,807
Figure out what?

388
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:01,246
That Kang Do Young and Mr. Song were in the same gang.

389
00:29:02,506 --> 00:29:03,607
That?

390
00:29:06,276 --> 00:29:07,416
From the start?

391
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:10,147
I never told you.

392
00:29:10,486 --> 00:29:13,486
From the moment we met right up until now,

393
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:16,657
I think we're headed toward the same goal.

394
00:29:18,627 --> 00:29:19,696
How sweet.

395
00:29:20,456 --> 00:29:21,696
It sounds like a confession of love.

396
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:25,797
You could call it a confession of sorts.

397
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:29,506
Okay. Since you confessed your love,

398
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:32,736
I think you're ready to meet your father-in-law.

399
00:29:33,706 --> 00:29:35,547
That comes right after the confession?

400
00:29:36,347 --> 00:29:37,676
Isn't that too quick?

401
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:40,216
It's not quick at all.

402
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:42,287
I should've introduced you long ago.

403
00:29:43,887 --> 00:29:45,587
You seem to love me too much.

404
00:29:46,387 --> 00:29:47,557
I'm glad you noticed.

405
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,387
Since we're in love,

406
00:29:51,196 --> 00:29:54,026
shall we head there first?

407
00:30:09,647 --> 00:30:12,176
Hey, can you drive like a normal person?

408
00:30:13,317 --> 00:30:14,647
Hey, Je Yi!

409
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,647
I'd rather stick with Ha Ri.

410
00:30:16,647 --> 00:30:18,117
Stop the car. Pull over!

411
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:22,287
Help!

412
00:30:22,627 --> 00:30:25,057
Je Yi. Cars come with a thing called brakes.

413
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:27,256
Could you please use that function?

414
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:28,726
I do.

415
00:30:29,097 --> 00:30:30,936
- When it's time to stop. - Shoot.

416
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,407
Mr. Hwang. How much further do we have to go?

417
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:35,407
Where...

418
00:30:35,907 --> 00:30:38,077
- I think he's asleep. - Are you sure he's asleep?

419
00:30:38,206 --> 00:30:40,236
- Is he not dead? - Mr. Hwang!

420
00:30:40,236 --> 00:30:41,607
- Don't touch me. - Goodness.

421
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:42,776
I'm meditating.

422
00:30:42,976 --> 00:30:45,347
If I focus hard enough, my brain will emit alpha waves...

423
00:30:45,347 --> 00:30:47,547
- so however fast we're going... - Oh, no.

424
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,787
Is there...

425
00:30:49,787 --> 00:30:52,516
- a plastic bag? - Don't turn around.

426
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:54,587
- Oh, dear. - That's gross.

427
00:30:54,587 --> 00:30:57,456
My goodness. That guy, really...

428
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:04,137
Chicken.

429
00:31:04,837 --> 00:31:07,037
Chicken. My fried chicken.

430
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,936
(Closed for personal reasons. We apologize for the inconvenience.)

431
00:31:13,107 --> 00:31:14,176
No way.

432
00:31:15,946 --> 00:31:16,976
It can't be.

433
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:20,647
Please let it be a lie.

434
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,016
No.

435
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:26,216
I can't handle the muscle loss.

436
00:31:27,357 --> 00:31:30,827
Darn it. I said we should just order in.

437
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:34,797
Listen, everyone.

438
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,597
You seem to misunderstand... Will you hold me up?

439
00:31:38,466 --> 00:31:40,067
You seem to misunderstand.

440
00:31:40,706 --> 00:31:42,837
We're not here for fried chicken.

441
00:31:42,837 --> 00:31:44,107
- What? - What?

442
00:31:44,637 --> 00:31:46,276
I brought you here...

443
00:31:46,276 --> 00:31:47,976
to tell you about this place.

444
00:31:48,047 --> 00:31:50,476
That makes as much sense as going to the gym for a concert.

445
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,117
Right.

446
00:31:52,946 --> 00:31:54,787
I'm shaking all over.

447
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:56,817
Is my blood sugar that low?

448
00:31:57,216 --> 00:31:59,587
Is it because I'm so darn angry?

449
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:01,726
Do you have to make us come all the way here to say it?

450
00:32:03,357 --> 00:32:05,696
So, what is it you want to say?

451
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:09,397
Why this restaurant...

452
00:32:10,736 --> 00:32:12,067
closed its doors.

453
00:32:13,867 --> 00:32:15,006
Why do we have to know...

454
00:32:15,307 --> 00:32:16,666
- Hey, just take him to the car. - Okay.

455
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:18,506
- Mr. Hwang. - Let's go.

456
00:32:23,706 --> 00:32:26,077
Wait, did you actually bring us here?

457
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:27,587
Yes.

458
00:32:29,486 --> 00:32:31,117
I'm not quite fully recovered yet...

459
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:35,456
So, you need to focus your energy on a wound for it to recover.

460
00:32:36,026 --> 00:32:37,926
But if I focus on something else, this wound will fester.

461
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:39,456
I can't do this. Okay?

462
00:32:39,956 --> 00:32:40,996
It's fine.

463
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:43,426
But I'm not fine, okay?

464
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:45,597
Why? Are you unsure of yourself?

465
00:32:47,297 --> 00:32:48,607
I'm always sure of my...

466
00:32:49,407 --> 00:32:50,466
Well, look.

467
00:32:51,176 --> 00:32:52,276
Goodness.

468
00:32:52,506 --> 00:32:54,377
Sure, Soo Min, I understand. You could feel that way about me.

469
00:32:54,377 --> 00:32:55,446
I get it, but...

470
00:32:56,077 --> 00:32:58,147
Well, I don't know what you've thought of me,

471
00:32:58,347 --> 00:33:00,787
but I'm more conservative than you might think.

472
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:03,117
Are you seriously going to be like this and ruin all the fun?

473
00:33:03,446 --> 00:33:04,916
We finished the job well,

474
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,857
so why not celebrate a job well done with this?

475
00:33:07,956 --> 00:33:09,827
Who celebrates a job well done in this way?

476
00:33:11,797 --> 00:33:14,367
My gosh. I've tried my best to talk you down, okay?

477
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,327
I really don't know anymore.

478
00:33:20,196 --> 00:33:22,166
Is it fun to play around with me?

479
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:23,666
Gosh.

480
00:33:26,676 --> 00:33:27,776
What are you doing?

481
00:33:29,276 --> 00:33:30,377
What do you think?

482
00:33:31,216 --> 00:33:32,976
Since we're done with the last project,

483
00:33:32,976 --> 00:33:34,347
we should move on to the next project right away.

484
00:33:36,186 --> 00:33:38,186
Yes, you're right. We should work.

485
00:33:46,196 --> 00:33:48,026
Was there some kind of accident here?

486
00:33:50,126 --> 00:33:51,137
Yes.

487
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:55,066
The victim and the assailant were two young men of the same age.

488
00:33:57,466 --> 00:33:58,676
(Lee Sang Wook, 27 years old)

489
00:33:58,676 --> 00:33:59,676
Done.

490
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:02,807
Yes!

491
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,077
(Min Won Jun, 27 years old)

492
00:34:13,356 --> 00:34:17,426
(A few months ago)

493
00:34:17,426 --> 00:34:19,356
I'm here.

494
00:34:19,597 --> 00:34:21,026
What?

495
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:22,896
Gosh, you should rest if you're done with your studies.

496
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:24,126
Why did you come here?

497
00:34:24,126 --> 00:34:26,367
It's nice to get some fresh air and some exercise too.

498
00:34:26,736 --> 00:34:28,937
Besides, the fees for deliveries are so high these days.

499
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,106
You run a business, but you don't know how to cut costs.

500
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,937
- I'll be back soon. - Okay.

501
00:34:33,437 --> 00:34:34,477
Son.

502
00:34:35,046 --> 00:34:36,907
- Drive carefully. - Of course!

503
00:34:37,716 --> 00:34:38,716
I'll be back.

504
00:34:47,187 --> 00:34:49,856
(Fried Chicken)

505
00:34:54,966 --> 00:34:56,597
- That hurts! - Where are you going, Won Jun?

506
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,606
Valet!

507
00:35:05,207 --> 00:35:06,376
- What's he doing? - Leave him be.

508
00:35:07,307 --> 00:35:09,776
- I should pay for valet parking. - Gosh.

509
00:35:10,506 --> 00:35:12,946
I should pay you.

510
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:15,347
- I should pay you. - There you go.

511
00:35:15,716 --> 00:35:17,046
Hey, I'm really going to post this.

512
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,387
- You punk. - Hey, be careful.

513
00:35:20,387 --> 00:35:21,526
I'll deal with it.

514
00:35:21,526 --> 00:35:23,157
- Oh, man. - Okay.

515
00:35:23,426 --> 00:35:24,626
- Ha Young! - Yes?

516
00:35:24,926 --> 00:35:26,896
- I'm leaving! - Bye.

517
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:29,896
What's up with you two?

518
00:35:30,327 --> 00:35:32,736
- Bye! - Hey, you're too drunk to drive.

519
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,037
- I said I'd take care of it. - Okay.

520
00:35:37,066 --> 00:35:38,937
- Hey, you can't drive. - Be careful.

521
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:42,307
- Bye. - Bye.

522
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,307
Bye.

523
00:35:43,676 --> 00:35:45,046
Hey, watch out!

524
00:35:45,146 --> 00:35:46,146
It's fine.

525
00:35:46,316 --> 00:35:47,477
Hey.

526
00:35:47,477 --> 00:35:48,486
Come here.

527
00:35:49,086 --> 00:35:50,287
Go!

528
00:36:22,617 --> 00:36:23,687
Darn it.

529
00:36:52,876 --> 00:36:54,176
(Fried Chicken)

530
00:37:10,026 --> 00:37:11,066
Darn it.

531
00:37:13,937 --> 00:37:16,207
- Are you okay? - And who are you?

532
00:37:17,937 --> 00:37:19,137
Have you been drinking?

533
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:21,276
What do you care if I drink or not?

534
00:37:21,276 --> 00:37:23,276
Why are you waking me up, you punk?

535
00:37:23,546 --> 00:37:24,577
- But... - Hey.

536
00:37:24,747 --> 00:37:25,847
Get lost.

537
00:37:25,847 --> 00:37:26,977
Still, you should call a designated driver...

538
00:37:26,977 --> 00:37:28,086
before you get into an accident.

539
00:37:28,486 --> 00:37:30,517
Darn it! I told you to get lost.

540
00:37:31,187 --> 00:37:32,787
You darn beggar.

541
00:37:32,787 --> 00:37:34,727
You can't drink and drive. I'll call a driver for you.

542
00:37:34,727 --> 00:37:36,856
Stay here for a minute. You have to stay put.

543
00:37:43,026 --> 00:37:44,066
Yes, designated driver service?

544
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:45,997
I need a driver here.

545
00:37:46,937 --> 00:37:48,966
Yes, we're at the intersection.

546
00:37:49,506 --> 00:37:50,566
Yes.

547
00:37:51,407 --> 00:37:53,407
That crazy punk is going to report me to the police.

548
00:38:15,966 --> 00:38:16,966
Dad.

549
00:38:17,466 --> 00:38:18,836
Dad, I think I just caused trouble.

550
00:38:20,637 --> 00:38:21,707
What do I do?

551
00:38:24,006 --> 00:38:25,876
What? Okay.

552
00:39:09,687 --> 00:39:12,157
Are you saying that piece of trash still hasn't been caught?

553
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:14,216
Of course...

554
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,227
he has.

555
00:39:18,296 --> 00:39:21,227
He was caught by police that day and stood trial in court.

556
00:39:23,367 --> 00:39:24,367
But...

557
00:39:24,597 --> 00:39:25,937
He got off on probation?

558
00:39:26,566 --> 00:39:27,736
- Yes. - But...

559
00:39:28,236 --> 00:39:31,336
what reason did they give for letting him off on probation?

560
00:39:32,006 --> 00:39:35,546
Gosh, that makes no sense! He blatantly killed a guy.

561
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:37,876
If you look at the court records from back then,

562
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:41,077
they weren't able to prove intentionality in the first place.

563
00:39:41,187 --> 00:39:43,646
But still. He violated a red light,

564
00:39:43,747 --> 00:39:45,387
drove while he was drunk, and did a hit-and-run.

565
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,086
It's exactly that.

566
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:50,486
- What? - He had...

567
00:39:51,126 --> 00:39:52,557
someone watching his back.

568
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,026
Yes, that's right. He was a third-generation conglomerate.

569
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:59,267
The assailant, Min Won Jun, is the firstborn son of WQ Group.

570
00:40:00,137 --> 00:40:01,437
Gosh, I can't believe this.

571
00:40:01,437 --> 00:40:03,267
Are conglomerate families' kids above the law?

572
00:40:03,907 --> 00:40:07,477
There's someone who blurs out the blatant truth.

573
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:11,546
And she does it professionally at that.

574
00:40:13,276 --> 00:40:14,477
The villagers,

575
00:40:14,477 --> 00:40:15,586
who were diagnosed with cancer due to the waste water,

576
00:40:15,586 --> 00:40:17,086
filed a class-action suit.

577
00:40:17,646 --> 00:40:20,316
But Onhwa Industries won because of insufficient proof.

578
00:40:20,557 --> 00:40:22,387
And Nokang Constructions won...

579
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:23,957
against those who had their houses stolen.

580
00:40:24,457 --> 00:40:25,896
And Chairman Jang, who took advantage...

581
00:40:25,896 --> 00:40:28,526
of his student's girlfriend, making the student take his own life,

582
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:30,367
was also acquitted.

583
00:40:30,926 --> 00:40:31,997
Hang on.

584
00:40:32,836 --> 00:40:34,836
All of these cases were one person's doing?

585
00:40:35,106 --> 00:40:37,037
From Min Won Jun to all of those other guys.

586
00:40:40,907 --> 00:40:43,376
Gosh, this person is incredible.

587
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:47,046
Even Vincenzo and Woo Young Woo would run away crying.

588
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:50,117
Hang on. What does this person do?

589
00:40:50,486 --> 00:40:52,517
Is she an attorney at a large law firm?

590
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:54,187
Or is she a judge?

591
00:40:55,387 --> 00:40:56,626
The answer is in here.

592
00:41:00,696 --> 00:41:02,466
(Baek Hyeon Mi, Graduated from Ironwild Arts Academy)

593
00:41:02,466 --> 00:41:04,196
(Awards, Exhibitions)

594
00:41:11,477 --> 00:41:12,977
This painting was done without the use of brushes...

595
00:41:12,977 --> 00:41:14,907
but by sprinkling paint.

596
00:41:15,847 --> 00:41:16,946
It's called "dripping."

597
00:41:17,446 --> 00:41:20,977
It's a method that a genius artist called Jackson Pollock came up with.

598
00:41:22,187 --> 00:41:24,316
I'm not really interested in paintings.

599
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,957
But this Jackson Pollock...

600
00:41:27,356 --> 00:41:30,157
left a crucial stain on his life.

601
00:41:31,327 --> 00:41:33,097
He killed a man while driving drunk.

602
00:41:34,457 --> 00:41:36,926
- Look, Director Baek. - But do you know what's funny?

603
00:41:38,566 --> 00:41:42,267
Even after that, Jackson Pollock's value didn't plummet.

604
00:41:43,336 --> 00:41:44,537
Of course, even now,

605
00:41:45,037 --> 00:41:48,347
he's one of the most highly valued artists in the world.

606
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:52,847
This is what I think.

607
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:57,187
The value of the heir of WQ Group...

608
00:41:58,256 --> 00:42:01,256
should be damaged because of a silly little accident.

609
00:42:03,827 --> 00:42:05,756
Besides, this incident is beneath him.

610
00:42:06,926 --> 00:42:09,827
It's not like people from the same class got into an accident.

611
00:42:10,396 --> 00:42:11,836
He was only a delivery guy.

612
00:42:13,736 --> 00:42:16,506
Stepping on an ant while walking is understandable for us.

613
00:42:18,276 --> 00:42:19,537
Don't you agree, Chairman Min?

614
00:42:20,736 --> 00:42:23,907
You're quite right. Yes. That's it.

615
00:42:27,176 --> 00:42:29,417
Director Baek. I'm counting on you.

616
00:42:35,827 --> 00:42:36,926
Well,

617
00:42:37,887 --> 00:42:39,926
the motorcycle kept following me.

618
00:42:41,396 --> 00:42:42,566
He said I could only drive a nice car...

619
00:42:42,566 --> 00:42:43,727
because I got lucky and had rich parents.

620
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:46,966
He asked me how much the car cost.

621
00:42:47,937 --> 00:42:49,466
He kept getting in my way on the road...

622
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:50,966
and picked a fight on me.

623
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:53,176
No!

624
00:42:53,577 --> 00:42:56,747
No! My dear boy, Sang Wook, wouldn't do something like that.

625
00:42:56,776 --> 00:42:58,006
Silence in the courtroom.

626
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:02,617
Prosecutor.

627
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:05,356
Do you have any other questions for the defendant?

628
00:43:08,187 --> 00:43:09,426
Don't worry.

629
00:43:09,586 --> 00:43:11,057
I'm well-prepared for the case.

630
00:43:11,057 --> 00:43:13,126
I will prove all of Min Won Jun's crimes.

631
00:43:13,597 --> 00:43:16,497
An eyewitness confirmed that the deceased motorcycle driver...

632
00:43:17,196 --> 00:43:19,836
drove aggressively and obstructed the defendant's driving.

633
00:43:26,577 --> 00:43:27,637
No more questions, Your Honor.

634
00:43:28,646 --> 00:43:29,646
Gosh.

635
00:43:30,577 --> 00:43:31,617
What?

636
00:43:32,146 --> 00:43:36,216
This isn't true! No!

637
00:43:36,216 --> 00:43:38,617
(Prosecution)

638
00:43:42,457 --> 00:43:43,756
I already got rid of the security footage...

639
00:43:43,756 --> 00:43:45,026
and the dashcam video.

640
00:43:45,796 --> 00:43:46,997
This is the only video from that night...

641
00:43:46,997 --> 00:43:48,167
that can be used as evidence.

642
00:43:50,597 --> 00:43:52,336
Gosh. I'm so grateful.

643
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:56,736
By the way, from my understanding, we're on different sides.

644
00:43:57,907 --> 00:44:01,477
You know that I'm trying to send Min Won Jun to prison, right?

645
00:44:04,247 --> 00:44:05,376
Of course.

646
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,577
That's why I invited you here.

647
00:44:09,687 --> 00:44:11,086
You must be gravely mistaken.

648
00:44:14,117 --> 00:44:17,187
I'll use this video as evidence.

649
00:44:18,526 --> 00:44:21,126
You're the one who's mistaken, Prosecutor.

650
00:44:24,026 --> 00:44:25,137
How?

651
00:44:29,037 --> 00:44:30,937
You're mistaken that you're a righteous man.

652
00:44:33,506 --> 00:44:35,577
Why do you keep provoking me?

653
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:39,216
How much would you charge me for treating your delusion?

654
00:44:40,676 --> 00:44:41,747
A hundred thousand dollars?

655
00:44:42,517 --> 00:44:43,586
Or 200,000 dollars?

656
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:50,657
I hate bribes.

657
00:44:51,696 --> 00:44:53,296
I like to play it safe.

658
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,367
What if I were to say it would be safe?

659
00:45:00,437 --> 00:45:02,566
No bribes in the world can be safe.

660
00:45:08,106 --> 00:45:09,146
Do you like...

661
00:45:11,577 --> 00:45:12,646
paintings?

662
00:45:18,887 --> 00:45:20,387
Wire 20,000 dollars to the gallery's bank account...

663
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:21,926
for the painting.

664
00:45:23,457 --> 00:45:25,756
Once the trial is over, you can sell it back...

665
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:26,796
at any price you want.

666
00:45:28,396 --> 00:45:29,526
Here's our ruling.

667
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:31,296
The accident was caused...

668
00:45:31,497 --> 00:45:33,336
because the plaintiff, Lee Sang Wook,

669
00:45:33,336 --> 00:45:34,367
provoked the defendant.

670
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:37,336
We cannot hold Min Won Jun responsible for his intention...

671
00:45:37,336 --> 00:45:39,006
or action in this accident.

672
00:45:39,276 --> 00:45:41,876
An external factor affected the outcome of the accident.

673
00:45:42,276 --> 00:45:45,646
Therefore, the court sentences the defendant,

674
00:45:45,646 --> 00:45:46,847
Min Won Jun,

675
00:45:47,176 --> 00:45:49,387
to probation.

676
00:45:51,287 --> 00:45:52,417
This can't be!

677
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:54,856
This can't be!

678
00:45:55,657 --> 00:45:59,457
No! This can't be happening!

679
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:02,296
Honey, how...

680
00:46:02,296 --> 00:46:04,196
No!

681
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,296
Honey, how could this happen?

682
00:46:07,396 --> 00:46:10,637
A fixer for the VVIPs of Korea.

683
00:46:11,037 --> 00:46:12,506
That's Director Baek.

684
00:46:12,776 --> 00:46:14,606
As for the paintings at her gallery,

685
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:17,176
they are like useful commodities to conduct transactions.

686
00:46:17,176 --> 00:46:18,276
It makes sense.

687
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:21,276
There are no suggested prices on these paintings.

688
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:22,747
Then...

689
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:25,057
she can just argue that the money came from selling the paintings.

690
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:29,957
But can a director of an art gallery have that much power?

691
00:46:30,126 --> 00:46:31,457
Physically speaking, you're more powerful.

692
00:46:31,557 --> 00:46:32,727
What are you talking about?

693
00:46:33,097 --> 00:46:35,626
Was it about five years ago?

694
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:37,827
She did get a divorce.

695
00:46:38,836 --> 00:46:39,896
Although it was brief,

696
00:46:39,896 --> 00:46:41,907
she was a daughter-in-law of a wealthy family.

697
00:46:46,876 --> 00:46:49,506
She became the daughter-in-law of the wealthy family...

698
00:46:50,046 --> 00:46:51,477
not out of love...

699
00:46:52,316 --> 00:46:53,816
or with the power of destiny.

700
00:46:56,287 --> 00:46:57,316
How should I put it?

701
00:46:57,946 --> 00:46:59,816
It was some kind of collaboration to coexist.

702
00:47:00,657 --> 00:47:03,187
One party was held back by a rumor, while ambition hindered the other.

703
00:47:03,327 --> 00:47:04,926
They had their own problems, holding them back.

704
00:47:08,497 --> 00:47:10,566
But here's a thing. That woman...

705
00:47:11,267 --> 00:47:13,796
didn't have the generosity to endure the boring days.

706
00:47:14,137 --> 00:47:16,307
To be patient, her ambition...

707
00:47:16,307 --> 00:47:17,667
was indeed enormous.

708
00:47:22,347 --> 00:47:25,117
So after getting what she wanted,

709
00:47:25,816 --> 00:47:27,347
she got rid of any obstacle...

710
00:47:27,876 --> 00:47:29,486
that stood in her way.

711
00:47:30,617 --> 00:47:32,057
(Assemblyman Won Tae Yong of Hankuk Party)

712
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:33,457
(Director Baek Hyun Mi)

713
00:47:33,457 --> 00:47:35,586
But she had always been ambitious.

714
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,557
So she formed connections with pretty important people...

715
00:47:37,557 --> 00:47:39,097
when she was married.

716
00:47:39,196 --> 00:47:42,327
More importantly, her intel is as impressive as that...

717
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:44,196
of some prosecutors in high positions.

718
00:47:44,196 --> 00:47:46,167
- Sounds great. I'll do it. - Really?

719
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:47,196
- Oh, my. - What?

720
00:47:47,196 --> 00:47:48,907
Congratulations on publishing your book.

721
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:51,537
Gosh. Thank you for coming here despite your busy schedule.

722
00:47:52,037 --> 00:47:54,376
Gosh. I didn't see you there, ma'am.

723
00:47:54,376 --> 00:47:55,876
I hope Director Choi is doing well.

724
00:47:55,876 --> 00:47:58,106
Of course. I hope you're doing well too.

725
00:47:58,106 --> 00:47:59,176
Of course.

726
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:00,676
(Won Tae Yong's Story on the National Hero)

727
00:48:00,676 --> 00:48:01,787
I see.

728
00:48:03,586 --> 00:48:05,017
- Please excuse me. - Sure.

729
00:48:05,017 --> 00:48:06,086
See you around.

730
00:48:07,287 --> 00:48:09,026
Funny running into you here again.

731
00:48:11,256 --> 00:48:12,356
Excuse me.

732
00:48:12,457 --> 00:48:13,597
Let's go. Bye.

733
00:48:15,066 --> 00:48:16,426
I guess we're meant to be.

734
00:48:17,267 --> 00:48:18,396
As if.

735
00:48:19,867 --> 00:48:21,437
I hope Judge Kang is doing well.

736
00:48:22,207 --> 00:48:23,736
Yes. Sure.

737
00:48:25,207 --> 00:48:26,307
Ma'am.

738
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:28,207
Your shoes.

739
00:48:31,146 --> 00:48:32,676
I guess we're meant to be indeed.

740
00:48:33,017 --> 00:48:34,646
We have a similar taste in shoes.

741
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:37,986
I just wore them because they were a gift.

742
00:48:38,347 --> 00:48:39,687
They're uncomfortable, though.

743
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:43,327
Should I say these shoes are way too light?

744
00:48:44,387 --> 00:48:45,957
They aren't my style.

745
00:48:47,026 --> 00:48:48,526
I see.

746
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:51,367
Right. You sent a painting to my husband.

747
00:48:51,497 --> 00:48:53,267
I sent it back to the gallery today.

748
00:48:54,497 --> 00:48:55,707
From now on,

749
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,236
don't send us paintings without my permission.

750
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:01,106
It's quite rude. You know?

751
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:04,207
I'm just worried...

752
00:49:04,676 --> 00:49:06,546
that people get the wrong idea that you are...

753
00:49:07,546 --> 00:49:08,747
an easy woman.

754
00:49:17,526 --> 00:49:19,256
I must have acted rashly, ma'am.

755
00:49:24,526 --> 00:49:27,236
No. Anyone can make that mistake.

756
00:49:28,537 --> 00:49:30,437
When I saw the new car Actor Yeo Min was driving,

757
00:49:31,106 --> 00:49:33,577
I just assumed these shoes would suit your style.

758
00:49:35,546 --> 00:49:36,847
What do you mean?

759
00:49:37,606 --> 00:49:39,946
It's the car you recently bought for him.

760
00:49:40,776 --> 00:49:42,847
It seemed light, but it definitely stood out.

761
00:49:46,457 --> 00:49:47,517
Right.

762
00:49:48,586 --> 00:49:50,887
Don't go to the actor's house that often.

763
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:54,097
I'm just saying it because I'm also worried...

764
00:49:55,597 --> 00:49:57,066
that people might misunderstand...

765
00:49:57,066 --> 00:49:58,327
you're easy when you're a married woman.

766
00:50:00,296 --> 00:50:02,307
Wait. Is that not a misunderstanding?

767
00:50:05,006 --> 00:50:06,807
I'll send the painting back to the judge.

768
00:50:14,676 --> 00:50:17,517
When she simply opened the door to the elite social circle,

769
00:50:18,086 --> 00:50:20,486
she could easily turn some important people...

770
00:50:21,086 --> 00:50:22,256
into meek lambs.

771
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:23,727
She sounds impressive.

772
00:50:24,957 --> 00:50:27,597
After doing everything she wanted,

773
00:50:27,626 --> 00:50:29,327
she had been accused of only one crime.

774
00:50:30,267 --> 00:50:31,497
But they couldn't even prove that...

775
00:50:31,497 --> 00:50:32,736
she took the bribe in exchange for a favor.

776
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,667
So nothing really happened with the accusation.

777
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:40,606
Gosh. This case will give us a headache.

778
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:42,676
Don't worry. I'll make sure there's no headache for you.

779
00:50:43,247 --> 00:50:46,247
Stand up. Our hero is here to save us.

780
00:50:47,676 --> 00:50:50,117
- Kang Ha Ri! - Gosh.

781
00:50:50,117 --> 00:50:51,687
- Hey. - Jin Woong.

782
00:50:51,687 --> 00:50:53,986
- Hey, it hurts. - He's in pain. Stop that.

783
00:50:53,986 --> 00:50:55,626
- It hurts. - Sorry.

784
00:50:55,626 --> 00:50:56,787
- Gosh. - Are you okay?

785
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,486
I was fine. But he's about to send me back to the hospital.

786
00:50:58,486 --> 00:51:01,227
- Hey. - I thought you were going to die.

787
00:51:02,066 --> 00:51:03,066
Goodness.

788
00:51:03,066 --> 00:51:04,267
- Stop that. - I got shot!

789
00:51:04,426 --> 00:51:06,736
- Welcome home. - Welcome home!

790
00:51:06,736 --> 00:51:07,997
- Come on. - Gosh.

791
00:51:07,997 --> 00:51:10,236
Now that you're here, you should have some food.

792
00:51:10,437 --> 00:51:11,977
Soo Min is...

793
00:51:11,977 --> 00:51:13,637
- I know. - Je Yi. Dig in.

794
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:14,736
- Thank you for the food. - I see.

795
00:51:14,736 --> 00:51:16,146
Hey, dig in. I'm starving.

796
00:51:16,146 --> 00:51:17,247
Here I go.

797
00:51:17,847 --> 00:51:19,617
- Gosh. - You almost killed him.

798
00:51:19,716 --> 00:51:22,446
My blood sugar is crashing because I talked way too much today.

799
00:51:48,407 --> 00:51:49,776
As you said,

800
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:51,707
it was the same crew just like the Kang Do Young case.

801
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:54,946
It's as if they're one step ahead of us.

802
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,287
Should I keep tracking them?

803
00:51:58,546 --> 00:51:59,557
Yes.

804
00:52:00,086 --> 00:52:02,026
We have to figure out who they're working for.

805
00:52:02,626 --> 00:52:03,626
Yes, sir.

806
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:15,907
Little thieves are trying so hard.

807
00:52:19,676 --> 00:52:20,676
Interesting.

808
00:52:26,941 --> 00:52:29,140
Kang Ha Ri seems to have caught on.

809
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:30,981
I see.

810
00:52:32,211 --> 00:52:35,921
We've gotten enough of a confirmation now.

811
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,120
There's no need to delay it any longer.

812
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:41,450
By that, do you mean...

813
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,591
Call him right now.

814
00:52:43,921 --> 00:52:46,030
Let me meet Kang Ha Ri.

815
00:52:48,461 --> 00:52:49,930
Yes, sir.

816
00:52:54,631 --> 00:52:56,401
- Ha Ri. - Yes, Mr. Hwang?

817
00:52:57,771 --> 00:53:00,071
I'll need you to come somewhere with me.

818
00:53:01,071 --> 00:53:02,841
- Now? - Yes.

819
00:53:03,841 --> 00:53:05,010
Where would we go at this late hour?

820
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,280
You'll see.

821
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,120
Why are you being so serious all of a sudden?

822
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:18,021
I'll have the car ready, so please take your time.

823
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:40,010
Soo Min.

824
00:53:41,611 --> 00:53:42,981
What's going on?

825
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:46,091
I'll explain. Follow me.

826
00:53:46,691 --> 00:53:47,691
Well, then.

827
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:49,461
I'll let you two get to it.

828
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,760
Wait.

829
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,890
Don't get too intimate.

830
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,330
- Pardon? Mr. Hwang... - Go on.

831
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,301
Let's go.

832
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,030
Gosh. What is going on today?

833
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:05,841
Gosh.

834
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,280
Soo Min.

835
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,100
He's here.

836
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:44,680
(President Choi Sang Ho)

837
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,160
Thank you for coming all the way here.

838
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,301
It's a pleasure to meet you,

839
00:55:03,001 --> 00:55:04,001
Mr. Kang Ha Ri.

840
00:55:29,921 --> 00:55:34,861
(Epilogue)

841
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:36,731
- I want the drumstick. - It's mine.

842
00:55:36,731 --> 00:55:38,830
- Okay. Here's one for you. - Thanks.

843
00:55:40,631 --> 00:55:42,341
Who bought the chicken?

844
00:55:43,071 --> 00:55:44,240
We need protein.

845
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:49,780
Just looking at chicken makes me sad.

846
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:56,521
Thinking about what happened...

847
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,450
to that family...

848
00:55:59,591 --> 00:56:00,890
makes me sad too.

849
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:05,060
I can't even imagine how it feels...

850
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,091
to lose a child.

851
00:56:10,231 --> 00:56:11,231
Seriously.

852
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,771
Let's do an even better job this time, okay?

853
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,910
I'll head to bed first.

854
00:56:25,611 --> 00:56:27,180
When there's so much chicken left?

855
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,120
Cha Je Yi is the first to leave a meal?

856
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,850
Is Je Yi not feeling well?

857
00:56:46,771 --> 00:56:47,830
What's going on?

858
00:56:49,071 --> 00:56:51,240
What is it? I didn't even hear you come.

859
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,711
What are you hiding? Let me see.

860
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,370
Let me see my younger sister.

861
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:58,881
Younger sister, my foot.

862
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,580
Ah Ryung was like family to us.

863
00:57:11,521 --> 00:57:12,530
Don't be ridiculous.

864
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,961
Even now, you empathize with everyone else's stories,

865
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,200
but my sister's revenge is the last priority for you.

866
00:57:19,801 --> 00:57:20,830
And you call her family?

867
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:22,941
What kind of family is this?

868
00:57:23,771 --> 00:57:25,441
Family should put family first.

869
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,240
Of course.

870
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:30,211
But Je Yi.

871
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,850
But with this work, there is an order to things.

872
00:57:35,881 --> 00:57:38,080
Is revenge for my sister in your plan at all?

873
00:57:42,191 --> 00:57:43,821
I've never forgotten about it, even for a moment.

874
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,760
So...

875
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:49,131
what are you doing right now?

876
00:57:53,571 --> 00:57:54,930
You'll soon understand the meaning...

877
00:57:56,441 --> 00:57:57,571
of what we're doing now.

878
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:02,740
So please wait...

879
00:58:03,711 --> 00:58:05,140
and trust me until then.

880
00:58:07,881 --> 00:58:09,350
If you can't trust me,

881
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,950
at least trust them.

882
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:20,490
Hey, Cha Je Yi.

883
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:23,030
Are you done digesting?

884
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,100
Why are you being so soppy? It's not like you.

885
00:58:27,231 --> 00:58:30,441
Let's go out and relieve some stress.

886
00:58:30,441 --> 00:58:32,510
Yes. Let's eat something good and relieve some stress.

887
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,211
- We just ate. - That's in the past.

888
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:37,240
You have such bad fuel efficiency.

889
00:58:37,481 --> 00:58:39,350
The more luxurious the car, the worse fuel efficiency it has.

890
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:41,551
- Are you a luxurious car? - Of course. I'm not cheap.

891
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,220
- What? - Punk.

892
00:58:45,921 --> 00:58:47,021
What do you want to eat?

893
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:49,990
You are cheap.

894
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:51,760
Let's go.

895
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:09,780
(The Player 2: Master of Swindlers)

896
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:12,780
(Special thanks to Park Gun Hyung and Ryu Hwa Young for appearing.)

897
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,111
Please become my player, Mr. Kang.

898
00:59:40,111 --> 00:59:42,341
Long time no see, Damien Lee.

899
00:59:42,341 --> 00:59:43,481
How about you?

900
00:59:43,481 --> 00:59:45,010
He reacted so quickly.

901
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:46,881
Because he's quick when he smells money.

902
00:59:47,611 --> 00:59:49,950
I heard you went to the British National Academy.

903
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,921
What scheme are you cooking up now?

904
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:57,921
I'm not threatening you. I'm such a big fan.

905
00:59:57,921 --> 00:59:59,260
Then you can indict him.

906
00:59:59,591 --> 01:00:02,700
Of course, after you find undeniable evidence.

907
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,660
- This isn't going to work. Abort. - Cha Je Yi.

908
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:06,930
Abort the plan.
