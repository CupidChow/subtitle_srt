1
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,360
   

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,930
   

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,700
   

4
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,740
   

5
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,830
   

6
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:45,260
   

7
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,800
Hey, pass the ball!

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,640
   

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,530
Hey, pass the ball!

10
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,510
Hey! No, no!

11
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,040
Amasius, you have a guest!

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,990
Pass, pass!

13
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,640
I heard.

14
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,510
You are into charity and volunteer work these days, huh?

15
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,740
Why? It doesn't suit you.

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,470
I'm trying things that don't suit me.

17
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,690
Why?

18
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,190
I committed a lot of sins.

19
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,840
I'm bound to go to hell at this rate.

20
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,110
Were you planning to go to a good place?

21
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:57,480
Well, I wasn't planning to go to a bad place.

22
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:03,370
So, you're protesting to go to a good place or are you aiming for an extenuation?

23
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:08,700
Geez. It's not something you can get just by aiming for it, poor bastard.

24
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,550
I'm going to live a quiet life. That's what I decided to do.

25
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,810
Okay. I understand what you're thinking, and

26
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,680
they said they also got the message.

27
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,970
So, let's go do our work.

28
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,480
Hey, Kang Ha Ri, you crazy asshole!

29
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,760
Are you crazy for money or something?

30
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,270
How could you, even after going through that...

31
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,500
Forget it. Just leave.

32
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,710
It's because I went through it.

33
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,340
I'm asking you to join me because we went through it.

34
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,550
Not for the money.

35
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,380
For revenge.

36
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,910
Byeong Min said he would come, too.

37
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,560
Jin Woong.

38
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,800
Let's just go to hell.

39
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,690
I'm Eddie Jung.

40
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,190
Eddie Jung?

41
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,570
Eddie Jung.

42
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,330
Nice to meet you. I'm Mr. Song.

43
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,330
Nice to meet you, too.

44
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,940
You look familiar.

45
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,590
Have we met before?

46
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,660
I'm not sure.

47
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,700
I think I'm meeting you for the first time.

48
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,180
How odd.

49
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,440
I think we had a lot of fun.

50
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,430
Stay put.

51
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,090
Don't touch me. I warned you.

52
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,030
Don't move.

53
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,190
Stop it. That's enough.

54
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,910
I said that's enough, you punk!

55
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,920
What are you doing right now?

56
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,820
Seriously.

57
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,450
I think I'll need you to

58
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,400
explain what's going on right now.

59
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,930
Oh, we got the location. 
   

60
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,170
Yes, Prosecutor. The address is...

61
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,100
91 Soinang-ro, Yeongmoo-myeon, Bocheon-si, Yeonki-do.

62
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,170
Gosh, these punks went to a resort for vacation.

63
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,510
And they went quite far, too.

64
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,940
It'll take one hour.

65
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,300
 Tell him to hold them in place until then. 

66
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,400
Yes, I'll do that.

67
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,680
If it goes wrong, we'll get rid of the target right away.

68
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,760
Who's the main target?

69
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,000
What's wrong? You don't have any explanation to give?

70
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,460
Wait a moment.

71
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:42,530
Mr. Song, do we have to go this far?

72
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,630
Fine. You win.

73
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,960
Yes, I'm the one who gave the order to go and overturn the rigged deal.

74
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,840
I was doubtful of this deal in the first place.

75
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,490
- What?
 - Mr. Jung.

76
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,300
What do you mean by that?

77
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,240
CEO, you really don't get it?

78
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,560
Right now, we only have your money, and Mr. Song's goods aren't here.

79
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,960
We just might lose our money only right now!

80
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,150
CEO, is this how you've been making your deals so far?

81
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,970
Of course not.

82
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,290
It'd make no sense if the goods weren't here.

83
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,720
Yes.

84
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,350
Where are the goods?

85
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,680
I see...

86
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,630
This is how you're going to get through, huh?

87
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:54,400
CEO Kim, why wouldn't the goods be here?

88
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,320
You bet.

89
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,400
Hey!

90
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,930
Bring that sugar.

91
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,700
   

92
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,290
   

93
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,130
Hey, take care.

94
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,960
 I'll be right back, so you all should eat! 

95
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,150
Wow.

96
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,470
What's all this?

97
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:31,030
You know, Korea is more or less an island.

98
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,840
"Our hope is unification."

99
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,110
We've been chanting that forever.

100
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,680
But traveling overland is still impossible.

101
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,520
It's so hard to get anything into this country.

102
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,080
But you've had no problem getting them in via planes and ships.

103
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,420
You only need to get the goods, CEO.

104
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,180
So, you only saw the successful cases.

105
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,430
Korean schools are terrible at teaching students,

106
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,540
but they're fucking good at teaching dogs.

107
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:04,050
These fucking dogs are so good at sniffing things out.

108
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,520
Oh, I wasn't cursing at you.

109
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,340
Please don't misunderstand.

110
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,800
A fucking dog.

111
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,320
A fucking retriever.

112
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,160
Is that why you even produce them here now?

113
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,480
Even better.

114
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,040
Korean goods are the best for Korean people.

115
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,370
All right. You should go and confirm it now.

116
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,520
The goods you were dying to see.

117
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,630
Sure.

118
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,740
Come on now! That's not right.

119
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,400
You're going to half-ass it like that when you care so much about quality?

120
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,610
You need to check it out properly.

121
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,920
Hey, Mr. Song, don't you think your joke went too far?

122
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,700
No.

123
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,040
This guy is the one who's joking around, not me.

124
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,560
Am I wrong, Kang Ha Ri?

125
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,240
Kang Ha Ri.

126
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:47,260
I came here just to make some money. Let's not bring up old stories now.

127
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,690
I'd be thankful if you'd do that.

128
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,200
But would you really do that?

129
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,740
So, prove it to me.

130
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:06,570
That your soul is rotten enough to make a deal with your enemy who killed your friend.

131
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,190
Shit.

132
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,760
Jae Yi. Jae Yi?

133
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,350
I lost contact with Jae Yi suddenly.

134
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,620
E-Excuse me, Prosecutor. Prosecutor Kwak.

135
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,380
Kwak─ H-His name?

136
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,000
- Do Su. 
- K-Kwak Do Su! Kwak—

137
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,950
I-I think we lost contact with this guy, too.

138
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,170
A-Ahjeossi, Ahjeossi!

139
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,590
I'm so cold because I'm wearing mesh clothing.

140
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,570
Please bring me a down jacket. It's so cold.

141
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,300
I remember now that I see those fools like that.

142
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,950
As I thought, you didn't come to make money.

143
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,740
Did you come to get killed by me again?

144
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,790
What's this?

145
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,470
Hi. Everyone, stop.

146
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,340
Gosh, you took your sweet time. You know?

147
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,840
What's he saying?

148
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,750
It was also hard to get the right timing.

149
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,230
Go get them all!

150
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,910
 They really even do productions here? 

151
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,890
 Here is your evidence. 

152
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,070
 But why did you have to startle me from behind, Ahjeossi— 

153
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,710
 Ahjeo— 

154
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,510
 Am I supposed to come waving my hand at you? 

155
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,350
 Let's go. 

156
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,740
 - Freeze!
 - Don't move! 

157
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,860
All right. Where's the exit?

158
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,520
That was so fucking dark.

159
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,330
Come here, you asshole!

160
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,760
Good shot!

161
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,200
What's this? Is that all you got?

162
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,920
What would you have done without a gun?

163
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,720
Don't shoot.

164
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,340
Don't shoot!

165
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,900
 No. 

166
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,370
 Stop it, you asshole! 

167
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,120
Gosh, I thought it was a convention!

168
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,120
Gosh, I said I'm going!

169
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,460
Gosh!

170
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,090
You don't know who I am, do you?

171
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:34,130
Why's he so proudly trying to tell them about himself?

172
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:38,080
All right! That man over there is CEO Kim Yun Gi of KU Entertainment.

173
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,840
Please rough him up if he doesn't cooperate!

174
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,130
You like my present, right?

175
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,800
Yes, I love it so much.

176
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,050
- Every day is Christmas for me these days. 
 - It must be great.

177
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:55,120
But at the same time, it's not perfectly great.

178
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,280
You can go finish unboxing now, then.

179
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,200
Santa's going home now.

180
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,520
Hey, Kang Ha Ri.

181
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:08,360
You're not Santa, but you're my last present.

182
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,420
I'm looking forward to the day I'll unbox you the most.

183
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,190
Let's go, Prosecutor.

184
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:30,410
Shit! Fuck it!

185
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,520
You're just as noisy as the others.

186
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,300
Cherish your life more.

187
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,870
Because you don't get extra lives.

188
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,930
My body's not what it used to be.

189
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,380
Gosh, I'm so tired.

190
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,380
Is that guy the one?

191
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,930
The one who killed your colleague?

192
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,090
Yes, he's one of them.

193
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,500
You're all okay.

194
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,350
Aigoo, of course. This much is a piece of cake.

195
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:32,000
When I took a job in Europe in the past, I learned this thing called Krav Maga.

196
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,320
Krav Maga is the best self-defense.

197
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,670
360 Defense! You can block attacks from 360 degrees.

198
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:41,600
There's no opening for your enemy. Some fellas went home while waiting for an opening.

199
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,500
Block and attack! Block and attack─

200
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,300
Beautiful women have always made me weak.

201
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,330
And what's with the long face over here?

202
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,700
What's wrong?

203
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,410
You didn't beat them up enough?

204
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,590
Yeah, I should've beat the crap out of one of them.

205
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,750
But I let him go alive.

206
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,300
What a shame!

207
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,940
Jae Yi, you were great today.

208
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,560
Hey!

209
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,790
 Director, are you okay? It feels great to finally loosen up a little bit. 

210
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,590
 Oppa, I'm hungry. Let's go eat. 

211
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,170
- Sure. What should we eat?
 - Some beef.

212
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,940
What's that?

213
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,910
Ha Ri, take cover!

214
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,070
 - Excuse me! Please help us here!  
- Prosecutor.

215
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,070
Kang Ha Ri was...

216
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:56,490
I guess you really don't know well, Prosecutor.

217
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,950
I won't be arrested for something like this anyway.

218
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,720
Oh, I see. Is that right?

219
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,120
Do you know how many people I have in the Prosecutor's Office alone?

220
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,940
I wouldn't know.

221
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:11,520
If you knew, you wouldn't be able to treat me like this.

222
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,190
So, let's not waste our energies needlessly

223
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:19,440
and let's try to come to a good conclusion together.

224
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:29,020
- With me? 
 - Yes, with you.

225
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,260
Do you think we're on a blind date?

226
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,890
Why would I come to a good conclusion with you, Kim Yun Gi?

227
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,370
We're headed in different directions.

228
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,520
Gosh, this man is really...

229
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,510
Are you going to retire after this case?

230
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,250
You need to learn to look further ahead.

231
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:53,540
My company makes 500 billion won (~$350 mio.) per year through NTry alone.

232
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,610
Five-hundred billion won.

233
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,590
I've got the money and the connections.

234
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,770
There's nothing you can't do with those two in Korea.

235
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:06,360
I see. You can take care of those connections.

236
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,210
But I think...

237
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,140
you won't have much money anymore.

238
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,140
   

239
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:31,100
 The five of us in NTry are canceling our exclusive contract with KU Entertainment 

240
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,730
 and exposing the true nature of Kim Yun Gi, our agency's CEO. 

241
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:38,830
Kim Yun Gi, our agency's CEO, abused his position as the CEO of the company

242
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,580
to regularly abuse the company's artists and employees, verbally and physically.

243
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,350
 And he continuously forced the trainees to escort 

244
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,340
 the upper echelon at drinking parties. 

245
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,690
Sexual assaults and harassment were a given.

246
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:56,490
The victims were even forcefully injected with

247
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,820
the drugs CEO Kim Yun Gi distributed.

248
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:06,900
Do you happen to have evidence you can reveal here?

249
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,380
Yes.

250
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:16,040
 Hey, we've seen our best and worst. 
  

251
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,310
- It's true? 
- No way.

252
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:21,470
- This can't be. 
- It was the CEO's doing?

253
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,290
   

254
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,890
Look at that. The rumor back then was true. 
    

255
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,830
- Oh, really? 
- Yes.
    

256
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:36,340
 I hope ugly crimes like this, where someone's dream is taken hostage, 

257
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:41,150
 won't ever happen again, starting with our actions today. 

258
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,860
Mr. Song's location still hasn't been identified?

259
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:56,220
Correct. After he escaped from the scene, he still hasn't been seen anywhere.

260
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,350
Oh, and regarding CEO Kim Yun Gi,

261
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,430
I think the higher-ups are talking about probation.

262
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:07,370
It looks like they're trying to just wrap it up lightly.

263
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:11,070
The case isn't light, so why would it be wrapped up lightly?

264
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,750
He's got one heck of a connection, for sure.

265
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,520
Still, the media is onto him, and a lot of people have taken an interest.

266
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,410
It won't be easy to wrap it up, right?

267
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:24,970
Are the media our court and the people our judge?

268
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:29,300
If that's the case, why do we need the people who work here?

269
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,170
Prosecutor Kwak, CEO Kim has...

270
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,280
-  Hey, check the CCTV. 
- Yes. 

271
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,060
 Shit! 

272
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,310
 Hey, you didn't see anyone suspicious? 

273
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,950
 I didn't. 

274
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,880
 Damn it. 

275
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,540
 People who are scarier than criminals are people 

276
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,560
 who committed crimes yet haven't been marked as criminals. 

277
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:26,290
 As long as those people exist, the law cannot keep anyone safe. 

278
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,350
I'm pissed.

279
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,850
Prosecutor!

280
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,580
You forgot this.

281
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,460
Thank you.

282
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,440
You should quit now.

283
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,380
What the heck?

284
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,400
Let's quit together starting tomorrow.

285
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,040
Sure.

286
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,990
By the way,

287
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,050
is he alive, at least?

288
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:19,990
Did you come to comfort me or kill me?

289
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:24,580
I'll die from sleep deprivation because of the noise!

290
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,200
- My goodness.
 - I'm sorry.

291
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,450
This thing's really sad.

292
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,930
Look at this. Isn't it sad?

293
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,860
You'll cry like this at my funeral, too, right?

294
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,330
Would that be this sad?

295
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:52,190
Hey, you're fated to live long, so you'll die a peaceful death.

296
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:56,140
Just look at you. Even bullets avoid hitting you.

297
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,190
The main character never gets shot.

298
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:02,000
Oh, is that so? I forgot you're the main character.

299
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,680
Aigoo, sure. I hope you live a long life. Live long and healthy!

300
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,920
Hey, just get going now. Okay?

301
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,740
CEO Kim was found dead at the detention center.

302
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,810
CEO Kim died?

303
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,260
You expected this.

304
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,460
The day CEO Kim was arrested, the drug smuggler escaped from the scene.

305
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,490
His reinforcement came to his rescue at the end.

306
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:43,170
 The ones who shot Ha Ri and the ones who got rid of Kim Yun Gi and Kang Do Yeong 

307
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,580
 all work for the same organization. 

308
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:57,030
By the way, since when did you know?

309
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,510
Know what?

310
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:02,380
That Kang Do Yeong and Mr. Song are in the same organization.

311
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,920
Well, from the beginning.

312
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,680
I never told you, though.

313
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,600
It's because I think we've been heading in the same direction

314
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,970
from the moment we first met.

315
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:22,940
How sweet. It sounds like a love confession.

316
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,820
Well, you can say this is a type of confession if you want to.

317
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,750
Sure. Since I got your confession now,

318
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:33,860
you should prepare to meet your father-in-law.

319
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,570
Wait, that's the next step after a confession?

320
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,430
Don't you think it's too soon?

321
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,450
Gosh, not at all.

322
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:44,080
I should've introduced you way earlier.

323
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,630
I can't help but think you love me too much.

324
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,970
I'm glad you know.

325
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:55,300
Since we're in love, shall we go there first right now?

326
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,400
 H-Hey, please, let's get there normally! 

327
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,880
H-Hey, I'll just go to Ha Ri if you're going to do this!

328
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,250
Let me get off. Please pull over!

329
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,260
Jae Yi, cars have this thing called brakes.

330
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,950
Can't you use that function together, please?

331
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,160
I do... when we arrive.

332
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,730
Why you!

333
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,630
Wait, D-Director, when are we going to arrive?

334
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,160
Director, when─

335
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,430
- I think the Director fell asleep.
 - Huh? Are you sure he's sleeping?

336
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,450
- Don't you think he passed away?
- Director! Director!

337
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:43,160
- Don't touch me! I'm meditating right now.
 - My gosh.

338
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,200
If you focus and secrete alpha waves from your brain, regardless of how fast a car goes─

339
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,660
Director!

340
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,100
- Do you have a plastic bag?
 - No, we don't have any, Director!

341
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,110
- Plastic bag- 
 - My goodness. That's gross!

342
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,660
For crying out loud, this guy!

343
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:08,170
Chicken. Oh, the chicken. My chicken!

344
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:13,220
   

345
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,290
Lies.

346
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,100
This has to be a lie.

347
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,230
Please tell me it's a lie.

348
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,730
No way.

349
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:27,540
I can't miss my protein macros!

350
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,880
I told you we should get delivery!

351
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,550
Excuse me, g-guys. Guys!

352
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,770
There seems to be a— Could you hold me, please?

353
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,950
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

354
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:43,070
But we didn't come here to eat chicken.

355
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,820
- What?
 - Huh?

356
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,300
We came because I had something to tell you about this place.

357
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,630
That's like appreciating music at the gym.

358
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,720
I'm so shaky right now.

359
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,450
Is it because my sugar is low?

360
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:00,140
Is it because I'm fuc... furious?

361
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:03,210
Why would we have to come this far—

362
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:07,230
S-So what are you saying?

363
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:13,900
The reason why this place closed down.

364
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,030
Why did we come all the way? Hey, escort him to the car.

365
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,900
 Director, just come. 
   

366
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,670
   

367
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,740
Wait, w-we really came here right now.

368
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,230
Yes.

369
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,020
My body hasn't fully recovered yet.

370
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:36,310
So, for a wound to heal, you need to focus your energy on it.

371
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:40,150
If I direct my energy elsewhere, the wound will get worse. I can't be doing that.

372
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,160
It's okay.

373
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,090
I'm not okay!

374
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,800
Why? Are you scared?

375
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,630
I'm never scared to—

376
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:53,720
I mean, wait. Seriously. I understand, Su Min.

377
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,280
I can understand why you'd think of me like that, but...

378
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,630
I don't know what you thought of me,

379
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,940
but I'm a lot more conservative than you think.

380
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,590
Gosh, are you really going to do this? It's no fun.

381
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:08,240
We got the job done right. So, let's get right to it to celebrate!

382
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,440
- Who celebrates like this? 
- Huh?

383
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,760
 Seriously. I really did my best to stop you. 
  

384
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,670
 I-It's really on you from now on. 

385
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,370
Was it fun teasing me? Huh?

386
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,530
What are you doing?

387
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,380
What could it be?

388
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:36,400
Since we got one job done, we need to get on with the next job now.

389
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,470
Yes, sure. We need to get to work.

390
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,250
Was there some kind of an accident here?

391
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,360
Yes.

392
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,270
The victim and the assailant are young men who are the same age.

393
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,920
   

394
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,500
All done!

395
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:04,470
   

396
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,580
   

397
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:21,270
- I'm here. 
- Huh?

398
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:24,140
Aigoo, you should rest if you're done studying. Why would you come?

399
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,930
I get some air and exercise, so it's great.

400
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:29,530
And delivery fees are so expensive these days.

401
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,940
You don't know how to cut costs when you run a business.

402
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,710
- I'll be right back. 
- Yes.

403
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:36,490
Son, drive safely.

404
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:39,670
Of course! I'll be back.

405
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,220
   

406
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,300
Oppa, don't do it!

407
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,420
Valet! Valet.

408
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,690
What are you doing?

409
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,700
I need to pay the valet.

410
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,340
I should give you money.

411
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,060
- I give you money.
 - Must be great to have a lot of money!

412
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,490
Hey, your money's here.

413
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,800
- Stop being so cheap! 
- Hey, be careful!

414
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,550
- Don't worry about me, okay? 
- Okay.

415
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,140
- Da Yeong!
 - Huh?

416
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,990
- I'm going now! 
- Take care.

417
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,780
- What's going on with you two? 
 - I'm going!

418
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,610
- But you drank! 
- I told you not to worry about me.

419
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:40,200
- You can't drive drunk.
 - Be careful!

420
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,000
- I'm going! 
- Okay.

421
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,580
Hey, Won Jun, drive slowly!

422
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,360
It's okay. It's okay.

423
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,710
- Bye.
 - Go that way.

424
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,050
   

425
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,330
Gosh.

426
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,410
- Are you okay? 
- Who are you?

427
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,380
Did you drink?

428
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,770
Whether I drank or not, why the fuck are you waking me up?

429
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:26,160
Hey, get out of my face.

430
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,250
You should get a designated driver before you get into an accident.

431
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,440
Fuck! I told you to get lost.

432
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,950
This fucking bastard...

433
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,010
You can't be driving drunk. I'll get you a designated driver!

434
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:38,180
Please wait here a moment. You have to stay here.

435
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,230
Hi, it's the driving service, right? I need a designated driver here.

436
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:51,620
Yes, yes. This is Munhwa-ro, Sadam.

437
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,780
He's reporting me! That crazy bastard!

438
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,770
Dad... Dad, I think I'm in trouble.

439
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,920
What do I do?

440
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,250
Huh? Okay. Yes.

441
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:13,440
Don't tell me a trash like him still hasn't been caught?

442
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,320
Of course...

443
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,450
he was caught.

444
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:22,510
He was caught by the police on that day, and he was even tried in court.

445
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,860
However...

446
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,370
- Wait, only probation? 
- Yes.

447
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:32,220
Wait, on what basis could he get probation?

448
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:36,070
Man, that's a complete nonsense! He outright killed a person.

449
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:38,590
Looking at the court records from back then,

450
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,420
they couldn't even prove intentionality in the first place.

451
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:46,030
Even if that's the case. He ran a red light while driving drunk and did a hit-and-run.

452
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:48,910
This is totally that kind of case.

453
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,360
What kind?

454
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,330
It's that somebody's got his back.

455
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:56,280
Yes, that's right. He's a third-gen chaebol.

456
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,750
The assailant, Min Won Jun, is the eldest son of WQ Group.

457
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:04,160
I'm so sick of this crap. Are these kids above the law?

458
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,750
There's a person who blurs out the clear truth for them.

459
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,690
Very professional at that.

460
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,860
The people of Ipsan Village filed a class action lawsuit after getting cancer from wastewater,

461
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,850
but Honhwa Corporation easily won due to a lack of evidence.

462
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:24,600
Nokan Construction won against residents who had their homes robbed.

463
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,240
Even Chairman Jang, who sexually assaulted his student's lover and made his student take his own life

464
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,200
was found innocent in the end.

465
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,070
W-Wait. Hold on here.

466
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:35,370
Are you saying all of them were done by one person?

467
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:39,000
- All of them, starting with Min Won Jun. 
- Wow...

468
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,020
Wow. Man, this is really something else. Right?

469
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,690
Even Vincenzo and Woo Young Woo would run away crying. 
  (Refering to the dramas Vincenzo and Extraordinary Attorney Woo) 

470
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,750
Wait, what's their occupation?

471
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,810
An attorney at a mega law firm?

472
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:55,550
Or a judge?

473
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,820
The answer is here.

474
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,510
   

475
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:15,980
This painting was drawn by pouring the paint without using a brush.

476
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,690
It's called the drip technique,

477
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:22,370
a technique created by a genius artist called Jackson Pollock.

478
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:25,480
I'm not exactly interested in the painting.

479
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:31,570
But Jackson Pollock leaves a critical error in his life.

480
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:34,700
He killed a person while driving drunk.

481
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,710
- Look here, Director Baek.
 - Do you know what's funny, though?

482
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:43,490
It's that Jackson Pollock's value didn't drop afterward.

483
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:49,590
Of course, his works are also some of the most expensive pieces in the world.

484
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,150
This is what I think.

485
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:02,150
WQ Group's heir's value also shouldn't be damaged because of a mere accident.

486
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,140
Also, it's just so trivial.

487
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,620
It's not like it was an accident between equal people.

488
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,050
A mere deliveryman?

489
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:18,560
A person might step on an ant while walking.

490
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,940
Don't you agree, Chairman Min?

491
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,050
That's right. Yes. That's it.

492
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:30,660
Director Baek, I'm counting on you.

493
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:41,600
The bike driver kept following me,

494
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,420
saying I get to ride a good car because I was born rich by luck.

495
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,070
Asking me how much the car was.

496
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:52,080
He kept distracting me from driving and trying to pick a fight.

497
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:57,030
No! No, Sang Wuk would never do such a thing!

498
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:59,250
Please be quiet!

499
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,630
Prosecutor, do you have any more questions to ask about the defendant's testimony?

500
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:09,830
 Please don't worry. 

501
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,310
 I made all the preparations. 

502
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:13,750
 I'll make sure to uncover all of Min Won Jun's crimes. 

503
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:17,490
The biker's violent driving or distractive behavior

504
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:21,040
were already confirmed in the witness testimony as well.

505
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:28,420
I don't have any questions.

506
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,270
 What? 

507
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:36,760
No! This can't be.

508
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,020
   

509
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:45,980
 I took care of the CCTV and the black box first thing. 

510
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:49,290
 That's probably the only video evidence left. 

511
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,500
 Aigoo, I'm so thankful. 

512
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:58,050
 By the way, we're on opposite teams, from what I know. 

513
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:02,670
 You know I'm the prosecutor who's trying to get Min Won Jun locked up, right? 

514
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:08,960
 Of course. That's why I invited you. 

515
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:12,210
 You're clearly mistaken here. 

516
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,720
 I'll put this evidence to good use. 

517
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,320
 I think you're the one who's mistaken, Prosecutor. 

518
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,960
 About what? 

519
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:32,150
 Mistaken that you're righteous. 

520
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,500
 This woman is crossing the line now. 

521
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,880
 How much money would you need to cure that mistake? 

522
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,690
 One hundred million won? 

523
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:44,510
 Or two hundred million won? 

524
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,880
 I hate bribery. 

525
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,410
 I absolutely dislike taking risks. 

526
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,570
 What if you don't have to take any risk? 

527
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:03,830
 What kind of bribery wouldn't be risky in this world? 

528
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:10,100
 Do you... 

529
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,720
 like paintings? 

530
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,680
 Send 20 million won to the gallery's account for the painting. 

531
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,560
 Once the trial is over, you'll get to sell it at the price you want. 

532
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,310
Here's the verdict.

533
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:35,040
The accident was caused by the provocation of the defendant, Lee Sang Wuk.

534
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,500
So, the accident is believed to be a result of an external influence

535
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,480
Min Won Jun's will or action can be blamed for.

536
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,350
As such, the court sentences the defendant,

537
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:50,640
Min Won Jun, to probation.
    

538
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,230
No way!

539
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,930
No way!

540
00:45:55,930 --> 00:46:00,880
No! This can't be.

541
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,880
Honey... No way!

542
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,610
Honey.

543
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:11,280
 The problem solver for Korea's VVIPs. 

544
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,950
That's who Director Baek is.

545
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:17,420
The paintings at her gallery are just currencies to make their trades convenient.

546
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,740
I mean, it's not like there's a recommended retail price on paintings.

547
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:26,490
That means they can insist all the money is from buying and selling the paintings.

548
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:30,300
By the way, are art gallery directors that strong?

549
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,840
Of course, you're stronger.

550
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,240
What the hell is this guy saying?

551
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,620
Was it about five years ago?

552
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:39,040
 She did get a divorce. 

553
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,030
 But she was a daughter-in-law of a chaebol family for a short time. 

554
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,230
 That woman became a chaebol family's daughter-in-law 

555
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:55,010
 not by the power of love or fate, obviously. 

556
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,150
 How can I put it? 

557
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,940
 A mutually benefitial partnership? 

558
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,610
 One had a lot rumors and the other had ambition. 

559
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:06,130
 They had each other by the throat. 

560
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:14,390
 But that woman didn't have the generosity to endure those boring times. 

561
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:19,000
 Her ambition was too great to do that. 

562
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:26,100
 So she leached out all she wanted and 

563
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:30,570
 got rid of everyone who got in her way. 

564
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,690
   

565
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:36,260
 However, she's always been so ambitious. 

566
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:39,410
 So, she's made quite the connections from back then. 

567
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:45,430
 She's especially got more intel than all of the prosecution combined. 

568
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,330
Congratulations on your publication, Assemblyman.

569
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:52,320
Aigoo, thank you for coming with your busy schedule.

570
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,580
Oh, my. Your wife was here, too.

571
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,070
Director Choi, you're doing well, right?

572
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:58,380
Yes, of course. And you're doing well, too, right?

573
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,110
Of course.

574
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,370
   

575
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,320
- One moment, please.
 - Oh, sure.

576
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,510
I'll see you again later.

577
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:10,190
We meet again here!

578
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:14,190
We'll get going first.

579
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:17,500
It must be fate.

580
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,040
I doubt it.

581
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,460
Judge Kang is doing well, right?

582
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,720
Yes, I guess.

583
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,430
Oh, my, Madam...

584
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:28,910
your shoes.

585
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,210
We really are meant to be.

586
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:36,250
We even have similar tastes in shoes.

587
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,550
I'm wearing them only because they are a gift.

588
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,600
But they're a bit uncomfortable for me.

589
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:44,620
I guess you can say they're too light.

590
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,920
It's definitely not my cup of tea.

591
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,700
- I see.
 - Right.

592
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:54,750
I had the painting you sent Judge Kang sent back to your gallery today.

593
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:59,720
Don't send stuff like that without permission from now on.

594
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,160
It's rude.

595
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,880
I'm just worried about you,

596
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:09,840
since you might be misunderstood as an easy woman.

597
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:20,410
I was careless, Madam.

598
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,740
Not at all. It's understandable.

599
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:34,690
I thought those shoes were your type after seeing Actor Yeo Min's new car.

600
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,830
What do you mean?

601
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:40,950
The new car you bought him recently.

602
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:44,110
It was a bit light, but it still stood out.

603
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,790
Oh, right.

604
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:52,780
Don't go to that actor's house too often.

605
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,850
I'm also just worried.

606
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:59,600
Since you might be misunderstood as an easy married woman.

607
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,450
Is this not a misunderstanding?

608
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:08,030
I'll send the painting back to the judge.

609
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,390
 If she opens up her vault just a tiny bit, 

610
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:22,750
making most people become humble isn't even a problem.

611
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:25,150
She's something else.

612
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:30,400
She ran wild for that long, but she's been accused only once so far.

613
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,370
But they couldn't even prove it was bribery.

614
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:37,390
So, it has been dismissed more or less by now.

615
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:40,890
Aigoo, this one's going to be a headache.

616
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:43,430
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.

617
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:47,940
Stand up! Our hero is here.

618
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,420
Kang Ha Ri! Kang Ha Ri!

619
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,540
H-Hey, don't do it!

620
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:56,330
M-My arm hurts! I-It hurts.

621
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:58,580
- Are you okay? 
- I was okay, but he'll kill me now.

622
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:03,250
- Hey.
 - Hey, I thought you were really going to die!

623
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,720
That's enough.

624
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,210
- Welcome home!
 - Welcome home!

625
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:11,290
All right. Let's eat first since you're here. Okay?

626
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:13,820
- Oh, Su Min is—
 - Yes, I know.

627
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:18,130
- Thanks for the food. 
- Hey, hurry up and eat. I'm starving.

628
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:19,890
I was really about to starve to death.

629
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:23,590
I talked so much today that I'm having insulin shock.

630
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,030
As you said,

631
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:53,140
 they're the same punks from the Kang Do Yeong case. 

632
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:56,320
They're moving as if they know what our plan is, huh?

633
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,740
 Should I keep following them? 

634
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,250
Yes.

635
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,910
I must know who their head is.

636
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:04,800
 Yes, I understand. 

637
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:17,200
Little thieves trying so hard.

638
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,730
Interesting.

639
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:30,030
It seems Kang Ha Ri has got a rough idea now.

640
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:32,140
Is that so?

641
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:37,600
In that case, we've got more than enough confirmation now.

642
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,530
So, there's no reason to postpone it further.

643
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,290
That means...

644
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:43,980
Please call him over right now.

645
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:47,080
Let's meet Kang Ha Ri.

646
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,020
Yes, I got it.

647
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:57,740
- Oh, Ha Ri.
 - Yes, Director.

648
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,960
I think you'll have to come with me for a moment.

649
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,750
- Right now? 
 - Yes.

650
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,910
Where, at this hour?

651
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:08,350
You'll see when you're there.

652
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,230
But why are you being so serious all of a sudden, Director?

653
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:17,160
I'll wait in the car outside.

654
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,220
Take your time and come out.

655
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,760
Hey, Su Min.

656
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,940
What's going on right now?

657
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:46,670
I'll explain. Come with me.

658
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:49,900
All right. You two can tend to your business.

659
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,710
Oh, hold on.

660
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:53,400
Don't get too intimate.

661
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,400
What? Wait, Director Hwang—

662
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,980
Let's go.

663
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:03,070
My gosh. What's going on today?

664
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,060
Su Min!

665
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:30,140
I brought him.

666
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,920
   

667
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:01,100
Thank you for coming all the way here.

668
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,910
It's a pleasure to meet you, Kang Ha Ri.

669
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:35,330
   

670
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:36,740
- I'll eat the drumstick. 
- It's mine.

671
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:39,740
- Okay, okay. Here's one more. 
- Thanks.

672
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:43,050
Hey, who bought the chicken, by the way?

673
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:45,220
Fill up on protein.

674
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,870
I get sad from just looking at chicken now.

675
00:55:55,590 --> 00:56:02,050
My heart also feels heavy when I think about what happened to them.

676
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:07,990
I can't even fathom what it would feel like to lose your child.

677
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:15,770
Seriously. So, let's make sure to get this done right again.

678
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:24,780
Please excuse me.

679
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:28,050
H-Hey, you didn't even finish eating.

680
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:30,310
Wait, Cha Jae Yi's the first one to finish eating?

681
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:33,950
What... Is Jae Yi feeling ill?

682
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,290
What is it?

683
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:52,190
What's this? You didn't even knock.

684
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:54,210
What did you hide? Let me see her, too.

685
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,700
It's been forever. My sis.

686
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,080
Sis, my foot.

687
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:06,590
Ah Ryeong was family to us.

688
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:13,740
Don't make me laugh.

689
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,610
You sympathized with everyone's story just now,

690
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:19,780
but my eonni's matter is way down your list.

691
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,920
And you call her family?

692
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,720
What kind of family is like this?

693
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,210
You'd take care of family first if you really are a family.

694
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,100
Of course.

695
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:31,000
However, Jae Yi,

696
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:35,010
there's an order to doing things.

697
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:39,300
Is my eonni's revenge even on the list?

698
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,830
I haven't forgotten it, not even for a moment.

699
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:50,280
What the heck are you doing right now, then?

700
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:58,530
You'll soon realize the meaning behind everything we're doing right now.

701
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,760
So, just a bit longer. Okay?

702
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,450
Please trust me just a bit longer until then.

703
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:10,370
If you really can't trust me,

704
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:13,990
please trust them, at least.

705
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:22,010
Hey, Cha Jae Yi.

706
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:24,140
Are you done digesting?

707
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:27,200
Why are you suddenly depressed, unlike you?

708
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,510
You know what? Let's go out and destress.

709
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,590
Yes, let's all go out and eat something tasty to destress.

710
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:35,830
- We just ate.
 - That was a moment ago.

711
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:37,560
What terrible mileage.

712
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,440
The high-class ones always have terrible mileage.

713
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,760
- You're high-class? 
- Of course. Am I cheap, then?

714
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,280
- Yes.
 - Why you.

715
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:47,690
What should we eat?

716
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:50,110
Yes, you're cheap.

717
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:52,690
Let's go! Let's go.

 Long time no see, 

728
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:43,530
 Damian Lee. How about you? 

729
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:45,680
 As expected, she responds fast. 

730
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,620
 She can smell money from a mile away. 

731
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:51,600
 I heard you graduated from the British National Academy. 

732
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,650
 What are you scheming this time? 

733
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:58,040
 What do you mean I'm blackmailing you? I'm your biggest fan! 

734
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,660
 Then, you can prosecute me. 

735
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:03,480
 Of course, you would need to secure clear evidence first. 

736
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,690
 - Forget this. Operation abort.
 - Cha Jae Yi! 

737
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:08,050
 This operation has been aborted completely.
