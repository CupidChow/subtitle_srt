1
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,340
   

2
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,790
   

3
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,620
   

4
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,700
   

5
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,760
   

6
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,190
   

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,310
 I did expect to meet someone great, 
  

8
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,620
 but I didn't think you'd be here, Mr. President. 

9
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,700
 Why would you need someone like me? 

10
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,420
 Because evil needs to be crushed with evil. 

11
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,960
 So, I'm making a request. 

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,980
 Kang Ha Ri, please become my player who will represent me. 

13
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,200
 The assailant, Min Won Jun, is the eldest son of WQ Group. 

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,520
 Wait, only probation? 

15
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,750
 The problem solver for Korea's VVIPs. That's who Director Baek is. 

16
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,160
 This is the work of Damien Lee, the global rising star. 

17
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,040
 350 million won has won the bid! 

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,460
 Artist Damien Lee? 

19
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,180
 Get it in and infiltrate enemy territory. 

20
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,030
 - Wow, it's totally the Trojan Horse. 
- Bingo. 

21
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,880
 Put it under worker's compensation. 

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,750
 This is a ledger. A record of briberies. 

23
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,330
 - I don't know anything about this. 
- Mission accomplished. 

24
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,710
 Here. 

25
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,570
 I won. 

26
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,590
 Mr. Han, known as Villa King for owning hundreds of villas, was found dead. 

27
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,070
 Mysterious deaths of Villa Kings in different areas have occurred. 

28
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,010
 Mr. Myeong? 
  

29
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,250
 Mr. Myeong. Have you heard of him? 

30
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,590
 A hidden hand in the real estate market. 

31
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,300
 He's so filthy that he's pitch black. So, you can't see him. 

32
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,490
 Mr. Myeong doesn't officially exist. 

33
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,810
 We've already laid the ground in this area to stay one step ahead of Mr. Myeong. 

34
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,260
 - Aigoo, CEO Im. 
- My gosh, Mr. Kim! 

35
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,860
 Are you saying you want to see us do a job? 

36
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,940
 He said I should make sure and see it for myself. 

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,090
 - Everyone, stop!
 - They got us. 

38
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,040
 Mr. Myeong said to let you all go in one piece. 

39
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,510
 So don't ever show up around here. 

40
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,440
 The trust hinges on suspicion. 

41
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,190
 He could trust us as much as his suspicion. 

42
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,540
 Mr. Newbie, it's time to play your role. 

43
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,870
 What do they take me for? 

44
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,320
 You're under arrest for lease fraud. 

45
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,980
 Even a prosecutor showed up to arrest them? 

46
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,560
 Seems like I've found a worthy opponent. 

47
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,430
 Thanks to you, Prosecutor, he'll think we're trustworthy. 

48
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,620
 I'm sure he'll contact us again. 

49
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,760
 Mr. Choi, set up a meeting with Mr. Kim again. 

50
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,950
 Does Mr. Myeong want to meet me now? 

51
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,260
 Now is the moment I have to make a business decision. 

52
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,530
 Whether I will go along 

53
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,670
 with your game or not. 

54
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,530
 Mr. Myeong, you should say hi. 

55
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,630
 Glad to meet you. 

56
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,260
   

57
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:23,460
Mr. Jang, none of these guys will be able to walk around tomorrow.

58
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,260
This guy will have to be hospitalized for eight weeks.

59
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,570
And... this guy will have a 10-week hospitalization.

60
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:39,350
And this guy... one month, two months, three months!

61
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,000
Hey, get over here.

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,300
Get over here, shit! Attention.

63
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,180
- Pardon?
 - Attention.

64
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,860
At ease. Attention.

65
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,620
Give it to me.

66
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,270
I said give it to me. Shit!

67
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,980
Yes, well, this is a tranquilizer gun.

68
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,900
So, how do you use it—

69
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,970
I was going to explain it...

70
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,560
Wait, s-sorry.

71
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,250
I was going to explain—

72
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,460
Goodnight.

73
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,450
Hey, Ha Ri, don't you think it's a good time to explain things?

74
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,850
I'll speak to Mr. Myeong directly now.

75
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,280
You seem to worry a lot, don't you?

76
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,040
That's how you were able to remain unidentified.

77
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,080
But this time, your worries got the best of you.

78
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:51,750
You may have seen us get arrested but you didn't see the tenant for real.

79
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,360
I'm sure you were concerned.

80
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,190
 Very much so. 

81
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,550
   

82
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,830
   

83
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,480
 I knew you would want to confirm. 

84
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,620
 If it were Mr. Myeong, he would want to see it for himself. 

85
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:25,000


86
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,100
   

87
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,530
   

88
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,320
If you want to grab onto our tail, I'll give you mine. But instead

89
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,830
very dark, unerasable paint will be on that tail you just grabbed onto.

90
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,790
You installed a virus, huh?

91
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,680
Mr. Myeong, you like bicycle racing, don't you?

92
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,150
You look at it every day according to your browser history.

93
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,710
By chance, are you going after the bicycle races next? Acquisition?

94
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,190
A vehicle is approaching.

95
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,850
What?

96
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,510
Who could that be?

97
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,290
   

98
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,190
   

99
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,820
The man in there is a scammer who stole all of your assets.

100
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,520
But still, this is...

101
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,460
If you take care of him, he'll get your money back for you.

102
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,710
This Mr. Myeong.

103
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,600
He's got...

104
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,590
something in his hand.

105
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,180
A gun!

106
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,080
 It's a gun! 

107
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,240
Mr. Myeong, it's not like we're flirting with each other.

108
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,320
Let's talk business properly. Come on.

109
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,480
 Give me a call after you hear about it. 

110
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,920
Sure thing.

111
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,140
I don't drink coffee, so all I have is tea.

112
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,480
   

113
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,730
Why don't you drink your tea later?

114
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:19,690
This time, you'll need to come with me.

115
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:25,190
I have a great story to tell you.

116
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,290
Let us go as well.

117
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,430
Let's go.

118
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,420
W-Who...

119
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,760
   

120
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,520
What is it you want to tell me?

121
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,090
If you steal lease deposits from one neighborhood,

122
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,220
about 20 billion won (~$20 million) falls into your hands, right?

123
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:08,360
You can earn ten times that amount today alone.

124
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,190
 So, you get several hundred billion won in one go. 

125
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,610
What you guys have been doing will feel like child's play.

126
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,260
Yet you're trying to share a job like that with us?

127
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,630
Because I have to make sure I keep my promise.

128
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,590
What?

129
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,780
To pull this game together,

130
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,600
I put 50 million won (~$50.000) on the line.

131
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,170
You've heard the rumor about the new city being built in  Suseong City, right?

132
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,310
Do you think I'd pay attention to some rumor that's meant to lure me in?

133
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,640
A rumor is worthless as soon as you hear it.

134
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,250
It's worth it if you're the one coming up with one.

135
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,800
If it's true, that is.

136
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,340
Gosh, seriously...

137
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,840
That's all false rumor.

138
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,780
I mean, they announced the building an innovative city in Dongseong which is next door.

139
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,990
There's no reason to build a new city in Suseong.

140
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,600
I checked everything myself.

141
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,620
You know that Team Leader Seon? One of your guys.

142
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,280
He's probably hearing about it now.

143
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,800
   

144
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,240
Hey.

145
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,720
 Mr. Choi, I heard Dongseong City is actually fake 

146
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,640
 and the Suseong City is the real deal! 

147
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,560
Got it. Hang up for now.

148
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,740
Continue.

149
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,510
 I guess you don't believe me. 

150
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,700
If it was over this, we could've wrapped it up at the office.

151
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,780
We came out here for nothing.

152
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,080
I'll show you something interesting.

153
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,810
It's a total of 20 billion won.

154
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,740
Why are you showing this to me?

155
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,670
I'm on my way to the auction house.

156
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,810
There are quite a number of old villas where the new city is to be built.

157
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,230
And those villas are being auctioned off?

158
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,500
A combined worth of about 50 billion won (~$50 million).

159
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,340
We don't have much time until the auction.

160
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,150
The brokers and the bidders have all been synced.

161
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,920
It's over if I hand over the money to the broker?

162
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,760
Yes. The amount I promised the broker is 50 billion won.

163
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,910
I have 20 billion won.

164
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,930
So, you need 30 billion won more?

165
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,140
I'll get a call soon.

166
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,280
You just have to do what I tell you.

167
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,220
You could also have it all.

168
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,780
How so?

169
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,410
Since I know where Mr. Kim goes.

170
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,670
If he can't go anywhere because of my plan to have his car break down,

171
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,110
the broker will be furious and freak out.

172
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,110
Since he broke his promise.

173
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,780
Right then, you can show up with 50 billion won.

174
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,850
What's going on?

175
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,150
What do you mean?

176
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,100
You're Mr. Kim's right-hand woman.

177
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,900
If I'm his right-hand woman, as you say,

178
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,280
how much do you think I'd get to keep from this job?

179
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,330
After all of my expenses, maybe 1 percent?

180
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:03,920
If you have 50 billion won, you'll end up with hundreds of billions of won!

181
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,910
All I want is just 10 percent.

182
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,200
What if the broker makes an issue of it since I'm not the Mr. Kim you promised?

183
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,290
Is there a name written on the money?

184
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,780
Who cares whose money it is?

185
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,100
As long as it's money.

186
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,540
Sounds good.

187
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,640
Then, shall we get going?

188
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,200
Not yet.

189
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,530
   

190
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,800
Yes, sir.

191
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,490
Yes.

192
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,510
Got it, sir.

193
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,470
I have to stop and pick up something.

194
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,050
Sure. Of course.

195
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,250
Really?

196
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,720
D-Did Ha Ri really do that?

197
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm sure he had his reasons.

198
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,400
He ruined my life.

199
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,860
Are you saying there's a reason for going through all that?

200
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,970
Kang Ha Ri, you really crossed the line this time.

201
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,290
 Yes, Prosecutor, so as for that, 

202
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,650
many of the victims of Kang Ha Ri's lease fraud have requested criminal investigations.

203
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,200
 - Many?  
- Yes. Thirty of them.

204
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,670
The damages are over 10 billion won.

205
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,690
You hid money in the midst of trash?

206
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,590
What a typical old-school idea.

207
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,550
Help me out.

208
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,020
I have tons to move.

209
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,740
Sure.

210
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,090
Stop right there.

211
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,920
Slowly put your hands behind your head.

212
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,370
What are you trying to pull here?

213
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,460
Kneel.

214
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,970
- Mr. Choi—
 - Kneel. Now.

215
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,470
Geez.

216
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,410
It was a great plan.

217
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,840
Mr. Myeong?

218
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,200
You're younger than I thought.

219
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,260
In any case, how did you know?

220
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,810
How should I say...

221
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,590
I guess,

222
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,970
I would've done the same thing you did.

223
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,660
Rule one for players.

224
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,680
There's a reason for everything in this world.

225
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,930
If luck comes my way out of nowhere, it's one of two things.

226
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,500
It's either a scam or a lie.

227
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,600
I don't know if it'd be a consolation, but I almost fell for it.

228
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,720
Only if you had been cautious about one thing, I would've believed you.

229
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,790
Oh, yeah?

230
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,810
So, what should I have been cautious of?

231
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,020
Too good of a deal.

232
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:36,490
If you were careful with that detail, hundreds of billions of my money would be long gone by now.

233
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,890
Fine.

234
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,420
You took 20 billion won.

235
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,710
Consider it as a lesson fee, and let us go.

236
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,750
Lesson fee? Well, not sure.

237
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,500
I thought about it,

238
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,770
but you wouldn't work under me.

239
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,940
You would out a knife to my throat someday.

240
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,610
No. Not at all.

241
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,620
Rule two for players. The most important thing is money.

242
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,980
I also hate wasting time over emotions like revenge.

243
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,420
Okay.

244
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,200
Rules three for players.

245
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,090
There are no rules.

246
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,980
It's a scam.

247
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,990
You want me to tell you something interesting?

248
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:31,110
I already knew. That Kim Su Chan is for real.

249
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,900
I was curious

250
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:40,410
as to what would happen if I gave Kim Su Chan a gun.

251
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,190
 Had it gone according to the plan, 

252
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:47,150
 it would've been an interesting ending that suits Mr. Kim. 

253
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,720
 A game of getting devoured by prey. 

254
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,790
But oh, well.

255
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,120
It's disappointing, but what can you do?

256
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,030
You guys were hiding in the indoor fishing hole

257
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,000
and Kim Su Chan was an idiot who couldn't even take his own revenge.

258
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,040
It's kind of like a natural disaster, so to speak.

259
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,380
Something I can't control.

260
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,960
Mr. Kim, you understand me, right?

261
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,290
Mr. Myeong, it's not too late.

262
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,460
The villa auction is all true. If we head to the auction house—

263
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,210
Let's stop there.

264
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,270
Finish him.

265
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,860
If we don't go to the auction house now, we're both dead!

266
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:35,030
If you go like this, the real hell begins. You know that?

267
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,460
You should put some work into your lies.

268
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,870
Mr. Myeong!

269
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,750
Let's go.

270
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,840
Arrest them.

271
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,760
Four-week hospitalization!

272
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,750
W-W-Wait, wait, wait!

273
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:19,880
You! Six-week hospitalization!

274
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,330
Are you okay?

275
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,390
Kang Ha Ri!

276
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,640
Hurry up and get him—

277
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,440
Real people got hurt by your fake scams.

278
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,060
What?

279
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,440
Lease fraud. It wasn't fake.

280
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,350
W-What do you mean?

281
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:55,370
Kang Ha Ri took money from the victims for real!

282
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,550
I'm a victim.

283
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,520
I was scammed by that fraudster.

284
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,620
Prosecutor Kwak, if you arrest me here—

285
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,540
Did you really commit fraud like he says?

286
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,770
It wasn't just Kim Su Chan.

287
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:21,250
There are 30 victims and over 10 billion won in damages.

288
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,950
Ha Ri, it can't be, right?

289
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,280
You have a reason, right?

290
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,630
That fucker. Ha Ri, we don't go after just anybody.

291
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:35,000
We don't hurt innocent people. That's our rule!

292
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,270
I'll explain everything later.

293
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,770
I can tell you then.

294
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,380
Make a choice.

295
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:46,910
If you catch me now, you'll never catch Mr. Myeong.

296
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,790
Make your choice.

297
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,480
Okay.

298
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,380
I'll make my choice.

299
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:03,410
Kang Ha Ri, you're under arrest for lease fraud.

300
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,170
Take him.

301
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,900
Hey, hey, hey!

302
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,300
What are you doing?

303
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,110
- Hey, Ha Ri.
 - Oppa.

304
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:24,200
- Don't come. 
- Hey... That's not it, man!

305
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,310
Ha Ri, I don't know what you're thinking, but let's stop here.

306
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,280
Don't come.

307
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,190
Kang Ha Ri, shit!

308
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,850
Kang Ha Ri!

309
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,630
 Kang Ha Ri is on the run on a motorcycle. Chase him. 

310
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,970
Arrest all of them.

311
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,680
Prosecutor, we really had no idea. Not at all.

312
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,060
I'm not letting this one slide.

313
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,610
Put them in the van.

314
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,150
Jeong Su Min.

315
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,760
I warned you, didn't I?

316
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,420
Kang Ha Ri is just a fraudster.

317
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:14,140
You'll have to take responsibility for trusting him blindly and making the moves.

318
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,560
In front of the real victims who have lost their lives.

319
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,750
What happened?

320
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,750
 We lost him, Prosecutor. 

321
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,550
Mr. Myeong ran away

322
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,140
 and Kang Ha Ri disappeared. 

323
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,130
Kang Ha Ri.

324
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,270
It's time to put things in order.

325
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,150
For sure.

326
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,350
I can answer it, right?

327
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,830
Go ahead and answer it.

328
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,020
   

329
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,380
Who are you?

330
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,320
Hello, Prosecutor Kwak.

331
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,060
I'm President Choi Sang Ho.

332
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,630
Do you have a moment?

333
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,320
Yes, Mr. President.

334
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,680
I'm sure you're quite stunned.

335
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,440
Yes. No.

336
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,300
Yes, a little bit.

337
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,190
 I think I need to lift a huge weight 

338
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,540
off of your shoulders, Prosecutor Kwak.

339
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:56,050
I'm sure you're busy, but I shamelessly wanted to give you a call.

340
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,930
No, it's all right. Please go ahead.

341
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,280
Secretary Jeong Su Min and Kang Ha Ri.

342
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,050
They all work under me.

343
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:18,610
   

344
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,060
   

345
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,480
  
   

346
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,770
   

347
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:29,080
How much of this was discussed with Mr. President?

348
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,220
Mr. President only made the commission.

349
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,170
All the specifics came out of Ha Ri's brain.

350
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,010
Are you trying to cut off your tail with Kang Ha Ri?

351
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:45,290
Prosecutor, if we were trying to cut off the tail, would we have told you about the President?

352
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:48,060
If we hadn't told you, you would've had no idea.

353
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:53,610
By chance, do you still think we're all in on this and trying to deceive you?

354
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,260
You've been with us all this time.

355
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:01,390
Prosecutor, we're the ones who are most stunned and furious.

356
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:04,210
I had no idea Ha Ri would lie to us, too.

357
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:09,240
To me, you guys are the same as Kang Ha Ri now.

358
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,950
I can never trust you.

359
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,370
   

360
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:20,430
But is this villa auction a real thing?

361
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,060
It is. We picked our date to match the auction.

362
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,760
How about the broker?

363
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,070
 We lived in the States for about four years. 

364
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,650
 In the evening? 

365
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,360
 Well, I have— Shit! 

366
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,960
 What the hell is— 

367
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,770
 The broker. 
  

368
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,650
 - Broker?
 - Set it up like that. 

369
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,960
   

370
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,770
   

371
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,820
   

372
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,270
Lee Dong Gil.

373
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:59,610
Lee Dong Gil. I'm sure I've heard of that name.

374
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,550
Ha Ri...

375
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,400
Prosecutor!

376
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,760
Byeong Min, please connect.

377
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:14,820
 Listen to what I'm about to tell you. 

378
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:21,750
 Everything that is happening here is entirely true and 

379
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:25,430
there's not a single lie in what I'm about to tell you.

380
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,270
Ha Ri...

381
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,380
 If you don't bring 

382
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,110
- Lee Dong Gil.
  - 50 billion won by tonight, as we promised... 

383
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,700
Right.

384
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,420
It's him.

385
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,940
 Mr. Myeong, 

386
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,390
 if you don't keep your promise, 

387
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,410
 we're all going to die. 

388
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,460
All of us.

389
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,770
 This is a preview. 

390
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,950
 If you don't bring the 50 billion won you promised, 

391
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:24,950
 you'll all end up like this. 

392
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,210
There's a Yakuza organization that has been showing up

393
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:33,350
in various domestic rights businesses since 10 years ago.

394
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,730
Yakuza?

395
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,850
Almost nothing is known about this organization. What's unique about them is

396
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:41,510
that the members wear masks, unlike other yakuza organizations.

397
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:45,490
According to the prosecutor who has worked on a few of their cases,

398
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,020
no one has ever seen the members' faces.

399
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,260
Because no one has ever lived to tell?

400
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:56,920
W-Wait... Are you saying Ha Ri brought in someone that dangerous?

401
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,990
If nothing is known about them, how did you find out the name "Lee Dong Gil"?

402
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,000
Four years ago, that Yakuza organization and

403
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,620
the regional gangsters confronted each other over rights issues in redevelopment.

404
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,280
   

405
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:46,100
Yeah. I'm Lee Dong Gil.

406
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:51,200
You understand what happens if you

407
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,010
mess with what's mine, right?

408
00:31:54,910 --> 00:32:00,850
 One day, the regional gangster boss and his men were all murdered. 

409
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:05,770
You didn't just let someone that dangerous go, right?

410
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:09,020
We tried to get him, but the investigation wouldn't move forward for some reason.

411
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,780
One thing we found out

412
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:15,070
 is that Lee Dong Gil has a burnt scar on the back of his right hand. 

413
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:18,840
Ha Ri, why did you go this far? Why?

414
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,380
Because unless he went to this extent, they wouldn't fall for it.

415
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,600
What?

416
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,680
Mr. Myeong. He was suspicious right to the end.

417
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,510
He held on until the very end.

418
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,030
If we had hired actors instead of doing it ourselves,

419
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,990
we would've never seen Mr. Myeong's face.

420
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,220
 We let them take our pictures on purpose 

421
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,680
 but he had been watching us from way before. 

422
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:54,520
Ha Ri thought of Mr. Myeong as someone just like him.

423
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,370
That's why he came up with a plan that even he would fall for.

424
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,310
Where he's the only fake one,

425
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,710
and everything else is for real.

426
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,920
Gosh, but still.

427
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,350
How could he deceive us, too?

428
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,280
What?

429
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,610
There's someone at the restaurant entrance.

430
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,840
I can't reach Mr. Jang and Team Leader Seon.

431
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,000
   

432
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,080
   

433
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,150
Yes. Hello.

434
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:51,720
I heard you make a living selling real estate.

435
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:56,480
Then, you must've heard of Lee Dong Gil.

436
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,180
Come to the address I'll send you by 9 o'clock.

437
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,990
 Let's talk about business. 

438
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,950
Who was that?

439
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,870
He says he's Lee Dong Gil.

440
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,450
L-L-Lee Dong Gil?

441
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:22,210
T-Then, we should return the m-money, no?

442
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,960
Sir, I can't reach anyone right now.

443
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,610
The fraud victims were real, too.

444
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:31,200
Last night, too. He was there to arrest him, not to rescue him.

445
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,820
Let's go.

446
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,520
Mr. Lee Dong Gil?

447
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,400
Where's the money?

448
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,960
Mr. Kim's 20 billion won and my 30 billion won. It's all in the car.

449
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,630
What are you doing! Hey, hey!

450
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,230
What the hell! Who are you?

451
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,500
Who the hell are you?

452
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,990
What the hell?

453
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,680
What the!

454
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,550
I missed an important auction because of you.

455
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:06,260
Well, there has to be a way for you to make that up.

456
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,510
I'm sure there are many ways if I look for them.

457
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,260
Only if...

458
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,330
you keep the promise.

459
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:20,030
All right, then. Shall we talk business?

460
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,590
Yes. Sure, let's do so.

461
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:26,760
The lease fraud that shook up the world.

462
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,460
I heard it was you.

463
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,110
Compared to you, it's inadequate.

464
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,400
So, how is the profit?

465
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,670
Several tens of billion won.

466
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,320
I see.

467
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:46,780
- In any case—
 - I got it all on film. Your confession.

468
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,690
You'll never get out of this one, Mr. Myeong.

469
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,250
What the hell is this?

470
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,830
Hey. You scammed the same way I do.

471
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,160
Ten billion won in damages!

472
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,050
So, why are you doing this?

473
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,560
That's right.

474
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,730
Those people were scammed for real.

475
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,810
Twice at that.

476
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,210
- What?
 - But first of all, Mr. Myeong,

477
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,250
they were scammed by you.

478
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,300
Once scammed by you for real,

479
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,650
and once scammed by us but fake.

480
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,220
 What brings you here, Kim Su Chan? 

481
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,730
 I have something to tell you. 

482
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,680
 Kang Ha Ri came to see me. 

483
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,950
 Hey, Su Chan. 

484
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:10,570
 I'm here, Min Jeong. 

485
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:19,820
 Mother, take a break. I'll be with her. 

486
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:23,230
 - I'll go home and get changed, then. 
 - Okay. 

487
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,220
 Go home and get some rest. 

488
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,860
 You have to consider your health, too. 

489
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,890
 Kim Su Chan. 

490
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,450
 Who are you? 

491
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,980
 All of you are 

492
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:14,620
 the family, relatives, and friends of the victims of the lease fraud. 

493
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:20,730
 You're suffering through their pain alongside them. 

494
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,140
 But if you will help me, 

495
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,770
 I can end that pain. 

496
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:30,040
 How would you do that? 

497
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,960
 Become victims of lease fraud by me. 

498
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,870
 Right now. 

499
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,170
   

500
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:00,270
For the sake of their friends, family, and relatives,

501
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:05,150
they suffered a lease fraud by Ha Ri for real.

502
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,660
Mr. Myeong.

503
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:12,760
Why did you bring 30 billion won on your own?

504
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,570
No matter how much you dug into me, everything you saw were real happenings.

505
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,250
 Kim Su Chan...
   

506
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:25,590
 Come to the address I'll send you by 9 o'clock. 

507
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,680
That's why you had no choice but to believe.

508
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,720
Lee Dong Gil's existence...

509
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,280
 - Your 30 billion won... will be returned to the victims.  
- Hey.

510
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:48,510
Did you take care of Team Leader Seon and Mr. Jang?

511
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,240
No need to worry.  

512
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,750
The government will protect them.

513
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,100
 This time, it's a package. 

514
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:14,960
So, you want to just go or play for a bit?

515
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,350
Honey, you know... go for a vital point.

516
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,790
Duck, and hit the stomach. Do you have insurance?

517
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,800
- Fighting. 
 - Fighting.

518
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:40,380
Hey, wait up! I'm done playing.

519
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,200
Stop right there.

520
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:02,430
Hands up!

521
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:17,490
Myeong Joo, you're under arrest for lease fraud.

522
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:19,990
You have the right to remain—

523
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,950
Go right ahead.

524
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:24,480
Whatever you say won't be too helpful.

525
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,220
Take him.

526
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,810
Thank you so much.

527
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:52,250
Thank you.

528
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,080
Thank you.

529
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,550
   

530
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,470
   

531
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,690
Yes.

532
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:22,960
I heard your situation is pretty dire.

533
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,380
Yes.

534
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:30,700
You don't have to worry.

535
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:49,230
I can't seem to get rid of my cold.

536
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,560
I just got a call from Prosecutor Kwak.

537
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,900
Mr. Myeong died while being transferred to the prosecution.

538
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:15,500
Prosecutor Kwak must be in shock.

539
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,940
That's not all you're going to say, are you?

540
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,250
If I said he got what he deserved, does that make me a scumbag?

541
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:28,120
Isn't it more important to find out who punished him that way?

542
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:15,400
Min Jeong.

543
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,000
M-Min... Min Jeong...

544
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,920
Mother. Mother, M-M-Min Jeong...

545
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,300
I'll get the d-doctor!

546
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,620
- Min Jeong.
 - Doctor!

547
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:28,930
Min Jeong! Min Jeong! Min Jeong, it's mom. Are you awake?

548
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:31,230
 Words are like food. 

549
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:34,630
If you say it too quickly, it's like you get burned because it's too hot.

550
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:37,960
If it's too late, it becomes meaningless because it gets cold.

551
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,390
Is that also one of Kang Ha Ri's mottos? Something like that?

552
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:44,020
Number 19? 20?

553
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:47,340
Let me give you some advice.

554
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,980
Don't trust anyone.

555
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,710
Not me, nor Mr. Hwang, and...

556
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:58,660
not the President either.

557
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:00,720
   

558
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,740
   

559
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:05,640
   

560
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,380
   

561
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:15,000
I don't know if I should accept advice from a player who uses any means possible

562
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,870
for the sake of getting results.

563
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:24,860
But I'll keep in mind what you said about not trusting Kang Ha Ri.

564
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:10,670
Satan, get behind me.

565
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:13,820
You do not consider the matters of heaven

566
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,760
but are thinking of matters of people.

567
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,650
 Supreme Leader Im... 

568
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,620
 He's a total cult leader. 

569
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:26,970
 I was once a messenger candidate for the House of Truth. 

570
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:31,020
 After I found out the truth, I felt like someone hit me with a hammer. 

571
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:33,920
 Miracle? It's all a scam. 

572
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,770
 How could a blind man see and a paralyzed man stand up? 

573
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:41,240
 I will reveal everything going forward. 

574
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,110
 The truth behind the Almighty House of Truth. 

575
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:45,160
Our eternal heaven,

576
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:50,340
the one who insulted the name of the Almighty House of Truth is here.

577
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,200
That's right.

578
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:13,470
This man fell for Satan's temptation and lied in front of the entire nation!

579
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:17,480
He can no longer stand on his legs after a car accident.

580
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:22,880
This is exactly the judgment from heaven for someone who insulted the Truth.

581
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:30,350
This sinful man came to me again.

582
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:33,680
And he's pleading desperately

583
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,710
to forgive his sins.

584
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,720
I can hear the voice of heaven.

585
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,750
When one sinner repents,

586
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:46,410
it will be a great joy for the Lord's messengers.

587
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:50,080
It says, "Go ahead and forgive him in my place."

588
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:58,390
In place of the Lord of Heaven, I will take back this man's punishment right here.

589
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:12,470
My son was dead and was raised from the dead.

590
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:16,280
I lost him and got him back.

591
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:20,390
I will forgive your sins.

592
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:23,310
So, stand up right now!

593
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,330
I command you in my name!

594
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:31,480
Stand up on your two feet and start dancing!

595
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,840
Stand up.

596
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,800
Stand up!

597
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:44,110
Are you giving me all this money?

598
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:51,640
Of course.

599
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,540
You even danced in front of my congregation.

600
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,980
The payment should be made accurately.

601
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:01,910
I had no idea you cared for me this much, Supreme Leader.

602
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:05,020
- I'm so sorry.
 - Gosh, what are you saying?

603
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:08,890
I said everything in front of the congregation earlier.

604
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:11,590
I forgive everything that happened in the past.

605
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:15,450
From the day you came to me, Brother,

606
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:19,690
I had forgiven everything.

607
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:24,410
I will do everything you ask for. I'll put my life on the line, Supreme Leader.

608
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:27,390
Thank you. Thank you so much.

609
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:33,010
Wow. The reaction was incredible earlier, huh?

610
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:36,950
By chance, were you an actor?

611
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:39,820
You struggled to get up from the wheelchair

612
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:42,960
and started bawling as you were acting.

613
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,110
I was moved.

614
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:50,480
How about we make a pilgrimage to the provinces...

615
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:56,970
With you, I'll go to the ends of the Earth. I'll go anywhere, Supreme Leader.

616
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:02,420
Thank you.

617
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,820
I'll be in touch.

618
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,230
Thank you!

619
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:39,520
His name is Im Sang Sik.

620
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,900
He's the chairman of the Almighty House of Truth.

621
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,170
I've seen him a few times on the news.

622
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:46,320
He's a cult leader.

623
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,680
He has more than 200,000 followers nationwide.

624
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,350
He has over 20 years of history.

625
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:52,950
Two hundred thousand for 20 years...

626
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:57,110
Wait. If you ripped off 10,000 a week, how much is that?

627
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,280
Supreme Leader Im. 
   

628
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,160
 Intense charisma and eloquent speech. 

629
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,970
 Even mysterious ability to read one's heart. 

630
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:08,810
He opened up the Almighty House of Truth before he turned 30 and has come this far.

631
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:10,440
Look at his face.

632
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,320
People follow him even with those looks? What about his family?

633
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,000
He grew up without a father.

634
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,200
His mom was a pretty famous shaman.

635
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,470
He must be using what he learned from his mother.

636
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:23,680
Before he became a cult leader, he was quite a fighter.

637
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,320
But who are those guys with masks on?

638
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,080
They're members of the young adult group.

639
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,600
Inside the Almighty House of Truth, they're called "brothers."

640
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,570
You can consider them the closes aid to Supreme Leader Im.

641
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,090
 I looked up the articles. 

642
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:38,610
 Most of these guys are criminals that Supreme Leader Im converted. 

643
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:41,000
Their resumes look amazing.

644
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,010
Theft, assault, fraud, arson, etc.

645
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:50,940
Just consider them a group who would do anything for the Supreme Leader.

646
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:57,050
So, he'd entice people into going to heaven, and they're cult members who have nowhere to go but hell.

647
00:54:57,050 --> 00:55:02,210
I get that, but there are so many cults like that in South Korea.

648
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:06,090
What's so special about that cult that the President would give direct orders?

649
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,880
Because their connections are no joke.

650
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,360
Connections?

651
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:15,050
Supreme Leader Im has given away an enormous amount of money to the political and legal arena.

652
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:19,490
So, that became his strong shield?

653
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:22,190
Do you know how many times the prosecution conducted search and seizures?

654
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:24,080
But they found nothing.

655
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,140
As if they were prepared.

656
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:30,260
So, we can't mess with them legally?

657
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,410
I see why the President is fixated on them.

658
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:38,900
Byeong Min?

659
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:47,440
This is a website built by people who realized Supreme Leader Im was a cult and left the group.

660
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,720
Wait a minute.

661
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,750
Can't you gather testimonies from those people who built the site?

662
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:57,400
All the congregation members who testified about Supreme Leader Im went missing.

663
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,900
Wow, so brutal.

664
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:03,650
They aren't the only ones who went missing.

665
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:07,510
They're mostly people with bad credit or runaway teenagers.

666
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:10,450
Wait, even minors?

667
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,480
What a crazy asshole.

668
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,980
By chance, is he into organ trafficking and such?

669
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:21,370
Of course, we have no evidence, but it's more than possible.

670
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:25,030
Crazy. What the hell are the police doing?

671
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:31,250
Supreme Leader Im selects young women from his congregation and calls them heavenly brides.

672
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:33,830
There's intel that they become his sex slaves.

673
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:36,170
What a piece of trash.

674
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:40,040
Missing followers, the evidence the prosecution couldn't find,

675
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:45,530
the slush funds he took from his followers... I'm sure he's hiding them somewhere.

676
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:51,000
Searching for Supreme Leader Im's hidden treasures, huh?

677
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,680
Supreme Leader Im personally installs Almighty House of Truth messengers

678
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:00,540
from among those who were appointed by the Lord of Heaven through Supreme Leader Im.

679
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,970
But the truth is that they're loyal to Supreme Leader Im

680
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:06,470
and give lots of offerings.

681
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:10,390
Great.

682
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:14,030
Let's teach Supreme Leader Im, who sells out heaven and does all kinds of dirty deeds,

683
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,720
what real hell is.

684
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:25,460


685
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:27,680
Ha Ri, can you hear me?

686
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,240
Kim Han Jun, a graduate of Princeton Theological Seminary. 
   

687
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,490
Kim Han Jun.

688
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:37,920
- It's all—
 - It's all set, so you can just go with the plan.

689
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:40,310
Do it just like that.

690
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:45,720
Okay. Let's get started

691
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:53,590
   

692
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:01,930
Mr. Kim, let's not do this.

693
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,610
You really seem like a real Yakuza.

694
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:08,340
- Is that so?
 - That's right. 
 (Speaking Japanese) 

695
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:11,970
Then, I'll show you something more scary.

696
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:13,450
What?

697
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,420
What...

698
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:25,040
Blood... Blood...

699
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:35,010
Are you all ready?

700
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:40,940
Thanks to you all, it's been perfected.

701
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,700
Okay, let's begin, then.

702
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:54,250
Ready.

703
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:01,130
Action.

704
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:10,970
   

705
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:16,600
♫  Almost frantically. Going mad, shocked me again  ♫

706
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:22,410
♫  I stagger, I can kind of see it now. I tricked you, fell in again  ♫

707
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:27,600
♫  I can't help but be surprised  ♫

708
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,610
♫  You're gonna crash 'till the pain  ♫

709
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:34,340
♫  I have no choice but to swallow my regrets  ♫

710
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:38,310
♫  We're gonna fall in the end  ♫

711
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:41,040
 You're as decisive as I heard. 

712
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,250
 I'm your fan, Supreme Leader Im. 

713
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:46,590
 - I'll also become a loyal servant of the Supreme Leader. 
- We've got quite an interesting fellow. 

714
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:48,260
 She's Lee Seon Ja, and she's 80 years old. 

715
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:52,380
 She has more than 50 billion won in assets. She's pretty gullible. 

716
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:57,490
 When you receive a great gift, you must first suspect it. 

717
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,280
 That damn scum. 

718
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,000
 Ha Ri will be okay, right? 

719
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,350
♫  You shocked me, oh!  ♫

720
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:11,850
♫  Mess up above the ashes  ♫
