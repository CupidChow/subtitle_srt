00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:46,013
Ah Ryung. What's your ETA?

2
00:00:46,283 --> 00:00:47,442
We have one minute left.

3
00:00:47,443 --> 00:00:48,782
Byung Min. Are you still not done?

4
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:49,853
You got it.

5
00:00:50,914 --> 00:00:52,824
I did it, Jin Woong!

6
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:54,723
I obtained the item.

7
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:56,194
- Hey. - I'm serious.

8
00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:03,593
You're awake.

9
00:01:03,694 --> 00:01:06,234
You have no idea how much trouble you put me through.

10
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:07,834
Hey, you punk!

11
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:10,673
No!

12
00:01:18,414 --> 00:01:21,084
I shouldn't have been so mean to Ah Ryung.

13
00:01:27,184 --> 00:01:28,754
- Let me join too. - Join what?

14
00:01:28,953 --> 00:01:30,323
What you're preparing for right now.

15
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:31,624
That's not going to happen.

16
00:01:33,323 --> 00:01:35,223
I won't say I hope we get on well.

17
00:01:35,224 --> 00:01:37,693
Let's all fend for ourselves well.

18
00:01:37,694 --> 00:01:38,934
Driving skills must be hereditary.

19
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:43,474
The price of the NFT I bought last time went up.

20
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:46,372
He gathered many investors, saying he was starting a project,

21
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,844
and then he cancelled the project for a nonsensical reason.

22
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:50,914
A total of about 230 million dollars was stolen.

23
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:52,914
And that's the amount we'll steal from Kang Do Young.

24
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:54,413
The plan was quite simple.

25
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,754
And try my hand at a big NFT project like you.

26
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,153
Install a malicious code on his digital wallet.

27
00:01:59,823 --> 00:02:00,883
To hack his phone.

28
00:02:03,254 --> 00:02:05,623
You bastards!

29
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,293
He conned people to get this money.

30
00:02:10,293 --> 00:02:11,633
So we conned him to steal it back.

31
00:02:15,164 --> 00:02:16,174
It's me.

32
00:02:16,474 --> 00:02:17,474
Hello, sir.

33
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:19,243
I will get the money back right away.

34
00:02:21,543 --> 00:02:22,573
It's done, sir.

35
00:02:26,883 --> 00:02:29,853
Ha Ri. Is it really okay for us to work with that woman?

36
00:02:30,254 --> 00:02:31,284
Just for one year.

37
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,424
If you work with me for just a year...

38
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,522
Our criminal records and wanted records are all gone.

39
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,394
I'll erase your records permanently.

40
00:02:39,864 --> 00:02:40,864
Insane!

41
00:02:41,064 --> 00:02:42,263
What a delicious feeling.

42
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:45,362
What's the job?

43
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:47,434
The first thing we must do here.

44
00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:48,863
Get out, Mi Yu.

45
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:51,973
According to my sources, Club Libido is the main stage...

46
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:55,474
for a distribution ring of various hallucinogens and drugs.

47
00:02:55,603 --> 00:02:59,183
At the center is the club manager and director of KU Entertainment.

48
00:02:59,184 --> 00:03:00,184
Lee Jin Soo.

49
00:03:00,383 --> 00:03:01,843
So what? What's the plan?

50
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:02,852
Hey.

51
00:03:02,853 --> 00:03:05,553
You don't buy directly from a dealer, right?

52
00:03:05,814 --> 00:03:07,383
I'll talk!

53
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,524
So the actual big fish...

54
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:12,594
doesn't get away. We will get to them.

55
00:03:12,763 --> 00:03:14,124
Jin Soo should...

56
00:03:14,724 --> 00:03:15,863
go in.

57
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,863
Is the prosecutor trustworthy?

58
00:03:19,404 --> 00:03:22,063
I'm not sure if he's trustworthy or not.

59
00:03:22,064 --> 00:03:23,504
But he gets his job done for sure.

really hate...

Goodness. You're so fast.

71
00:05:01,563 --> 00:05:03,634
I was wondering who this arrogant Santa was.

72
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,034
I guess I found him.

73
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:08,302
Who knew there was a grown man that still believed in Santa?

74
00:05:08,303 --> 00:05:09,743
Thanks to you, I had some fun.

75
00:05:10,173 --> 00:05:12,983
Kang Ha Ri. Why did you come back to Korea?

76
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:16,312
Is my coming back to my homeland a problem for you?

77
00:05:16,313 --> 00:05:17,883
Yes, when you're the one coming back.

78
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,682
Gosh. I don't think you came here to see me today.

79
00:05:20,683 --> 00:05:22,954
Right. I didn't think I would see you here today.

80
00:05:24,594 --> 00:05:26,393
I'm thrilled because it feels as if...

81
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:28,764
I skipped the middle guy and went straight to the final boss.

82
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:31,594
Am I the middle guy you're referring to?

83
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:40,173
How have you been, sir?

84
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:41,603
It's been a while, my dear junior.

85
00:05:42,144 --> 00:05:43,672
We're both prosecutors.

86
00:05:43,673 --> 00:05:44,872
Don't you think calling your fellow prosecutor...

87
00:05:44,873 --> 00:05:46,043
the middle guy is a bit too harsh?

88
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:50,553
Why didn't you leave? What are you still doing here?

89
00:05:51,714 --> 00:05:52,723
I was about to leave.

90
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:54,584
But I came across a naive man who seemed lost.

91
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:58,394
Well, it seems he found his way now. So I'll get going.

92

It's fine. He's my guest.

93
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:04,563
I can vouch for him.

Why don't you and I talk today?

00:06:15,404 --> 00:06:16,843
What on earth is it?

98
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,312
Why did Kang Ha Ri come back here to see you?

00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:20,313
Gosh.

100
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:22,482
The defendants who have to deal with you...

101
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:23,953
might feel suffocated.

102
00:06:23,954 --> 00:06:25,453
You won't let me take a breather.

103
00:06:25,454 --> 00:06:28,284
Luckily, no one passed out from breathing difficulty yet.

104
00:06:28,384 --> 00:06:29,422
Should I congratulate you for...

105
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:31,023
having a clean record with the defendants?

106
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:32,394
I appreciate your gesture,

107
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:34,563
but I'd like to get some answers.

108
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:40,034
So what is it?

109
00:06:40,664 --> 00:06:43,103
Will this put you in a tight spot once again?

110
00:06:48,704 --> 00:06:50,914
Once you get the full story, it will be you...

111
00:06:52,373 --> 00:06:53,983
in a tight spot this time, not me.

112
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:17,904
He told me to give this to you.

113
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:20,003
He said he would be in touch soon.

114
00:07:25,074 --> 00:07:27,284
Kang Ha Ri gave this to me? Why?

115
00:07:28,183 --> 00:07:31,053
I have no idea how you ended up on his radar.

116
00:07:32,353 --> 00:07:33,983
There's only one thing I learned today.

117
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:38,123
That he wanted to show you, Prosecutor Kwak Do Soo,

118
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:40,764
the end of the road.

119

120

00:07:46,964 --> 00:07:48,363
if you work with him.

122
00:07:53,003 --> 00:07:54,704
Contrary to my looks, I'm quite the worrywart.

123
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,014
I have no intention of working with those lawbreakers.

124
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,884
Prosecutor Kwak Do Soo. Did you know?

125
00:08:07,024 --> 00:08:09,084
There are people who must be feared more than the lawbreakers.

126
00:08:09,384 --> 00:08:10,922
It's the people who still walk among us freely...

127
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,454
when they've violated the law.

128
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,562
As long as there are people like them,

129
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:17,764
the law won't be able to protect everyone.

130
00:08:19,363 --> 00:08:21,433
You should make your own decision too.

131
00:08:21,964 --> 00:08:24,474
Whether or not you answer the phone, it's up to you.

00:10:47,343 --> 00:10:48,984
Well, I know that.

169
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,952
But I have to watch Mistaping and...

170
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:53,722
Byung Min. You can't play games as of tonight.

171
00:10:53,723 --> 00:10:55,083
Focus on our operation.

172
00:10:55,984 --> 00:10:57,024
Gosh.

173
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:00,394
We have no choice.

174
00:11:00,624 --> 00:11:02,163
As it's about the entertainment industry,

175
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:03,293
I must step up. Right?

176
00:11:03,894 --> 00:11:06,764
I got several business cards back in my day in Apgujeong-dong.

177
00:11:06,864 --> 00:11:09,303
What? You?

178
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:11,432
Yes. I had to leave the agency in my first week...

179
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:12,802
because of a romance scandal.

180
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:15,303
But I was one of the first trainees XM Entertainment recruited.

181
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:18,144
Why would they...

182
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:20,683
I'm still not sure why either.

183
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:25,113
Right. Why don't you go, Jin Woong?

184
00:11:25,114 --> 00:11:26,114
Should I?

185
00:11:27,423 --> 00:11:28,583
I knew I was the right fit.

186
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:31,292

187
00:11:31,293 --> 00:11:32,754
Love bomb is what?

188
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,322
Why do you keep dancing?

189
00:11:34,323 --> 00:11:36,533
You're not going there as an idol trainee.

190
00:11:36,534 --> 00:11:37,534
Come on.

191
00:11:37,535 --> 00:11:38,864
It's a love bomb

192
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:43,803
I'll do it.

00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:48,644
Byung Min. Can you write a resume for her?

195
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:49,774
I'm good at that.

if you made a new account with a different name?

226

You had time to come up with an idea like this.

Cha Je Yi is totally spy material.

240
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,123
CEO Kim seems to be selling his company shares...

241
00:15:20,124 --> 00:15:21,984
to acquire cash.

242
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,592
From comparing internal documents and public statements,

243
00:15:24,593 --> 00:15:25,953
he doesn't seem to be properly disclosing it either.

244
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:29,293
He doesn't even care what happens to the regular shareholders.

245
00:15:30,034 --> 00:15:31,994
These cases always make me curious.

246
00:15:32,693 --> 00:15:34,633
Do con artists become CEOs?

247
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,374
Or do people turn into con artists when they become CEOs?

248
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,303
If so, you are fit to be a CEO.

249
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,614
Of course, I am. That's why I'm the boss here.

Oh, Eddy Jung? It's a successful broker in Yeouido.

302
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:17,134
Does he deal with funds, stocks, and such?

that he distributes drugs.

When CEO Kim is looking for someone...

Do you think CEO Kim will do as we are hoping?

333
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:49,054
We'll have to make him do so.

334
00:19:49,324 --> 00:19:50,394
How?

335
00:19:51,294 --> 00:19:53,294
I'm going to pump him full of gas.

336
00:19:53,423 --> 00:19:54,463
Gas?

337
00:20:00,703 --> 00:20:01,763
- Oh, goodness. - Gosh.

338
00:20:02,304 --> 00:20:03,304
Gosh.

339
00:20:03,305 --> 00:20:05,403
- He really farted. - Hey...

340
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,144
(CEO Kim Yun Gi, wholesaler)

341
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:13,717
Hi.

342
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:17,956
- Hi, Eddy. - Hey.

343
00:20:17,957 --> 00:20:19,356
- Eddy. - Hey, Steve.

344
00:20:19,926 --> 00:20:21,386
I heard you got another big deal recently.

345
00:20:22,586 --> 00:20:24,655
How did you manage to do that?

346
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,257
Please tell us your secret.

347
00:20:26,356 --> 00:20:28,125
It's nothing at all.

348
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,536
I'll treat you to a meal, so please make some time for me.

349
00:20:30,537 --> 00:20:31,836
I'll always treat you.

350
00:20:32,836 --> 00:20:34,537
- Can I go now? - Of course.

351
00:20:35,136 --> 00:20:36,807
- I have a meeting right now. - Okay.

352
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:43,207
I heard you asked for me. What did you want to talk about?

353
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:45,416
I'll get straight to the point.

354
00:20:45,717 --> 00:20:47,947
What do you think about working with me?

355
00:20:51,757 --> 00:20:53,086
I'm not sure what you mean...

356
00:20:53,326 --> 00:20:54,626
I know everything.

357
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:57,896
I heard you did some fun business.

358
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:03,066
You must be misunderstanding.

359
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:06,566
I'm just a salesman working for a regular company.

360
00:21:09,606 --> 00:21:10,906
You know who I am, right?

361
00:21:12,307 --> 00:21:14,707
Of course. You're CEO Kim Yun Gi of KU Entertainment.

362
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:16,777
I spoke of you several times on TV.

363
00:21:17,146 --> 00:21:18,575
"He's the leader of the K-pop market..."

364
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:20,386
"and the future of Korea's entertainment industry."

365
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:22,916
Exactly.

366
00:21:23,687 --> 00:21:27,727
Let's design that future together.

367
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,797
If my business lacked vision,

368
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:35,767
I wouldn't have asked to meet.

369
00:21:42,507 --> 00:21:44,307
Would you like to go somewhere else to talk?

370
00:21:45,836 --> 00:21:46,876
Nice.

371
00:21:51,646 --> 00:21:52,646
What are you doing?

372
00:21:54,086 --> 00:21:55,187
Are you out of your mind?

373
00:21:56,856 --> 00:21:57,856
What...

374
00:21:57,857 --> 00:22:00,027
Don't you know security is the key to this business?

375
00:22:00,626 --> 00:22:02,625
Are you trying to tell the world what you're up to?

376
00:22:02,626 --> 00:22:04,396
How can you be so careless?

377
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:06,967
Please stop...

378
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:13,836
You don't even know the basics of running this kind of business.

379
00:22:14,437 --> 00:22:16,776
How can you talk so openly in this day and age?

380
00:22:16,777 --> 00:22:19,007
- Gosh. - Please...

381
00:22:21,247 --> 00:22:22,247
Look.

382
00:22:22,248 --> 00:22:24,216
If you've lost your touch, just get lost.

383
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,977
Stop messing things up for the rest of us.

384
00:22:26,576 --> 00:22:29,487
I have no plans to work with a washed-up guy like you.

385
00:22:30,356 --> 00:22:31,356
Darn it.

386
00:22:33,257 --> 00:22:35,126
No wonder your place of business was raided.

387
00:22:36,926 --> 00:22:37,997
I'm sorry.

388
00:22:38,697 --> 00:22:40,096
I didn't think things through.

389
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:44,166
I'll be careful from now on.

390
00:22:45,136 --> 00:22:46,136
Please?

391
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:50,376
I'll be...

392
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:54,146
careful from now on.

393
00:22:56,777 --> 00:22:57,777
Okay?

394
00:23:01,586 --> 00:23:02,846
You're quick to apologize,

395
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:04,856
aren't you?

396
00:23:07,457 --> 00:23:08,487
Okay, then.

397
00:23:09,926 --> 00:23:11,697
Let's hear what you have to say.

398
00:23:18,537 --> 00:23:21,737
Do you know what the first thing I do is once I pick a mark?

399
00:23:23,307 --> 00:23:24,736
I figure out...

400
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,977
what part of his brain works first when he deals with someone.

401
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:28,646
That's the first step.

402
00:23:29,447 --> 00:23:30,576
What do you mean?

403
00:23:30,646 --> 00:23:33,146
The first button in their brain that gets pressed...

404
00:23:33,277 --> 00:23:35,646
is usually that person's strongest weapon,

405
00:23:36,187 --> 00:23:37,787
but it's also their greatest weakness.

406
00:23:37,957 --> 00:23:39,116
Here's an example.

407
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,526
People like Kang Do Young...

408
00:23:41,527 --> 00:23:44,057
suspect everyone they come across.

409
00:23:44,396 --> 00:23:45,895
That suspicion...

410
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:48,126
is what made him get so far,

411
00:23:48,697 --> 00:23:50,467
but you know what happened in the end.

412
00:23:50,636 --> 00:23:52,366
What about Kim Yun Gi, then?

413
00:23:53,336 --> 00:23:54,807
Kim Yun Gi...

414
00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:58,136
uses his psychological superiority to dominate others.

415
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,345
When he thinks or senses someone's beneath him,

416
00:24:00,346 --> 00:24:01,706
he turns extra nasty.

417
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,846
Hey, that's gas-lighting.

418
00:24:04,646 --> 00:24:07,846
It is. That's how Kim Yun Gi functions.

419
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,356
But this time, that's what will take him down.

420
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:13,017
Thank you.

421
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:15,987
It's not final yet. Don't get too excited.

422
00:24:17,126 --> 00:24:19,197
We should celebrate this momentous day.

423
00:24:19,557 --> 00:24:20,826
Let me treat you.

424
00:24:21,797 --> 00:24:23,426
What type do you like?

425
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,196
No, forget about that.

426
00:24:26,197 --> 00:24:28,135
I'll get my best girls to...

427
00:24:28,136 --> 00:24:30,977
Mr. Kim!

428
00:24:32,136 --> 00:24:34,376
This is why I say you're old-fashioned.

429
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,106
Why would I do such degrading stuff?

430
00:24:36,376 --> 00:24:38,346
What does that have to do with our business?

431
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:40,517
My goodness...

432
00:24:41,217 --> 00:24:44,616
You need to keep things nice and clean, okay?

433
00:24:45,156 --> 00:24:46,257
I apologize.

434
00:24:47,156 --> 00:24:49,057
I guess I messed up again.

435
00:24:49,757 --> 00:24:51,797
I'll let it go just this once.

436
00:24:56,227 --> 00:24:59,697
Oh. Let's meet at my place next time.

437
00:25:00,136 --> 00:25:02,335
You should see me at work too.

438
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:03,336
Well...

439
00:25:04,277 --> 00:25:07,747
I heard until my ears bled that you were good at what you do.

440
00:25:08,047 --> 00:25:09,476
Don't be like that.

441
00:25:09,477 --> 00:25:11,017
We only just met.

442
00:25:11,146 --> 00:25:12,646
Let's not be so naive.

443
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:14,717
Let's be thorough, okay?

444
00:25:15,586 --> 00:25:17,057
Okay, got it.

445
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,557
Okay.

446
00:25:19,187 --> 00:25:20,557
I'll send you the address.

447
00:25:29,396 --> 00:25:31,865
We moved on to the next stage with Mr. Kim.

448
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:33,707
You should start cleaning up on your end.

449
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,666
That's just what I'm doing right now.

450
00:25:37,437 --> 00:25:38,606
By the way, Je Yi.

451
00:25:39,477 --> 00:25:41,076
Before you leave the place,

452
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,146
could you get me N-Try's autograph?

453
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,345
I just became a fan.

454
00:25:46,346 --> 00:25:47,787
This guy Hwi Woong.

455
00:25:48,217 --> 00:25:50,116
Doesn't he look like me?

456
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,456
I think he's my doppelganger.

457
00:25:52,457 --> 00:25:54,686
He looks exactly like me when I was that...

458
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:55,757
Ms. Gu Ji Yeon.

459
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:03,396
Yes, Mr. Joo?

460
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,566
Shouldn't you go home?

461
00:26:08,207 --> 00:26:09,207
Yes.

462
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:11,376
I was just about to leave.

463
00:26:12,176 --> 00:26:13,406
See you tomorrow.

464
00:26:14,277 --> 00:26:15,307
Wait.

465
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:34,626
I'm off to pick up the trainees.

466
00:26:34,997 --> 00:26:36,896
Would you like to come if you're free?

467
00:26:42,566 --> 00:26:44,336
Why would you pick up...

468
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,307
the trainees this late at night?

469
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:49,277
They must entertain tonight.

470
00:26:50,346 --> 00:26:52,047
- What? - You know...

471
00:26:52,316 --> 00:26:53,517
what our agency's like.

472
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:55,616
But still.

473
00:26:57,086 --> 00:26:58,717
People are bound to notice.

474
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:01,027
And word travels fast.

475
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:02,187
I know.

476
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,527
Could you tell the CEO that?

477
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,896
I don't see why not.

478
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:15,866
If things go on like this,

479
00:27:16,537 --> 00:27:18,537
all the artists here must know.

480
00:27:19,707 --> 00:27:23,047
Wouldn't people like N-Try complain about it if they knew?

481
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,517
They have to keep quiet.

482
00:27:27,116 --> 00:27:29,987
They were the first victims.

483
00:27:32,086 --> 00:27:33,856
The reason Mr. Kim pimps them out.

484
00:27:34,356 --> 00:27:36,057
It's to make money off them,

485
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,797
but it's to control them too.

486
00:27:38,727 --> 00:27:40,666
When they're most powerless and clueless...

487
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,066
they get sent out and then they're taped.

488
00:27:44,737 --> 00:27:45,997
There are videos?

489
00:27:46,136 --> 00:27:47,906
Yes. If it weren't for that,

490
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,665
they wouldn't stay for all seven years...

491
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:50,977
and renew their contract after that.

492
00:27:55,947 --> 00:27:56,947
Mr. Joo.

493
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:01,047
Do you know where they're kept?

494
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:07,727
I don't know if there are copies,

495
00:28:08,057 --> 00:28:10,227
but the originals will be in the CEO's safe.

496
00:28:10,997 --> 00:28:11,997
Oh, gosh.

497
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:16,727
Any autographs?

498
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:23,007
I knew it. I didn't expect anything from you.

499
00:28:23,267 --> 00:28:24,277
Did you quit?

500
00:28:25,207 --> 00:28:26,336
Not yet.

501
00:28:26,777 --> 00:28:27,846
Why not?

502
00:28:28,047 --> 00:28:30,146
Do you think the job suits you?

503
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:31,777
Will you switch over for good?

504
00:28:37,047 --> 00:28:38,187
Simp.

505
00:28:39,356 --> 00:28:40,356
Hey.

506
00:28:41,426 --> 00:28:44,155
Why do you call me that...

507
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:46,626
and not anyone else?

508
00:28:47,797 --> 00:28:49,166
I need help.

509
00:28:53,497 --> 00:28:55,336
"Will you help me, please?" Say it.

510
00:28:57,606 --> 00:28:58,606
Please.

511
00:28:58,607 --> 00:29:01,676
That means "I need help, please."

512
00:29:03,307 --> 00:29:04,547
Will you help?

513
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:08,747
- Please. - Again.

514
00:29:10,386 --> 00:29:11,557
Help.

515
00:29:16,527 --> 00:29:18,326
I need to think about it.

516
00:29:18,396 --> 00:29:19,396
Hey.

517
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:21,126
Simp.

518
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:24,336
Hey!

519
00:29:35,906 --> 00:29:37,346
Mr. Kim. Here's the address.

520
00:29:38,217 --> 00:29:40,846
Gyucheon-ro 4-gil 33, Sangmi-gu, Seoun.

521
00:29:41,517 --> 00:29:43,386
Basement level three. Take the stairs.

522
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:04,477
Enter.

523
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:18,656
Do this.

524
00:30:30,227 --> 00:30:31,237
Let's go.

525
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:36,065
As you can see,

526
00:30:36,066 --> 00:30:38,977
over 90 percent of our distribution is automated.

527
00:30:39,376 --> 00:30:41,547
A Deep Learning AI is more than capable...

528
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,845
of handling all the customer queries...

529
00:30:43,846 --> 00:30:45,146
about our process.

530
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:46,977
An AI?

531
00:30:47,176 --> 00:30:48,616
Yes, an AI.

532
00:30:49,187 --> 00:30:50,616
Artificial Intelligence.

533
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,987
All records created in this process...

534
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,856
are encoded and then destroyed.

535
00:30:57,626 --> 00:31:01,027
That's why our customers are greatly satisfied.

536
00:31:01,866 --> 00:31:04,236
You could say that almost all...

537
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,636
the VVIP customers...

538
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:09,166
who want their identities kept secret use our platform.

539
00:31:10,237 --> 00:31:11,237
This way.

540
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:21,646
Hello.

541
00:31:22,586 --> 00:31:23,987
- I'll go now. - Okay.

542
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:25,687
Hey, wait.

543
00:31:28,326 --> 00:31:29,487
Some pocket money.

544
00:31:30,457 --> 00:31:31,457
Thank you.

545
00:31:35,096 --> 00:31:36,126
Take a seat.

546
00:31:43,336 --> 00:31:44,537
All this is...

547
00:31:45,406 --> 00:31:46,576
This week's sales.

548
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,007
This week's?

549
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,376
Yes. We did poorly this week.

550
00:31:54,687 --> 00:31:55,987
This is poorly?

551
00:31:57,116 --> 00:32:00,656
I think we should take a bigger commission.

552
00:32:03,856 --> 00:32:05,426
I was just kidding.

553
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:14,507
The more I get to know you, the more I think you're clueless.

554
00:32:15,336 --> 00:32:17,536
Be careful you don't get conned.

555
00:32:17,537 --> 00:32:19,007
Work only with people you trust.

556
00:32:20,477 --> 00:32:22,707
That's why I'm here with you, Mr. Jung.

557
00:32:23,406 --> 00:32:25,845
You're being too trustworthy again.

558
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:27,017
I told you not to be.

559
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,916
Goodness...

560
00:32:33,856 --> 00:32:34,886
So,

561
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,697
how much can you bring in this time?

562
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,166
Are we...

563
00:32:43,866 --> 00:32:45,467
in this together?

564
00:32:47,136 --> 00:32:48,136
Yes.

565
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:52,007
I want naive people like you to do well.

566
00:32:52,977 --> 00:32:53,977
I do.

567
00:32:54,346 --> 00:32:56,707
How much money can Kim Yun Gi put together at most?

568
00:32:57,277 --> 00:32:58,477
Well...

569
00:32:59,447 --> 00:33:01,247
If I add up the cash in hand...

570
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,457
and merchandise he can sell immediately...

571
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:07,217
About 70 million?

572
00:33:07,557 --> 00:33:08,626
Seventy million dollars...

573
00:33:12,197 --> 00:33:13,297
That much?

574
00:33:15,926 --> 00:33:18,136
Why? Don't you want to make money?

575
00:33:19,336 --> 00:33:20,336
Or...

576
00:33:22,237 --> 00:33:23,737
can't you get that much money ready?

577
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:29,707
No, that's not it.

578
00:33:31,247 --> 00:33:32,247
I should get it ready.

579
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:34,116
It is possible.

580
00:33:35,316 --> 00:33:36,616
I'll get the money ready.

581
00:33:37,856 --> 00:33:40,156
Yes, let's do that, then.

582
00:33:42,826 --> 00:33:44,256
About the products...

583
00:33:44,926 --> 00:33:47,096
I'm hoping to check it myself.

584
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:54,966
There's a reason why your business is going well.

585
00:33:56,636 --> 00:33:57,676
Mr. Kim.

586
00:33:57,776 --> 00:34:00,037
Distributing isn't just about getting products and selling them.

587
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,876
Are the products I'll be selling of good quality?

588
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:04,946
Will my customers be satisfied?

589
00:34:05,247 --> 00:34:06,846
I must take care of everything from A to Z.

590
00:34:07,747 --> 00:34:09,446
Those are the basics of our business, don't you think?

591
00:34:12,557 --> 00:34:15,326
On the day I get the products, you should join me.

592
00:34:16,727 --> 00:34:17,755
Let's do that, then.

593
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:19,796
If you know the date and location, please give me a heads-up.

594
00:34:19,997 --> 00:34:21,326
We have our schedule to consider too.

595
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:22,866
Yes, I'll do that.

596
00:34:23,627 --> 00:34:25,997
Goodbye, then. I won't see you out.

597
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:32,477
Bye.

598
00:34:37,616 --> 00:34:39,946
Hey, that guy is more of a pushover than I thought.

599
00:34:40,276 --> 00:34:42,346
Usually, guys who act weak before someone stronger...

600
00:34:42,546 --> 00:34:44,256
don't have a strong mindset.

601
00:34:46,886 --> 00:34:48,586
Man, I was so nervous earlier.

602
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,156
I don't know a thing about A or I, let alone AI.

603
00:34:52,526 --> 00:34:53,557
You're right.

604
00:34:53,957 --> 00:34:56,627
Where did Byung Min go? Why are you here, Mr. Hwang?

605
00:34:57,796 --> 00:34:59,596
That guy seemed to be out of his senses since yesterday.

606
00:34:59,796 --> 00:35:02,366
He was going on about Je Yi making him do something.

607
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,406
He was grumbling standing up, sitting down, and while pooping too.

608
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:07,576
I thought my ears were going to bleed.

609
00:35:07,946 --> 00:35:09,807
All we have to do is do well on our plan.

610
00:35:10,477 --> 00:35:12,616
Why did you bring something else to do?

611
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:14,787
You're going overboard.

612
00:35:15,486 --> 00:35:17,386
You wore what I told you to, right?

613
00:35:18,287 --> 00:35:19,287
Okay, good.

614
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,957
First, I deleted...

615
00:35:25,696 --> 00:35:28,497
all of the backed-up videos on CEO Kim's cloud yesterday.

616
00:35:28,796 --> 00:35:31,337
And now, we just have to get rid of the originals in the safe, right?

617
00:35:31,736 --> 00:35:32,736
Yes.

618
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:37,576
Yesterday, I took a quick look at the videos.

619
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:40,337
Why did you watch those?

620
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:43,747
No, I didn't mean to watch them.

621
00:35:44,046 --> 00:35:47,747
In order to delete them... Anyway, I watched them.

622
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:49,817
But they didn't do anything wrong.

623
00:35:49,946 --> 00:35:52,156
All they did was get dragged there and work their butts off.

624
00:35:53,256 --> 00:35:56,886
Even if that were true, people don't care about the truth.

625
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,556
What they want is just gossip.

626
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:02,397
Gosh, CEO Kim is threatening them with those videos,

627
00:36:03,096 --> 00:36:05,096
and people are so happy to chew them out. They're all so...

628
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:07,267
Here.

629
00:36:08,636 --> 00:36:10,766
Can't you hand it to me in a nicer way?

630
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:13,006
If you get caught, do as I told you to.

631
00:36:14,807 --> 00:36:16,046
I will never get caught.

632
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:17,716
"Never get caught."

633
00:36:21,817 --> 00:36:22,817
Hey, wait!

634
00:36:24,287 --> 00:36:25,287
"Hey?"

635
00:36:25,486 --> 00:36:27,457
Are you sure you can really break into that safe?

636
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,156
Break into what? I'm not breaking into the safe.

637
00:36:31,526 --> 00:36:33,656
What? You won't break into it?

638
00:36:47,807 --> 00:36:48,846
(Gu Ji Yeon)

639
00:36:51,946 --> 00:36:54,386
Would there really be a reason to break into it?

640
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:56,486
I could just make it break down...

641
00:36:57,087 --> 00:36:58,087
so that the inside just goes...

642
00:36:58,687 --> 00:36:59,715
Boom.

643
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:03,485
You're not trying to blow everything up with a bomb or anything, are you?

644
00:37:03,486 --> 00:37:04,596
A bomb...

645
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,025
Well, it is something similar.

646
00:37:07,026 --> 00:37:08,997
- You must be crazy! - Oh, gosh.

647
00:37:09,796 --> 00:37:10,826
Why...

648
00:37:11,497 --> 00:37:13,167
I didn't say it was a bomb.

649
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:15,267
It's just something similar.

650
00:37:16,337 --> 00:37:20,176
Have you heard of anything like electromagnetic pulse, or EMP?

651
00:37:20,337 --> 00:37:21,346
Here's what that is.

652
00:37:22,647 --> 00:37:23,676
Ta-da.

653
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,946
- Is it dangerous? - It's dangerous for the machinery.

654
00:37:27,216 --> 00:37:28,886
This destroys everything on the inside.

655
00:37:29,386 --> 00:37:31,886
Flash memory drives like USBs or SSDs?

656
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:33,986
If they just meet eyes with this guy? They just...

657
00:37:35,627 --> 00:37:37,696
If I were to explain it in an easier way,

658
00:37:38,196 --> 00:37:40,525
this is like a chemical, biological, and radiological weapon for people.

659
00:37:40,526 --> 00:37:41,865
- Forget it. - You know, CBRs are like...

660
00:37:41,866 --> 00:37:44,266
Just do what you have to, but don't cause too big of a scene.

661
00:37:44,267 --> 00:37:45,267
Okay?

662
00:37:52,977 --> 00:37:54,977
(High Floors)

663
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:57,877
It's been a while.

664
00:37:58,647 --> 00:37:59,647
Pardon?

665
00:38:00,817 --> 00:38:01,917
Oh, right.

666
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:05,687
We met in Jangam-dong once.

667
00:38:07,857 --> 00:38:08,957
Oh, right!

668
00:38:09,886 --> 00:38:11,026
Yes.

669
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:14,567
You gained so much weight. I barely recognized you.

670
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,326
Pardon?

671
00:38:25,276 --> 00:38:27,747
- I'll be going now. - Right.

672
00:38:30,046 --> 00:38:31,276
See you again next time.

673
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,546
Be careful when you get to the floor where the CEO's office is.

674
00:38:37,986 --> 00:38:39,386
That stuff won't work up there.

675
00:38:40,357 --> 00:38:41,627
I know that too.

676
00:38:49,296 --> 00:38:50,595
How did it go?

677
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:52,037
It went all right.

678
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:53,667
Why couldn't they take their time?

679
00:38:59,607 --> 00:39:00,906
Entry authorized.

680
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:08,287
It's next to CEO Kim's desk, inside the drawer.

681
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:22,426
Why won't this work?

682
00:39:26,037 --> 00:39:28,236
Someone is headed that way. Hurry up.

683
00:39:42,287 --> 00:39:44,216
- So, you see here... What? - What is this?

684
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:47,857
Why isn't it working?

685
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:49,756
My phone won't work.

686
00:39:51,897 --> 00:39:52,897
Hello?

687
00:39:52,898 --> 00:39:56,127
Darn it. I thought I had adjusted it.

688
00:39:57,466 --> 00:39:58,566
Hey, Je Yi.

689
00:39:58,567 --> 00:39:59,567
Hey, Cha Je Yi.

690
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:02,505
This thing died too.

691
00:40:02,506 --> 00:40:03,506
Darn it.

692
00:40:09,176 --> 00:40:10,207
What's this?

693
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:40,176
- Who are you? - Me?

694
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,246
Have a seat, and I'll tell you.

695
00:40:44,247 --> 00:40:45,247
I'm...

696
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:47,986
Hey.

697
00:40:50,216 --> 00:40:51,517
Hey, stop right there!

698
00:40:51,857 --> 00:40:52,857
Hey!

699
00:40:53,386 --> 00:40:54,627
Out of the way!

700
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:56,587
In front of the CEO's office, a suspicious...

701
00:40:56,986 --> 00:40:58,057
Darn it!

702
00:41:06,437 --> 00:41:07,437
Gosh.

703
00:41:17,046 --> 00:41:18,046
Get him!

704
00:41:22,616 --> 00:41:23,616
Darn it.

705
00:41:25,386 --> 00:41:27,787
Come here. You've been caught.

706
00:41:28,526 --> 00:41:29,587
It's not like that.

707
00:41:30,486 --> 00:41:32,796
- I'll explain everything. - Come here.

708
00:41:33,397 --> 00:41:34,497
So, what happened is...

709
00:41:36,397 --> 00:41:37,397
Darn it!

710
00:41:40,537 --> 00:41:41,567
Darn it!

711
00:41:43,466 --> 00:41:45,377
Gosh, this guy is a stalker fan of N-Try!

712
00:41:46,276 --> 00:41:48,476
This guy stole my badge and snuck in.

713
00:41:48,477 --> 00:41:49,477
Darn it!

714
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:51,477
We'll take care of things now.

715
00:41:51,716 --> 00:41:53,776
No! I'll take care of him.

716
00:41:53,977 --> 00:41:55,147
Get up, you punk.

717
00:41:56,587 --> 00:41:57,616
Gosh.

718
00:41:58,386 --> 00:41:59,417
Be quiet.

719
00:42:00,216 --> 00:42:02,457
- Shut it! - But you're hurting me!

720
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:06,796
Don't you dare come back here again!

721
00:42:06,997 --> 00:42:08,397
I won't let you get away with it!

722
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:10,227
That little...

723
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:22,946
Gosh, my...

724
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:26,377
Darn it.

725
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:35,957
Can you hear me?

726
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:40,426
Excuse me, Mr. Lim Byung Min?

727
00:42:43,067 --> 00:42:44,096
Hey.

728
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:45,937
You.

729
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,767
Don't even talk to me.

730
00:42:50,107 --> 00:42:51,807
I wanted to tell you that you worked so hard.

731
00:42:52,337 --> 00:42:53,437
See you later.

732
00:43:07,917 --> 00:43:10,156
You're Cha Hye Ryung, aren't you?

733
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:19,136
It's been a while.

734
00:43:21,096 --> 00:43:22,107
Hey.

735
00:43:23,707 --> 00:43:24,736
Here.

736
00:43:28,676 --> 00:43:30,076
- Earlier... - I'm sorry.

737
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,817
I should have stopped them sooner.

738
00:43:33,546 --> 00:43:34,576
No.

739
00:43:36,287 --> 00:43:37,386
I wanted to thank you.

740
00:43:37,616 --> 00:43:38,917
Why are you thanking me?

741
00:43:39,357 --> 00:43:41,187
I finally told them to stop when I looked away all this time.

742
00:43:44,826 --> 00:43:45,826
But...

743
00:43:46,756 --> 00:43:48,096
don't do that next time.

744
00:43:49,997 --> 00:43:53,067
You might end up getting bullied because of me.

745
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:55,006
Nothing about this is your fault.

746
00:43:55,807 --> 00:43:58,207
It's not your fault. You didn't do anything wrong.

747
00:43:59,506 --> 00:44:02,346
You were just crossing the street on a green light.

748
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,076
But you got into a car accident.

749
00:44:04,946 --> 00:44:06,716
You were just unlucky.

750
00:44:07,216 --> 00:44:09,317
This is the evil driver's fault.

751
00:44:13,457 --> 00:44:14,857
Right. Hye Ryung.

752
00:44:16,957 --> 00:44:18,397
It's not fair that you were in a car accident.

753
00:44:19,497 --> 00:44:20,696
But you must still recover from it.

754
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:23,227
Only you can...

755
00:44:24,267 --> 00:44:25,437
save yourself.

756
00:44:35,595 --> 00:44:38,196
Mr. Song. I hope you've been well.

757
00:44:38,896 --> 00:44:42,265
I'd like to buy a large shipment this time around.

758
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:45,935
A batch ten times larger than the last is quite a load.

759
00:44:47,006 --> 00:44:50,336
Oh, he asked to check them at the site?

760
00:44:53,845 --> 00:44:56,075
But... Oh, well,

761
00:44:56,816 --> 00:44:58,046
I don't see why not.

762
00:44:59,345 --> 00:45:01,415
If we're going to work as a team,

763
00:45:01,955 --> 00:45:04,316
maybe, this is not a bad way to get to know each other.

764
00:45:05,955 --> 00:45:07,055
Then...

765
00:45:07,856 --> 00:45:09,225
let's do this instead.

766
00:45:11,595 --> 00:45:12,725
I'm stepping out for a moment.

767
00:45:13,196 --> 00:45:15,435
- Where are you going? - To make a new friend.

768
00:45:15,665 --> 00:45:16,695
A friend?

769
00:45:16,696 --> 00:45:19,005
Yes. I got a message from Mr. Kim.

770
00:45:19,006 --> 00:45:20,506
He texted me the time and the location.

771
00:45:54,435 --> 00:45:56,935
(Restricted call)

772
00:46:15,095 --> 00:46:16,455
Are we filming a movie?

773
00:46:18,365 --> 00:46:19,426
Is this "Infernal Affairs?"

774
00:46:21,426 --> 00:46:22,796
Movies are nice.

775
00:46:24,696 --> 00:46:25,805
Care to film one with me?

776
00:46:28,635 --> 00:46:31,305
I don't interact with people like you.

777
00:46:32,705 --> 00:46:35,316
You say that, but you willingly accepted my present.

778
00:46:36,276 --> 00:46:38,316
What? Are you talking about Lee Jin Soo?

779
00:46:38,745 --> 00:46:40,046
Did you expect me to dump him?

780
00:46:40,515 --> 00:46:42,055
Even if it was a present from you,

781
00:46:42,685 --> 00:46:44,316
a piece of trash like him had to be disposed.

782
00:46:44,615 --> 00:46:46,755
That's it. That's what I want from you.

783
00:46:46,756 --> 00:46:48,396
I don't care what you want from me.

784
00:46:49,256 --> 00:46:51,526
Stop trying to latch on to me.

785
00:46:52,495 --> 00:46:53,495
Take it.

786
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:59,066
How come you can't accept my kindness as it is?

787
00:47:00,165 --> 00:47:01,235
If you wanted to be someone...

788
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:02,975
who extended kindness and did people favours,

789
00:47:04,475 --> 00:47:05,975
you shouldn't have committed crimes.

790
00:47:08,415 --> 00:47:09,415
Here.

791
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,514
Sure. You give me no choice then.

792
00:47:13,515 --> 00:47:15,514
I already set up everything, so you could bust the deal.

793
00:47:15,515 --> 00:47:17,216
But if you don't want that, I'll take it.

794
00:47:18,385 --> 00:47:19,586
What did you just say?

795
00:47:20,486 --> 00:47:21,995
I can bust the deal?

796
00:47:22,495 --> 00:47:23,594
The drug deal?

797
00:47:23,595 --> 00:47:25,495
What other deal could I possibly mean?

798
00:47:26,765 --> 00:47:27,895
Elaborate.

799
00:47:27,896 --> 00:47:29,235
Forget it. I don't need you.

800
00:47:29,236 --> 00:47:30,295
Other prosecutors are lining up to take this.

801
00:47:30,296 --> 00:47:32,164
- Give me that. - CEO Kim Yun Gi,

802
00:47:32,165 --> 00:47:33,735
Lee Jin Soo's boss, is the mastermind, right?

803
00:47:33,736 --> 00:47:34,736
Give it to me now.

804
00:47:34,737 --> 00:47:36,906
You said you didn't want any part of it. Why so curious now?

805
00:47:37,236 --> 00:47:39,205
Will Kim Yun Gi be at the drug deal?

806
00:47:45,015 --> 00:47:46,046
Are you curious?

807
00:47:53,756 --> 00:47:54,756
Yes.

808
00:47:55,526 --> 00:47:57,156
This time, he will be at the scene.

809
00:47:57,696 --> 00:47:59,365
He'll meet his supplier at the port.

810
00:48:01,026 --> 00:48:03,736
Money, drugs, and those dirtbags.

811
00:48:04,995 --> 00:48:07,665
It's a chance to gobble up all of them in one go.

812
00:48:24,156 --> 00:48:25,185
Investigator.

813
00:48:25,856 --> 00:48:27,725
Ask the police to investigate something for me.

814
00:48:52,515 --> 00:48:55,045
Hey. We've been through so much together.

815
00:48:55,046 --> 00:48:57,285
Even the things I wish we didn't have to. You know?

816
00:48:57,515 --> 00:48:59,285
And as for those unfortunate events,

817
00:49:01,086 --> 00:49:03,395
I have recordings of them.

818
00:49:03,396 --> 00:49:06,566
I got rid of the videos in Mr. Kim's safe.

819
00:49:07,095 --> 00:49:08,296
But who knows?

820
00:49:08,635 --> 00:49:09,836
Mr. Kim...

821
00:49:10,466 --> 00:49:12,736
might have saved copies of the videos somewhere else.

822
00:49:14,435 --> 00:49:17,035
Anyway, this is all I can do for you.

823
00:49:19,475 --> 00:49:21,745
Starting now, this is your fight.

824
00:49:23,546 --> 00:49:24,575
I'm sure you know...

825
00:49:25,785 --> 00:49:28,385
that you're the only one...

826
00:49:29,356 --> 00:49:30,385
who can save yourself.

827
00:49:32,986 --> 00:49:33,986
Yes.

828
00:49:34,785 --> 00:49:37,325
I'll bring him to you as soon as we finish the current case.

829
00:50:06,955 --> 00:50:08,626
Isn't it nice to see the ocean in a while?

830
00:50:10,095 --> 00:50:11,296
Yes. It's nice.

831
00:50:11,896 --> 00:50:14,595
But hearing your voice is ruining the moment.

832
00:50:15,665 --> 00:50:16,995
I'm sure I'll grow on you.

833
00:50:17,566 --> 00:50:19,406
Once we get close, I'll record some clips for you.

834
00:50:19,805 --> 00:50:22,376
You can do that once you go to the slammer later.

835
00:50:24,836 --> 00:50:27,745
Hey, are you sure this is the place?

836
00:50:28,406 --> 00:50:29,975
Something is off.

837
00:50:30,676 --> 00:50:32,345
You're very impatient.

838
00:50:32,415 --> 00:50:34,915
I'll wrap this up nicely for you.

839
00:50:35,185 --> 00:50:36,185
Right.

840
00:50:36,685 --> 00:50:39,156
You sound bored. Let me introduce one more friend.

841
00:50:46,466 --> 00:50:47,526
Hello.

842
00:50:48,265 --> 00:50:50,595
I see. Mr. Lim Byung Min.

843
00:50:52,765 --> 00:50:53,765
Do you know me?

844
00:50:53,766 --> 00:50:56,006
I know all of Ha Ri's friends.

845
00:50:56,805 --> 00:50:58,505
You just wait next to him.

846
00:50:58,506 --> 00:51:00,446
When he goes to prison, you'll be right there with him.

847
00:51:01,176 --> 00:51:03,216
I don't want to go to prison.

848
00:51:03,316 --> 00:51:05,586
Gosh, no way. You must accompany him to prison.

849
00:51:06,586 --> 00:51:08,014
Aren't you the social butterfly?

850
00:51:08,015 --> 00:51:09,515
You make friends quickly, don't you?

851
00:51:12,926 --> 00:51:15,455
We'll turn off our receivers now.

852
00:51:31,075 --> 00:51:32,245
You're here.

853
00:51:34,276 --> 00:51:35,345
Welcome.

854
00:51:37,745 --> 00:51:39,316
By the way, who are they?

855
00:51:39,415 --> 00:51:40,446
Oh, them?

856
00:51:41,185 --> 00:51:43,185
I wanted to come here alone,

857
00:51:43,555 --> 00:51:44,586
but my partner insisted on it.

858
00:51:45,486 --> 00:51:48,055
I see. The supplier?

859
00:51:48,225 --> 00:51:49,526
I call him Mr. Song.

860
00:51:50,656 --> 00:51:52,796
He can be very meticulous.

861
00:51:53,526 --> 00:51:54,566
I see.

862
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:57,796
Sure. It's always better to keep everything clear.

863
00:51:58,066 --> 00:51:59,165
He sounds trustworthy.

864
00:51:59,665 --> 00:52:01,664
- Let's go. - Allow me to search you.

865
00:52:01,665 --> 00:52:03,135
Come on.

866
00:52:11,015 --> 00:52:12,615
It's just a part of the process.

867
00:52:24,955 --> 00:52:25,966
Fine.

868
00:52:31,336 --> 00:52:32,836
We'll need your phones as well.

869
00:52:34,705 --> 00:52:35,906
It's always better to keep everything clear.

870
00:52:38,475 --> 00:52:39,475
Okay.

871
00:52:46,115 --> 00:52:47,385
Apologies for the inconvenience.

872
00:52:47,885 --> 00:52:50,885
We will transport you safely to the destination from here.

873
00:53:30,595 --> 00:53:31,595
Mr. Kim.

874
00:53:32,296 --> 00:53:33,966
Are we going the right way?

875
00:53:34,665 --> 00:53:37,095
We're going the opposite way from the port you mentioned.

876
00:53:38,135 --> 00:53:39,135
Oh, well...

877
00:53:39,836 --> 00:53:41,066
Let's do this instead.

878
00:53:41,665 --> 00:53:44,135
Lead Mr. Jung to another place.

879
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:49,515
I can go with the deal only when it's secured from my end.

880
00:53:50,876 --> 00:53:52,946
This is just how Mr. Song works.

881
00:53:53,546 --> 00:53:55,285
Please try to understand.

882
00:53:55,716 --> 00:53:58,885
It won't cause any problems with the deal, right?

883
00:54:03,325 --> 00:54:04,896
Yes, let's say so.

884
00:54:10,396 --> 00:54:11,765
It's just as we expected.

885
00:54:13,035 --> 00:54:14,165
Please call him.

886
00:54:17,075 --> 00:54:18,106
Darn it.

887
00:54:19,946 --> 00:54:22,415
Prosecutor Kwak. It's me, Byung Min.

888
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,756
Look at these punks playing tricks.

889
00:54:32,426 --> 00:54:33,455
They changed it.

890
00:54:36,526 --> 00:54:38,256
Gosh. They won't even send us any backup for this.

891
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:40,696
Prosecutor Kwak.

892
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:42,935
I just noticed it. You're wearing gray today.

893
00:54:43,495 --> 00:54:44,495
What do you mean?

894
00:54:44,496 --> 00:54:46,465
You said before that you don't wear anything in gray.

895
00:54:46,466 --> 00:54:47,836
Your shoes today...

896
00:54:52,575 --> 00:54:53,946
I had gray shoes, I guess.

897
00:54:54,606 --> 00:54:55,614
Anyway,

898
00:54:55,615 --> 00:54:57,474
they'll give us the location, so let's get moving.

899
00:54:57,475 --> 00:54:58,475
Yes, sir.

900
00:55:15,126 --> 00:55:16,165
Yes, sir.

901
00:55:17,995 --> 00:55:19,006
Pull over.

902
00:55:20,635 --> 00:55:21,665
What's going on?

903
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:23,606
Why are they pulling over here?

904
00:55:31,115 --> 00:55:32,115
Mr. Kim?

905
00:55:34,385 --> 00:55:35,486
Have a comfortable trip.

906
00:56:21,595 --> 00:56:24,165
I think they abandoned the car.

907
00:56:25,095 --> 00:56:26,205
What should we do?

908
00:56:31,506 --> 00:56:32,646
We need to trust...

909
00:56:33,776 --> 00:56:35,376
our best driver.

910
00:57:54,285 --> 00:57:55,325
This way.

911
00:58:38,066 --> 00:58:39,205
You got here safely.

912
00:58:39,906 --> 00:58:40,935
Thank you for coming all the way here.

913
00:58:41,265 --> 00:58:43,776
You're so thorough.

914
00:58:46,245 --> 00:58:47,606
Where is Mr. Song...

915
00:59:11,265 --> 00:59:12,296
You're awake.

916
00:59:14,205 --> 00:59:15,205
No!

917
00:59:40,696 --> 00:59:43,336
(Special thanks to Park Gun Hyung for appearing.)

918
01:00:06,825 --> 01:00:11,725
(The Player 2: Master of Swindlers)

919
01:00:11,955 --> 01:00:13,795
So prove it.

920
01:00:13,796 --> 01:00:15,126
Yes, of course.

921
01:00:15,426 --> 01:00:17,935
Is he the guy who killed your teammate?

922
01:00:18,935 --> 01:00:20,236
Are you obsessed with money?

923
01:00:20,566 --> 01:00:21,906
That's right. I told them to do that.

924
01:00:22,006 --> 01:00:23,506
To destroy everything if things go wrong.

925
01:00:23,805 --> 01:00:25,736
We have to figure out who they're working for.

926
01:00:25,906 --> 01:00:28,276
Is revenge for my sister in your plan at all?

927
01:00:29,646 --> 01:00:30,646
Je Yi.

928
01:00:30,845 --> 01:00:32,316
You'll soon understand the meaning...

929
01:00:33,716 --> 01:00:34,785
of what we're doing now.

930
01:00:35,115 --> 01:00:36,285
Watch out, Ha Ri!
