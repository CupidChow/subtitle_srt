listen carefully to what I say.

Everything that happens here...

00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,948
is all true,

So?

Behind Mr. Myeong, our current target, is Jeffrey Jung.

Before working on Mr. Myeong,

29

we must cover up Jeffrey Jung's eyes first.

The fact that you're telling us this now...

That means Jeffrey Jung doesn't have eyes on us yet.

- Yes? - I haven't heard from her for days.

So, I waited outside her place. But she won't answer the door.

45
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:53,218
I'm pretty sure she's at home.

How long has it been since you last contacted her?

47

It was two days ago already.

48
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:02,389

This is my daughter's first time living in Seoul.

58

She came to Seoul for work,

59
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:28,019
so she doesn't have any friends here either.

Despite owning hundreds of low-rise apartments,

85
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:18,359
Han was living in a shabby inn.

86
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:21,258
It seems the landlord was in a major financial struggle.

87
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:23,299
It's confirmed that the Villa King owned...

88
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,169
over 200 low-rise apartments just in Hyeongung-dong.

89

The landlord passed away while leaving behind...

90

only a welfare card which verified...

that he fell under Grade Four for physical disability.

there is no next of kin available...

to identify the body.

95
00:06:36,878 --> 00:06:40,049
As it seems the landlord had no confirmed assets,

96
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:42,289
the case is getting more puzzling.

All right. Wait.

Hey, just answer it already.

We didn't leave you out on purpose.

Actually, we were going to tell you.

119

You said I was a picky eater, so you didn't want me to tag along.

- a house in Seoul. - Yes. We have a case.

- she found a problem. - Will we just look at it and leave?

- she realized that... - He said the case was on the news.

- the landlord... - Forget it. Let's just eat.

- had taken out... - We'll go after we eat this.

141

What are we? The police? We're not here to solve crimes.

142
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:25,919
- Dig in now. - We can eat quickly and go.

143
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,789
You hate the police. Why are we talking about a case?

144
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:30,688
He urged to find a tenant.

145
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:33,529
She had just gotten her first job at a company...

146
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:35,258
and began to live on her own for the first time.

147
00:08:35,258 --> 00:08:36,799
She did not have any money saved up.

148
00:08:36,868 --> 00:08:39,698
She wasn't in any situation to ask her family for help.

149
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:41,938
In the end, the only choice she could make...

150
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,839
was taking her own life, so she wouldn't be a burden...

151
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,078
- to her family. - Hey. Finish the food first.

152
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:47,378
- Where are you going? - Eat first.

153
00:08:47,378 --> 00:08:48,708
- She apologized to her mother... - I want to keep eating.

154
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:49,808
- in her suicide note. - Go on.

155
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:52,349
She also wrote to relinquish her inheritance.

156
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,219
- When her mother contacted... - We should go.

157
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:55,649
- the police for not being able... - Sir, could you pack this up?

158
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:56,719
to reach her daughter,

159
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:59,719
- she was able to save her daughter. - Come on.

160
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:03,529
However, her daughter hasn't regained consciousness yet.

161
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:05,388
So her mother continues to stay by her side,

162
00:09:05,388 --> 00:09:07,159
worried for her child's life.

163
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:11,029
There's something I'd like to tell my daughter when she wakes up.

I'll be honest. This building was made for women living alone.

Oh, no. No one puts down their money for the deposit.

They all take out a loan.

a loan with a knife or something?

201

They asked me if I knew a good bank for it.

202
00:11:07,718 --> 00:11:10,088
So I made the introduction to the bank with good intentions.

The moment the victims signed the contract,

you sold off the building to someone else, didn't you?

you sold off on the days of the contract signing.

227

328
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,519
Prosecutor Kwak!

329
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,630
Congratulations on getting chosen...

330
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,529
for three months of cleaning the bathroom.

331
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,870
He's braver than I thought.

332
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,700
He's coming right out without even looking back.

333
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,640
Do you want to play one more time?

334
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,210
Gosh. Over what?

335
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:33,309
Four months of recycling. What do you think?

336
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:35,779
- And what is the question? - The first words out of his mouth.

337
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:37,380
He'll definitely be mad.

338
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,090
"What happened to our detective?" That's what he'll say.

339
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,049
He won't care...

340
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,489
What happened to our detective?

341
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:49,930
He should be taking a short nap.

342
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,700
He must be very tired carrying out the mission.

343
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,029
Just let him rest a bit.

344
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,079
Why are you sleeping with your eyes open?

345
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,380
You're okay.

346
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:21,130
You have been chosen for four months of recycling.

347
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,229
How could you exactly say,

348
00:20:23,229 --> 00:20:25,059
"What happened to our detective?"

349
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:28,170
Prosecutor Kwak. Were you two in on this together?

350
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,239
I guess you didn't.

351
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:32,700
Do you know why I just left you...

352
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,640
no matter what you were doing?

353
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:38,840
Because you knew what we were doing was right?

354
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:39,979
No.

355
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,009
Because you didn't invade my territory.

356
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,620
Because you only put on your shows in your front yard.

357
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,190
But how dare you mess with a detective?

358
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,160
You have...

359
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,160
very much crossed the line.

360
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,029
Gosh. I don't think this plan will go well.

361
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,400
Gosh. What should we do?

362
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,469
The detectives are coming in right now.

363
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:10,210
Let's talk about the details when we get back.

364
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,180
You should contact your lawyers.

365
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:14,549
Good ones.

366
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,180
Prosecutor Kwak.

367
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:19,680
The real reason you're here...

368
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,150
is Mr. Myeong, isn't it?

369
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,430
(86 Fishery, indoor fishing)

370
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,529
Mr. Myeong isn't here right now.

371
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:39,269
But Kang Ha Ri will find out soon.

372
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,180
Pick up.

373
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,180
(Ha Ri)

374
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,279
There's no time.

375
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:50,549
Don't you want to catch Mr. Myeong?

376
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:58,190
We don't have much time, so I'm only going to say this once.

377
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,489
Tell the police officers to stay back.

378
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:03,160
Don't cross the line, Kang Ha Ri.

379
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,460
Even if you arrest us now, all you can do is fine us...

380
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,630
for obstruction of justice.

381
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,299
Yes, I understand, Mr. Myeong.

382
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,069
Don't act desperately.

383
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:17,180
The more desperate person gets the bad end of the deal.

384
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,509
Check things thoroughly...

385
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,979
with your own two eyes.

386
00:22:37,229 --> 00:22:41,029
(Sansan Pharmacy)

387
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:43,029
We started such a big operation. Shouldn't we catch a big fish?

388
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,569
I'll put Mr. Myeong in your net today.

389
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:47,569
Prosecutor Kwak.

390
00:22:47,969 --> 00:22:49,840
Don't you want to see him with your own eyes?

391
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:51,340
Today?

392
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:53,850
- Even a minute late... - I'll take responsibility.

393
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,309
Do whatever you want with me.

394
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,150
You've seen what we're capable of.

395
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,789
There's no time. Decide quickly.

396
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:06,890
Okay. You have until the end of today.

397
00:23:07,229 --> 00:23:09,489
If you fail, you better be ready.

398
00:23:09,729 --> 00:23:10,729
Okay.

399
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:23,509
Pause on the mission and stand by.

400
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,059
You really are great, Prosecutor Kwak.

401
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:41,930
You decided to target Mr. Myeong, the real boss right away.

402
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,029
Come on.

403
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:45,360
He must have so much information.

404
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:48,329
I heard he had lots of information on celebrity gossip.

405
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,700
I heard the leader from the girl group Prizel...

406
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:54,410
and Kim something were dating.

407
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,009
Come on. It's Sung something.

408
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:58,180
- Sung something? - Yes.

409
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,239
I heard it was Kim something.

410
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:01,749
- Which is correct, Prosecutor Kwak? - It's Sung something, isn't it?

411
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:05,450
- They're not dating, I guess. - Isn't it Sung something?

412
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:09,789
Ha Ri's on the move. We should go too.

413
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:15,329
Welcome.

414
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,559
(Pharmacy)

415
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:18,930
I need some cold medicine.

416
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,100
Okay.

417
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:24,440
You have a bad one.

418
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,370
- I won't be long. - Excuse me.

419
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,440
Yes?

420
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,779
I want something potent.

421
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,739
Sure.

422
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,960
(Block D)

423
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,319
Is he asleep?

424
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,950
He can hear, sir.

425
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:25,460
Some cold medications...

426
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:27,829
contain something called deodramine.

427
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:33,239
It's also in the sleeping aid you took.

428
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,880
When you're found in 3 or 4 days and they run tests,

429
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,249
all they'll find...

430
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:42,809
is probably deodramine.

431
00:25:43,819 --> 00:25:45,749
Everyone will have a different opinion...

432
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:47,420
on what you took.

433
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,160
You have a chronic heart condition.

434
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,460
(Cold-in-one)

435
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,289
You took some cold meds before bed...

436
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:57,860
and died...

437
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:00,299
comfortably in your sleep.

438
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,140
And people will call you...

439
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,509
the Miheng-dong Villa King.

440
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,120
I usually leave this to someone else.

441
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:23,120
But I want to know what the moment of death is like.

442
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:25,289
Please...

443
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:27,489
No...

444
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,170
Please go to the light.

445
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,340
I don't want to see you in the fiery pit.

446
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,279
(Cold-in-one)

447
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:54,219
There was...

448
00:26:54,219 --> 00:26:56,420
a real estate con in Gangha City two years ago.

449
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:01,160
Hundreds of people lost over 50 million dollars in total.

450
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,489
It was a massive con.

451
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,160
A plot of greenbelt land that had practically no value...

452
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,299
was sold for over ten times the market price.

453
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:11,999
He set up a real estate agency and gathered people...

454
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:13,299
to pose as employees,

455
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,239
then had them buy the land first.

456
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:17,940
They brought in friends and family to sell?

457
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,910
It's a typical pyramid scheme.

458
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,579
I was going to bring in the agency CEO for questioning.

459
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:24,680
He offed himself.

460
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,150
It's quite similar.

461
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,090
Right before the CEO died,

462
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:31,059
he sent just one text message.

463
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,690
Mr. Myeong?

464
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,930
(Mr. Myeong. Please call me.)

465
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:42,029
You must've come across that name elsewhere.

466
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,400
When Hadeok Island was earmarked for the new airport four years ago,

467
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:46,469
a company made a profit by spreading lies...

468
00:27:46,469 --> 00:27:47,539
and that name came up.

469
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,210
Mr. Myeong.

470
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,140
The Seogi-dong...

471
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,140
redevelopment investment con from six years ago.

472
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,380
That name appeared then too.

473
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,680
"Jongno's Mr. Myeong."

474
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:59,880
The name means nothing if you keep the cases separate,

475
00:28:00,489 --> 00:28:02,249
but if you line everything up,

476
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:04,519
you can see the designer Mr. Myeong.

477
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,289
Yes. And...

478
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,690
it happened again.

479
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:17,069
(Real Estate Rental Agreement)

480
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:18,299
Sir.

481
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,200
- We found this. - Okay.

482
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,450
(Resident Registration Card, Welfare Card)

483
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,789
(Mr. Myeong)

484
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,660
(Mr. Myeong)

485
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,999
- The number... - It had to be a burner phone...

486
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:45,499
that couldn't be traced.

487
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:46,600
Check and try again.

488
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,700
So...

489
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:50,600
How did you find this guy?

490
00:28:51,739 --> 00:28:52,840
Who found him?

491
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,370
Mr. Myeong.

492
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,710
Has anyone heard the name?

493
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:01,850
The invisible hand of the real estate world.

494
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,920
Why?

495
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:06,219
It's so dirty it's black.

496
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:07,249
So it's invisible.

497
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:11,019
Ha Ri was already making a plan to approach Mr. Myeong.

498
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:14,259
So what is Mr. Myeong's real name?

499
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:17,900
- Myeong Ji Hwan. - Myeong Ji Hwan?

500
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:20,299
Myeong Jung Ho.

501
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:21,969
It's Myeong Jin Woo.

502
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,200
No. Myeong Won Seob.

503
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,469
What are you all playing at?

504
00:29:26,469 --> 00:29:29,210
Mr. Myeong has four more known aliases.

505
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,140
No one knows his real name?

506
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,650
He wants to see what we're working on right now?

507
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:39,680
He insisted I see it for myself.

508
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:42,090
Right.

509
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,259
I see.

510
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:47,090
Well...

511
00:29:47,989 --> 00:29:49,930
Okay, then. Let's go.

512
00:29:58,069 --> 00:29:59,799
Where are we?

513
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,210
This is Dojak-dong.

514
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:06,140
Sir.

515
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:09,410
It's Mr. Myeong's next known target.

516
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:12,150
In order to find Mr. Myeong,

517
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:14,420
we set something up here first.

518
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:16,019
You set something up?

519
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:18,590
We made a few shady deals.

520
00:30:18,989 --> 00:30:21,729
I find one thing pretty strange.

521
00:30:22,729 --> 00:30:25,729
Dojak-dong is just too quiet.

522
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,370
If you were right and you conned people,

523
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,799
reporters and prosecutors would be flooding the area...

524
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:34,269
because they smelled something.

525
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:35,910
Right.

526
00:30:36,469 --> 00:30:37,579
Goodness.

527
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:40,140
I've been picked on a lot in my day,

528
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,479
but never for being good at what I do.

529
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,180
Forget it. Let's call it off. Whatever.

530
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,249
Come on.

531
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:49,989
Let's see exactly how good you are, Mr. Kim.

532
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:52,519
Fine.

533
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:55,430
My condition is that I meet your boss Mr. Myeong.

534
00:30:55,829 --> 00:30:58,029
In return, I'll show you just one deal.

535
00:30:58,259 --> 00:30:59,259
Okay.

536
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Right now?

537
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,170
He can't do this.

538
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,569
Get ready, Prosecutor Kwak.

539
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,769
Tell me if you need time to prepare.

540
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:07,840
Why would I need to prepare to do something I always do?

541
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,910
I'll show you right now. Let's go.

542
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,279
Ta-da.

543
00:31:17,249 --> 00:31:18,450
Today's concept is a guy...

544
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,249
who made it big on cryptocurrency...

545
00:31:20,249 --> 00:31:21,390
and bought a few properties.

546
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,950
You look like a thug from Arizona.

547
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:25,590
A middle-aged guy who's pretending to own properties?

548
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,789
- Hey! - I just hired a newbie.

549
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:29,160
I wonder how well he'll do.

550
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:30,499
A newbie?

551
00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:31,999
(First, fake estate agent and tenant)

552
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,600
We'll go into this villa and show a property.

553
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,170
Oh, my! You made it!

554
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,479
Was it easy to find?

555
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:49,910
Yes. It wasn't that far from the subway exit.

556
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:53,019
Yes. Agents say their properties are close to the subway,

557
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:55,190
but in some cases, you need to take a shuttle...

558
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,590
to get to a subway station.

559
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,819
But this place is really, honestly close to a station...

560
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:00,019
and that's a fact.

561
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:02,390
That's why I asked you to find your way...

562
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,100
instead of bringing you here.

563
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,200
I see.

564
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,069
I might laugh off my belly button.

565
00:32:09,229 --> 00:32:11,039
Your acting's a bit off.

566
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,840
Try to sound more natural later.

567
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,769
This is a rehearsal, right?

568
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:16,940
I do better when the stage is set.

569
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,950
Oh, and the newbie will wait over there.

570
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,710
- Go on. - Go stand over there.

571
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,749
Good luck.

572
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:28,519
Let's go.

573
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,559
Hey, the door's open.

574
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,789
Is someone here?

575
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:35,229
Hey, Ms. Im.

576
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,130
Mr. Kim. Goodness. How are you?

577
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,860
You're looking good.

578
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,499
You haven't changed one bit.

579
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,400
Do call if you find something nice.

580
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:46,539
Take a look around.

581
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:47,640
- Okay. - Go ahead.

582
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,140
Are you here to check out the property too?

583
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,380
Oh, us?

584
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,279
I know the building owner.

585
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,110
Yes, but could you...

586
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,479
look out for people like me...

587
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:00,890
who live off of a commission?

588
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,960
People like you can't take over properties in the residential...

589
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,219
Ms. Im. Do you know the building by the junction's for sale?

590
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:09,930
The one with the hospital?

591
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,360
I'll have them call you.

592
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,130
Oh, will you?

593
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,700
Hey, Ms. Im.

594
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,499
Is the fridge included?

595
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:17,840
It's fully furnished.

596
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,039
- It's fully furnished? - Yes.

597
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,370
Don't you mind us.

598
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:25,140
I'll leave you to it.

599
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:29,610
What do you think?

600
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,279
The toilet flushes perfectly.

601
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:34,590
- Villas these days... - He'll sign, won't he?

602
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,660
- There is a bathtub too. - Shall we head to the bank?

603
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,219
- It's quite nice. - Isn't it?

604
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:41,890
You need to see the walk-in closet.

605
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,199
(Second, deposit loan fraud)

606
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:49,400
I don't think there are any private loan consultants here.

607
00:33:49,869 --> 00:33:51,800
You're right. There weren't.

608
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,840
Until we showed up.

609
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,309
Did you cast a magic spell or something?

610
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,940
- How did you know? - What?

611
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,579
We set up an office of magic...

612
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:03,380
that gives out loans to delinquent borrowers...

613
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,820
who can no longer go to banks.

614
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:10,050
You're here, ma'am.

615
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,659
Are you sure you're "a young man in society?"

616
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,999
I'm "a middle-aged man in society."

617
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:22,729
- Shall we go? - Let's go.

618
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,710
Good luck, "middle-aged man in society."

619
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,579
Cue.

620
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:37,249
Aren't we going to the bank?

621
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:41,349
Gosh, I wanted to help you in a more private setting.

622
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:42,349
Ms. Im.

623
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,889
Oh, my. Sir.

624
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:46,960
It's that guy from before.

625
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:48,889
- Mr. Kim. - I'm seeing a lot of you today.

626
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,699
We must be destined to meet today or something.

627
00:34:52,229 --> 00:34:53,729
Did you perhaps follow me?

628
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:57,470
It must be written all over my face that I like you.

629
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,470
- Goodness. I feel so shy. - You.

630
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,110
Oh, you can get back to business.

631
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,679
- Have a seat here. - Okay.

632
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,639
Gosh, you must be here to buy a house.

633
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:08,309
- Well, on a lease... - I see.

634
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,030
- Se Eun, give him good advice. - I will.

635
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,059
All of you, stop!

636
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:27,670
That's it.

637
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:33,800
Oh, sir.

638
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,409
I was going to call you first.

639
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,579
Goodness, how scary.

640
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,380
Why are you so serious?

641
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:50,289
- You look cute. - Yes, I get that often.

642
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,530
You seem to have prepared a lot, but I'm so sorry.

643
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,990
I just came here to...

644
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,769
We got caught.

645
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,039
- Put it over here. - Gosh, I'm sorry.

646
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,510
Hey.

647
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:14,650
You know the story, "The Emperor's New Clothes," right?

648
00:36:16,249 --> 00:36:18,119
He was the only one who didn't know he was naked.

649
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:22,650
He was an idiot who paraded around before people and was humiliated.

650
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:27,019
It was so embarrassing to watch you do that.

651
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:31,829
I held back on purpose to confirm you were all working together.

652
00:36:34,429 --> 00:36:37,329
Yes, I can see why this situation might seem odd.

653
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:38,670
I know.

654
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,499
Please give me a chance to explain.

655
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:41,539
Let's have a seat first...

656
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,110
You don't need to explain. I'm a professional too.

657
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,979
If you get caught, you just shut your mouth and leave the game.

658
00:36:49,449 --> 00:36:52,050
No matter how high you think you can jump,

659
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:54,289
you can't get away from Mr. Myeong's grasp.

660
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,260
Mr. Myeong said to send you off with your limbs intact.

661
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,990
So, be grateful.

662
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,789
Don't ever show your faces in this world again.

663
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,329
Got it?

664
00:37:06,999 --> 00:37:08,900
Out of the way. Police.

665
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:10,999
Out of the way. Police.

666
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,900
Why are there so many people in this small space?

667
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,340
You're under arrest for leasing fraud.

668
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,780
You may remain silent...

669
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,409
I just hired a newbie. I wonder how well he'll do.

670
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:30,119
You guys were all fraudsters! Why, I ought to...

671
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,490
Sit down.

672
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:36,360
Mr. Newbie. It's your turn to play your part.

673
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:39,329
- Come upstairs and arrest us. - Those little punks.

674
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,829
Do you have a warrant?

675
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,369
I don't need one to arrest you in the act.

676
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:46,940
I'll write one up for you on our way to the station.

677
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,940
Arrest him.

678
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,039
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

679
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:50,039
Wait, but...

680
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:53,110
- Gosh. - But I'm a victim.

681
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,349
- But why are you... - Goodness.

682
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,409
All of these people are con artists.

683
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,249
Yes. Prosecutor Kwak will come to you.

684
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,889
Okay, we have Prosecutor Kwak's location.

685
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,420
Rethink this once more.

686
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,159
It's too risky to bring Prosecutor Kwak into this personally.

687
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,659
I'm worried about how we got our pictures taken on purpose.

688
00:38:12,229 --> 00:38:14,030
If you don't want to trust someone, you're bound to doubt even more.

689
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:15,869
You end up trusting as much as you doubt.

690
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:18,999
That's Ha Ri's creed number 18. Okay!

691
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,139
By the way, Ha Ri,

692
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:25,110
Prosecutors Jang and Kwak are different kinds of men.

693
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:28,880
This guy is a prosecutor right down to the bone.

694
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,280
In order to catch Mr. Myeong,

695
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,420
Prosecutor Kwak would probably even hold...

696
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,289
- the devil's hand in the inferno. - Is that so?

697
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,949
You're finally admitting that you're the devil, aren't you?

698
00:38:37,659 --> 00:38:39,190
It's too big a risk.

699
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,630
If Prosecutor Kwak doesn't do as we expect...

700
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,789
Shall we make a bet, then?

701
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:45,099
Whether or not Prosecutor Kwak will do as we hope?

702
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,130
Forget it.

703
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,670
I'm not dumb enough to bet against a player.

704
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,070
Okay.

705
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,710
It was a good thing you didn't bet against me, right?

706
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:59,639
I told you. I don't gamble with a player.

707
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:02,510
Come on. This isn't gambling. It's just for fun.

708
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,179
Do you know what kids call that these days?

709
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:06,519
What?

710
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:09,150
"We did kiss, but we're not dating."

711
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,990
Wait... But is that even possible?

712
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:38,420
Yes, hello?

713
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,559
They were all arrested?

714
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,159
Fascinating.

715
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:51,900
Even prosecutors come to arrest these guys in person.

716
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:56,530
I guess we've found an opponent who's worthy of our attention.

(Police)

718
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:28,470
No one is watching now. Why don't we stop this act?

719
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,240
We didn't even get a glimpse of Mr. Myeong today.

720
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:34,510
You should take responsibility, Kang Ha Ri.

721
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:39,610
Think of the reason you always fell behind us until now.

722
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:42,249
- What? - Can't you be more flexible?

723
00:40:42,979 --> 00:40:44,720
You need to think outside the box...

724
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,519
to see what you can't see.

725

"Think outside the box?"

726
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:51,690
Enough with your nonsense.

727
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,860
All you've done so far was break the law, not think outside the box.

728
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:59,460
Excuse me. We'll give you time to do this later on.

729
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,300
You guys should catch up properly then.

730
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,530
Let's not do this here.

731
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:08,539
Mr. Choi kept watching us get arrested until the very end.

732
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:12,510
Thanks to you, he'll think we're trustworthy.

733
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,010
I'm sure he'll contact us again soon.

734
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:15,679
How's that?

735
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,780
You can tell for sure since you've worked with us now, right?

736

What you must do to catch Mr. Myeong.

737
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:23,289
There were specific testimonies from victims,

738
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:24,760
but you weren't able to arrest CEO Choi.

739
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,960
You let him go on purpose to catch Mr. Myeong?

740
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,630
No. You had no choice but to let him go.

741
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,659
Why?

742
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:33,059
Because you had no proof to say that it was fraud.

743
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,499
So?

744
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,340
I should think outside the box like you?

745
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:43,710
And work together with criminals?

746
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:47,309
My gosh.

747
00:41:47,979 --> 00:41:49,610
You're just asking me again when you already understood.

748
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,880
Is that something all prosecutors do?

749
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,920
This is no fun at all right now.

750

He's a prosecutor.

753
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,729
Mr. Prosecutor. There's something that punk, Ha Ri, didn't say.

754
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:10,429
He doesn't even pay us any gas money.

755
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:11,769
He doesn't cover our fuel costs.

756

Wait, but...

757

What are you doing?

758

Rather than just leaving now,

759
00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:27,579
wouldn't it look more convincing if you came in for a bit?

760

Then I must play my role too.

823
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,329
Here you go.

824
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,010
Mr. Myeong?

825
00:50:30,962 --> 00:50:32,063
Mr. Myeong?

826
00:50:49,942 --> 00:50:50,982
What is it, Kang Ha Ri?

827
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:52,552
Gosh.

828
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:56,152
Mr. Choi.

829
00:50:58,592 --> 00:51:01,293
You've been playing with me all day. What's this now?

830
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:04,592
Gosh.

831
00:51:06,592 --> 00:51:09,203
Wish Mr. Myeong a long, healthy life for me.

832
00:51:10,203 --> 00:51:11,362
Seriously.

833
00:51:12,632 --> 00:51:14,203
Wait, Mr. Kim.

834
00:51:17,973 --> 00:51:21,442
I'm going to tell you a fun story.

835
00:51:21,782 --> 00:51:23,012
(CEO Choi)

836
00:51:23,942 --> 00:51:25,782
It's about a prey...

837
00:51:26,782 --> 00:51:28,282
who thought he was the hunter.

838
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,163
Do you remember Mr. Kim Soo Chan?

839
00:51:37,223 --> 00:51:38,262
You know,

840
00:51:39,293 --> 00:51:41,462
the tenant who signed with you.

841
00:51:42,063 --> 00:51:45,632
You know, the tenant who signed with you.

842
00:51:46,402 --> 00:51:48,703
I wasn't there at the signing, just like Mr. Myeong wasn't.

843
00:51:51,402 --> 00:51:52,873
Then let me refresh your memory.

844
00:51:54,743 --> 00:51:56,743
This guy signed a rental agreement with you.

845
00:51:57,442 --> 00:51:59,183
The deposit was 250,000 dollars. He took out a loan for it.

846
00:52:01,012 --> 00:52:02,382
But on the day of the signing,

847
00:52:03,052 --> 00:52:04,922
You sold off the building.

848
00:52:05,393 --> 00:52:06,453
So what?

849
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:09,223
Some people call this fraud.

850
00:52:09,523 --> 00:52:12,063
But in fact, this is just a business deal.

851
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:13,393
Right.

852
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:17,902
There's nothing fun about this story.

853
00:52:18,232 --> 00:52:20,473
Just get to the point. Tell me what you really want to say.

854
00:52:23,072 --> 00:52:26,842
I think this is the moment I must make a business decision.

855
00:52:27,572 --> 00:52:28,913
Should I...

856
00:52:30,482 --> 00:52:33,212
play along with your story or not?

857
00:52:34,512 --> 00:52:35,523
A business decision?

858
00:52:37,123 --> 00:52:38,422
What on earth...

859
00:52:40,052 --> 00:52:42,293
I will soon ask Mr. Kim Soo Chan.

860
00:52:43,723 --> 00:52:46,532
If he hates you enough that he wants to kill you...

861
00:52:46,532 --> 00:52:48,192
since you stole his money.

862
00:52:49,203 --> 00:52:50,203
Or...

863
00:52:50,532 --> 00:52:53,373
you lied and used this incident as a way to get close to me.

864
00:52:54,632 --> 00:52:56,842
Who's Kim Soo Chan? Did you hire this guy?

865
00:52:57,842 --> 00:52:58,842
Well,

866
00:53:00,442 --> 00:53:02,083
- I don't know him either. - What?

867
00:53:02,543 --> 00:53:04,183
- Hey. - What's this?

868
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,552
I could've done this.

869
00:53:08,313 --> 00:53:09,583
I was bored, so I did it.

What isn't perfect about me?

875
00:53:26,402 --> 00:53:27,732
I just meant it was fine.

876
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:29,672
Gosh. So annoying.

877
00:53:31,572 --> 00:53:33,043
My face is more perfect than yours, you know.

878
00:53:34,413 --> 00:53:35,442

Thank you.

Good thing you know. Gosh.

Hello, Prosecutor Kwak.

884
00:53:55,503 --> 00:53:57,132
I'm going to send over a yearly lease agreement,

885
00:53:57,132 --> 00:53:58,873
so look into who signed it right away.

(Kim Soo Chan)

893
00:54:12,183 --> 00:54:14,853
The fact that Mr. Myeong is suspicious of Kim Soo Chan...

894
00:54:15,322 --> 00:54:17,322
means they've already found out about our plan.

I'll give you one last chance.

906

What else could it be for?

907
00:55:15,143 --> 00:55:16,712
Kang Ha Ri. Abort mission. Get out of there immediately.

We're coming in.

909
00:55:18,282 --> 00:55:19,982
Ha Ri didn't say it was over.

910
00:55:20,552 --> 00:55:22,583
That means the game isn't over yet.

won't just leave like this.

Gosh.

Are you going to knock me out with that...

923
00:56:04,563 --> 00:56:06,063
and make it seem as if I committed suicide?

Recently polls showed that candidate Choi Sang Ho...

pulled further ahead of the second place candidate.

937

It seems more sure that Choi Sang Ho will win.

938
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:07,913
Whether candidate Choi Sang Ho will win over half of the votes...
