1
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,300
   

2
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,810
   

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,610
   

4
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,690
   

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,840
   

6
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,990
   

7
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:54,950


8
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,520
Don't do anything stupid.

9
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,310
I knew you were unruly, but I didn't know you were this reckless.

10
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,020
Explain it.

11
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,970
What's your relationship with Jeffrey?

12
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:27,710
He wants to use me, and I want to eliminate him.

13
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,270
You two seem too tight for that to be true.

14
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,610
You're right.

15
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:38,010
We're very tight and solid.

16
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,110
Because that's what I've been planning all this time.

17
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,480
I was just an assemblyman from a small party without a clique or strong spirit,

18
00:01:53,480 --> 00:02:00,500
but at first, I thought I could take care of him myself.

19
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,080
 I'll help you, too. 

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,630
 I said I'll also help you in your fight, Reporter Sin. 

21
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,260
But it didn't take long for me to assess the reality.

22
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,800
 Candidate Yu Gwang Min, who was leading the polls for the presidential election, 

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,490
 is being accused of stock manipulation to gain an advantage. 

24
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,170
 Does it still look like I'm messing around? 

25
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,120
He wasn't someone that some assemblyman could handle.

26
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,180
I thought I needed more power.

27
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,890
That's why you decided to be the president?

28
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,510
Even by working with him?

29
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,200
That day, he told me...

30
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,030
 You know better than anyone, Assemblyman. 

31
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,970
 You're this country's best option. 

32
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,700
 To willingly become the worst for the best of the country... 

33
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,040
That's when I decided... that I will willingly...

34
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,150
become evil, just as he said.

35
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,270
And I would disappear with my sins.

36
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,730
I'll be responsible for everything regarding this matter.

37
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:20,410
Furthermore, I will make sure everyone involved will get punished.

38
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:27,770
From now on, I'll do my best to assist in the investigation as a suspect.

39
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:32,340
 You have to sacrifice when dealing with a major obstacle. 

40
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,510
 Now, I want to... 

41
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,480
 ask you something, Ha Ri. 

42
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,090
 Are you... 

43
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,650
 truly... 

44
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,570
 ready to sacrifice, Kang Ha Ri? 

45
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,040
The one behind me...

46
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,420
is the one who has been with me for a long time,

47
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,940
a Branch Manager of NQ Infracapital... Jeffrey Jeong.

48
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,160
- Jeffrey?
 - Jeffrey Jeong?

49
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,460
CEO Jeong of NQ and I go way back.

50
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,660
 CEO Kang Do Yeong of Meta Scarlet, who committed an NFT fraud, 

51
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,420
 CEO Kim Yun Gi of KU Entertainment, who threatened his clients and dealt illegal drugs, 

52
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,870
 and Director Baek Hyeon Mi of Baek Gallery, who bribed prosecutors and powerful figures 

53
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,170
 using expensive artworks. 

54
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,710
 They're all criminals who worked for Jeffrey. 

55
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,540
What the hell is going on?

56
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,690
 - Jeffrey... 
 - Why is he taking the blame for everything?

57
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,610
Was he blackmailed?

58
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,850
No, if he was blackmailed, he wouldn't have gotten Jeffrey involved.

59
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,720
You're right.

60
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:54,130
Su Min, did Ha Ri tell you anything, by chance?

61
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,560
Hold on.

62
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,690
Hold on.

63
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,800
They say President Choi Sang Ho resigned.

64
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,470
What?

65
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,330
Give me that.

66
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,600
   

67
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,210
TVS's President Kang will arrive in 15 minutes.

68
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,660
What's the point of talking without any speakers?

69
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,210
Call Chancellor Hwang, too, to open a cabinet.

70
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,650
Yes, sir.

71
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,050
Sir.

72
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,190
 Gosh, why so much? 

73
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,910
 Not at all. You helped me big time this time. 

74
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,370
 Gosh, but still. 

75
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:55,790
 The CEO really wants to privatize the railway construction. 

76
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:00,360
 Let him know that I'm always grateful to him. 

77
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,970
 He'll be in touch with you soon. 

78
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,360
 Along with everyone who helped this time. 

79
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,970
This video is spreading nationwide.

80
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,300
You bastards.

81
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,700
 Even Jeffrey can't stop a scandal this big. 

82
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,720
But why are they sacrificing themselves—

83
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,680
I also have asked him the same question.

84
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,250
 Mr. President, why are you trying to take the blame for everything? 

85
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,510
 The president is supposed to apologize and take responsibility. 

86
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,440
 I was put in... 

87
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,420
 this position because of that. 

88
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,910
 There's an evil group that's been rotting this country for long. 

89
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,360
 But I'm taking responsibility for it. 

90
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,980
But thinking about it, Kang Ha Ri really is a strange fellow.

91
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,330
I thought he would be selfish since he's a swindler.

92
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,190
But he's taking things too far now.

93
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,630
Su Min!

94
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,410
Su Min, I found out.

95
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,310
I found out. I did.

96
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,840
I'm sure even the Director doesn't know about this.

97
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,840
You know, Ha Ri and President Choi Sang Ho—

98
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,830
They planned this?

99
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,660
Well, did you know this, too?

100
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,400
I just told her everything.

101
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,860
I told you they would know. You make such a fuss.

102
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:48,530
Okay, okay. Let's get moving since we found out what's going on.

103
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,630
- To where?
 - We need to catch Jeffrey, of course.

104
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,080
We need to bring back Ha Ri, too.

105
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,820
You're right. They'll find a way to worm their way out again.

106
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,860
I can't let that happen again.

107
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,230
Let's finish this.

108
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,310
   

109
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,300
   

110
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,660
I really didn't do it.

111
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:50,970
If you blabber your mouth again, today will be your funeral.

112
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,330
You heard that, right?

113
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,830
I'm hungry. Gosh.

114
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,900
I'm starving to death.

115
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,020
I get it. Let's eat first, okay? I'm starving to death right now.

116
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,320
Investigator Kim!

117
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,780
Yes, yes, Prosecutor.

118
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,470
- Order this asshole some food. 
 - Food?

119
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,080
You know Jangteo Gukbap? Order from there.

120
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,810
Oh, and extra kimchi, too.

121
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,220
 Sunbaenim. 

122
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,120
There it is. Finally.

123
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,960
I'll go smoke a cigarette.

124
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,890
I'll be right back.

125
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,230
   

126
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,970
- Keep an eye on him.
 - Okay.

127
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,440
Oh, I finally feel alive. Thank you.

128
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,800
Hold on. Did I eat too fast?

129
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,180
I think I need to use the restroom.

130
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,000
   

131
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,200
I must've eaten too fast. Gosh.

132
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,850
- Keep it short.
 - I can't go in like this. Hurry up.

133
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,600
Are there no bidets here?

134
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,950
What do you mean, bidets?

135
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,080
Okay, okay.

136
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,160
   

137
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,330
Yes, Prosecutor.

138
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,070
Inspector Kim, where are you?

139
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,620
 Me? I'm in the restroom with Kang Ha Ri. 

140
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,440
You don't have time to prepare the case files I requested,

141
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,670
but you have time to accompany him to the restroom.

142
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,230
Case files?

143
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:48,250
 I see. I'm demanding case files you don't even remember. 

144
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,850
 I'm bullying you right now. 

145
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,920
 I put you in a very difficult position, didn't I? 

146
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,030
 I'd better retake the bar exam! 

147
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,660
I'm sorry. It's not that.

148
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,060
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

149
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,230
We took care of him.

150
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,430
If Kang Ha Ri ran away, find him and bring him to me immediately.

151
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,000
There's been a change in schedule.

152
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,060
Our flights are canceled.

153
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:47,230
I put a hold on all private flights leaving the country.

154
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,110
The last option they have is to escape by boat.

155
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,680
I'm grateful that we're surrounded by the ocean.

156
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,490
 How are things over there? 

157
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,660
I'm totally fine.

158
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,430
See you later.

159
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,490
 After admitting to creating a slush fund at a press conference yesterday afternoon 

160
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,970
 and announcing the resignation, President Choi Sang Ho was assassinated. 

161
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,080
 This is indeed a very shocking event 

162
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,210
 and it's affecting society greatly. 

163
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,950
 The Prosecutors' Office will investigate this case thoroughly. 

164
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,980
What's your plan, anyway?

165
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,580
I even helped you run away.

166
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:51,880
Shouldn't you explain why I have to listen to you and stay here?

167
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,020
Give me some time.

168
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,030
You guys can do this without me.

169
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,640
 Must we do this? 

170
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,850
 You know well. 

171
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:39,940
 You have to be crazy sometimes to deal with the crazy bastards. 

172
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,830
 Someone innocent... 

173
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,910
 died because of me. 

174
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,890
The Prosecution started investigating due to the news report.

176
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:09,470
I wanted to discuss the next plan until Jeffrey gets arrested,

177
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,430
but I didn't think they'd attack us in broad daylight like this.

178
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,140
There can't be...

179
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,510
any more sacrifices in this fight.

180
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,470
Prosecutor Kwak.

181
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,780
Yes, Mr. President.

182
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,550
Let's make sure to catch Jeffrey Jeong.

183
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,150
Of course.

184
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,610
I'll make sure to catch him.

185
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,890
And after that, I'll let you...

186
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,990
handle my case as well, Prosecutor Kwak.

187
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,120
I need to go to the restroom for a second.

188
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,250
   

189
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,760
Sort out all the files regarding Jeffrey and send them to me.

190
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,420
We'll see.

191
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,600
Haven't we seen each other enough already?

192
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,990
Are you laughing?

193
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,060
Don't laugh. I'm starting to like you.

194
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,660
Go.

195
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,860
Don't laugh.

196
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,530
Can we find him at this rate?

197
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,900
Take a rest in a room.

198
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:04,310
Mr. President, you must be tired. Why don't you get some rest briefly?

199
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,950
Thank you.

200
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,190
By the way, why isn't Su Min here yet?

201
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,370
She won't pick up the phone.

202
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,300
Where's that Jeffrey bastard?

203
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,830
He has to show up eventually.

204
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:28,340
I'll make sure to find that bastard.

205
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,550
   

206
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,840
 The phone is powered off. 

207
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,610
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep. 

208
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,740
Hello!

209
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,020
Is anyone there?

210
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,530
Is anyone there?

211
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,020
There's someone in here!

212
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,790
Hello!

213
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,780
Is anyone there?

214
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,660
 There's someone in here! 

215
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,320
Byeong Min,

216
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,980
did you find anything?

217
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,140
No, not yet. How about Su Min?

218
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,440
You can all go rest.

219
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,460
I'll look for her while drinking.

220
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,840
- Did you get to rest? 
 - Yes.

221
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,640
Don't worry too much.

222
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,180
We'll make sure to find Su Min.

223
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,550
I'll get some fresh air for a moment.

224
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,230
Okay.

225
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,510
- It's okay. 
- But for your safety...

226
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,910
 Nothing? 

227
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,890
   

228
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,790
Where's Mr. President?

229
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,220
We searched everywhere, but we couldn't find him.

230
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:03,150
Hey, Ha Ri! Ha Ri, look.

231
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,950
I don't know what they said over the phone,

232
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,320
but he called this number right after getting this text.

233
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,380
Kneel!

234
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,140
Su Min.

235
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,840
Ajeossi.

236
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,180
Are you okay?

237
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,920
Are you injured at all?

238
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,530
Why are you here?

239
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,750
Let her go now.

240
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,390
You were going after me, anyway.

241
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,410
Yes, got it.

242
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,120
No!

243
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,190
Ajeossi!

244
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,770
Ajeossi!

245
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,400
 Ajeossi! 

246
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,150
 Ajeossi! 

247
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,400
 - Ajeossi!  
- I finally like what I see.

248
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:37,210
Send this to our press, too.

249
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,100
   

250
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,470
   

251
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,820
Hey, be quiet.

252
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,490
What are you trying to do right now?

253
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,880
What do you mean?

254
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,810
I thought you started the game first.

255
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,580
 What do you think? 

256
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,020
 How long do you think he could last bleeding that much? 

257
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,660
Jeffrey,

258
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,960
I'll kill you.

259
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,580
 It's his job to stay alive. 

260
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,060
You have one hour.

261
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,570
 Search the spots I sent you and rescue him. 

262
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,710
 - I wish you luck.  
- Hold on, Jeffrey.

263
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,500
Jeffrey!

264
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,950
Ajeossi.

265
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:41,110
Su Min, where are you?

266
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,540
Ajeossi!

267
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,200
Ajeossi, wake up!

268
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,740
Ajeossi, you can't fall asleep. Ajeossi!

269
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,790
Ajeossi!

270
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,710
Ajeossi!

271
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,180
Right there.

272
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,560
Ajeossi!

273
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,660
Jeffrey.

274
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,360
Jeffrey!

275
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,060
I think he was here. I just missed him.

276
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,240
 I located Jeffrey. 

277
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,940
- Where is he?
  - He's at Yongjo Port. 

278
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,270
The ship he's taking is a cargo ship that's going to Port Klang, Malaysia.

279
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,480
You have about 40 minutest left.

280
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,750
 And I think I located Su Min, too. 

281
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,670
 It's Sangnam City, where Director Hwang is headed. 

282
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,130
Are you okay, Ajeossi?

283
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,660
I'm sorry...

284
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,670
Su Min...

285
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,060
I'm sorry...

286
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,120
about everything.

287
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,970
What are you sorry about?

288
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,780
I'm the one who didn't trust you.

289
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,650
I didn't get to apologize to you yet.

290
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:29,500
Please wake up! Please!

291
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,760
Ajeossi!

292
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,090
Ajeossi.

293
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,600
Ajeossi.

294
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,110
Ajeossi, please...

295
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,360
Yes, I'm here.

296
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,600
I think this is it.

297
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
Who the hell are you?

298
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,650
What's this?

299
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,890
Hold on.

300
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,730
I don't think this is the right place.

301
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,290
Freeze!

302
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:36,100
Everyone, head to Yongjo Port. We need to catch Jeffrey, no matter what.

303
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,860
I'll make sure to bring Su Min back. You're all okay, right?

304
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,330
Why would you even ask that?

305
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,660
Of course, you bastard.

306
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,500
Everyone, be careful.

307
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,340
See you later.

308
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,210
What brings you here?

309
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,530
I can take care of everyone here myself.

310
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,180
Really? I'll get going, then.

311
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,570
H-Hold on, hold on.

312
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:04,950
You might as well help me since you're already here.

313
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,000
Don't move!

314
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,370
Move. This is a BB gun.

315
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,960
Was it you?

316
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,770
Okay, okay.

317
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:50,470
Let's go. We need to save her.

318
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,700
Wake up, Ajeossi!

319
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,140
Is anyone there?

320
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,320
Sir! Sir!

321
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,850
- Ha Ri!
 - Are you okay?

322
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,550
There's no time. It's a bomb. A bomb.

323
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,080
What is with all of these bombs?

324
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,760
There's no time to disarm it. Let's go.

325
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,650
Let's go.

326
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,950
The door is locked!

327
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,760
Ajeossi.

328
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,780
I think we have a bit of a problem.

329
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,160
There's a bomb inside, but the door is locked.

330
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,110
- A bomb?
 - A bomb?

331
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,380
D-Director Hwang.

332
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,860
H-Ha Ri.

333
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,020
Oppa.

334
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,350
 Forget it, man! 

335
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:49,680
 Is Ah Ryeong coming back, just because you kill that bastard? 

336
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,080
 Let me in, too. 

337
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,080
 Just go and live like everyone else. As an ordinary person. 

338
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,470
 It's because I went through it. Not for the money. For revenge. 

339
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,620
 Let's just go to hell. 

340
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,330
Byeong Min, get it together.

341
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,860
Get it together, Im Byeong Min!

342
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,140
Jin Woong Oppa,

343
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,530
 don't worry. It'll be fine. 

344
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,510
See you at Yongjo Port.

345
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,920
Let's all

346
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,800
 meet there. 

347
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,610
Okay.

348
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,000
Let's...

349
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,210
catch that bastard.

350
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,560
- Why are there so many? 
 - Good question.

351
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,900
Maybe I should've written my will.

352
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,670
You haven't yet?

353
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,520
Let them join their friends.

354
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,740
Hold on! Hold on!

355
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,060
Hey, Mr. Fitness and Smile Face are here.

356
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,660
They beat you up smiling.

357
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,720
Step aside for a moment.

358
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,090
 Hold on. Hold on. 

359
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,650
   

360
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,720
 Su Min! Find water here. 

361
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,670
 Okay. 

362
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:56,010
 Hand me the water. 

363
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,010
 Hide somewhere. 

364
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,150
 - Let's go. 
 - Let's get up. 

365
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,650
 Hurry! Hurry! 

366
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,750
 Ajeossi, are you okay? 

367
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,040
 Don't worry. I'll take him to the hospital. 

368
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,100
 There's no time. Jeffrey will leave soon. I'll go. 

369
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,870
 I called them! To transport him. 

370
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,440
 Director Hwang. 

371
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,080
 But still, sir. 

372
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:03,380
 Go ahead and take it. You need to catch Jeffrey. 

373
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,470
Step back for a second.

374
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,800
Hey, Ha Ri!

375
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,490
- Where have you been, you bastard? 
- Hey, hey, hey.

376
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:16,240
- Gosh, seriously! 
- Are you all okay?

377
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,350
I said I would bring them back.

378
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,680
Su Min, are you okay?

379
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,940
- Of course, I am. Looks like you're in worse shape than me. 
 - I-I'm okay.

380
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,370
- Hey, where's the bastard? 
 - He went that way earlier.

381
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:32,310
Hey. Let's take care of this. You should leave now.

382
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,080
Hey!

383
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,730
You think you could handle this?

384
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,260
The reinforcement is here. Just leave.

385
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,270
Hurry up and leave!

386
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,840
Come on, baby.

387
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,030
My mighty Pikachu.

388
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,090
Hold on, hold on!

389
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,860
Damn.

390
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,230
Jeffrey!

391
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:05,770
Wow, look who's here.

392
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,720
The day finally came.

393
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,520
You worked very hard.

394
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,000
It's not like you can change the world like that.

395
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,540
That's why I'll work harder. You never know.

396
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,330
The world might change.

397
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:22,050
It's better to abandon unrealistic hope quickly

398
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,760
along with your cheap sense of justice.

399
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,650
Please leave quietly.

400
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,740
That's my last bit of kindness for you.

401
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,900
Give me a break.

402
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,360
 - You're so high maintenance. 
- It's so itchy. 

403
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,230
 Come on. Stay put. 

404
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,640
 Apply thoroughly, you bastard. 

405
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:08,760
 - You'd better not get beat up. 
 - Don't worry, and just apply thoroughly. 

406
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,930
 Take your pants off. 

407
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:14,240
 - Why would I take my pants off? 
- They can grab your legs. 

408
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,860
 Do you think? 

409
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:28,930
Hold on, hold on! Let me... Hold on.

410
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,450
- Prosecutor Kwak. 
- Geez.

411
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,180
Duck.

412
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,430
♫  It's too good to forget. Like a noir  ♫

413
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:55,050
♫  Get ready again. It's so tragic  ♫

414
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:58,610
♫  If you really want to see the end  ♫

415
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:02,140
♫  It's like a bullfight. Red light. Let's start  ♫

416
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,900
I paid in full now.

417
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,320
♫  You're at the end of the tense rope  ♫

418
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:14,470
♫  You shocked me, oh! I can't help but be surprised  ♫

419
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,540
♫  You're gonna crash 'till the pain  ♫

420
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:21,380
♫  I have no choice but to swallow my regrets  ♫

421
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,380
♫  We're gonna fall in the end  ♫

422
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:30,440
Hey...  the game is over. Let's go quietly.

423
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,580
Get up. Get up.

424
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:41,630
♫  Can you see coming over  ♫

425
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,550
♫  The white of your bloodied eyes  ♫

426
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,250
You bastard!

427
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:48,410
♫  I grabbed you inside of heart  ♫

428
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:53,020
♫  It's time, fade away  ♫

429
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,310
♫  You shocked me, oh!  ♫

430
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:58,790
♫  Messed up above the ashes  ♫

431
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:02,400
♫  Disappear, shocked me again  ♫

432
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:07,020
Get up, you bastard.

433
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:13,940
♫  I can't help but be surprised  ♫

434
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,270
Prosecutor, let me. I'll hold him. I'll hold him.

435
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:19,500
Byeong Min, give me my shirt. Give me my shirt.

436
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,530
- Hold on. Keep holding him! Hey! 
 - Hey, hey, hey!

437
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:26,360
Prosecutor, please finish up the rest here.

438
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,540
Please watch him.

439
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,720
Gosh, cleaning this up won't be easy.

440
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,080
Hey!

441
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:46,680
- What happened to you? Get up slowly.
 - Are you okay, Ha Ri?

442
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,150
- Did you get stabbed?
 - Look at that blood!

443
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:51,360
No, I won't die. I won't die.

444
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,170
Hey, Jae Yi.

445
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,790
- Ha Ri.
 - Hey.

446
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:58,260
Hey.

447
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:07,980
Jae Yi. Put the gun down.

448
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:15,820
 No! 

449
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,530
Shit, what was that? Run!

450
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:46,610
The reason why I'm not killing you is

451
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:51,490
so your pain won't end here.

452
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:55,520
I hope you get punished

453
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,710
for all the sins you committed.

454
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,580
Give me a fucking break.

455
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:06,190
You keep blabbering that mouth of yours—

456
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,350
You did the right thing.

457
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:38,770
He's definitely a bastard,

458
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,990
but I don't hate him.

459
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,150
Shall we go?

460
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,930
I'll take care of the rest.

461
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:50,870
I agreed to do it.

462
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:54,040
Gosh, what are you doing?

463
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,030
Let's wrap up quickly and leave!

464
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,670
Hey, hey.

465
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:05,800
Please be nice to him until he gets in the car.

466
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:13,770
 Jeffrey Jeong, the CEO of NQ Infracapital was arrested 

467
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:16,870
 as the suspect of the president's assassination at Yongjo Port. 

468
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:20,690
 On the NQ Infracapital's lobbyist list found by the Prosecutors' Office, 

469
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:26,560
 many Korean business and political figures are included, shocking many. 

470
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,250
   

471
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:40,370
   

472
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,350
   

473
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,680
   

474
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,920
Yes, Seonbaenim.

475
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,590
Yes, have you been well?

476
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,060
Gosh, congratulations.

477
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,960
I'll visit you sometime soon.

478
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,720
Yes, Seonbaenim.

479
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,210
So cute.

480
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:13,400
♪ The world is more beautiful than flowers ♪

481
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,770
- Hello. 
 - Prosecutor, it looks like you're in a good mood today.

482
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:18,380
Yes, I am.

483
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,090
You must've seen the article.

484
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:23,350
Yes, I did. And there's other good news.

485
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:28,630
- What is it? 
 - Prosecutor Jang finally started the business.

486
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:30,170
Really?

487
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:33,160
He went through a lot. I'm so happy to hear that.

488
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,950
I'm just noticing you're wearing a gray suit today.

489
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:38,800
Oh, this? I got it recently.

490
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,510
You said you don't like gray. What happened?

491
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:47,050
I'm kind of sick of black and white now.

492
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:50,020
It suits you well. Did you choose a cool tone for summer?

493
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:52,480
It's a warm tone for fall.

494
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,060
By the way,

495
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,980
how much longer will you keep it a secret, you two?

496
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,920
K-Keep what a secret?

497
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,520
I'm the prosecutor who caught Jeffrey.

498
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,320
I heard that you started a law firm.

499
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,680
Yes.

500
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:21,990
Let me know if you need a lawyer.

501
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,910
Okay.

502
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:34,690
But things will work out without my help.

503
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,070
I don't know how they found out,

504
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:44,020
but some people say, "President Choi did it on purpose to expose Jeffrey," apparently.

505
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,810
It's so fascinating.

506
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:48,910
No matter how much you try to hide it,

507
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:53,410
the truth always ends up getting revealed.

508
00:47:54,310 --> 00:48:00,660
It's because people eventually want the truth.

509
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,300
I'll go...

510
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,070
Dad.

511
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,960
Make sure to eat well.

512
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,380
By the way,

513
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:36,720
are your friends doing well?

514
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:46,560
Are you serious, Mr. Im?

515
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,170
I'm sorry.

516
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,630
Do you think art is a joke?

517
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:54,400
I'm sorry. I tried to do my best.

518
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,570
Gosh, darn it.

519
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,380
Why do you come here, exactly?

520
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,810
Artist? Artist?

521
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:02,620
Yes, a webtoon artist.

522
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:06,610
Everyone wants to be an artist these days. Geez.

523
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,730
- I'm sorry.
 - I'll give you an hour.

524
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:11,490
Go back, redo it, and send it to me.

525
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,400
If I still don't like it, you have to go home then.

526
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,790
- Okay?
 - Okay, okay. Got it.

527
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:18,880
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

528
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,990
I was surprised. I didn't think you'd actually come.

529
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:26,930
Wow, it's been so long.

530
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:29,620
I know. It's been so long. Right?

531
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,330
Yes, it was 26 years ago.

532
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:35,890
It was when I was 21 years old.

533
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:42,480
I'm 47 now. In the international age.

534
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,690
You haven't changed.

535
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:48,770
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes, I've been working hard.

536
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:51,470
How have you been, Ju Yeong?

537
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:53,290
I...

538
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,900
was married once.

539
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,540
I'm single now.

540
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:00,620
- Do you live alone now? 
 - Yes.

541
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:03,670
Well...

542
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:07,810
I-I'm sorry. I shouldn't be getting a call.

543
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:10,430
Hello? Artist Im.

544
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:12,100
 Do you still get yelled at these days? 

545
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,360
Artist, my foot. When will we start a mission?

546
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,340
That artist is weird.

547
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,500
Mission? Artist Im—

548
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,620
W-Well, I can't talk now.

549
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:26,410
Let's talk later. I'll hang up now.

550
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:33,930
Gosh, seriously.

551
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,400
"Mr. Im Byeong Min!"

552
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:43,850
These bastards.

553
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,640
You want to go at it, huh?

554
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,970
Come in. Come in!

555
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,840
Okay, okay, guys! Okay!

556
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:57,550
Hello.

557
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:06,440
I'll be starting today. I'm—

558
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,240
Ms. Kim Min Su?

559
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,140
Yes, that's right.

560
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:12,650
Min Su was a woman—

561
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,820
People say I have a boy's name.

562
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,440
You're pretty.

563
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,390
- Pardon?
 - No, no.

564
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:22,180
Pretty. I mean, the kids are so pretty.

565
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,630
Dad.

566
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:25,840
Shi An, I'm not your dad.

567
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,420
I don't have a girlfriend, and I'm not married.

568
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,120
I'm not married, and I don't have a girlfriend, either.

569
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,770
 Cha Hye Ryeong! 

570
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,170
Twenty minutes left until the rehearsal.

571
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,450
It's just a rehearsal. I thought I had enough time.

572
00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:00,630
The more successful you are, the more prepared you have to be.

573
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:03,370
Chat with your juniors, too.

574
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:08,530
And get me Shi Eon's autograph, too.

575
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,810
Lee Shi Eon? What's with you, Cha Hye Ryeong?

576
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:12,270
Do you like someone else?

577
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:14,360
Come on, I'm just kidding.

578
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,840
Oppa, we'll start now.

579
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,700
We have eight minutes left.

580
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,190
Cha Hye Ryeong.

581
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:21,540
Yes?

582
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,250
Think about it.

583
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:26,410
- You mean, getting Lee Shi Eon's autograph? 
 - No.

584
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:29,100
Think about what we'll eat today.

585
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:32,790
See you later.

586
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:52,060
I'm here.

587
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,910
Have you been well?

588
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:59,000
   

589
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:50,860
   

590
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:53,890
Knock, knock.

591
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,720
Has it been about three years?

592
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,550
Since we met in London.

593
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:05,740
We said, "See you again," and this is how we met.

594
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:10,690
How are things here? Do you find it okay?

595
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:14,200
You're still just as chatty.

596
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,240
Really? I'm really shy.

597
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:21,740
That's why I held back even though I had so much to say then.

598
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,050
You can tell me when I get out.

599
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:26,730
Get out?

600
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,370
Who is?

601
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:31,380
You?

602
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,180
You thought I came to save you.

603
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,200
My goodness.

604
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,990
I didn't.

605
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,900
What are you doing right now?

606
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:50,120
There isn't a lot of time. Let's hurry.

607
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:59,520
Can you act like you're in more pain?

608
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,720
You don't look like you're in much pain now.

609
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,450
Don't act tough.

610
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:23,020
Death is painful.

611
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:27,950
I came here to give you pain.

612
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:31,160
But you can't act like that now.

613
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,840
This isn't satisfying for me.

614
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,570
You're such a selfish person.

615
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,490
Until the last minute.

616
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,840
Gosh, I paid a lot of money for this.

617
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:23,910
 Channel Manager: 
animarina_677 

618
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:27,960

 unnieshimkoong (TE), Joysprite (GE), animarina_677 (CE) 

619

 Big thanks also to the great segmenting team:

620
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:36,100
 Big thanks also to the great segmenting team: 
 marisol_inf, lyam_88, squirrelpants_73, hana_860, kitty_100 

621
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:40,060
 And thank you so much for all the great Other Language Moderators. 

622
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,210
 We hope all viewers had as much fun with the show as we had! 

623
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:46,620
You have additional files, right?

624
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,810
- Yes.
 - Please get them for me.

625
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:54,180
Thank you.

626
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,530
Yes.

627
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,530
Prosecutor, Jeffrey Jeong...

628
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,010
Oh, my God.

629
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:11,100
He's so handsome.

630
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:14,200
Do you know... Maybe he's single?

631
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,910
No.

632
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,630
   

633
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,390
It's a delivery service.

634
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:42,130
- Mr. Im Byeong Min?
 - Yes, that's me.

635
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,900
You're Ms. Jeong Su Min, right?

636
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:49,920
- Yes.
 - Someone asked me to give you this.

637
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,390
Okay.

638
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:54,730
Jin Woong.

639
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:56,040
Oh, Min Su.

640
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,960
You got a package.

641
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,680
For me?

642
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:12,150
 This message will be deleted in five seconds. 

643
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:19,450
Gosh, seriously.

644
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:25,700
He looks old, but he acts even older.

645
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:32,710
That was cool.

646
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,410
Gosh, are you serious? This oppa is so...

647
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:42,040
I should feel embarrassed.

648
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,750
He saw too many movies.

649
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:51,320
Hot, hot.

650
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:10,930


651
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:14,860
I've been a webtoon artist.

652
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,810
- Webtoon artist?
 - I found a good mentor.

653
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:19,250
Hey!

654
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:21,120
- Ha Ri!
 - Oppa.

655
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,160
Long time no see.

656
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,790
Are you all rested?

657
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:35,220
We should get to work, then. Right?

658
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:45,060
♫  Let's get started now. Listen to my story  ♫

659
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:48,660

♫  I'm the player. I'm the Player. We are the player  ♫

667
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:22,120
♫  I'm the player. I'm the player. I'm the player  ♫

668

♫  Feel the rhythm. Make some noise  ♫

671
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,220
♫  You're already in my trap. Yeah, I'm going higher  ♫

♫  Little by little. Secretly  ♫

676
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,230
♫  I'm digging in  ♫

677
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:46,750
♫  So no one can catch me  ♫

678
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,620
♫  There's no point in fighting  ♫

679
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:51,660
♫  You're transparent. You're in my hand  ♫
