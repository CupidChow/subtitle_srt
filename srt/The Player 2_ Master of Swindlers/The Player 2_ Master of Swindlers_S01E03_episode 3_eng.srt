1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,400
   

2
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,810
   

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,730
   

4
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,710
   

5
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,870
   

6
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:45,000
   

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,000
 Ah Ryeong, when are you arriving? 
  

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,210
 You've got one minute left. 

9
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,600
 Byeong Min, are you still not done? 

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,550
 Success! 

11
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,290
 I did it, Jin Woong! 

12
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,770
 The goods have been acquired. 

13
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,100
 Get out of the car. 

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,370
 You're awake. 

15
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,350
 You don't know how much I've suffered because of you. 

16
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,410
 You bastard! 

17
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,420
 No! 

18
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,960
 I shouldn't have flipped out at Eonni. 

19
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,670
 - Let me in, too.
 - On what? 

20
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,300
 What you guys are preparing for right now. 

21
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,140
 No, never. 

22
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,040
 I won't say I look forward to working with you. 

23
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,530
 Let's each survive the best we can. 

24
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,750
 Driving skills must run in the family, too. 

25
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,490
 The NFT that I bought last time jumped this much in value. 

26
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,120
 After he gathers a bunch of investors regarding a new project he's starting, 

27
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,920
 he suddenly cancels the project for some ridiculous reason. 

28
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,970
 The total losses amount to about 230 billion won. 

29
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,950
 That's the money we will be stealing from Kang Do Yeong. 

30
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,100
 The method is actually quite simple. 

31
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,720
 Running a major NFT business like you. 

32
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,430
 Install malware in his digital wallet to let us hack it. 

33
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,440
 You fucking sons of bitches! 

34
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,050
 He scammed the money, 

35
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,500
 so we scammed it from him. 

36
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,230
 It's me. 

37
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,000
 Yes, CEO. I'll restore the money in no time. 

38
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,220
 Yes, the job is done. 

39
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,000
 Ha Ri, is it really okay to work with that woman? 

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,610
 Just one year. If you'll work with me for one year... 

41
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,250
 All of our criminal history and wanted records were erased. 

42
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,570
 I'll have your records erased permanently. 

43
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,000
 - Daebak!
 - Hey, this is delicious! 

44
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,590
 - What's the first job we're to take while we're here? 
 - You get out, too, Mi Wu. 

45
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,700
 According to our intel, all kinds of hallucinogens and 

46
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,280
 drugs are being distributed with Club Libido at the center of it all. 

47
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,020
 And Lee Jin Su, the club's operator and the director of KU Entertainment, is at the center. 

48
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,460
 - What's the plan? 
 - There. Swallow. 

49
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,530
 You're not personally getting this drug, are you? 

50
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,320
 I said I'll talk! I will! 

51
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,560
 We catch them first. So, the real body of this case can't escape. 
   

52
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,150
 Jin Su will have to go. 

53
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,200
 Is that prosecutor trustworthy, by the way? 

54
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,770
 I don't know if we can trust him or not. 

55
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,000
 But he gets his job done for sure. 
  

56
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,810
   

57
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,250
   

58
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:44,160
 Timing and Subtitles by the 
 ðŸ’¸ The Players Team ðŸ’¸ @Viki.com 

59
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,790
Kang Ha Ri?

60
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:02,180
 You see, I hate it so much when black and white are mixed together. 

61
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,290
Shit!

62
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,200
Man, you're so damn fast.

63
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,720
I wondered who the arrogant Santa was, and here you are.

64
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,930
Here's an adult who still believes in Santa.

65
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,140
It was fun, thanks to you, Kang Ha Ri.

66
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,350
Why did you come back to Korea?

67
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,040
Is coming to my motherland a problem?

68
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,680
For you, yes, Kang Ha Ri.

69
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,380
I don't think you're here to see me, though.

70
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,280
I know, huh? I had no idea this would happen,

71
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,910
but I feel like I skipped the middleman and got to meet the ultimate boss. I'm so elated.

72
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,370
Am I the middleman you're referring to?

73
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,070
Hello, Seonbaenim.

74
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,880
Long time, no see, Hoobaenim.

75
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,830
Don't you think it's a little harsh to call your fellow prosecutor a middleman?

76
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,510
Why are you still hanging around here?

77
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,350
I was about to leave, but I think there was a man who got lost.

78
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,070
Well, I think he found his way. All right, then.

79
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,230
It's okay. I called him in.

80
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,170
I'll vouch for him.

81
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,030
Seonbaenim!

82
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,450
Hoobaenim.

83
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,130
Talk to me today.

84
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,390
 What's going on with Kang Ha Ri? 

85
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,030
Why did he come to see you again? 
   

86
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,610
Prosecutor Kwak, the defendants up against you would have difficulty breathing.

87
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,120
You don't give me room to breathe.

88
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,970
Fortunately, no one has passed out from difficulty with breathing.

89
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,620
Should I congratulate you on that or something?

90
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,240
Let's say you did, but I'd like to hear your answer.

91
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,070
So... is it something that puts you in a bind?

92
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,720
Once you hear it, the one in a bind this time will be you, not me.

93
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,050
 He asked me to give it to you. 

94
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,690
 He said he'd be in touch. 

95
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,910
 Ha Ri would contact me? Why? 

96
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:33,100
 I wouldn't know that. I don't know why he picked you. 

97
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,460
 I only know one thing today. 

98
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:42,020
 That he wants to show you how it ends, Prosecutor Kwak. 

99
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,830
 The ending? 

100
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,660
 You'll become like me. 

101
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,130
 If you work with him. 

102
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,690
 I'm more cowardly than I look. 

103
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:59,780
 I have no intention of working with such a criminal. 

104
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,570
 Prosecutor Kwak Do Su, you know what? 

105
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,100
 People who are scarier than criminals are people 

106
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,460
 who committed crimes yet haven't been marked as criminals. 

107
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,280
 As long as those people exist, the law cannot keep anyone safe. 

108
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,670
 Prosecutor Kwak, make your choice as well. 

109
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,320
 It's up to you whether you answer his call or not. 

110
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,610
   

111
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,250
 I will treat you right one of these days. 

112
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,870
 Bye now, Prosecutor. 

113
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,080
Whether it's this guy or that guy, all they want is money.

114
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,680
- Team Leader Ju. 
 - Yes, CEO.

115
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,260
You'll have to do what Lee Jin Su used to do.

116
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,260
Are you talking about the club?

117
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,520
The club and...

118
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,680
You know what we do.

119
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,260
We'll receive new goods soon.

120
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,320
Be in charge and take care of that for me.

121
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,020
CEO,

122
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,450
I don't... want to do that job.

123
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,950
Why not?

124
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,910
You don't want to dirty your hands...

125
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,920
something like that?

126
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,600
I wasn't asking.

127
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,530
Just do it while I'm using words.

128
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,420
You can do it, right?

129
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,040
Yes.

130
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,940
Okay.

131
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,590
Take care of it.

132
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,620
Team Leader, hello.

133
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,110
My name is Gu Ji Yeon, a new member of the rookie development team.

134
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,120
 Okay, they're looking for someone with experience. 

135
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,310
 Hiring in rookie development team. 

136
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,510
 Sounds good. Any applicants? 

137
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,520
 I can't develop people, but I can develop programs really well. 

138
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,010
 You're not really going to develop rookies, you know? 

139
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:51,560
 Well, that's true, but I also need to watchâ€” 

140
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,660
 Byeong Min, no more video games starting tonight. Focus on our mission! 

141
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,350
 We have no choice, then. 

142
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,500
 Since it's the entertainment industry, I'm the obvious choice. 

143
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,570
 I used to get scouted quite a bit on Apgujeong Street. 

144
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,180
 Pardon? You, Mr. Hwang? 

145
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,480
 Yes, well, even though I had to leave in a week due to a scandal, 

146
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,320
 I'm a first-generation entertainer from XM. 

147
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,210
 But why would they... 

148
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:22,500
 I haven't figured that out myself yet. 

149
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,820
 How about you, Jin Woong? 

150
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,330
 Yes. 

151
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,130
 Of course, it should be me. 

152
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,440
 Love-love, boom-boom, love-love, one. 

153
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,070
 Why do you keep dancing? 

154
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,220
 You're not going there to be an idol trainee. 

155
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,530
 Aw, look, look. Yap! 

156
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,680
 I will go. 

157
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,290
 Jae Yi! 

158
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,480
 Please write up a resume for her, Byeong Min. 

159
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,540
 That I can do. 

160
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,340
Let's go get some lunch.

161
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,040
Aren't you eating?

162
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,830
I don't feel too good.

163
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,920
   

164
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,050
   

165
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,120
   

166
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,510
   

167
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,160
That'll be all. Coffee anyone?

168
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,610
 Hello, Assemblywoman Jang. 

169
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,400
Why don't we play a round of golf soon?

170
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,530
I'll treat you well.

171
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,210
Let's call it a day.

172
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,950
Well...

173
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,980
Team Leader.

174
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,960
- Hey, Hwi Woong. 
- Hello.

175
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,000
- Did everything go well?
 - Yes.

176
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,530
Who...

177
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,590
A new employee.

178
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,990
 Jae Yi. 

179
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,690
 Is your name Cha Jae Yi? 

180
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,860
 It says, Cha Jae Yi. Look, look... 

181
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:32,100
 Hye Ryeong, did you think we wouldn't know if you opened a new account with a new name? 

182
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,130
 Our Hye Ryeong, can't believe you thought of doing this. 

183
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,680
 Your life must be peachy these days. 

184
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
 Do the "V." Look over here. 

185
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,760
 Hey, Cha Hye Ryeong. Smile. They'd think we're bullying you. 

186
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,810
 It came out nice. 

187
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,270
 I'll upload this for you. 

188
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,990
 Give it a rest already. 

189
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,500
 Ban Hwi Woong, what's with you? 

190
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,000
 Out of nowhere, huh? 

191
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,390
 You're too noisy. I'm trying to sleep. 

192
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,560
   

193
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,710
Cha Jae Yi, you're meant to be a spy.

194
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:23,080
I guess CEO Kim is still securing cash by constantly selling company shares.

195
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,740
If you compare the internal documents with the public disclosures, they are not even properly disclosed.

196
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,650
He doesn't care about his shareholders. Whether they suffer damage or not.

197
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,390
I get so curious when I see things like this.

198
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:39,150
Does a fraudster become a CEO or do you become a fraudster once you're a CEO?

199
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,210
That means you're quite qualified to be a CEO, right?

200
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,790
Of course I am. That's why I'm the CEO here.

201
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,580
Hey, we were supposed to take turns.

202
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,960
- Isn't it me this year? 
- Is it?

203
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,980
- Why do you leave me out? 
- You were it last year.

204
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,510
Excuse me, decide your CEO on your own.

205
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,860
Let's think about CEO Kim first.

206
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,560
Think? We did that already.

207
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,810
Well, we should come up with a plan.

208
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,840
That's what I mean. It's all in here.

209
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,190
Gosh, stop kidding around.

210
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,100
I'm not kidding. Mr. Hwang, any issues with the cast?

211
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,220
Oh, that? CEO Kim sure has a huge network.

212
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,280
 I happen to know someone in his circle. 

213
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,420
Long time no see, Assemblywoman Jang.

214
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,160
Oh, my goodness. Mr. Hwang?

215
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,140
You'll have to help us out this time.

216
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,800
Is it about him?

217
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,760
Everything I do concerns him.

218
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,260
 - Byeong Min, the location for my meeting? 
- I've set it all up. 

219
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,290
 Okay. 

220
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,770
 It's perfect. Yes. 

221
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,170
You must be busy, and you made time for me.

222
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,070
Thank you so much, Assemblywoman.

223
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,270
Don't mention it. You're busier than I am.

224
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,730
My eldest loves your kids.

225
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,550
They're so popular.

226
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,020
So what? They only cause problems for me.

227
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,500
- Oh, Eddie Jung? 
 - Oh, Assemblywoman.

228
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,000
Oh, my goodness! I can't believe I ran into you here.

229
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,260
- How are you?
 - Good.

230
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,250
Oh. This is Eddie Jung.

231
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,810
And this is CEO Kim of KU Entertainment.

232
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,890
- Hello.
 - Hi.

233
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,300
Excuse me.

234
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,680
I'm Eddie Jung.

235
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,470
I'm Kim Yun Gi.

236
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,710
I was going to reach out to you anyway.

237
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,630
Thank you so much for last time.

238
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,910
Our chairman also asked me to thank you.

239
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,450
Don't mention it.

240
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,780
Okay, I'll get going now.

241
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,120
   

242
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,660
Nice shot.

243
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,840
Wow, Assemblywoman, your swing got better.

244
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,380
Really?

245
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,560
So, who was that gentleman from earlier?

246
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,890
Oh, Eddie Jung? A successful broker in Yeouido.

247
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:18,910
If he's a broker in Yeouido, does he work in funds and the stock market?

248
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,520
That's his real job.

249
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,550
   

250
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,050
 But his real self as a broker is something else. 

251
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,540
 His real self? 

252
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,070
 He's actually...
  

253
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,420
 into drug dealing, according to the rumor. 

254
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,520
 He's quite dangerous once you get to know him. Watch out. 

255
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,670
 Why would I get mixed up with him? 

256
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:55,180
 From what I hear, he's supposedly the most successful one in that market. 

257
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,130
 - Is that so? 
- Yeah. 

258
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,810
 You'll draw CEO Kim's attention by acting like a drug dealer? 

259
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,130
He can't deal drugs at the club anymore because of us.

260
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:11,110
In front of CEO Kim, who's got a lot on his mind, is shown a brand new platform.

261
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:15,030
 I'll approach him as Eddie Jung while he's looking for someone for drug distribution. 

262
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:20,840
 Make him believe that Eddie Jung could sell drugs for him. 

263
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,130
Eddie Jung...

264
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:27,720
Then, CEO Kim, who found the sales channel, will bring in the goods from the supplier.

265
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,060
Eddie Jung, who became their partner, hits the spot where the goods and money are?

266
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,030
Bingo!

267
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:39,810
 Of course, along with Prosecutor Kwak. Since we have to clean up the trash there. 

268
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,270
Kang Ha Ri...  
  

269
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,620
Kim Yun Gi...
    

270
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,310
But would CEO Kim follow along with our plan?

271
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,020
We'll have to make him follow.

272
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,020
But how?

273
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,150
We'll gas him this time.

274
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,880
Gas?

275
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,080
What the hell!

276
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,160
Come on! You really ripped one.

277
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,300
   

278
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,280
Ah, Seonbaenim!

279
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,500
- Eun Mi.
 - Eddie...

280
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,400
- Mr. Kim. 
 - I heard you pulled in a big one recently.

281
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,540
Seonbaenim, how did you pull it off this time?

282
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,300
Please tell us your secret.

283
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,130
Gosh, that's basic, you know.

284
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,510
I'll buy you dinner. Make time for me. Please?

285
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,710
I'll always be the one buying dinner.

286
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,100
- I can go, right?
 - Of course.

287
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,800
- Hey, I have a meeting right now. 
- Sure, sure.

288
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,270
I heard you asked for me. How can I help you?

289
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,540
I'll cut to the chase.

290
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,000
How about working with me?

291
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,260
What do you mean?

292
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,880
I know everything.

293
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,070
I heard you have an interesting side hustle.

294
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,530
I think you've misunderstood something.

295
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,630
As you can see, I'm an ordinary corporate man. I'm a salesman.

296
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,160
You know who I am, don't you?

297
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,780
Of course, I do. You're CEO Kim Yun Gi of KU Entertainment.

298
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,040
I've mentioned it several times on air, too.

299
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,600
The leader of the K-pop market. The future of Korean entertainment.

300
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,550
That's what I mean.

301
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:29,830
Let's paint that future together.

302
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,890
If I thought this business had no vision,

303
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,850
I wouldn't even be here right now.

304
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,740
Shall we talk outside for a moment?

305
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,570
Nice.

306
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:58,770
- Are you out of your mind? 
 - What...

307
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,620
Don't you know security is a priority in this business?

308
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,670
Are you trying to advertise what we do?

309
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,920
What the hell are you doing?

310
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,590
Wait.

311
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,290
You have no foundation for this business.

312
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:19,330
How can you just show up like this in this day and age? Geez!

313
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,230
Look. Get lost if you're out of touch.

314
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,540
Don't go around causing problems.

315
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,480
I'm not interested in working with someone who's a has-been.

316
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,930
No wonder they got to your club.

317
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,580
I'm sorry.

318
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,030
I was rash.

319
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,510
I'll be careful from now on. Okay?

320
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:56,220
I said from now on... I'll be careful.

321
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,560
Okay?

322
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,520
You're quick with your apology.

323
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,010
Fine, then.

324
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,690
Let me hear you out.

325
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,200
 Do you know the first thing I do when I set out to deceive someone? 

326
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,540
Figure out what his brain engages in first when he deals with people.

327
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,360
I look for that first.

328
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,550
 What do you mean... 

329
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,140
 The first thing that starts going in his brain is 

330
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,880
 his strongest weapon and the biggest flaw. 

331
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,410
For example, it's like this.

332
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,490
Someone like Kang Do Yeong from the last case.

333
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,240
He's suspicious of the person first and foremost.

334
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,620
Of course, that suspicious mind has helped him to survive to that point,

335
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,590
but in the end, you know, right?

336
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:54,170
How about CEO Kim, then?

337
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,900
As for CEO Kim,

338
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,240
he tries to dominate the other person using his psychological advantage.

339
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,600
He's especially meaner to those he thinks are weaker than him.

340
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,550
Oh, it's gaslighting. 
  (Gaslighting = a form of psychological abuse or manipulation) 

341
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:09,380
That's right. That's how Kim Yun Gi functions.

342
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,710
Of course, he'll get burned himself because of his ways.

343
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,120
Thank you.

344
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,990
It's not firm yet, so don't get too excited.

345
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:22,590
Today is a special day. Why don't I treat you?

346
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,040
What type of women are you into...

347
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,030
No, no. Let's not do that. Out of our kids, pick the aceâ€”

348
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,040
CEO. CEO Kim!

349
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,330
This is what makes you old.

350
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,230
Why do you pull something dirty like that?

351
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:40,010
What does that have to do with our business?

352
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,010
Geez, seriously.

353
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:46,120
You have to work clean. Got it?

354
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,120
I'm sorry.

355
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,670
I made another mistake.

356
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,740
I'll let this one slide.

357
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,970
Next time, let's meet at our office.

358
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:04,200
You should check out how I work, too.

359
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,950
I've already heard that you do your job well.

360
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,470
CEO, don't do that.

361
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,130
You just met me. How do you trust me?

362
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,800
Let's not be naive like this.

363
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,480
Let's be thorough. Okay?

364
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,530
Okay. Check.

365
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,130
Okay.

366
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,450
I'll text you my address.

367
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,830
 CEO Kim has moved on to the next phase. 

368
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,090
 Wrap things up over there. 

369
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:38,280
That's what I'm doing anyway.

370
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,190
Hey, you know... before you leave there,

371
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,490
can you get me Entrai's autograph?

372
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:49,130
 I became their fan recently, and you know Hwi Woong? 

373
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,580
 Doesn't he resemble me? 

374
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,430
Like a doppelganger?

375
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,550
 I thought I was looking at my younger self. 

376
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,410
Gu Ji Yeon.

377
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,310
Yes, Team Leader.

378
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,510
Aren't you going home?

379
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,020
I was about to go.

380
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,120
See you tomorrow.

381
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,890
By chance,

382
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,860
I'm going to pick up the trainees.

383
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,750
Do you want to go with me if you're free?

384
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,500
But why pick them up at this late hour?

385
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,250
They have to entertain tonight.

386
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:55,310
- Pardon?
 - You have an idea what our company does.

387
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,210
But still...

388
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,000
There are people watching, and rumors fly fast in this field.

389
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,300
I know. Will you say that to the CEO?

390
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,830
Well, why not?

391
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:20,480
But at this rate, all the artists here must know.

392
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,920
Are the guys in Entrai okay with all this?

393
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,990
They have no choice

394
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:31,770
since they were the first victims.

395
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:37,070
The reason CEO Kim has them entertain is... well, of course, for money.

396
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,630
It's to keep them on a tight leash.

397
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:45,590
When the kids are weakest, he sends them to these places to record them.

398
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,820
- There are video clips?
 - Yes.

399
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,840
Why would they renew their contract with him after seven years if not for that?

400
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,150
Team Leader.

401
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:02,900
Do you know where all those files are?

402
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:12,060
 I don't know about the copies, but I'm sure the originals are in the CEO's safe. 

403
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,400
How about the autograph?

404
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,940
I knew it.

405
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,060
I didn't even expect it. Did you quit?

406
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,640
Not yet.

407
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,970
Why not?

408
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:31,450
Does the job seem to suit you?

409
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,560
Are you switching jobs?

410
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,340
Deokhu.
  (Fan, otaku) 

411
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,750
Hey.

412
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:48,640
You know, you don't do this to others, so why do you call me that?

413
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,010
Help me out.

414
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:57,270
Say, "Please help me."

415
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,520
Please.

416
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,350
That's like saying, "Help me. Now."

417
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,380
You'll help me...

418
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,440
- right?
 - Again.

419
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,360
Please help me.

420
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,380
I'll think about it.

421
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,980
Hey.

422
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,790
Hey, Deokhu.

423
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,220
Hey, you!

424
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,020
 CEO, here's my address. 

425
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,390
 33 Gyujeon-ro 4-gil, Sangmi-gu, Seoun-si. 

426
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:45,280
 Go down the stairs to the third basement floor. 

427
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,920
Come in.

428
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,990
Please.

429
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,710
Let's go.

430
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:40,190
As you can see, 90% of our distribution work is automated.

431
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,570
As for all the processes needed for the deal,

432
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,930
the AI with sufficient deep learning is dealing with customers.

433
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,120
- AI? 
 - Yes. AI.

434
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,250
Artificial Intelligence.

435
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:58,470
And all the records throughout this process are completely encrypted and destroyed.

436
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:02,780
Thanks to that, our clients are highly satisfied.

437
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:06,840
Especially the VVIPs who want to stay unidentified,

438
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,160
you can say they all use our platform.

439
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,610
Go ahead.

440
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,470
You made it.

441
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,470
- I'll get going. 
- All right.

442
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,460
Wait, wait.

443
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,370
Spending money.

444
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,090
Thank you.

445
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,600
Have a seat.

446
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,310
All this is...

447
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,490
This week's sales.

448
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,120
- This week? 
- Yes.

449
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,430
It's a little slow this week.

450
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:58,040
Slow, huh?

451
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,570
I'll have to cut their commission this time.

452
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,300
I'm kidding. Just kidding.

453
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,300
The more I see you, the more naive you seem.

454
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,390
Be careful so you don't get scammed somewhere.

455
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:21,310
Work with only trustworthy people.

456
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,310
That's why I'm working with you, Mr. Jung.

457
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,730
There you go again. Trusting people so easily.

458
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:29,320
I told you not to, didn't I?

459
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,810
Come on now.

460
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:39,590
So, how much can you bring in this time?

461
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:48,010
That means we're working together, right?

462
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,430
Sure.

463
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:53,780
I also hope pure-hearted people like you succeed.

464
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,270
Yes?

465
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:58,170
 How much can Kim Yun Gi get? 

466
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,360
 Well... 

467
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:06,200
 all the cash he has plus the things he can dispose of... 

468
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,520
 - Seventy billion won? 
 - Seventy billion won? 

469
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,220
That much?

470
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:20,270
Why? Don't you want to make money?

471
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,970
Or...

472
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,660
you're not able to get that much?

473
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:31,350
No, no, no.

474
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,810
I should get it.

475
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,290
It's possible.

476
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,810
I'll prepare it.

477
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:42,050
Okay. Then, do that.

478
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:49,010
And I'd like to check out the goods myself.

479
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:57,480
There's a reason you're doing well.

480
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,730
CEO, the distribution doesn't end at just passing out the goods.

481
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,830
What quality of my goods are,

482
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,000
and if my customers will be satisfied...

483
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,610
I have to pay attention to everything.

484
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:11,150
Those are our business basics.

485
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:16,840
Come with me on the day I pick up the goods.

486
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,580
Sure, why not?

487
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,920
Let me know the date and location in advance.

488
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,510
We have our schedule, too.

489
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,550
Sure, will do.

490
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:27,960
Go on home, then. I won't walk you out.

491
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,300
Bye now.

492
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,060
Hey, he's really an idiot.

493
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:46,200
The ones who act tough are actually weak.

494
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,500
Gosh, I was so nervous. I was dying.

495
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,600
AI or whatever. What do I know?

496
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,630
I know, huh? Where is that punk Byeong Min, and why are you here, Mr. Hwang?

497
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,670
Oh, he's been out of it since yesterday.

498
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,500
He's been complaining, saying Jae Yi has him doing stuff.

499
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,610
Complaining while standing up, sitting down, pooping...

500
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,850
 I thought my ears were bleeding. 

501
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,320
You just have to be faithful to our mission.

502
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,810
Why cause more trouble, huh?

503
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:16,340
You're overdoing it.

504
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,280
You're wearing what I told you to wear, right?

505
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,050
Okay. Good.

506
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:29,670
First of all, I erased all the backup video clips on CEO Kim's cloud server yesterday.

507
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,700
You're saying we just have to get rid of the originals in the safe, right?

508
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,110
Yeah.

509
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:39,840
I saw a little bit of the video clips yesterday.

510
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,880
Why did you look at it?

511
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,920
No. I wasn't trying to look at it.

512
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,040
If I have to delete it... I mean, I did look at it, but...

513
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,900
they didn't do anything wrong.

514
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,210
All they did was get dragged there and work their asses off.

515
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:58,990
Even if that's true, people aren't interested in the truth.

516
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,750
- They only want to gossip.
 - Aigoo.

517
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,960
CEO Kim, who blackmails them with that

518
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,260
or people who are trying to rip them apart.

519
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,750
Here.

520
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,750
Come on, be nice.

521
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,980
If you get caught, do what I told you to do.

522
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,700
I'll never get caught.

523
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,680
"I'll never get caught."

524
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,350
Hey, wait!

525
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,420
"Hey"?

526
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,560
Are you sure you can open the safe?

527
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,400
Open what? I'm not going to open the safe.

528
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,570
What? You're not?

529
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,510
   

530
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:55,740
 Would I need to open it, though? 

531
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,760
 I'll just break it and have it go "Boom!" inside... 

532
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:04,650
 By chance, are you going to blow it up with a bomb or something? 

533
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:08,060
 A bomb... something like it, but... 

534
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,690
 - Are you crazy?
 - Come on. 

535
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,440
 Whyâ€” 

536
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,260
 I never said it was a bomb. 

537
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,270
 Something like it, I said. 

538
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:21,250
 Have you heard of tiny electromagnetic pulses or EMP waves? 

539
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,650
 Let me tell you what it is... 

540
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,650
 Ta-da. 

541
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:28,210
 - Is it dangerous?
- For the machine, yes. 

542
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,330
 It will destroy the insides of things. 

543
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:33,190
 You know flash memory drives like USB or SSD? 

544
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:36,500
 If they even spot this, they... 

545
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:41,530
 In layman's terms, it's like CBR military training for people. 
 (CBR - Chemical, Biological, Radiological)  

546
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,780
 - Forget it.
 - The CBRâ€” 

547
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:46,850
 Do what you have to do. Just don't attract attention. Okay? 

548
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,100
   

549
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,560
Long time no see.

550
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,960
Excuse me?

551
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,660
Oh, yes.

552
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,680
We've met in Jangam-dong.

553
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,780
Oh, I see.

554
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:16,200
You've gained a lot of weight, so I didn't recognize you.

555
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,680
What?

556
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,700
- I'll be going. 
- Yes, yes.

557
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,970
See you next time.

558
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,980
Be careful on the CEO office level.

559
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,220
 Stuff like that doesn't work there. 

560
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,610
I know.

561
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,870
 The door is open. 

562
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:10,280
Inside the dresser next to CEO Kim's desk.

563
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,960
Why isn't it working?

564
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,190
 Someone's coming. Hurry up. 

565
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,350
What the?

566
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,860
Why isn't it working?

567
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,770
My phone's not working.

568
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,200
- Hello? 
- Shit.

569
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,300
I tried to adjust the level.

570
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,440
Hey, Jae Yi. Cha Jae YI.

571
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,200
- It's dead, too. 
- Darn it!

572
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,890
What's this?

573
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,840
- Who the hell are you? 
 - Me?

574
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,600
Let's sit down and talk. Iâ”€

575
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,470
Hey!

576
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,250
Hey, stop! Hey!

577
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,220
Move, move, move!

578
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,030
In front of the CEO's officeâ€”

579
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,810
Damn it!

580
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,540
Get him!

581
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,360
Shit.

582
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,430
Come. Come here, come.

583
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,440
It's not like that.

584
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,330
- I'll explain everything. 
- Come here.

585
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,350
What happened wasâ€”

586
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,170
Geez, you crazy Entrai fan!

587
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:51,020
He even stole my ID card and came in. Geez!

588
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,530
We'll take care of him.

589
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:54,880
No! I'll take care of him.

590
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,880
Get up, you bastard!

591
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,800
Quiet!

592
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,070
Don't you dare come around here!

593
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,220
You won't get away with this!

594
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,900
That!

595
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,630
 Can you hear me? 

596
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,400
 Hello, Mr. Im Byeong Min. 

597
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:47,260
Hey. You.

598
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:50,920
Don't you talk to me.

599
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,270
You worked so hard.

600
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,110
See you later.

601
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:12,020
You're Cha Hye Ryeong, right?

602
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,860
Long time, no see.

603
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,720
 Hey. 

604
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,260
 Here. 

605
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,190
 - Earlierâ€” 
- I'm sorry. 

606
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:34,500
 I should've stopped them sooner. 

607
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,320
 No, no. 

608
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,530
 I wanted to thank you. 

609
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:40,280
 Why would you be thankful for that? 

610
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,150
 I ignored it all this time and barely said anything. 

611
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:50,100
 But... don't do that again. 

612
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,400
 You'll get hurt just because of me. 

613
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,740
 Nothing is "because of you." 

614
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:00,430
 It's not your fault. You didn't do anything wrong. 

615
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:05,780
 You were just crossing the street with a green light and got into an accident. 

616
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:11,230
 You just got unlucky, and it was the terrible driver's fault. 

617
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,620
 Oh, Hye Ryeong, but you know... 

618
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:22,720
 Getting into an accident is unfair, but you'll have to recover. 

619
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,190
 You're the only one who could save yourself. 

620
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:39,460
Mr. Song, how are you?

621
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:43,820
I'm considering making a big purchase this time.

622
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:47,610
Ten times the last batch is quite a load.

623
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,890
Asked to check them on site?

624
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:59,860
But oh, well. I don't see why not.

625
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,540
If we're going to work as a team,

626
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:05,570
maybe this is not a bad way to know each other.

627
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:10,740
Then... let's do this instead.

628
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,800
I'll be back.

629
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,270
- Where are you going? 
- To make new friends.

630
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:18,170
Friends?

631
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:22,040
CEO Kim left me a message. He told me the time and location.

632
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,670
   

633
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:17,970
Are you making a movie or something?

634
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:21,040
"Infernal Affairs" (a Hong Kong film) or something?

635
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,240
Movie? That would be nice.

636
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,400
You want to make one together?

637
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:33,320
I don't deal with guys like you.

638
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,830
Yet you accepted my gift so wholeheartedly.

639
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:39,410
What? Lee Jin Su?

640
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:40,990
Would I throw that away, then?

641
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:45,180
Even if it's a gift, I should separate my trash from the recycling.

642
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,300
That's exactly what I want from you.

643
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,830
Whether it's this or that, you.

644
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:53,010
Don't try to play me for a fool.

645
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,680
Take it.

646
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,790
Why can't you accept my kindness in good faith?

647
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:04,990
If you wanted to become a kind person,

648
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:07,440
you shouldn't have committed a crime.

649
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,530
Here.

650
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:14,120
Fine, then. I can't help it.

651
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,010
I set it all up so you can get them at the scene.

652
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:18,940
But if you don't want it, oh well. Give it.

653
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,970
What did you just say?

654
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:24,170
Get them at the scene? At a drug deal?

655
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:28,550
- What else would I be talking about? 
 - Tell me the details.

656
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:31,420
Forget it. If you don't want it, I've got people lined up. Give it.

657
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:34,270
CEO Kim Yun Gi above Lee Jin Su is the real power, right?

658
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:37,830
Hurry up and give it. You turned it down. Why all the curiosity now?

659
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:40,770
Is Kim Yun Gi making the deal himself?

660
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,160
Are you curious?

661
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,130
Yes.

662
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,330
He's doing it himself.

663
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:01,630
Along with the guy supplying that drug in Korea.

664
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:05,510
Money, drugs, and that trash.

665
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:09,220
You can get all of them at once.

666
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:29,210
Investigator, request assistance from the police.

667
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,160
â™«  White shirts, denim pants  â™«

668
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,380
â™«  Money up in the Cadillac  â™«

669
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:49,030
â™«  I'm excited. Shaking it to the rhythm  â™«

670
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:53,100
â™«  Edgy up in the Cadillac  â™«

671
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:58,050
Hey, we've seen our best and worst.

672
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:00,700
And those worst moments...

673
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,960
I have them all.

674
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,650
 For now, I got rid of all the files that were in CEO Kim's safe. 

675
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:09,220
 But who knows? 

676
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:14,060
 CEO Kim might have a backup copy somewhere. 

677
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,610
 In any case, this is all I can do for you. 

678
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:23,190
 Starting now, it's your battle to fight. 

679
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:26,350
 You know how it is. 

680
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:31,770
 You're the only one who could save yourself. 

681
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:35,360
Yes.

682
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,900
I'll take him as soon as this job is finished.

683
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,640
It's nice to see the ocean for the first time in a while, huh?

684
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,280
Yeah, it's nice. But...

685
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,240
 your voice is ruining it for me. 

686
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,150
It'll get nicer the more you listen to it.

687
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:20,360
I'll do some ASMR when we get closer. 
  (ASMR = Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response; describes a sensation in response to specific triggering audio) 

688
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:24,000
Make your eardrum bestie inside prison later on.

689
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:28,910
Hey, are you sure this is the spot?

690
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:31,230
I don't see it happening here at all.

691
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,880
 Your'e so impatient. 

692
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,280
I'll wrap it up nicely from here.

693
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,740
If you're bored, I'll introduce you to another friend.

694
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,860
Hello.

695
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,220
Oh, Im Byeong Min?

696
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,400
- Do you know me?
 - I know all of Ha Ri's friends.

697
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,990
You just wait, too.

698
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:01,700
 You'll join Ha Ri in prison. 

699
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,920
But I don't want to go.

700
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,180
Come on, no way. You have to go with him.

701
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,980
You're so sociable. You guys are friends already.

702
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:16,970
Our team's earphones will be off from here.

703
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,650
You made it.

704
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:36,600
Welcome.

705
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:40,640
But these people are?

706
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:45,870
I wanted to come alone, but not the other party.

707
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:48,760
The one with the goods?

708
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,220
It's Mr. Song.

709
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:54,120
He's extremely particular.

710
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,680
I see.

711
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,720
Well, it's good to make things clear.

712
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,080
He seems reliable. Let's go.

713
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:04,430
- I'll look you over. 
 - Come on now.

714
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:14,330
They say it's procedure.

715
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:27,100
Okay.

716
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,380
We'll confiscate your cell phone.

717
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,370
It's good to make it clear.

718
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:40,680
Okay.

719
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,420
Pardon me.

720
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:52,490
We'll escort you to the location safely.

721
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:35,250
CEO Kim, we're going to the right place, right?

722
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:38,750
I think we're going in the opposite direction of the harbor you mentioned.

723
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,470
Oh, this?

724
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,220
 Let's do this instead. 

725
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,840
 Lead Mr. Jung to another place. 

726
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:50,780
 I can go with the deal only when it's secure from my end. 

727
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:54,140
This is how Mr. Song is.

728
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,330
Please be understanding, Mr. Jung.

729
00:53:56,330 --> 00:54:00,510
But still, there's no problem with the deal. Right?

730
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:06,520
Yes, let's say that's the case.

731
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:13,660
As expected.

732
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,720
Please call him.

733
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:24,060
Prosecutor, it's Byeong Min.

734
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,030
These guys. Talk about pulling all the stops.

735
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:34,810
It's been changed.

736
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:40,270
Geez, I don't even get paid for mileage.

737
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:44,180
Prosecutor, I just noticed it. You're wearing gray today.

738
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:47,050
- What do you mean? 
 - You said you don't wear anything gray.

739
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,450
But your shoes today...

740
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,280
I guess I had gray shoes.

741
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,130
In any case, let's follow them.

742
00:54:58,130 --> 00:54:59,660
Yes, sir.

743
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,720
Yes, got it.

744
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,220
Stop the car.

745
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:22,580
What?

746
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:25,210
Why are you stopping the car here?

747
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,520
CEO Kim.

748
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:37,030
Take your time.

749
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:25,660
It looks like they've abandoned the vehicle.

750
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,600
What do we do then?

751
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:36,990
Let's have faith... in our best driver.

752
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,570
Let's go.

753
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:41,810
You made it safely. You went through a lot.

754
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:45,370
Aigoo, you're so thorough.

755
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:49,370
So, where's Mr. Song?

756
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:13,780
 You're awake.

 So, prove it to me.

 Sure, fine. 

766
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:19,550
 Is that guy the one? The one who killed your colleague? 

767
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:21,070
 Are you crazy for money or something? 

768
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:24,280
 Yes, I'm the one who gave the order to go and overturn the rigged deal.

 I must know who their head is.
